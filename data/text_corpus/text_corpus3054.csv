15270,a good floc formation of activated sludge as is crucial for solid liquid separation and production of clean effluent during wastewater treatment floc formation is partly controlled by self produced extracellular polymeric substances eps such as exopolysaccharides proteins and nucleic acids little is known about the composition structure and function of eps in as and which bacteria produce them to address this knowledge gap for the exopolysaccharides we took advantage of 1083 high quality metagenome assembled genomes mags obtained from 23 danish wastewater treatment plants we

the biosynthesis of alginate cellulose curdlan diutan hyaluronic acids pel poly β 1 6 n acetyl d glucosamine pnag psl s88 capsular polysaccharide salecan succinoglycan and xanthan were identified and

wastewater treatment is vital to secure human health prevent environmental pollution and recover important resources activated sludge as the most widely used technology for biological wastewater treatment relies on the catabolic activity of suspended microbial aggregates as flocs seviour and nielsen 2010 good separation between the solid liquid phase is essential to recover clean effluent from the sludge the flocculation of the microorganisms determines this process and poor floc formation can lead to process failures including deterioration of effluent quality and decreased dewaterability of the sludge karr and keinath 1978 wilén et al 2000 extracellular polymeric substances eps constitute a major component of the as flocs and are essential for linking the cells together in a large three dimensional matrix frølund et al 1996 the eps matrix protects against predation and environmental stressors helps the bacteria sequester nutrients and allows microbial cells to live in close association thereby facilitating cell to cell contact and horizontal gene transfer flemming et al 2016 2022 the eps represent a mixture of substances originating from active secretion cell surface material shedding cell lysis and sorption from the environment and include exopolysaccharides proteins lipids and nucleic acids liu and fang 2003 however the exact composition of the matrix is highly variable and dynamic exopolysaccharides have proved important for shape and structural support of the matrix as well as adhesion and aggregation of cells seviour et al 2019 additionally the exopolysaccharides are important for the retention of water and extracellular enzymes flemming and wingender 2010 siddharth et al 2021 besides their biological roles eps have also gained increased attention as they can be extracted and formulated into renewable bioresources such as flocculants for improved wastewater treatment eco friendly flame retardant materials and binders for composite materials ajao et al 2018 feng et al 2021 karakas et al 2020 kim et al 2020 nouha et al 2018 despite their apparent importance wastewater treatment related exopolysaccharides are poorly described because such investigations traditionally require pure or at least highly enriched cultures and subsequent extraction and characterization of the individual eps flemming et al 2022 seviour et al 2019 among described exopolysaccharides are polymers from a zoogloea resiniphila strain an et al 2016 gao et al 2018 duganella zoogloeoides atcc 25 925 ikeda et al 1982 and thauera allen et al 2004 in addition to these pure culture derived exopolysaccharides there are granulan seviour et al 2010 and alginate like exopolymers ale lin et al 2013 which were both extracted from aerobic granular sludge granulan and ale both contain anionic polysaccharides and depend on divalent cations for gel formation lin et al 2010 seviour et al 2012 however as these exopolymers were extracted from complex microbial communities they represent a mixture of different eps molecules from several taxa accordingly we have little knowledge about the exact composition which bacteria have produced them and the associated biosynthetic machinery most knowledge regarding biofilm associated exopolysaccharides originates from the clinical fields with pure cultures from genera such as pseudomonas escherichia and staphylococcus atkin et al 2014 gill et al 2005 ma et al 2006 monteiro et al 2009 some common characteristics are often shared across exopolysaccharides including the genomic clustering of genes involved in their biogenesis schmid et al 2015 there are three well described pathways for exopolysaccharide synthesis in bacteria which each share some conserved key enzymes these are the synthase dependent pathway the wzx wzy dependent pathway and the abc transporter dependent pathway schmid et al 2015 the conserved nature of the exopolysaccharide synthesis pathways suggests that it is possible to reveal the genetic potential for exopolysaccharides of individual species in complex microbial communities through genome mining of the relevant microbes however this has previously been hampered in complex systems by the quality of metagenome assembled genomes mags obtained by short read sequencing which are often highly fragmented and lack genes that occur in multiple copies or includes repetitive sequences koren and phillippy 2015 accordingly these mags are unsuited for gene synteny analyses and may lack important genes such as those encoding the periplasmic tetratricopeptide repeat tpr containing scaffold proteins involved in the synthase dependent polysaccharide biogenesis whitney and howell 2013 recently we recovered 1083 high quality hq mags from 23 danish wwtps based on hybrid assembly of nanopore long reads and illumina short reads singleton et al 2021 these mags represent 578 bacterial species and 65 of the top 100 most abundant species in danish wwtps nierychlo et al 2020 singleton et al 2021 most mags affiliate with the bacteroidota proteobacteria and chloroflexota phylum but mags from 29 additional phyla were also recovered these mags have high contiguity and are 90 complete meeting the mimag standards for hq mags bowers et al 2017 which enables the identification and comprehensive characterization of conserved operons and gene clusters even when these are long and contain repetitive sequences goldstein et al 2019 the hq mags therefore represent a valuable foundation for linking microbial identity taxonomy with their genetic potential for exopolysaccharide production furthermore most of these mags represent common genera across global wastewater treatment systems dueholm et al 2022 here we carried out a literature survey to identify experimentally validated exopolysaccharide biosynthetic pathways encoded in operons or gene clusters within well characterized bacterial isolates we identified 16 exopolysaccharide biosynthetic gene clusters bgcs and used these to compile a database of the corresponding proteins this database was then used to identify homologous systems in the as hq mags hereby linking the potential for exopolysaccharide production to individual bacterial species based on homolog identification and gene proximity analysis we identified putative gene clusters related to 10 of the examined exopolysaccharide biosynthetic pathways to our knowledge this is the first comprehensive description of the genome resolved potential for these exopolysaccharides in as bacteria generally the biosynthetic pathways were restricted to one or two phyla alginate bgcs were restricted to a few low abundant mags in a single family questioning the proposed importance of alginate zhang et al 2021 in wastewater treatment systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 source data translated gene sequences from experimentally validated polysaccharide biosynthesis pathways table 1 were acquired from the national center for biotechnology information ncbi database the hq mags from as and their taxonomy were obtained from the study by singleton et al 2021 translated coding sequences cdss were identified and annotated using prokka v 1 14 seemann 2014 with the following options meta kingdom bacteria or archaea depending on the taxonomy of the mag 2 2 identification of protein homologs the position specific iterative basic local alignment search tool psi blast blast v 2 11 0 altschul et al 1997 was used to identify protein homologs in the prokka generated hq mag protein database singleton et al 2021 psi blast parameters were initially optimized using proteins encoded by the pnag operon as query and empirically optimal parameters were found to be num iterations 20 max hsp 10 evalue 0 001 qcov hsp perc 20 and max target seq 100 000 output format out fmt 6 was used these parameters were then used for all searches 2 3 prediction and visualization of exopolysaccharide biosynthetic gene clusters proteins related to exopolysaccharide biosynthesis gene clusters were evaluated based on the number of homologs found for each exopolysaccharide system and whether their genes were located together in the genomes fig 1 to achieve this results from psi blast searches for individual polysaccharide queries were analyzed in r based on the following steps i for each query homologs identified by psi blast were evaluated based on percent identity thresholds empirically optimized to enhance search specificity while limiting the number of hits outside the identified biosynthetic gene clusters homologs with 20 identity were removed for all exopolysaccharide systems except for the hyaluronic acid system from pasteurella multocida which only contains a single query protein for this system a cutoff at 33 identity was applied to reduce the rate of false positive hits ii to avoid homologs associated with unrelated pathways a proximity criterion for genes in putative gene clusters was introduced identified homologs whose genes were separated by more than eight annotated genes or 2000 bp from other homologs from the same exopolysaccharide gene cluster were removed the proximity criteria were set arbitrarily based on an empirical evaluation iii putative gene clusters were filtered based on the number of homologs identified and the presence of essential key enzymes see table 1 iv for the proteins related to the putative gene clusters amino acid sequences were mapped to the pfam database mistry et al 2021 using interproscan search jones et al 2014 to identify conserved protein domains v the phylogenetic distribution of each exopolysaccharide system was visualized using the phylogenetic tree created by singleton et al 2021 the synteny of gene clusters was examined using gene arrow maps the following r packages were used seqinr v 4 2 16 gouy et al 1984 tidyverse v 1 3 1 wickham et al 2019 gggenes v 0 4 1 wilkins 2020 ggtree v 3 2 1 yu et al 2017 and ggtreeextra v 1 6 0 xu et al 2021 final figures were assembled and visually enhanced in adobe illustrator 2022 2 4 data and code availability r scripts used for data analyses and figures are available at github https github com msdueholm publications tree master dueholm2022b raw data for the scripts is available at figshare https doi org 10 6084 m9 figshare 21287112 v1 a list of all identified eps gene clusters is provided as supplementary data s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 exopolysaccharide biosynthesis systems in as bacteria to identify potential exopolysaccharide biosynthesis systems in the hq mags we first searched for gene clusters associated with the biosynthesis of known exopolysaccharides this resulted in a list of 16 validated exopolysaccharide systems each consisting of a set of query sequences table 1 an initial homology search using the translated protein sequences from these query genes was conducted against the translated coding sequences cds from the hq mags using psi blast however after removing hits with low percent identity 20 homolog proteins related to all exopolysaccharide systems were still identified in almost all mags suggesting that many of the query genes had homologs associated with unrelated metabolic pathways fig 2 a this was also apparent from the observation that some query sequences from different exopolysaccharide systems targeted the same cdss in the hq mags fig s1 to increase the specificity of our search we introduced a proximity criterion utilizing the fact that functionally related genes including those encoding exopolysaccharides are generally organized in operons or bgcs in bacteria schmid et al 2015 fig 2b this filtration proved to be highly effective in identifying complete or near complete exopolysaccharide bgcs while removing hits which are likely associated with unrelated metabolic pathways to only include the most plausible hits we considered a pathway to be present if all essential genes e g the main synthase unit were present while complying with the proximity criterion and the threshold for the number of genes for the given polysaccharide biosynthesis pathway generally homologs of some genes related to a specific polysaccharide were found in many mags in contrast other genes were more specific and were mainly seen with a high percent identity in mags with a complete biosynthesis pathway fig 2a and fig s2 s8 thus some genes are good predictors for a putative biosynthetic gene cluster we identified homologs for 10 out of the 16 examined exopolysaccharide biosynthetic pathways supplementary data s1 3 2 alginate bgcs are uncommon in as bacteria alginate is an anionic linear polysaccharide composed of mannuronic acid and guluronic acid residues remminghorst and rehm 2006 putative gene clusters for alginate synthesis were only identified in five mags these belong to the two midas placeholder genera midas g 2943 3 mags and midas g 4210 2 mags both in the micavibrionales order of the proteobacteria phylum fig s2 interestingly several members of this order including micavibrio are epiphytic obligate bacterial parasites that among others prey on pseudomonas aeruginosa from which the query operon originates wang et al 2011 accordingly the alginate bgc may have been acquired by horizontal gene transfer because of this lifestyle the alginate related genes were organized as gene clusters consisting of both operons and individually transcribed genes fig 3 this contrasts with the single operon organization of the query genes in p aeruginosa the organization of the alginate gene clusters was genus specific the midas g 4210 gene clusters lacked the algg gene proposed to be an epimerase schmid et al 2015 whereas those for midas g 2943 had homologs for all query genes the latter also encoded additional genes including three copies of the putative acetylation gene algx because the genetic potential for alginate was restricted to a few low abundant bacteria it is unlikely that alginate is an important polymer in wwtps furthermore it suggests that the main polysaccharide component in ale is evolutionarily unrelated to alginate although sharing physicochemical properties 3 3 pel operons are found in several orders within the proteobacteria pel is a known constituent in biofilms produced by p aeruginosa friedman and kolter 2003 and is composed of dimeric repeats of α 1 4 linked galactosamine and n acetylgalactosamine le mauff et al 2022 the genetic capacity to synthesize pel is encoded in the seven gene pel operon pela g widespread among gram negative and gram positive bacteria whitfield and howell 2021 we identified 25 mags with the genetic capacity to produce pel fig s3 these mags were all except for one myxococcota mag from the proteobacteria phylum and represented the following orders the burkholderiales 18 mags pseudomonadales 5 mags oceanospirillales 1 mag and myxococcales 1 mag the pel genes were for all mags organized as a single operon and gene synteny matched that of the query operon from p aeruginosa except for the myxococcales mag fig 4 in the latter the pela and pelb genes were located downstream from pelg as the last genes in the operon compared to at the beginning in operons from the burkholderiales and pseudomonadales order the presence of the pel biosynthetic machinery in 25 mags representing 12 species including a general core lautropia midas s 135 and three conditional rare or abundant taxa crat species across the world propionivibrio aalborgensis propionivibrio midas s 421 and hahella midas s 10 928 table s1 suggests that pel could be important in global wastewater treatment systems 3 4 cellulose bgcs display diverse structures cellulose is a polymer of β 1 4 linked d glucose and a common constituent of wastewater originating from e g toilet paper ruiken et al 2013 however many bacteria can also produce cellulose as a component of their extracellular matrix römling and galperin 2015 the presence of cellulose in the inlet wastewater makes it challenging to differentiate microbial produced cellulose necessitating genomic or protein investigations to resolve its origin previous studies have shown that the as isolate shinella zoogloeoides atcc 19 623 formerly known as zoogloea ramigera i 16 m produces and uses cellulose for floc formation gao et al 2022 otherwise little is known about microbial produced cellulose in wastewater treatment systems komagataeibacter medellinensis formerly known as gluconacetobacter xylinus and acetobacter xylinum is a model organism for bacterial cellulose and it can produce two different forms matsutani et al 2015 cellulose i is a ribbon like polymer composed of bundles of microfibrils whereas cellulose ii is an amorphous polymer with increased thermostability compared to cellulose i yu and atalla 1996 the two forms of cellulose are encoded by separate bgcs matsutani et al 2015 we used both as queries to identify mags with the genetic potential for cellulose production 43 mags were identified when a minimum threshold of two observed homologs including the main synthase gene bcsai or bcsabii were used for identification fig s4 and s5 out of these 30 mags encoded only cellulose i three mags only cellulose ii and ten mags both cellulose i and ii these mags included four loose core and two crat species including acidovorax midas s 1484 dechloromonas midas s 173 recently classified as d phosphoritropha petriglieri et al 2021 and nitrotoga midas s 181 which all encode both cellulose types table s1 because the genomic potential for cellulose i expression was more common in the examined mags we analyzed this system in greater detail fig 5 interestingly critical pfam domains present in the query genes were only detected in the homologs of 14 mags which could indicate that some detected operons were non functional the operons from the 14 mags could be separated into three groups depending on gene organization and flanking genes agrobacterium tumefaciens like 1 mag k medellinensis like 5 mags and escherichia coli like 8 mags fig 5 the e coli like hits contained a bcsq and a bcsg gene and had similar operon structures bcsg has been identified as a phosphoethanolamine transferase involved in producing modified cellulose with these groups added römling and galperin 2015 the k medellinensis like operon structures contained a bcsd gene in two mags bscd is often coupled to the crystalline cellulose structure found in k medellinensis römling and galperin 2015 the a tumefaciens like operon uniquely encoded the bcsn gene which was previously shown to be specific for alphaproteobacteria römling and galperin 2015 cellulose is known to be regulated by c di gmp via its binding to conserved motifs in the pilz domain in bcsa mcnamara et al 2015 the a tumefaciens like operon is distinguished by the absence of a functional important amino acid in the pilz domain which has previously been coupled to c di gmp independent regulation matthysse et al 1995b 1995a suggesting different regulatory strategies the diverse organization of the identified cellulose operons implies differentiation of their regulation monomer composition and the structural organization of cellulose fibrils due to their uncharacterized nature it is currently a challenge to couple the physicochemical characteristics of microbial cellulose to the different cellulose synthase complexes mcnamara et al 2015 however the genomic potential for cellulose production in several mags including core taxa supports the role of microbial cellulose as an important eps in as floc formation 3 5 the pga operon is favored for pnag biosynthesis in as poly n acetylglucosamine pnag is an eps polysaccharide associated with microbial biofilms it is a homopolysaccharide consisting of β 1 6 linked n acetylglucosamine and is synthesized in a range of bacterial species including both gram negative pgaabcd operon in e coli and gram positive species icaadbc operon in staphylococcus species and epshijk operon in b subtilis atkin et al 2014 bundalovic torma et al 2020 roux et al 2015 the gram negative pnag pga query identified putative operons in 12 mags fig s6 no homologs to pgad were found by psi blast but in all operons a pgad like protein domain was identified based on interproscan organization and domain annotation were similar across all identified operons however all hits from the betaproteobacteriales order lacked an annotated gh13 domain within the pgab gene dividing the hits into two operon types one with an assigned gh13 and one without fig 6 the gh13 domain in pgab has previously been proposed to play a role in binding and translocating pnag through the periplasmic space little et al 2014 however it may also act as an extracellular hydrolase that can disperse pnag dependent biofilms little et al 2018 all hits were identified in the proteobacteria phylum within the gammaproteobacteria 11 mags and desulfobacterota 1 mag classes similarly bundalovic torma et al 2020 showed that pnag is widely represented in the proteobacteria phylum but is also found in other phyla among the identified mags were the two loose core species ca accumulibacter phosphatis and sulfuritalea hydrogenivorans and the crat species ca accumulibacter midas s 315 which was recently reclassified as ca propionivibrio dominans table s1 petriglieri et al 2022 the gram positive pnag eps genes are often observed in larger gene clusters epsa o but only epshijk are required for biosynthesis when filtered to three required genes only eight hits remained these belonged to the bacteroidetes 7 mags and acidobacterium 1 mag phyla fig s7 the bacteroidetes mags included a single crat species representing a midas placeholder order midas o 31 within the class sja 28 table s1 the modification gene epsi was not identified in any of the mags and in most the annotated epsk genes were only partially aligned to the query which questions the functionality of these operons we also searched for homologous synthesis systems for the staphylococcus like pnag ica homologous synthesis systems but no operons were identified 3 6 bgcs for several known wzx wzy dependent polysaccharides were not identified generally our approach did not identify any complete biosynthetic pathway 75 of query genes for xanthan salecan psl diutan s88 and succinoglycan fig 2 these all represent the wzx wzy dependent pathway and include at least 12 genes the large number of genes provides increased room for diversification and gene shuffling which may have prevented us from detecting such operons in support of this we found that the genetic loci associated with the only three wzx wzy dependent pathways detected in the mags were rearranged entirely fig 7 previous studies carried out on lactobacillus have furthermore demonstrated that diversification of wzx wzy dependent eps gene cluster can occur at the strain level deo et al 2019 martino et al 2016 if this is also the case for strains in as we might expect that such gene clusters may not be correctly assembled in some of the hq mags as these may represent species level co assemblies of several strains meziti et al 2021 this questions whether the larger wzx wzy dependent gene clusters are not detected due to strain diversity or are simply not present in the as bacteria 3 7 limited potential for hyaluronic acid and curdlan biosynthesis ha like polymers are produced by ha synthases and have previously been reported in aerobic granular sludge where they are assumed to form hydrogels felz et al 2020 ha synthases are divided into two distinct classes based on their configuration the ha has and ha pmhas we identified homologs of proteins associated with ha has in 20 mags however the organization of the genes questions whether they are functional for ha synthesis the query is a short three gene operon sze et al 2016 whereas the identified homologs were separated by multiple genes and often present on separate strands of the dna accordingly the identified hits might originate from conserved domains also found in genes related to other pathways utilizing the same substrates ha pmhas only contained a single query gene we identified homologs in seven mags from different phyla however pfam domain annotation did not identify all the domains required for ha synthesis in any of the hits and it may therefore be speculated whether these homologs are functional or not we also searched for curdlan bgcs but did not detect any 3 8 a genetic approach to identifying exopolysaccharide potential the experimental validation of eps polysaccharides in complex bacterial communities such as wwtps is highly challenging seviour et al 2019 thus approaches to identifying genomic potentials may provide a possible starting point for a better understanding of biofilm and floc formation in the context of wwtps furthermore the genomic potentials can be linked to bacterial taxonomies which could facilitate a more refined regulation of e g floc formation by altering conditions in wwtps to select for specific microbial taxa in this work we used a bioinformatic approach to identify potential exopolysaccharide synthesis operons or gene clusters incorporating genomic proximity the strategy proved extremely powerful in finding homologous systems of the synthase dependent exopolysaccharide synthesis pathways and relies only on the availability of hq mags or genomes and that the relevant pathways have clustered and conserved genes thus this method can easily be extended to similar pathways in any ecosystem 3 9 limited genomic potential for biosynthesis of known exopolysaccharides we identified biosynthetic gene clusters associated with known exopolysaccharides in 121 mags corresponding to 11 of the hq mags obtained by singleton et al 2021 this suggests that it is either a subset of the abundant bacteria in danish wwtps that can produce exopolysaccharides or that there are exopolysaccharide systems that were not detected using our approach in support of the latter it should be noted that while this study provides information on the genomic presence of known polysaccharide synthesis pathways the method does not capture potential novel polysaccharide synthesis systems not covered by the queries to identify novel polysaccharide synthesis systems the search can be expanded with additional genes for general synthesis proteins from the three main mechanisms of polysaccharide synthesis abc transporter synthase and wzx wzy dependent as new systems could be expected to have conserved key genes homologous to those already known however this approach requires fine tuning of the method putative gene clusters related to 10 out of the 16 examined exopolysaccharide bgcs were identified in our mags including mags that represent core or crat species found in wwtps across the globe dueholm et al 2022 table s1 the most common type of exopolysaccharide gene cluster was cellulose 40 mags followed by pel 25 mags most mags encoded only a single type of exopolysaccharide except for cellulose where several mags encoded both type i and ii interestingly gene clusters for specific exopolysaccharides were generally conserved across mags from the same species table s1 accordingly we may be able to link the potential for exopolysaccharide biosynthesis to specific species it should be stressed that the current study only determined genomic potentials therefore future research must confirm that the predicted exopolysaccharide systems are important for the as floc formation and if they are how they are regulated in response to process and environmental factors 3 10 a platform for in situ studies our approach has revealed the genomic potential for known exopolysaccharide biosynthesis systems in as thus it represents an excellent starting point for in situ studies which potentially can verify the systems and help characterize their biofilm dynamics various imaging techniques can link the production of specific exopolysaccharides with specific bacterial taxa and spatially locate key producers in the as flocs this knowledge can prove important in understanding and characterizing the role of the particular exopolysaccharides in floc formation to improve solid liquid separation to potentially regulate the floc assembly in the future transcriptomics can be used to study the triggers of exopolysaccharide synthesis and identify the most important producers temporal studies with altering conditions can potentially reveal regulatory mechanisms which have huge potential in controlling flocculation and settlement furthermore proteomics can be used to verify the expression and quantification of relevant proteins which can indicate the importance of a given exopolysaccharide for the biofilm matrix which is critical to the process management of the wwtps 4 conclusions we have here applied genome mining and gene synteny analyses to uncover the genetic potential for exopolysaccharide synthesis in more than 1000 hq mags representing typical species found in as systems globally this provided a direct link between individual taxa their potential exopolysaccharides and the associated bgcs however as only 11 of the examined mags encoded homologs to known exopolysaccharide gene clusters and most only carried the genes for one system there might be an unexplored potential for novel exopolysaccharide systems in the many poorly studied taxa found in wwtps characterization of the genomic potential for eps biosynthesis represents a foundation for further exploration into what exopolysaccharides are expressed in situ by which bacteria and how expression is regulated in response to process and environmental factors this information may ultimately be used to regulate exopolysaccharide production to improve the properties of as flocs or enhance the

gene clusters even when these are long and contain repetitive sequences goldstein et al 2019 the hq mags therefore represent a valuable foundation for linking microbial identity taxonomy with their genetic potential for exopolysaccharide production furthermore most of these mags represent common genera across global wastewater treatment systems dueholm et al 2022 here we carried out a literature survey to identify experimentally validated exopolysaccharide biosynthetic pathways encoded in operons or gene clusters within well characterized bacterial isolates we identified 16 exopolysaccharide biosynthetic gene clusters bgcs and used these to compile a database of the corresponding proteins this database was then used to identify homologous systems in the as hq mags hereby linking the potential for exopolysaccharide production to individual bacterial species based on homolog identification and gene proximity analysis we identified putative gene clusters related to 10 of the examined exopolysaccharide biosynthetic pathways to our knowledge this is the first comprehensive description of the genome resolved potential for these exopolysaccharides in as bacteria generally the biosynthetic pathways were restricted to one or two phyla alginate bgcs were restricted to a few low abundant mags in a single family questioning the proposed importance of alginate zhang et al 2021 in wastewater treatment systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 source data translated gene sequences from experimentally validated polysaccharide biosynthesis pathways table 1 were acquired from the national center for biotechnology information ncbi database the hq mags from as and their taxonomy were obtained from the study by singleton et al 2021 translated coding sequences cdss were identified and annotated using prokka v 1 14 seemann 2014 with the following options meta kingdom bacteria or archaea depending on the taxonomy of the mag 2 2 identification of protein homologs the position specific iterative basic local alignment search tool psi blast blast v 2 11 0 altschul et al 1997 was used to identify protein homologs in the prokka generated hq mag protein database singleton et al 2021 psi blast parameters were initially optimized using proteins encoded by the pnag operon as query and empirically optimal parameters were found to be num iterations 20 max hsp 10 evalue 0 001 qcov hsp perc 20 and max target seq 100 000 output format out fmt 6 was used these parameters were then used for all searches 2 3 prediction and visualization of exopolysaccharide biosynthetic gene clusters proteins related to exopolysaccharide biosynthesis gene clusters were evaluated based on the number of homologs found for each exopolysaccharide system and whether their genes were located together in the genomes fig 1 to achieve this results from psi blast searches for individual polysaccharide queries were analyzed in r based on the following steps i for each query homologs identified by psi blast were evaluated based on percent identity thresholds empirically optimized to enhance search specificity while limiting the number of hits outside the identified biosynthetic gene clusters homologs with 20 identity were removed for all exopolysaccharide systems except for the hyaluronic acid system from pasteurella multocida which only contains a single query protein for this system a cutoff at 33 identity was applied to reduce the rate of false positive hits ii to avoid homologs associated with unrelated pathways a proximity criterion for genes in putative gene clusters was introduced identified homologs whose genes were separated by more than eight annotated genes or 2000 bp from other homologs from the same exopolysaccharide gene cluster were removed the proximity criteria were set arbitrarily based on an empirical evaluation iii putative gene clusters were filtered based on the number of homologs identified and the presence of essential key enzymes see table 1 iv for the proteins related to the putative gene clusters amino acid sequences were mapped to the pfam database mistry et al 2021 using interproscan search jones et al 2014 to identify conserved protein domains v the phylogenetic distribution of each exopolysaccharide system was visualized using the phylogenetic tree created by singleton et al 2021 the synteny of gene clusters was examined using gene arrow maps the following r packages were used seqinr v 4 2 16 gouy et al 1984 tidyverse v 1 3 1 wickham et al 2019 gggenes v 0 4 1 wilkins 2020 ggtree v 3 2 1 yu et al 2017 and ggtreeextra v 1 6 0 xu et al 2021 final figures were assembled and visually enhanced in adobe illustrator 2022 2 4 data and code availability r scripts used for data analyses and figures are available at github https github com msdueholm publications tree master dueholm2022b raw data for the scripts is available at figshare https doi org 10 6084 m9 figshare 21287112 v1 a list of all identified eps gene clusters is provided as supplementary data s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 exopolysaccharide biosynthesis systems in as bacteria to identify potential exopolysaccharide biosynthesis systems in the hq mags we first searched for gene clusters associated with the biosynthesis of known exopolysaccharides this resulted in a list of 16 validated exopolysaccharide systems each consisting of a set of query sequences table 1 an initial homology search using the translated protein sequences from these query genes was conducted against the translated coding sequences cds from the hq mags using psi blast however after removing hits with low percent identity 20 homolog proteins related to all exopolysaccharide systems were still identified in almost all mags suggesting that many of the query genes had homologs associated with unrelated metabolic pathways fig 2 a this was also apparent from the observation that some query sequences from different exopolysaccharide systems targeted the same cdss in the hq mags fig s1 to increase the specificity of our search we introduced a proximity criterion utilizing the fact that functionally related genes including those encoding exopolysaccharides are generally organized in operons or bgcs in bacteria schmid et al 2015 fig 2b this filtration proved to be highly effective in identifying complete or near complete exopolysaccharide bgcs while removing hits which are likely associated with unrelated metabolic pathways to only include the most plausible hits we considered a pathway to be present if all essential genes e g the main synthase unit were present while complying with the proximity criterion and the threshold for the number of genes for the given polysaccharide biosynthesis pathway generally homologs of some genes related to a specific polysaccharide were found in many mags in contrast other genes were more specific and were mainly seen with a high percent identity in mags with a complete biosynthesis pathway fig 2a and fig s2 s8 thus some genes are good predictors for a putative biosynthetic gene cluster we identified homologs for 10 out of the 16 examined exopolysaccharide biosynthetic pathways supplementary data s1 3 2 alginate bgcs are uncommon in as bacteria alginate is an anionic linear polysaccharide composed of mannuronic acid and guluronic acid residues remminghorst and rehm 2006 putative gene clusters for alginate synthesis were only identified in five mags these belong to the two midas placeholder genera midas g 2943 3 mags and midas g 4210 2 mags both in the micavibrionales order of the proteobacteria phylum fig s2 interestingly several members of this order including micavibrio are epiphytic obligate bacterial parasites that among others prey on pseudomonas aeruginosa from which the query operon originates wang et al 2011 accordingly the alginate bgc may have been acquired by horizontal gene transfer because of this lifestyle the alginate related genes were organized as gene clusters consisting of both operons and individually transcribed genes fig 3 this contrasts with the single operon organization of the query genes in p aeruginosa the organization of the alginate gene clusters was genus specific the midas g 4210 gene clusters lacked the algg gene proposed to be an epimerase schmid et al 2015 whereas those for midas g 2943 had homologs for all query genes the latter also encoded additional genes including three copies of the putative acetylation gene algx because the genetic potential for alginate was restricted to a few low abundant bacteria it is unlikely that alginate is an important polymer in wwtps furthermore it suggests that the main polysaccharide component in ale is evolutionarily unrelated to alginate although sharing physicochemical properties 3 3 pel operons are found in several orders within the proteobacteria pel is a known constituent in biofilms produced by p aeruginosa friedman and kolter 2003 and is composed of dimeric repeats of α 1 4 linked galactosamine and n acetylgalactosamine le mauff et al 2022 the genetic capacity to synthesize pel is encoded in the seven gene pel operon pela g widespread among gram negative and gram positive bacteria whitfield and howell 2021 we identified 25 mags with the genetic capacity to produce pel fig s3 these mags were all except for one myxococcota mag from the proteobacteria phylum and represented the following orders the burkholderiales 18 mags pseudomonadales 5 mags oceanospirillales 1 mag and myxococcales 1 mag the pel genes were for all mags organized as a single operon and gene synteny matched that of the query operon from p aeruginosa except for the myxococcales mag fig 4 in the latter the pela and pelb genes were located downstream from pelg as the last genes in the operon compared to at the beginning in operons from the burkholderiales and pseudomonadales order the presence of the pel biosynthetic machinery in 25 mags representing 12 species including a general core lautropia midas s 135 and three conditional rare or abundant taxa crat species across the world propionivibrio aalborgensis propionivibrio midas s 421 and hahella midas s 10 928 table s1 suggests that pel could be important in global wastewater treatment systems 3 4 cellulose bgcs display diverse structures cellulose is a polymer of β 1 4 linked d glucose and a common constituent of wastewater originating from e g toilet paper ruiken et al 2013 however many bacteria can also produce cellulose as a component of their extracellular matrix römling and galperin 2015 the presence of cellulose in the inlet wastewater makes it challenging to differentiate microbial produced cellulose necessitating genomic or protein investigations to resolve its origin previous studies have shown that the as isolate shinella zoogloeoides atcc 19 623 formerly known as zoogloea ramigera i 16 m produces and uses cellulose for floc formation gao et al 2022 otherwise little is known about microbial produced cellulose in wastewater treatment systems komagataeibacter medellinensis formerly known as gluconacetobacter xylinus and acetobacter xylinum is a model organism for bacterial cellulose and it can produce two different forms matsutani et al 2015 cellulose i is a ribbon like polymer composed of bundles of microfibrils whereas cellulose ii is an amorphous polymer with increased thermostability compared to cellulose i yu and atalla 1996 the two forms of cellulose are encoded by separate bgcs matsutani et al 2015 we used both as queries to identify mags with the genetic potential for cellulose production 43 mags were identified when a minimum threshold of two observed homologs including the main synthase gene bcsai or bcsabii were used for identification fig s4 and s5 out of these 30 mags encoded only cellulose i three mags only cellulose ii and ten mags both cellulose i and ii these mags included four loose core and two crat species including acidovorax midas s 1484 dechloromonas midas s 173 recently classified as d phosphoritropha petriglieri et al 2021 and nitrotoga midas s 181 which all encode both cellulose types table s1 because the genomic potential for cellulose i expression was more common in the examined mags we analyzed this system in greater detail fig 5 interestingly critical pfam domains present in the query genes were only detected in the homologs of 14 mags which could indicate that some detected operons were non functional the operons from the 14 mags could be separated into three groups depending on gene organization and flanking genes agrobacterium tumefaciens like 1 mag k medellinensis like 5 mags and escherichia coli like 8 mags fig 5 the e coli like hits contained a bcsq and a bcsg gene and had similar operon structures bcsg has been identified as a phosphoethanolamine transferase involved in producing modified cellulose with these groups added römling and galperin 2015 the k medellinensis like operon structures contained a bcsd gene in two mags bscd is often coupled to the crystalline cellulose structure found in k medellinensis römling and galperin 2015 the a tumefaciens like operon uniquely encoded the bcsn gene which was previously shown to be specific for alphaproteobacteria römling and galperin 2015 cellulose is known to be regulated by c di gmp via its binding to conserved motifs in the pilz domain in bcsa mcnamara et al 2015 the a tumefaciens like operon is distinguished by the absence of a functional important amino acid in the pilz domain which has previously been coupled to c di gmp independent regulation matthysse et al 1995b 1995a suggesting different regulatory strategies the diverse organization of the identified cellulose operons implies differentiation of their regulation monomer composition and the structural organization of cellulose fibrils due to their uncharacterized nature it is currently a challenge to couple the physicochemical characteristics of microbial cellulose to the different cellulose synthase complexes mcnamara et al 2015 however the genomic potential for cellulose production in several mags including core taxa supports the role of microbial cellulose as an important eps in as floc formation 3 5 the pga operon is favored for pnag biosynthesis in as poly n acetylglucosamine pnag is an eps polysaccharide associated with microbial biofilms it is a homopolysaccharide consisting of β 1 6 linked n acetylglucosamine and is synthesized in a range of bacterial species including both gram negative pgaabcd operon in e coli and gram positive species icaadbc operon in staphylococcus species and epshijk operon in b subtilis atkin et al 2014 bundalovic torma et al 2020 roux et al 2015 the gram negative pnag pga query identified putative operons in 12 mags fig s6 no homologs to pgad were found by psi blast but in all operons a pgad like protein domain was identified based on interproscan organization and domain annotation were similar across all identified operons however all hits from the betaproteobacteriales order lacked an annotated gh13 domain within the pgab gene dividing the hits into two operon types one with an assigned gh13 and one without fig 6 the gh13 domain in pgab has previously been proposed to play a role in binding and translocating pnag through the periplasmic space little et al 2014 however it may also act as an extracellular hydrolase that can disperse pnag dependent biofilms little et al 2018 all hits were identified in the proteobacteria phylum within the gammaproteobacteria 11 mags and desulfobacterota 1 mag classes similarly bundalovic torma et al 2020 showed that pnag is widely represented in the proteobacteria phylum but is also found in other phyla among the identified mags were the two loose core species ca accumulibacter phosphatis and sulfuritalea hydrogenivorans and the crat species ca accumulibacter midas s 315 which was recently reclassified as ca propionivibrio dominans table s1 petriglieri et al 2022 the gram positive pnag eps genes are often observed in larger gene clusters epsa o but only epshijk are required for biosynthesis when filtered to three required genes only eight hits remained these belonged to the bacteroidetes 7 mags and acidobacterium 1 mag phyla fig s7 the bacteroidetes mags included a single crat species representing a midas placeholder order midas o 31 within the class sja 28 table s1 the modification gene epsi was not identified in any of the mags and in most the annotated epsk genes were only partially aligned to the query which questions the functionality of these operons we also searched for homologous synthesis systems for the staphylococcus like pnag ica homologous synthesis systems but no operons were identified 3 6 bgcs for several known wzx wzy dependent polysaccharides were not identified generally our approach did not identify any complete biosynthetic pathway 75 of query genes for xanthan salecan psl diutan s88 and succinoglycan fig 2 these all represent the wzx wzy dependent pathway and include at least 12 genes the large number of genes provides increased room for diversification and gene shuffling which may have prevented us from detecting such operons in support of this we found that the genetic loci associated with the only three wzx wzy dependent pathways detected in the mags were rearranged entirely fig 7 previous studies carried out on lactobacillus have furthermore demonstrated that diversification of wzx wzy dependent eps gene cluster can occur at the strain level deo et al 2019 martino et al 2016 if this is also the case for strains in as we might expect that such gene clusters may not be correctly assembled in some of the hq mags as these may represent species level co assemblies of several strains meziti et al 2021 this questions whether the larger wzx wzy dependent gene clusters are not detected due to strain diversity or are simply not present in the as bacteria 3 7 limited potential for hyaluronic acid and curdlan biosynthesis ha like polymers are produced by ha synthases and have previously been reported in aerobic granular sludge where they are assumed to form hydrogels felz et al 2020 ha synthases are divided into two distinct classes based on their configuration the ha has and ha pmhas we identified homologs of proteins associated with ha has in 20 mags however the organization of the genes questions whether they are functional for ha synthesis the query is a short three gene operon sze et al 2016 whereas the identified homologs were separated by multiple genes and often present on separate strands of the dna accordingly the identified hits might originate from conserved domains also found in genes related to other pathways utilizing the same substrates ha pmhas only contained a single query gene we identified homologs in seven mags from different phyla however pfam domain annotation did not identify all the domains required for ha synthesis in any of the hits and it may therefore be speculated whether these homologs are functional or not we also searched for curdlan bgcs but did not detect any 3 8 a genetic approach to identifying exopolysaccharide potential the experimental validation of eps polysaccharides in complex bacterial communities such as wwtps is highly challenging seviour et al 2019 thus approaches to identifying genomic potentials may provide a possible starting point for a better understanding of biofilm and floc formation in the context of wwtps furthermore the genomic potentials can be linked to bacterial taxonomies which could facilitate a more refined regulation of e g floc formation by altering conditions in wwtps to select for specific microbial taxa in this work we used a bioinformatic approach to identify potential exopolysaccharide synthesis operons or gene clusters incorporating genomic proximity the strategy proved extremely powerful in finding homologous systems of the synthase dependent exopolysaccharide synthesis pathways and relies only on the availability of hq mags or genomes and that the relevant pathways have clustered and conserved genes thus this method can easily be extended to similar pathways in any ecosystem 3 9 limited genomic potential for biosynthesis of known exopolysaccharides we identified biosynthetic gene clusters associated with known exopolysaccharides in 121 mags corresponding to 11 of the hq mags obtained by singleton et al 2021 this suggests that it is either a subset of the abundant bacteria in danish wwtps that can produce exopolysaccharides or that there are exopolysaccharide systems that were not detected using our approach in support of the latter it should be noted that while this study provides information on the genomic presence of known polysaccharide synthesis pathways the method does not capture potential novel polysaccharide synthesis systems not covered by the queries to identify novel polysaccharide synthesis systems the search can be expanded with additional genes for general synthesis proteins from the three main mechanisms of polysaccharide synthesis abc transporter synthase and wzx wzy dependent as new systems could be expected to have conserved key genes homologous to those already known however this approach requires fine tuning of the method putative gene clusters related to 10 out of the 16 examined exopolysaccharide bgcs were identified in our mags including mags that represent core or crat species found in wwtps across the globe dueholm et al 2022 table s1 the most common type of exopolysaccharide gene cluster was cellulose 40 mags followed by pel 25 mags most mags encoded only a single type of exopolysaccharide except for cellulose where several mags encoded both type i and ii interestingly gene clusters for specific exopolysaccharides were generally conserved across mags from the same species table s1 accordingly we may be able to link the potential for exopolysaccharide biosynthesis to specific species it should be stressed that the current study only determined genomic potentials therefore future research must confirm that the predicted exopolysaccharide systems are important for the as floc formation and if they are how they are regulated in response to process and environmental factors 3 10 a platform for in situ studies our approach has revealed the genomic potential for known exopolysaccharide biosynthesis systems in as thus it represents an excellent starting point for in situ studies which potentially can verify the systems and help characterize their biofilm dynamics various imaging techniques can link the production of specific exopolysaccharides with specific bacterial taxa and spatially locate key producers in the as flocs this knowledge can prove important in understanding and characterizing the role of the particular exopolysaccharides in floc formation to improve solid liquid separation to potentially regulate the floc assembly in the future transcriptomics can be used to study the triggers of exopolysaccharide synthesis and identify the most important producers temporal studies with altering conditions can potentially reveal regulatory mechanisms which have huge potential in controlling flocculation and settlement furthermore proteomics can be used to verify the expression and quantification of relevant proteins which can indicate the importance of a given exopolysaccharide for the biofilm matrix which is critical to the process management of the wwtps 4 conclusions we have here applied genome mining and gene synteny analyses to uncover the genetic potential for exopolysaccharide synthesis in more than 1000 hq mags representing typical species found in as systems globally this provided a direct link between individual taxa their potential exopolysaccharides and the associated bgcs however as only 11 of the examined mags encoded homologs to known exopolysaccharide gene clusters and most only carried the genes for one system there might be an unexplored potential for novel exopolysaccharide systems in the many poorly studied taxa found in wwtps characterization of the genomic potential for eps biosynthesis represents a foundation for further exploration into what exopolysaccharides are expressed in situ by which bacteria and how expression is regulated in response to process and environmental factors this information may ultimately be used to regulate exopolysaccharide production to improve the properties of as flocs or enhance the

15271,the microplastic residence time in lakes is a key factor controlling its uptake by lake organisms in this work we have for the first time conducted a series of microplastic addition experiments in a 12 3 m lake mesocosm and traced its transport through the lake water column this was combined with a 1d physically based random walk model of microplastic transport four experiments were conducted using three microplastic size ranges 1 5 28 48 and 53 63 µm over one year during thermal stratification and lake turnover the results showed that the residence time in the water column largely depended on particle size and lake hydrodynamics although the smallest particles were poorly represented by the model residence times in the mesocosm ranged between 1 day for the largest particles to 24 days for the small particles during summer the modeled residence time were similar to the measured values of the 28 48 µm and 53 63 µm particles but for the smallest particles residence times were calculated to be 200 d the discrepancy is likely due to aggregation between the small microplastic particles and natural lake particles which increases the microplastic settling velocity aggregation is favored for the small particles due their large surface area to volume ratio in contrast density instabilities in the water column during autumn likely led to turbulent convective mixing and rapid microplastic transport within the water column this work shows that microplastic transport within lakes is complex and not fully understood especially for the smallest sizes and involves interactions between physical physicochemical and biological processes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastic settling velocity residence time turbulent mixing lake turnover random walk modeling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction continual technological advances in polymer engineering have reduced the costs of plastic production allowing it to be used in a wide range of applications d avignon et al 2022 the majority of the global plastic volume produced is typically made for single use particularly as packaging d avignon et al 2022 ideally after use the polymer is recycled and reenters the production stream however evidence from life cycle studies shows that improper disposal of plastic is significant lavoie et al 2021 woods et al 2021 this has led to migration and accumulation of plastic debris in the environment e g in inland waters before it reaches the ocean cai et al 2021 during the transport of plastic debris in the environment it is exposed to various physical chemical and biological degradation processes meides et al 2021 the fragmentation and degradation processes in natural environments transform the large plastic debris 5 mm into secondary microplastic 5 mm to 100 nm and nanoplastics 100 nm while secondary microplastic results from the breakdown of macroplastic primary microplastic is plastic pellets designed for commercial purposes such as in cosmetics arthur et al 2009 these particles can reach lake systems predominantly from terrestrial sources such as effluents from sewage treatment plants sun et al 2019 surface runoff wang et al 2022 agriculture bigalke et al 2022 and improper disposal of plastic waste close to the shoreline since non buoyant pristine microplastic particles are small in size and have polymer densities close to that of water they are expected to have significant residence times in lake systems elagami et al 2022 during their residence in the lake water column they are exposed to a wide range of lake organisms e g zooplankton fish this results in a high likelihood of uptake by lake organisms before the plastic reaches the lake sediment or before they are flushed from the lake via outlets canniff and hoang 2018 d avignon et al 2022 recent studies have shown that lake organisms such as zooplankton have a limited ability to distinguish between their food which is usually composed of natural particulate organic carbon either from the lake or its catchment and microplastic particles aljaibachi and callaghan 2018 once microplastic particles have entered the food web they can migrate to higher trophic levels through direct ingestion or indirect ingestion of microplastic containing organisms by predators d avignon et al 2022 nelms et al 2018 the settling velocity of microplastic is controlled by key physical particle properties such as density and size ahmadi et al 2022 elagami et al 2022 khatmullina and isachenko 2017 waldschläger and schüttrumpf 2019 physical chemical factors such as hydrophobic adhesion between pristine particles and fine air bubbles formation of aggregates with natural particles existing in lake water column schmidtmann et al 2022 as well as biofouling can affect the buoyancy of the microplastic modify its settling velocity and thus also influence its residence time in lakes elagami et al 2022 leiser et al 2020 renner et al 2020 lake hydrodynamics can also influence the residence times of microplastic within the water column for instance turbulent mixing in the epilimnion during summer is expected to cause a significant increase in the residence times of sinking particles compared to particles in the laminar metalimnion elagami et al 2022 kirillin et al 2012 reynolds and wiseman 1982 however the behavior of microplastic during lake turnover is expected to be very different from that during the stratification period this is due to the instability of the lake water column which leads to the onset of natural turbulent convective mixing cannon et al 2021 the role that such complex hydrodynamic processes play in determining microplastic residence time is currently poorly understood despite the growing number of studies investigating microplastic transport in lake systems it is still a poorly understood process all results from previous research are based on controlled laboratory settings elagami et al 2022 waldschläger and schüttrumpf 2019 and modeling ahmadi et al 2022 and are unlikely to represent the complex microplastic behavior in a real lake this is attributed to the fact that microplastic behavior in lake systems incorporates various interrelated biological chemical and hydrodynamic processes that are not yet well understood especially at the whole lake scale such processes and their associated impacts on residence time can only be captured by experiments directly in a lake water column in this work we have performed microplastic addition experiments in a 3 12 m in lake mesocosm located in lake großer brombachsee germany the experiments were conducted over one year capturing the complexities of real lake settings during thermal stratification and lake turnover fluorescence techniques were used to quantify microplastic concentrations and infer residence times in the mesocosm during complex hydrodynamic conditions in the lake water column the results from the mesocosm experiments were compared with results from a physically based random walk model that included turbulent and gravitational transport the primary aims were to i develop a quantitative understanding of the primary processes influencing microplastic transport in the lake water column e g particle size and lake hydrodynamics ii investigate how well physical transport processes can explain observations in a complex in lake mesocosm and iii understand how the complex processes in the lake water column influence the exposure of organisms to this emerging pollutant 2 methodology 2 1 study region all field experiments were conducted at lake großer brombachsee in the german federal state of bavaria the großer brombachsee is a 5 1 km long and 2 0 km wide water reservoir with a maximum depth of 32 5 m covering an area of 8 50 km2 according to the long term monitoring data of the water management authority office ansbach the thermal stratification period extends from may until the end of october lake turnover typically begins in november the lake has an intermediate level of productivity and is classified as mesotrophic the average annual total nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations over lake depth are 0 95 and 0 025 mg l 1 respectively the experimental site was situated at the border of a nature reserve located on the southwestern side of the lake fig 1 the water depth at the mesocosm site varied between 10 and 12 m depending on the season and extraction for water supply 2 2 mesocosm setup the mesocosm setup aquatic research instruments usa consisted of a round 12 m deep and 3 m diameter impermeable polyethylene plastic enclosure with 80 light transmittance reinforced with nylon fibers figs 2 and s1 the enclosure was fitted with side loops at 3 m intervals to stabilize the mesocosm the upper end of the mesocosm was fitted with a 3 m diameter ring buoy constructed from a foam filled corrugated drain pipe the bottom of the enclosure was fixed to the sediment layer using 5 20 kg concrete ballasts the enclosure was freely open from the top but partially sealed from the bottom with a mesh the mesocosm was lowered slowly into the lake before the mesh was installed shortly after the mesocosm no filling pumping was required a u shaped pontoon was fixed around the mesocosm and adopted as a platform for fixing the instruments the whole setup was anchored to the lake bed with 4 anchors and the ropes were tensioned to prevent the setup from drifting and rotating the mesocosm was deployed in may 2021 and left for two months to allow the water column to equilibrate with the surrounding lake water before conducting the first experiment 2 3 microplastic particles in this work we exclusively used microspheres due to the limited availability of fluorescent microplastic with irregular or fibrous forms all microspheres were supplied by cospheric llc in green fluorescence dry powder the fluorescent dye had maximum excitation and emission wave lengths of 414 and 514 nm respectively table 1 shows the polymers their densities particle sizes and the amounts of the microplastic used in each experiment the 1 5 µm particles were composed of a propriety polymer of unknown chemical structure whereas the larger particles were polyethylene with custom specific gravities aqueous microplastic solutions with concentrations of 1 0 g l 1 were prepared in the laboratory prior to each experiment due to the hydrophobic nature of cospheric particles the stock solutions were prepared using distilled water mixed with 0 1 g of surfactant tween 20 per 100 ml of stock solution this also prevented the microplastic from agglomerating or floating on the surface of the water while preparing the solution the solutions were then preserved in clean sealed buckets in a cool room before transportation to the lake four microplastic addition experiments were conducted in the mesocosm over one year from july 2021 to june 2022 the experimental dates were chosen carefully to capture lake stratification in summer as well as lake turnover in autumn three experiments were conducted during summer using 1 5 28 48 and 53 63 µm spherical fluorescence particles the summer experiments were aimed at investigating the effect of particle size and surface area to volume ratio on the residence time of the particles during thermal stratification the autumn experiment conducted using the 1 5 µm particles was aimed at quantifying the effect of lake turnover convection on the residence time of the particles in the mesocosm 2 4 microplastic addition to the mesocosm prior to each experiment the surface of the water inside the mesocosm was cleaned using fine nets the stock solutions were stirred in the buckets until all settled particles were resuspended and uniformly distributed in the solution the particles were then added as a pulse from the top of the mesocosm simultaneously by two persons using two metal watering cans fitted with wide sprinklers to ensure a uniform distribution of the microplastic at the surface of the mesocosm fig s2 the watering cans and sprinklers were carefully rinsed using lake water to ensure that all microplastic were flushed into the mesocosm the particle additions are estimated to have lasted a maximum of five minutes 2 5 field measurements water temperatures were measured in the center of the mesocosm for the duration of the experiments using hobo tidbit temperature loggers at 1 m intervals and with a sampling resolution of 30 min temperature profiles were also taken outside the mesocosm before the start of each experiment and compared with the temperatures in the mesocosm the temperature data were used to infer the stability and stratification of the water column and to define the epilimnion and metalimnion a 3d acoustic doppler velocimeter adv nortek vector 300 was used to measure 3d water velocities inside the mesocosm and infer turbulent kinetic energy and turbulent diffusion the adv was fixed in the center of the mesocosm at 1 m below the water surface the instrument was set to sample at burst intervals of 600 s with 100 samples per burst at 8 hz the adv was set to detect flow velocities in the east north up enu directions in a sampling volume of 1 5 cm3 the instrument is equipped with a magnetometer and tilt sensors to correct measured velocities for movement of the instrument in the water column the fluorescent microplastic was measured in the center of the mesocosm using submersible field fluorometers ggun fl24 from albillia bailly comte et al 2018 the fluorometers used an excitation wavelength of 470 nm to excite the green microplastic particles and the fluorescent intensity was measured in the uranine channel the fluorometers were calibrated in the laboratory following the same procedures as presented in boos et al 2021 at least 8 calibration points were used the only difference to boos et al 2021 is that calibration solutions were prepared using filtered lake water rather than distilled water the calibrations are presented in fig s3 the minimum detection limits of the 1 5 28 48 and 53 63 µm particles were approximately 2 100 and 200 µg l 1 respectively the fluorometers were less sensitive to the 28 48 and 53 63 µm microspheres due to the lower particle numbers per gram microplastic and higher scattering in the measuring cell fig s3 the measurement frequency of the fluorometers in the mesocosm was selected according to the expected residence times of the particles based on their laminar settling velocities thus the sampling interval was fixed at 2 and 120 s for the large fast and the small slow particles respectively during lake stratification the fluorometers were positioned at 0 5 m below the water surface the epilimnion metalimnion interface and 1 m from the bottom of the mesocosm during lake turnover in autumn the fluorometers were only positioned at 0 5 m below the water surface and 1 m over lake sediment 2 6 microplastic settling velocity in this work we have used three characteristic settling velocities for the microplastic particles firstly the settling velocities of the 28 48 and 53 63 µm particles were measured in the laboratory under laminar conditions using particle image velocimetry system piv the measured velocities were then corrected to the water temperature of each lake compartment in the mesocosm the corrected settling velocities were denoted as vs piv l t 1 secondly due to the limitations of our piv system it was not possible to measure the settling velocity of the particles in the range of 1 µm in the laboratory here we used stokes equation to calculate the settling velocity of the 1 5 µm particles as these particles were large enough that the brownian motion will not affect their settling but also small enough that the reynolds number would be 1 and so laminar conditions around the particle can be assumed i e in stokes range stokes velocity was denoted vs stokes l t 1 finally effective settling velocities for all microplastic particles were calculated using the experimental data from the mesocosm vs eff l t 1 the settling velocities of the large 28 48 and 53 63 µm microspheres were measured in the laboratory using the same two dimensional ila 5051 piv system used by elagami et al 2022 the system consists of a high speed camera 40 frames per second and a light source high power light emitting diodes with a wavelength of 530 nm the settling velocities were measured in a 10 cm x10 cm x 40 cm glass column filled with filtered lake water based on the design of khatmullina and isachenko 2017 the room temperature was kept constant at 20 c approximately 1 ml of the stock microplastic solution was added carefully at the top of the column as a pulse cloud the average settling velocity of each particle cloud was calculated based on the piv images the vs piv were corrected as in ghawi and kris 2012 using the water temperature of each lake compartment using eq s4 stokes settling velocities were calculated as 1 v s s t o k e s 2 9 ρ p ρ w μ g r 2 where ρ p m l 3 is the density of the particle ρ w m l 3 is the density of the lake water r l is the radius of the particle g l t 2 is the acceleration due to gravity and µ m l 1 t 1 is the dynamic viscosity of the water the effective settling velocities from the mesocosm experiments were calculated for all microplastic sizes by dividing the depth of each compartment i e epilimnion or metalimnion by the time required until 50 of the particles were lost from the compartment median particle breakthrough at the bottom of the compartment 2 v s e f f z τ 50 where z l is the depth of the compartment and τ50 t is the time elapsed until 50 of particles was lost from that compartment median residence time 2 7 hydrodynamic calculations the temperature data inside the mesocosm was used to calculate the rayleigh number to elucidate if natural convection occurred in the water column during the autumn experiment the rayleigh number was calculated according to eq 3 weeraratne and manga 1998 3 r a α g δ t z 3 ν β where α is the thermal expansion coefficient of water 210 10 6 c 1 g is the acceleration due to gravity δt c is the temperature difference between the bottom and top boundaries z is the thickness of the compartment ν l2 t 1 is the kinematic viscosity of water and β l2 t 1 is thermal diffusivity of water the 3d water velocity data were used to calculate the turbulence kinetic energy tke l2 t 2 in the mesocosm the time series for tke of each burst was calculated using eq 4 as in wüest and lorke 2003 4 tke 1 2 σ east 2 σ north 2 σ up 2 where σ east σ north and σ up l t 1 are the standard deviations of the fluctuations in velocity components during each burst the vertical component of the velocity data was also used to calculate the vertical eddy diffusivity d l2 t 1 for each burst since velocities were measured in the eulerian frame of reference where the flow moves past the velocity sensor fixed at 1 m below the water surface d can be estimated from taylor s approach using holtappels and lorke 2011 5 d w l e 6 l e 0 e r dr where w is the standard deviation of the vertical velocities l t 1 le l is the eulerian integral length scale er is the spatial correlation coefficient and r l is the spatial distance for simplification le l was assumed to be equal to the lagrangian length scale ll l as also done by holtappels and lorke 2011 hence d l2t 1 was calculated as follows 7 d w l l 8 l l w t l 9 t l 0 r l d τ where tl t is the lagrangian time scale rl is the lagrangian velocity autocorrelation and τ t is the time interval between two velocity measurements 0 125 s 2 8 calculation of residence times in the mesocosm the residence time of the microplastic in each compartment was calculated as the delay between the time required for 95 of the microplastics to be lost from the compartment and the time of microplastic input to that compartment for instance the residence time in the epilimnion τepi t was calculated as the difference between the time required until 95 of the particles were lost from the epilimnion and the time when the microplastic was added to the mesocosm the residence time in the metalimnion τmeta t was calculated as the delay between the time where 95 of the particles was lost from the metalimnion and the start of the pulse detected by the fluorometer positioned at the epilimnion metalimnion interface during lake turnover in the autumn the mesocosm was treated as one mixed compartment and thus the residence time was calculated for the whole mesocosm τtot t the total residence times in the mesocosm during autumn and summer experiments were calculated as the difference between the time required until 95 of the particles passed the deepest fluorescence detector and the time of adding the microplastic to the mesocosm 2 9 modeling of microplastic sinking trajectories and residence times particle sinking trajectories and residence times in the mesocosm were modeled using a lagrangian particle tracking technique based on the huret et al 2007 visser 1997 scheme which was later modified and applied by rowe et al 2016 and ross 2006 to simulate the vertical distribution of bacteria and plankton under turbulent conditions

profiles the measurements at the start of the experiments showed that the water column inside and outside the mesocosm were near to identical and during summer was thermally stratified and divided into an epilimnion and metalimnion fig s6 the water temperatures inside the mesocosm for the duration of the experiments are shown in fig 3 the thickness of the epilimnion inside the mesocosm over the extent of the experiments were 8 9 and 6 m for the first second and third summer experiment respectively fig 3 the thickness of the metalimnion during the three summer experiments were 3 2 and 4 m the water temperatures varied between 18 and 25 c for the epilimnion and 12 to 14 c for the metalimnion prior to and during the autumn experiment the temperature tended to be warmer at depth than at the surface figs 3d and s6 the differences between the lower the warmer and the upper the cooler layer inside and outside the mesocosm at the start of the experiment were 0 8 and 0 85 c respectively fig s6 also the average temperature difference between the lower and the upper layer inside the mesocosm during the whole autumn experiment was 0 8 c over an extent of 11 m the rayleigh number eq 3 was calculated to investigate the propensity for natural convection in the mesocosm the time series for the rayleigh numbers is presented in fig s7 the minimum rayleigh number was 4 1012 considerably exceeding the critical value of 1700 reid and harris 1958 the rayleigh number also indicated that the convection was turbulent ra 109 3 2 turbulence kinetic energy there were substantial fluctuations in the tke in the epilimnion during summer experiments especially for the experiment with the 1 5 µm particles fig 4 the maximum values for tke during the summer experiments were 2 7 10 3 5 10 3 and 6 6 10 3 m2 s 2 for the first second and third experiments respectively the average tke values were 3 5 10 4 5 10 4 and 1 10 4 m2 s 2 during autumn however the fluctuations in the tke values were much lower showing much flatter tke time series than that during summer experiments the maximum and the average tke values during autumn were 1 8 10 4 and 2 10 5 m2 s 2 respectively 3 3 microplastic concentrations in the mesocosm fig 5 a b and c show the abundance and distribution of the microplastic in the mesocosm during the summer experiments the maximum microplastic concentrations measured at 0 5 m were approximately 15 11 mg l 1 and 400 µg l 1 during the first 53 60 µm second 28 48 µm and third 1 5 µm experiments respectively the maximum concentrations at the epilimnion metalimnion interface were approximately 10 5 mg l 1 and 200 µg l 1 during the first second and third experiments at the bottom of the metalimnion the maximum microplastic concentrations were approximately 2 7 mg l 1 and 50 µg l 1 for the first second and third experiments the time required until 95 of the particles was lost from the epilimnion τepi was 0 8 1 9 and 19 5 days for the first second and third summer experiments fig 5 for the metalimnion τmeta was 0 6 1 4 and 22 days for the first second and third experiments fig 5 the total residence times in the mesocosm were 1 2 5 and 24 7 days the measured particle concentrations during autumn are presented in fig 5d surprisingly the upper and the lower pulses showed an overlap of 1 day the maximum microplastic concentration detected by the upper fluorometer was 80 µg l 1 the lower pulse was divided into large initial and small subsequent pulses with maximum concentrations of 55 and 25 µg l 1 respectively the time until 95 of the particles had passed the lowest detector 1 m over lake sediment τtot 1 9 days 3 4 settling velocity table 2 shows the values of the characteristic settling velocities vs stokes vs piv and vs eff used in the random walk model for the 1 5 µm particles the lowest velocities were estimated using stokes law 0 079 m d 1 while the highest settling velocities were the vs eff 1 09 m d 1 also for the 53 63 µm particles vs eff was the highest 50 m d 1 while vs piv was the lowest 17 m d 1 in contrast for the 28 48 µm particles vs piv was the highest 8 7 m d 1 while vs eff was the lowest 0 16 m d 1 3 5 eddy diffusivity the a d fitting routine provided estimates for the turbulent diffusivities that were comparable to those derived using taylor s approach and the adv data for the summer experiments using the 1 5 µm particles supplementary information s8 the turbulent diffusivities ranged between dh 1 12 10 6 and ds 6 7 10 6 m² s 1 table s9 for the summer experiments using 28 48 and 53 63 µm the a d fitting was less successful so that the random walk modeling relied primarily on d values derived from taylors approach this ranged from 3 10 6 to 1 10 5 m2 s 1 depending on experiment and depth table s9 during autumn our modeling depended exclusively on the d values calculated from taylor s approach 3 6 random walk model the random walk model was run using the three different settling velocities vs stokes vs piv and vs eff depending on the experiment being simulated the distribution in residence times of the individual simulated particles i e microplastic residence time distribution where then used to calculate the time until 95 of particles had passed a specified depth in the water column this is defined as the virtual microplastic residence time the simulations using v s stokes summer experiment 1 5 µm are shown in fig 6 and have a rapid rise as the particle pulse reaches the measurement depth and then a long tail as particles are transported by a combination of settling and turbulence from the water column the simulated residence times were considerably longer than the measured values with 135 days for the first 0 5 m 225 days for the epilimnion 6 m and 239 days for the whole mesocosm water column 10 m when using vs eff for the same model run the simulated microplastic residence times of the 1 5 µm particles in summer were similar to that inferred from microplastic concentrations in the mesocosm fig 7 all distributions showed the characteristic shape of the a d model with a fast increase a local maxima and a slowly decaying tail the only parts that could not accurately be represented by the random walk model were the initial peak in particle concentrations at 0 5 m and the rapidly decaying tails at 0 5 and 10 m depth fig 7 using vs eff the residence times were 4 days for 0 5 m 11 days for the epilimnion 6 m and 32 days for the whole 10 m water column results from simulations for the 28 48 and 53 63 µm particles in summer and the 1 5 µm particles in autumn experiment are summarized in table 3 as the vs eff method did not work well for the larger particle sizes 28 48 µm due to a noisy signal from the detectors the random walk simulations for this size class were parameterized using vs piv the results show that while the random walk model can reproduce the measured residence times for the larger particles relatively well e g 0 8 vs 0 62 days for the 53 63 µm particles it significantly overestimated the residence times for the small particles in the autumn experiments independent of the settling velocity used 2 vs 17 225 days 4 discussions microplastic abundance in lake systems is associated with negative impacts on lake organisms and ecosystem functioning aljaibachi and callaghan 2018 d avignon et al 2022 uptake from the water column by organisms such as filter feeders is highly dependent on the residence time in the water column and particularly in the epilimnion where most organisms reside several factors such as particle size polymer density water temperature and lake hydrodynamics affect the residence times of microplastic waldschläger and schüttrumpf 2019 elagami et al 2022 ahmadi et al 2022 these factors coupled with the abundance of microplastic in lakes control the uptake probability of microplastic by lake organisms and their potential transfer through the food web d avignon et al 2022 nelms et al 2018 the temperature gradient and thus the strong density gradient during lake stratification formed a very stable water column inside the mesocosm the water column was divided into a turbulent epilimnion and a more or less laminar metalimnion this shows maximum tke values at the 1 m below the water surface top of the epilimnion of 2 7 10 3 5 10 3 and 6 6 10 3 m2 s 2 for the first second and third experiments respectively the major source of the high tke in the surface layer during turbulent mixing is likely to be the wind cannon et al 2021 singh et al 2019 the waves in the lake impacting directly on the mesocosm walls and the platform could also have contributed to the relatively high tke in the surface layer the d values calculated from the a d fitting for the 1 5 µm particles during summer experiments table s10 were similar to those calculated from adv data and taylor s approach 10 6 m2 s 1 the calculated ds dm and dh values were in a similar range but at the lower end of typical d values in stratified lakes 10 7 to 10 2 m2 s 2 wüest and lorke 2009 in contrast to the summer experiments the average temperature difference between the bottom part of the mesocosm and the water surface was 0 8 c this temperature difference and subsequently the density difference combined with the 11 m depth of the water column and the temperature fluctuations in the water column resulted in a highly unstable water column this instability resulted in rayleigh numbers 1012 which were significantly higher than the critical values for convection suggesting that the water column was mixed by turbulent convection the maximum tke values at 1 m below the water surface during this period was one order of magnitude lower than that during summer 1 8 10 4 m2 s 2 the major source of tke is convection during autumn which results in the sinking of the upper cool water parcels finally the calculated d values in autumn in the range of 10 7 m2 s 1 were considerably lower than during the summer and at the lower end of the compilation of d values in wüest and lorke 2009 microplastic concentrations were affected by the hydrodynamic conditions in the mesocosm for instance the maximum microplastic concentrations in the mesocosm water column during summer were 5 times higher than that in autumn for the same 1 5 µm particles fig 5c and d the distribution of microplastic inside the mesocosm was also affected by season unlike the summer experiment the upper pulse at 0 5 m below water surface and the lower pulse at 1 m over the sediment during autumn experiment had an overlap of 1day fig 5c and d furthermore the fluorometer at 1 m over the lake sediment detected two subsequent microplastic pulses during the autumn experiment the maximum concentration of the two pulses at 1 m over sediment were 55 and 25 µg l 1 surprisingly however the measurements suggest that turbulent convection seemed to be not strong enough to start resuspension of the settled microplastic as neither fluorometer detected any microplastic after the end of the pulse these differences between microplastic behaviors during summer and autumn experiments are to be attributed to the instability in the water column that likely led to turbulent convective mixing and rapid microplastic transport within the mesocosm as also found by elagami et al 2022 the microplastic residence times were significantly affected by the size of the particles in the stratified water column when increasing the particle size from 28 48 to 53 63 the residence time in the whole column decreased by 2 5 times by comparing the residence times in the mesocosm for the particle group 1 5 µm during summer thermal stratification with that during autumn lake turnover the total residence time in summer was 13 times longer than that during autumn we suspect that the instability of the lake water column during lake turnover which resulted in the onset of lake convection and fast transport of the microplastic to the lake sediment also during lake turnover organic materials cyanobacteria and iron particles could resuspend and attach to the microplastic particles either increasing their density or building aggregates both of which would increasing their settling velocity and reducing residence time in the mesocosm d avignon et al 2022 this shows that in addition to size complex lake hydrodynamics can play a critical role in microplastic transport especially for the smallest particle sizes the simulated residence times using the random walk model differed from the actual residence times in the mesocosm especially for the simulations using vs stokes for the smallest particle sizes tables 2 and 3 the simulated residence time of the 1 5 µm particles in summer using vs stokes was 10 times higher than the actual residence time in the mesocosm table 3 this could be due to the interaction with natural particles existing in the lake schmidtmann et al 2022 or the agglomeration of the microplastic particles in the mesocosm caused by the large surface area to volume ratio and the surface charge of the small microplastic particles such aggregates are large and likely to have higher settling velocities compared to the individual pristine microplastic particles used in stokes model the simulated residence times during summer of the 1 5 µm particles using vs eff 32 days were very close to the actual residence times in the mesocosm 24 days this is due to vs eff and d being derived directly from the mesocosm data as such vs eff implicitly incorporates processes influencing settling velocities in the mesocosm such as particle microplastic interactions and hydrodynamic conditions such processes are not included in the laminar settling velocities in vs stokes or v piv the only part of the measured data that could not be represented by the random walk model for the 1 5 µm particles during summer using vs eff were the peak height and the rapidly decaying tail of the pulse at 0 5 m below the water surface as well as the width of the pulse at the bottom of the metalimnion fig 7 this is likely due to the simplified way the random walk represents the complexities of real world microplastic transport particularly that the model assumes one dimensional transport and uses predefined and stationary d values in reality the tke time series shows that the turbulent strength is transient and likely depends many interrelated factors such as winds currents and waves that impact on the mesocosm for the summer experiments using the large 28 48 and 53 63 µm particles the simulated residence times using vs piv values were comparable to the actual residence times in the mesocosm with a difference of 1 4 and 1 9 times this is likely to be attributed to the faster sinking velocities and relatively lower surface area of the large particles which subsequently reduces the potential particle microplastic interactions and aggregation formation with organic matter e g live and dead phytoplankton inside the mesocosm during autumn the modeled residence times of the 1 5 µm particles were considerably longer than those derived from the mesocosm the simulation results using vs stokes and vs eff were 113 and 8 8 times higher than the actual residence time respectively these significant differences are likely due to the complex hydrodynamic conditions caused by the high instability in the lake water column and particularly the initiation of natural convection which cannot be represented by the simplified lake physics used in the random walk model also the complex biological and chemical processes occurring in the lake water during lake turnover d avignon et al 2022 are not included in the model this shows that the processes controlling microplastic settling velocities and residence times in lake systems during highly unstable hydrodynamic conditions need to be more deeply studied in future research the residence times calculated from the mesocosm experiments are considered more realistic than residence times calculated based on previous modeling or laboratory experiments as mesocosm experiments more closely represent the complexities existing in lake systems however the conditions in the mesocosm are still likely to be quite different from a real lake this could be due to several factors such as the boundary effect of the mesocosm walls the small surface area of the mesocosm exposed to wind 7 m2 and the isolation of the water inside the mesocosm from the rest of the lake this will limit the size of turbulent eddies that can develop in the water column and the influence of other hydrodynamic processes such as seiches and currents that only develop in lake basins we also noticed that the productivity in the mesocosm was higher than in the surrounding lake making the likelihood and effect of interactions with plankton larger than in the große brombachsee also there were some limitations caused by the field instruments for example microplastic concentrations and residence times were calculated depending solely on the signals detected in the measuring cells of the fluorometers with the best case being measurements at three depths this resulted in a lack of knowledge about the behavior of the microplastic particles over the extent of the entire water column in addition our understanding of the hydrodynamics inside the water column depended largely on the velocity measurements by the adv at a single point fixed at 1 m below the water surface this also limits our understanding of the hydrodynamic conditions over the entire extent of the water column finally we exclusively used microspheres and only two polymer types in all experiments we believe that irregular particles would have longer residence time than perfect spheres due to the increase in the drag forces exerted on the irregular particles compared to spheres however we think that particle shape and roundness would have less effect on the residence time of microplastic than that of density and size ahmadi et al 2022 we also believe that the polymer type can affect the residence time for instance particles from biodegradable polymers may attach fine air bubbles in the lake water column increasing buoyancy and thus having a longer residence time compared to non biodegradable polymers elagami et al 2022 5 conclusion previous studies investigating microplastic behavior in lake systems have used simplified laboratory settings to estimate microplastic transport here we have attempted to address the real complexity of transport in lakes by adopting a combination of complex in lake mesocosm experiments with random walk modeling to quantify microplastic residence times and understand the underlying processes controlling microplastic transport in the lake water column the experiments were conducted over of one year capturing thermal stratification and lake turnover and the associated complex chemical biological and hydrodynamic conditions high end techniques were used to infer microplastic residence times and lake hydrodynamics our results quantified for the first time the effect of particle size and lake hydrodynamics on the residence time in conditions close to that in real lake systems the limitations of the model have highlighted where real lake microplastic transport processes are more complex than pure physical transport based on sinking and turbulent diffusion our field experiments have confirmed that particle size has a significant impact on the residence time during stratified summer conditions the small microplastic particles had considerably longer mesocosm residence times than large particles however the residence times of these small particles were still 1 to 2 orders of magnitude shorter than predicted by a random walk model parameterized using the stokes sinking velocities and turbulent dispersivities from the mesocosm this was thought to be due to complex processes such as aggregation of the microplastic with existing lake particulate matter agglomeration and potentially the interactions with biota lake hydrodynamics driven by seasonal temperature changes affected the residence time and distribution of microplastic in the mesocosm in autumn the microplastic residence times during lake turnover were significantly shorter than during the summer experiment and the random walk simulations using the velocities calculated from the mesocosm data and stokes calculations it is thought that this was induced by the initiation of turbulent convection and associated complex biological chemical and hydrodynamic conditions in the water column this shows that the behavior of microplastic in real lake systems and the uptake probability by lake biota such as zooplankton is still poorly understood future work needs to quantitatively incorporate processes such as heteroaggregation biofouling and uptake by lake organisms as well as lake hydrodynamics to quantitatively understand microplastic residence times and associated ecological effects of microplastic in these sensitive environments author contribution statement he

15271,the microplastic residence time in lakes is a key factor controlling its uptake by lake organisms in this work we have for the first time conducted a series of microplastic addition experiments in a 12 3 m lake mesocosm and traced its transport through the lake water column this was combined with a 1d physically based random walk model of microplastic transport four experiments were conducted using three microplastic size ranges 1 5 28 48 and 53 63 µm over one year during thermal stratification and lake turnover the results showed that the residence time in the water column largely depended on particle size and lake hydrodynamics although the smallest particles were poorly represented by the model residence times in the mesocosm ranged between 1 day for the largest particles to 24 days for the small particles during summer the modeled residence time were similar to the measured values of the 28 48 µm and 53 63 µm particles but for the smallest particles residence times were calculated to be 200 d the discrepancy is likely due to aggregation between the small microplastic particles and natural lake particles which increases the microplastic settling velocity aggregation is favored for the small particles due their large surface area to volume ratio in contrast density instabilities in the water column during autumn likely led to turbulent convective mixing and rapid microplastic transport within the water column this work shows that microplastic transport within lakes is complex and not fully understood especially for the smallest sizes and involves interactions between physical physicochemical and biological processes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastic settling velocity residence time turbulent

plastic production allowing it to be used in a wide range of applications d avignon et al 2022 the majority of the global plastic volume produced is typically made for single use particularly as packaging d avignon et al 2022 ideally after use the polymer is recycled and reenters the production stream however evidence from life cycle studies shows that improper disposal of plastic is significant lavoie et al 2021 woods et al 2021 this has led to migration and accumulation of plastic debris in the environment e g in inland waters before it reaches the ocean cai et al 2021 during the transport of plastic debris in the environment it is exposed to various physical chemical and biological degradation processes meides et al 2021 the fragmentation and degradation processes in natural environments transform the large plastic debris 5 mm into secondary microplastic 5 mm to 100 nm and nanoplastics 100 nm while secondary microplastic results from the breakdown of macroplastic primary microplastic is plastic pellets designed for commercial purposes such as in cosmetics arthur et al 2009 these particles can reach lake systems predominantly from terrestrial sources such as effluents from sewage treatment plants sun et al 2019 surface runoff wang et al 2022 agriculture bigalke et al 2022 and improper disposal of plastic waste close to the shoreline since non buoyant pristine microplastic particles are small in size and have polymer densities close to that of water they are expected to have significant residence times in lake systems elagami et al 2022 during their residence in the lake water column they are exposed to a wide range of lake organisms e g zooplankton fish this results in a high likelihood of uptake by lake organisms before the plastic reaches the lake sediment or before they are flushed from the lake via outlets canniff and hoang 2018 d avignon et al 2022 recent studies have shown that lake organisms such as zooplankton have a limited ability to distinguish between their food which is usually composed of natural particulate organic carbon either from the lake or its catchment and microplastic particles aljaibachi and callaghan 2018 once microplastic particles have entered the food web they can migrate to higher trophic levels through direct ingestion or indirect ingestion of microplastic containing organisms by predators d avignon et al 2022 nelms et al 2018 the settling velocity of microplastic is controlled by key physical particle properties such as density and size ahmadi et al 2022 elagami et al 2022 khatmullina and isachenko 2017 waldschläger and schüttrumpf 2019 physical chemical factors such as hydrophobic adhesion between pristine particles and fine air bubbles formation of aggregates with natural particles existing in lake water column schmidtmann et al 2022 as well as biofouling can affect the buoyancy of the microplastic modify its settling velocity and thus also influence its residence time in lakes elagami et al 2022 leiser et al 2020 renner et al 2020 lake hydrodynamics can also influence the residence times of microplastic within the water column for instance turbulent mixing in the epilimnion during summer is expected to cause a significant increase in the residence times of sinking particles compared to particles in the laminar metalimnion elagami et al 2022 kirillin et al 2012 reynolds and wiseman 1982 however the behavior of microplastic during lake turnover is expected to be very different from that during the stratification period this is due to the instability of the lake water column which leads to the onset of natural turbulent convective mixing cannon et al 2021 the role that such complex hydrodynamic processes play in determining microplastic residence time is currently poorly understood despite the growing number of studies investigating microplastic transport in lake systems it is still a poorly understood process all results from previous research are based on controlled laboratory settings elagami et al 2022 waldschläger and schüttrumpf 2019 and modeling ahmadi et al 2022 and are unlikely to represent the complex microplastic behavior in a real lake this is attributed to the fact that microplastic behavior in lake systems incorporates various interrelated biological chemical and hydrodynamic processes that are not yet well understood especially at the whole lake scale such processes and their associated impacts on residence time can only be captured by experiments directly in a lake water column in this work we have performed microplastic addition experiments in a 3 12 m in lake mesocosm located in lake großer brombachsee germany the experiments were conducted over one year capturing the complexities of real lake settings during thermal stratification and lake turnover fluorescence techniques were used to quantify microplastic concentrations and infer residence times in the mesocosm during complex hydrodynamic conditions in the lake water column the results from the mesocosm experiments were compared with results from a physically based random walk model that included turbulent and gravitational transport the primary aims were to i develop a quantitative understanding of the primary processes influencing microplastic transport in the lake water column e g particle size and lake hydrodynamics ii investigate how well physical transport processes can explain observations in a complex in lake mesocosm and iii understand how the complex processes in the lake water column influence the exposure of organisms to this emerging pollutant 2 methodology 2 1 study region all field experiments were conducted at lake großer brombachsee in the german federal state of bavaria the großer brombachsee is a 5 1 km long and 2 0 km wide water reservoir with a maximum depth of 32 5 m covering an area of 8 50 km2 according to the long term monitoring data of the water management authority office ansbach the thermal stratification period extends from may until the end of october lake turnover typically begins in november the lake has an intermediate level of productivity and is classified as mesotrophic the average annual total nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations over lake depth are 0 95 and 0 025 mg l 1 respectively the experimental site was situated at the border of a nature reserve located on the southwestern side of the lake fig 1 the water depth at the mesocosm site varied between 10 and 12 m depending on the season and extraction for water supply 2 2 mesocosm setup the mesocosm setup aquatic research instruments usa consisted of a round 12 m deep and 3 m diameter impermeable polyethylene plastic enclosure with 80 light transmittance reinforced with nylon fibers figs 2 and s1 the enclosure was fitted with side loops at 3 m intervals to stabilize the mesocosm the upper end of the mesocosm was fitted with a 3 m diameter ring buoy constructed from a foam filled corrugated drain pipe the bottom of the enclosure was fixed to the sediment layer using 5 20 kg concrete ballasts the enclosure was freely open from the top but partially sealed from the bottom with a mesh the mesocosm was lowered slowly into the lake before the mesh was installed shortly after the mesocosm no filling pumping was required a u shaped pontoon was fixed around the mesocosm and adopted as a platform for fixing the instruments the whole setup was anchored to the lake bed with 4 anchors and the ropes were tensioned to prevent the setup from drifting and rotating the mesocosm was deployed in may 2021 and left for two months to allow the water column to equilibrate with the surrounding lake water before conducting the first experiment 2 3 microplastic particles in this work we exclusively used microspheres due to the limited availability of fluorescent microplastic with irregular or fibrous forms all microspheres were supplied by cospheric llc in green fluorescence dry powder the fluorescent dye had maximum excitation and emission wave lengths of 414 and 514 nm respectively table 1 shows the polymers their densities particle sizes and the amounts of the microplastic used in each experiment the 1 5 µm particles were composed of a propriety polymer of unknown chemical structure whereas the larger particles were polyethylene with custom specific gravities aqueous microplastic solutions with concentrations of 1 0 g l 1 were prepared in the laboratory prior to each experiment due to the hydrophobic nature of cospheric particles the stock solutions were prepared using distilled water mixed with 0 1 g of surfactant tween 20 per 100 ml of stock solution this also prevented the microplastic from agglomerating or floating on the surface of the water while preparing the solution the solutions were then preserved in clean sealed buckets in a cool room before transportation to the lake four microplastic addition experiments were conducted in the mesocosm over one year from july 2021 to june 2022 the experimental dates were chosen carefully to capture lake stratification in summer as well as lake turnover in autumn three experiments were conducted during summer using 1 5 28 48 and 53 63 µm spherical fluorescence particles the summer experiments were aimed at investigating the effect of particle size and surface area to volume ratio on the residence time of the particles during thermal stratification the autumn experiment conducted using the 1 5 µm particles was aimed at quantifying the effect of lake turnover convection on the residence time of the particles in the mesocosm 2 4 microplastic addition to the mesocosm prior to each experiment the surface of the water inside the mesocosm was cleaned using fine nets the stock solutions were stirred in the buckets until all settled particles were resuspended and uniformly distributed in the solution the particles were then added as a pulse from the top of the mesocosm simultaneously by two persons using two metal watering cans fitted with wide sprinklers to ensure a uniform distribution of the microplastic at the surface of the mesocosm fig s2 the watering cans and sprinklers were carefully rinsed using lake water to ensure that all microplastic were flushed into the mesocosm the particle additions are estimated to have lasted a maximum of five minutes 2 5 field measurements water temperatures were measured in the center of the mesocosm for the duration of the experiments using hobo tidbit temperature loggers at 1 m intervals and with a sampling resolution of 30 min temperature profiles were also taken outside the mesocosm before the start of each experiment and compared with the temperatures in the mesocosm the temperature data were used to infer the stability and stratification of the water column and to define the epilimnion and metalimnion a 3d acoustic doppler velocimeter adv nortek vector 300 was used to measure 3d water velocities inside the mesocosm and infer turbulent kinetic energy and turbulent diffusion the adv was fixed in the center of the mesocosm at 1 m below the water surface the instrument was set to sample at burst intervals of 600 s with 100 samples per burst at 8 hz the adv was set to detect flow velocities in the east north up enu directions in a sampling volume of 1 5 cm3 the instrument is equipped with a magnetometer and tilt sensors to correct measured velocities for movement of the instrument in the water column the fluorescent microplastic was measured in the center of the mesocosm using submersible field fluorometers ggun fl24 from albillia bailly comte et al 2018 the fluorometers used an excitation wavelength of 470 nm to excite the green microplastic particles and the fluorescent intensity was measured in the uranine channel the fluorometers were calibrated in the laboratory following the same procedures as presented in boos et al 2021 at least 8 calibration points were used the only difference to boos et al 2021 is that calibration solutions were prepared using filtered lake water rather than distilled water the calibrations are presented in fig s3 the minimum detection limits of the 1 5 28 48 and 53 63 µm particles were approximately 2 100 and 200 µg l 1 respectively the fluorometers were less sensitive to the 28 48 and 53 63 µm microspheres due to the lower particle numbers per gram microplastic and higher scattering in the measuring cell fig s3 the measurement frequency of the fluorometers in the mesocosm was selected according to the expected residence times of the particles based on their laminar settling velocities thus the sampling interval was fixed at 2 and 120 s for the large fast and the small slow particles respectively during lake stratification the fluorometers were positioned at 0 5 m below the water surface the epilimnion metalimnion interface and 1 m from the bottom of the mesocosm during lake turnover in autumn the fluorometers were only positioned at 0 5 m below the water surface and 1 m over lake sediment 2 6 microplastic settling velocity in this work we have used three characteristic settling velocities for the microplastic particles firstly the settling velocities of the 28 48 and 53 63 µm particles were measured in the laboratory under laminar conditions using particle image velocimetry system piv the measured velocities were then corrected to the water temperature of each lake compartment in the mesocosm the corrected settling velocities were denoted as vs piv l t 1 secondly due to the limitations of our piv system it was not possible to measure the settling velocity of the particles in the range of 1 µm in the laboratory here we used stokes equation to calculate the settling velocity of the 1 5 µm particles as these particles were large enough that the brownian motion will not affect their settling but also small enough that the reynolds number would be 1 and so laminar conditions around the particle can be assumed i e in stokes range stokes velocity was denoted vs stokes l t 1 finally effective settling velocities for all microplastic particles were calculated using the experimental data from the mesocosm vs eff l t 1 the settling velocities of the large 28 48 and 53 63 µm microspheres were measured in the laboratory using the same two dimensional ila 5051 piv system used by elagami et al 2022 the system consists of a high speed camera 40 frames per second and a light source high power light emitting diodes with a wavelength of 530 nm the settling velocities were measured in a 10 cm x10 cm x 40 cm glass column filled with filtered lake water based on the design of khatmullina and isachenko 2017 the room temperature was kept constant at 20 c approximately 1 ml of the stock microplastic solution was added carefully at the top of the column as a pulse cloud the average settling velocity of each particle cloud was calculated based on the piv images the vs piv were corrected as in ghawi and kris 2012 using the water temperature of each lake compartment using eq s4 stokes settling velocities were calculated as 1 v s s t o k e s 2 9 ρ p ρ w μ g r 2 where ρ p m l 3 is the density of the particle ρ w m l 3 is the density of the lake water r l is the radius of the particle g l t 2 is the acceleration due to gravity and µ m l 1 t 1 is the dynamic viscosity of the water the effective settling velocities from the mesocosm experiments were calculated for all microplastic sizes by dividing the depth of each compartment i e epilimnion or metalimnion by the time required until 50 of the particles were lost from the compartment median particle breakthrough at the bottom of the compartment 2 v s e f f z τ 50 where z l is the depth of the compartment and τ50 t is the time elapsed until 50 of particles was lost from that compartment median residence time 2 7 hydrodynamic calculations the temperature data inside the mesocosm was used to calculate the rayleigh number to elucidate if natural convection occurred in the water column during the autumn experiment the rayleigh number was calculated according to eq 3 weeraratne and manga 1998 3 r a α g δ t z 3 ν β where α is the thermal expansion coefficient of water 210 10 6 c 1 g is the acceleration due to gravity δt c is the temperature difference between the bottom and top boundaries z is the thickness of the compartment ν l2 t 1 is the kinematic viscosity of water and β l2 t 1 is thermal diffusivity of water the 3d water velocity data were used to calculate the turbulence kinetic energy tke l2 t 2 in the mesocosm the time series for tke of each burst was calculated using eq 4 as in wüest and lorke 2003 4 tke 1 2 σ east 2 σ north 2 σ up 2 where σ east σ north and σ up l t 1 are the standard deviations of the fluctuations in velocity components during each burst the vertical component of the velocity data was also used to calculate the vertical eddy diffusivity d l2 t 1 for each burst since velocities were measured in the eulerian frame of reference where the flow moves past the velocity sensor fixed at 1 m below the water surface d can be estimated from taylor s approach using holtappels and lorke 2011 5 d w l e 6 l e 0 e r dr where w is the standard deviation of the vertical velocities l t 1 le l is the eulerian integral length scale er is the spatial correlation coefficient and r l is the spatial distance for simplification le l was assumed to be equal to the lagrangian length scale ll l as also done by holtappels and lorke 2011 hence d l2t 1 was calculated as follows 7 d w l l 8 l l w t l 9 t l 0 r l d τ where tl t is the lagrangian time scale rl is the lagrangian velocity autocorrelation and τ t is the time interval between two velocity measurements 0 125 s 2 8 calculation of residence times in the mesocosm the residence time of the microplastic in each compartment was calculated as the delay between the time required for 95 of the microplastics to be lost from the compartment and the time of microplastic input to that compartment for instance the residence time in the epilimnion τepi t was calculated as the difference between the time required until 95 of the particles were lost from the epilimnion and the time when the microplastic was added to the mesocosm the residence time in the metalimnion τmeta t was calculated as the delay between the time where 95 of the particles was lost from the metalimnion and the start of the pulse detected by the fluorometer positioned at the epilimnion metalimnion interface during lake turnover in the autumn the mesocosm was treated as one mixed compartment and thus the residence time was calculated for the whole mesocosm τtot t the total residence times in the mesocosm during autumn and summer experiments were calculated as the difference between the time required until 95 of the particles passed the deepest fluorescence detector and the time of adding the microplastic to the mesocosm 2 9 modeling of microplastic sinking trajectories and residence times particle sinking trajectories and residence times in the mesocosm were modeled using a lagrangian particle tracking technique based on the huret et al 2007 visser 1997 scheme which was later modified and applied by rowe et al 2016 and ross 2006 to simulate the vertical distribution of bacteria and plankton under turbulent conditions in lakes the effect of turbulent motion on particle trajectories and residence times in the water column is represented by a 1d random walk assuming a vertically heterogeneous turbulence field 10 z t δ t z t v s δ t d z t δ t r 2 d z δ t r where the vertical particle trajectory z t δt l for a time increment δt t can be estimated based on the current particle location z t l the depth specific

surface ds was estimated using the taylor s approach based on the adv data diffusivities at the interface to the metalimnion and the lake bottom were estimated by fitting the measured particle curves at each depth to an advection dispersion model a d the a d model represents an analytical solution to the one dimensional advection dispersion equation for a semi infinite system with an instantaneous injection of a tracer in our case microplastic particles in the fluid flux kreft and zuber 1978 małoszewski and zuber 1982 from the a d fitting the depth specific peclet number pe vsz d can be derived relating the effect of gravitational settling and turbulent diffusion for a specific depths z where microplastic concentrations were measured ross 2006 d values can then be derived from the pe number using the settling velocity i e vs stokes vs piv vs eff a detailed description of the a d fitting procedure is provided as part of the supplementary information each breakthrough experiment was represented using 2500 particles in the random walk simulations all parameters used to run the random walk model are provided in the supplementary information s5 3 results 3 1 mesocosm temperature profiles the measurements at the start of the experiments showed that the water column inside and outside the mesocosm were near to identical and during summer was thermally stratified and divided into an epilimnion and metalimnion fig s6 the water temperatures inside the mesocosm for the duration of the experiments are shown in fig 3 the thickness of the epilimnion inside the mesocosm over the extent of the experiments were 8 9 and 6 m for the first second and third summer experiment respectively fig 3 the thickness of the metalimnion during the three summer experiments were 3 2 and 4 m the water temperatures varied between 18 and 25 c for the epilimnion and 12 to 14 c for the metalimnion prior to and during the autumn experiment the temperature tended to be warmer at depth than at the surface figs 3d and s6 the differences between the lower the warmer and the upper the cooler layer inside and outside the mesocosm at the start of the experiment were 0 8 and 0 85 c respectively fig s6 also the average temperature difference between the lower and the upper layer inside the mesocosm during the whole autumn experiment was 0 8 c over an extent of 11 m the rayleigh number eq 3 was calculated to investigate the propensity for natural convection in the mesocosm the time series for the rayleigh numbers is presented in fig s7 the minimum rayleigh number was 4 1012 considerably exceeding the critical value of 1700 reid and harris 1958 the rayleigh number also indicated that the convection was turbulent ra 109 3 2 turbulence kinetic energy there were substantial fluctuations in the tke in the epilimnion during summer experiments especially for the experiment with the 1 5 µm particles fig 4 the maximum values for tke during the summer experiments were 2 7 10 3 5 10 3 and 6 6 10 3 m2 s 2 for the first second and third experiments respectively the average tke values were 3 5 10 4 5 10 4 and 1 10 4 m2 s 2 during autumn however the fluctuations in the tke values were much lower showing much flatter tke time series than that during summer experiments the maximum and the average tke values during autumn were 1 8 10 4 and 2 10 5 m2 s 2 respectively 3 3 microplastic concentrations in the mesocosm fig 5 a b and c show the abundance and distribution of the microplastic in the mesocosm during the summer experiments the maximum microplastic concentrations measured at 0 5 m were approximately 15 11 mg l 1 and 400 µg l 1 during the first 53 60 µm second 28 48 µm and third 1 5 µm experiments respectively the maximum concentrations at the epilimnion metalimnion interface were approximately 10 5 mg l 1 and 200 µg l 1 during the first second and third experiments at the bottom of the metalimnion the maximum microplastic concentrations were approximately 2 7 mg l 1 and 50 µg l 1 for the first second and third experiments the time required until 95 of the particles was lost from the epilimnion τepi was 0 8 1 9 and 19 5 days for the first second and third summer experiments fig 5 for the metalimnion τmeta was 0 6 1 4 and 22 days for the first second and third experiments fig 5 the total residence times in the mesocosm were 1 2 5 and 24 7 days the measured particle concentrations during autumn are presented in fig 5d surprisingly the upper and the lower pulses showed an overlap of 1 day the maximum microplastic concentration detected by the upper fluorometer was 80 µg l 1 the lower pulse was divided into large initial and small subsequent pulses with maximum concentrations of 55 and 25 µg l 1 respectively the time until 95 of the particles had passed the lowest detector 1 m over lake sediment τtot 1 9 days 3 4 settling velocity table 2 shows the values of the characteristic settling velocities vs stokes vs piv and vs eff used in the random walk model for the 1 5 µm particles the lowest velocities were estimated using stokes law 0 079 m d 1 while the highest settling velocities were the vs eff 1 09 m d 1 also for the 53 63 µm particles vs eff was the highest 50 m d 1 while vs piv was the lowest 17 m d 1 in contrast for the 28 48 µm particles vs piv was the highest 8 7 m d 1 while vs eff was the lowest 0 16 m d 1 3 5 eddy diffusivity the a d fitting routine provided estimates for the turbulent diffusivities that were comparable to those derived using taylor s approach and the adv data for the summer experiments using the 1 5 µm particles supplementary information s8 the turbulent diffusivities ranged between dh 1 12 10 6 and ds 6 7 10 6 m² s 1 table s9 for the summer experiments using 28 48 and 53 63 µm the a d fitting was less successful so that the random walk modeling relied primarily on d values derived from taylors approach this ranged from 3 10 6 to 1 10 5 m2 s 1 depending on experiment and depth table s9 during autumn our modeling depended exclusively on the d values calculated from taylor s approach 3 6 random walk model the random walk model was run using the three different settling velocities vs stokes vs piv and vs eff depending on the experiment being simulated the distribution in residence times of the individual simulated particles i e microplastic residence time distribution where then used to calculate the time until 95 of particles had passed a specified depth in the water column this is defined as the virtual microplastic residence time the simulations using v s stokes summer experiment 1 5 µm are shown in fig 6 and have a rapid rise as the particle pulse reaches the measurement depth and then a long tail as particles are transported by a combination of settling and turbulence from the water column the simulated residence times were considerably longer than the measured values with 135 days for the first 0 5 m 225 days for the epilimnion 6 m and 239 days for the whole mesocosm water column 10 m when using vs eff for the same model run the simulated microplastic residence times of the 1 5 µm particles in summer were similar to that inferred from microplastic concentrations in the mesocosm fig 7 all distributions showed the characteristic shape of the a d model with a fast increase a local maxima and a slowly decaying tail the only parts that could not accurately be represented by the random walk model were the initial peak in particle concentrations at 0 5 m and the rapidly decaying tails at 0 5 and 10 m depth fig 7 using vs eff the residence times were 4 days for 0 5 m 11 days for the epilimnion 6 m and 32 days for the whole 10 m water column results from simulations for the 28 48 and 53 63 µm particles in summer and the 1 5 µm particles in autumn experiment are summarized in table 3 as the vs eff method did not work well for the larger particle sizes 28 48 µm due to a noisy signal from the detectors the random walk simulations for this size class were parameterized using vs piv the results show that while the random walk model can reproduce the measured residence times for the larger particles relatively well e g 0 8 vs 0 62 days for the 53 63 µm particles it significantly overestimated the residence times for the small particles in the autumn experiments independent of the settling velocity used 2 vs 17 225 days 4 discussions microplastic abundance in lake systems is associated with negative impacts on lake organisms and ecosystem functioning aljaibachi and callaghan 2018 d avignon et al 2022 uptake from the water column by organisms such as filter feeders is highly dependent on the residence time in the water column and particularly in the epilimnion where most organisms reside several factors such as particle size polymer density water temperature and lake hydrodynamics affect the residence times of microplastic waldschläger and schüttrumpf 2019 elagami et al 2022 ahmadi et al 2022 these factors coupled with the abundance of microplastic in lakes control the uptake probability of microplastic by lake organisms and their potential transfer through the food web d avignon et al 2022 nelms et al 2018 the temperature gradient and thus the strong density gradient during lake stratification formed a very stable water column inside the mesocosm the water column was divided into a turbulent epilimnion and a more or less laminar metalimnion this shows maximum tke values at the 1 m below the water surface top of the epilimnion of 2 7 10 3 5 10 3 and 6 6 10 3 m2 s 2 for the first second and third experiments respectively the major source of the high tke in the surface layer during turbulent mixing is likely to be the wind cannon et al 2021 singh et al 2019 the waves in the lake impacting directly on the mesocosm walls and the platform could also have contributed to the relatively high tke in the surface layer the d values calculated from the a d fitting for the 1 5 µm particles during summer experiments table s10 were similar to those calculated from adv data and taylor s approach 10 6 m2 s 1 the calculated ds dm and dh values were in a similar range but at the lower end of typical d values in stratified lakes 10 7 to 10 2 m2 s 2 wüest and lorke 2009 in contrast to the summer experiments the average temperature difference between the bottom part of the mesocosm and the water surface was 0 8 c this temperature difference and subsequently the density difference combined with the 11 m depth of the water column and the temperature fluctuations in the water column resulted in a highly unstable water column this instability resulted in rayleigh numbers 1012 which were significantly higher than the critical values for convection suggesting that the water column was mixed by turbulent convection the maximum tke values at 1 m below the water surface during this period was one order of magnitude lower than that during summer 1 8 10 4 m2 s 2 the major source of tke is convection during autumn which results in the sinking of the upper cool water parcels finally the calculated d values in autumn in the range of 10 7 m2 s 1 were considerably lower than during the summer and at the lower end of the compilation of d values in wüest and lorke 2009 microplastic concentrations were affected by the hydrodynamic conditions in the mesocosm for instance the maximum microplastic concentrations in the mesocosm water column during summer were 5 times higher than that in autumn for the same 1 5 µm particles fig 5c and d the distribution of microplastic inside the mesocosm was also affected by season unlike the summer experiment the upper pulse at 0 5 m below water surface and the lower pulse at 1 m over the sediment during autumn experiment had an overlap of 1day fig 5c and d furthermore the fluorometer at 1 m over the lake sediment detected two subsequent microplastic pulses during the autumn experiment the maximum concentration of the two pulses at 1 m over sediment were 55 and 25 µg l 1 surprisingly however the measurements suggest that turbulent convection seemed to be not strong enough to start resuspension of the settled microplastic as neither fluorometer detected any microplastic after the end of the pulse these differences between microplastic behaviors during summer and autumn experiments are to be attributed to the instability in the water column that likely led to turbulent convective mixing and rapid microplastic transport within the mesocosm as also found by elagami et al 2022 the microplastic residence times were significantly affected by the size of the particles in the stratified water column when increasing the particle size from 28 48 to 53 63 the residence time in the whole column decreased by 2 5 times by comparing the residence times in the mesocosm for the particle group 1 5 µm during summer thermal stratification with that during autumn lake turnover the total residence time in summer was 13 times longer than that during autumn we suspect that the instability of the lake water column during lake turnover which resulted in the onset of lake convection and fast transport of the microplastic to the lake sediment also during lake turnover organic materials cyanobacteria and iron particles could resuspend and attach to the microplastic particles either increasing their density or building aggregates both of which would increasing their settling velocity and reducing residence time in the mesocosm d avignon et al 2022 this shows that in addition to size complex lake hydrodynamics can play a critical role in microplastic transport especially for the smallest particle sizes the simulated residence times using the random walk model differed from the actual residence times in the mesocosm especially for the simulations using vs stokes for the smallest particle sizes tables 2 and 3 the simulated residence time of the 1 5 µm particles in summer using vs stokes was 10 times higher than the actual residence time in the mesocosm table 3 this could be due to the interaction with natural particles existing in the lake schmidtmann et al 2022 or the agglomeration of the microplastic particles in the mesocosm caused by the large surface area to volume ratio and the surface charge of the small microplastic particles such aggregates are large and likely to have higher settling velocities compared to the individual pristine microplastic particles used in stokes model the simulated residence times during summer of the 1 5 µm particles using vs eff 32 days were very close to the actual residence times in the mesocosm 24 days this is due to vs eff and d being derived directly from the mesocosm data as such vs eff implicitly incorporates processes influencing settling velocities in the mesocosm such as particle microplastic interactions and hydrodynamic conditions such processes are not included in the laminar settling velocities in vs stokes or v piv the only part of the measured data that could not be represented by the random walk model for the 1 5 µm particles during summer using vs eff were the peak height and the rapidly decaying tail of the pulse at 0 5 m below the water surface as well as the width of the pulse at the bottom of the metalimnion fig 7 this is likely due to the simplified way the random walk represents the complexities of real world microplastic transport particularly that the model assumes one dimensional transport and uses predefined and stationary d values in reality the tke time series shows that the turbulent strength is transient and likely depends many interrelated factors such as winds currents and waves that impact on the mesocosm for the summer experiments using the large 28 48 and 53 63 µm particles the simulated residence times using vs piv values were comparable to the actual residence times in the mesocosm with a difference of 1 4 and 1 9 times this is likely to be attributed to the faster sinking velocities and relatively lower surface area of the large particles which subsequently reduces the potential particle microplastic interactions and aggregation formation with organic matter e g live and dead phytoplankton inside the mesocosm during autumn the modeled residence times of the 1 5 µm particles were considerably longer than those derived from the mesocosm the simulation results using vs stokes and vs eff were 113 and 8 8 times higher than the actual residence time respectively these significant differences are likely due to the complex hydrodynamic conditions caused by the high instability in the lake water column and particularly the initiation of natural convection which cannot be represented by the simplified lake physics used in the random walk model also the complex biological and chemical processes occurring in the lake water during lake turnover d avignon et al 2022 are not included in the model this shows that the processes controlling microplastic settling velocities and residence times in lake systems during highly unstable hydrodynamic conditions need to be more deeply studied in future research the residence times calculated from the mesocosm experiments are considered more realistic than residence times calculated based on previous modeling or laboratory experiments as mesocosm experiments more closely represent the complexities existing in lake systems however the conditions in the mesocosm are still likely to be quite different from a real lake this could be due to several factors such as the boundary effect of the mesocosm walls the small surface area of the mesocosm exposed to wind 7 m2 and the isolation of the water inside the mesocosm from the rest of the lake this will limit the size of turbulent eddies that can develop in the water column and the influence of other hydrodynamic processes such as seiches and currents that only develop in lake basins we also noticed that the productivity in the mesocosm was higher than in the surrounding lake making the likelihood and effect of interactions with plankton larger than in the große brombachsee also there were some limitations caused by the field instruments for example microplastic concentrations and residence times were calculated depending solely on the signals detected in the measuring cells of the fluorometers with the best case being measurements at three depths this resulted in a lack of knowledge about the behavior of the microplastic particles over the extent of the entire water column in addition our understanding of the hydrodynamics inside the water column depended largely on the velocity measurements by the adv at a single point fixed at 1 m below the water surface this also limits our understanding of the hydrodynamic conditions over the entire extent of the water column finally we exclusively used microspheres and only two polymer types in all experiments we believe that irregular particles would have longer residence time than perfect spheres due to the increase in the drag forces exerted on the irregular particles compared to spheres however we think that particle shape and roundness would have less effect on the residence time of microplastic than that of density and size ahmadi et al 2022 we also believe that the polymer type can affect the residence time for instance particles from biodegradable polymers may attach fine air bubbles in the lake water column increasing buoyancy and thus having a longer residence time compared to non biodegradable polymers elagami et al 2022 5 conclusion previous studies investigating microplastic behavior in lake systems have used simplified laboratory settings to estimate microplastic transport here we have attempted to address the real complexity of transport in lakes by adopting a combination of complex in lake mesocosm experiments with random walk modeling to quantify microplastic residence times and understand the underlying processes controlling microplastic transport in the lake water column the experiments were conducted over of one year capturing thermal stratification and lake turnover and the associated complex chemical biological and hydrodynamic conditions high end techniques were used to infer microplastic residence times and lake hydrodynamics our results quantified for the first time the effect of particle size and lake hydrodynamics on the residence time in conditions close to that in real lake systems the limitations of the model have highlighted where real lake microplastic transport processes are more complex than pure physical transport based on sinking and turbulent diffusion our field experiments have confirmed that particle size has a significant impact on the residence time during stratified summer conditions the small microplastic particles had considerably longer mesocosm residence times than large particles however the residence times of these small particles were still 1 to 2 orders of magnitude shorter than predicted by a random walk model parameterized using the stokes sinking velocities and turbulent dispersivities from the mesocosm this was thought to be due to complex processes such as aggregation of the microplastic with existing lake particulate matter agglomeration and potentially the interactions with biota lake hydrodynamics driven by seasonal temperature changes affected the residence time and distribution of microplastic in the mesocosm in autumn the microplastic residence times during lake turnover were significantly shorter than during the summer experiment and the random walk simulations using the velocities calculated from the mesocosm data and stokes calculations it is thought that this was induced by the initiation of turbulent convection and associated complex biological chemical and hydrodynamic conditions in the water column this shows that the behavior of microplastic in real lake systems and the uptake probability by lake biota such as zooplankton is still poorly understood future work needs to quantitatively incorporate processes such as heteroaggregation biofouling and uptake by lake organisms as well as lake hydrodynamics to quantitatively understand microplastic residence times and associated ecological effects of microplastic in these sensitive environments author contribution statement he

15272,the real time control rtc of urban drainage systems can make full use of the capabilities of existing infrastructures to mitigate combined sewer overflow cso and urban flooding despite the benefits of rtc it may encounter potential risks and failures which need further consideration to enhance its robustness besides failures of hardware components such as sensors and actuators the rtc performance is also sensitive to communication failures between the devices that are spatially distributed in a catchment scale system this paper proposes a decentralized control strategy based on multi agent reinforcement learning to enhance communication robustness and coordinate the decentralized control agents through centralized training to investigate different control structures a centralized and a fully decentralized strategy are also developed based on reinforcement learning rl for comparison a benchmark drainage model and a real world drainage model are formulated as two cases and the control agents are trained to control the orifices or pumps for cso or flooding mitigation in each case the three rl strategies reduce the cso volume by 5 62 9 30 compared with a static baseline in historical rainfalls of the benchmark case and reduce the cso and flooding volume by 14 39 21 36 compared with currently used rule based control in synthetic rainfalls of the real world case benefitting from centralized training the decentralized agents can achieve similar performance to the centralized agent the decentralized control also enhances the communication robustness with smaller performance loss than the centralized control when observation communication fails and provides a robust backup at the local level to limit the uncertainties when action commands from the centralized agent are lost the results and findings indicate that multi agent rl contributes to a coordinated and robust solution for rtc of urban drainage systems graphical abstract image graphical

in the repository https github com zhiyu014 marl uds 1 introduction under the pressure of urbanization and climate change problems with the urban drainage system uds exist such as urban flooding and combined sewer overflow cso which results in unexpected environmental damage to receiving water owolabi et al 2022 real time control rtc has been proven as an efficient method for cso mitigation under the background of smart cities balla et al 2022 van der werf et al 2022 equipped with sensors and flow control actuators rtc can make full use of the storage and conveying capacities of uds through real time decisions and operations schütze et al 2004 as machine learning shows promising potential in urban drainage management troutman et al 2017 garzón et al 2022 reinforcement learning rl has been also implemented as an artificial intelligence method to control combined sewer networks tian et al 2022a and stormwater networks mullapudi et al 2020 with much smaller real time computational burden than widely used model predictive control the performance of rtc systems is exposed to potential threats from functioning failures in sensors actuators and also communication between different components the actuator failure is the major threat to the drainage system as blocked gates are unable to change their settings and broken pumps cannot discharge water anymore leading to increased cso or flooding volume directly garofalo et al 2017 van der werf et al 2022 the sensor error is also concerned with the robustness of rl control systems and existing literature has examined the abilities of rl agents to handle systematic and random information uncertainties such as data drifting and forecast error saliba et al 2020 zhang et al 2022 in addition rtc controllers need to keep connected with sensors to track the hydraulic states of the drainage network and send online control signals to local actuators concerning the real time requirements the control performance is sensitive to communication failures in both observation and action processes especially in centralized control systems that rely on extensive wireless communication networks van der werf et al 2022 possible solutions could be data filling techniques or local backup settings when observation or action information is lost palmitessa et al 2021 but additional efforts should be made to enhance communication robustness from the perspective of the control architecture in the centralized control structure an agent receives global information and controls multiple actuators which are spatially distributed in a drainage system centralized rl algorithms are reported effective in mitigating urban flooding risk zhang et al 2022 reducing cso volume tian et al 2022b and decreasing total suspended solids export bowes et al 2022 despite the potential optimality of centralized rl it relies on large scale data transmission and remote control in real time and there is possible information loss or delay during the communication process directly applying the overall decision making process to decide the set points of local actuators may be vulnerable to communication failure between the control center and local actuators mollerup et al 2017 decentralized control excludes a specific control center and each decentralized agent controls the local actuator with small information integration the relatively simple architecture of local control limits possible threats from communication failure some studies on the rtc of stormwater systems focused on the local control of an independent structure eulogi et al 2021 the lack of coordination may be the main drawback as there are non negligible relationships among distributed controllable subsystems in a catchment scale uds local controllers are scalable and shown effective in practical implementations but simple heuristic procedures like if then and fuzzy rules are not enough and there is potential for general performance enhancement with further coordination and more advanced control strategies multi agent reinforcement learning marl is a field of rl aimed at solving decentralized problems with partial observations and has been applied in unmanned aerial vehicles cluster control pham et al 2018 autonomous driving shalev shwartz et al 2016 and wastewater treatment plants control chen et al 2021 this paper proposes a decentralized control strategy for flooding and cso reduction based on a marl algorithm to coordinate distributed actuators following the centralized training and decentralized execution framework wang et al 2021 the controlled drainage network is modeled as a multi agent system in which each rl agent uses a neural network to decide control policies with partial real time observations independently and all the agents are trained centrally with global operation records different from distributed control that relies on explicit neighbor communication between actuators garofalo et al 2017 maiolo et al 2020 there is no real time communication between rl agents in this work but they are coordinated through offline global training which can be regarded as implicit communications fully centralized and decentralized control structures are also established in this paper using rl algorithms for comparison the rl agents are developed in a benchmark drainage model to control the outflow orifices of four tanks in case 1 and also implemented in a real world model to control two pumping stations in case 2 the robustness of different rl structures is also evaluated in communication failure scenarios to our knowledge this is the first attempt of marl for decentralized control of the uds 2 methodology in this section a cooperative marl algorithm called value decomposition network vdn sunehag et al 2018 is introduced for the real time control of the uds another two rl algorithms single agent deep q learning network dqn and independent q learning iql are also implemented for comparison to represent the fully centralized and fully decentralized control respectively the basic architectures training methods rtc formulations and robustness evaluation of the three value based rl algorithms are illustrated in this section 2 1 reinforcement learning in reinforcement learning control the uds is formulated as the environment controlled by rl agents in value based rl algorithms agents get observations o t from the environment and generate action values through an action value function q o t a t which is formed as a neural network the action a t with the largest value is chosen to control the actuator in the environment which gives a reward r t as feedback mnih et al 2015 to achieve promising control performance the agent is trained through q learning to estimate an action value function q o t a t defined as the expected sum of future rewards to evaluate the value of action a t with observation o t as eq 1 1 q o t a t e o t a t k 0 γ k r t k o t a t q o t a t α r t γ max a a q o t 1 a q o t a t where γ is the discount factor k is the future time step a is the action space and e o t a t represents the expectation when action a t is taken under the observation o t after training the action value function q o t a t with rewards r t the developed agent can estimate the performance of each action and conduct the best action with the largest action value a t argmax a a q o t a given the observation o t 2 2 multi agent reinforcement learning algorithms to deal with the decentralized control problem of multi actuators one direct idea is to train a central agent using q learning with all the information as the input and all the action values as the output as established in mullapudi et al 2020 it is an extension of the deep q network dqn to a multi agent system another option is a decentralized control approach independent q learning iql which separates the environment into several parts controlled by multiple individual agents tampuu et al 2017 each iql agent is formed as a single q network which decides the control policy of its actuator using the local observations and gets trained with the reward independently following the multi agent control structure of iql the value decomposition network vdn provides a different training method in which a summation layer connects the individual action value functions q i o t a t of all the agents to estimate the joint action value function q t o t o t a t in eq 2 sunehag et al 2018 2 q t o t o t a t q t o t o t 1 o t 2 o t n a t 1 a t 2 a t n i 1 n q i o t i a t i where q i is the estimation of the local action value q i that only depends on the local observations and actions the neural networks are trained together with the summation layer to ensure a consistent update target and establish the potential coordination for all the agents dqn iql and vdn establish one or several rl agents to control the environment and the structures of the agents are formulated in fig 1 the action value function is estimated through a neural network which uses observations as the input action values as the output the fully connected hidden layers include a multi layer perceptron mlp and a dueling layer wang et al 2016 the dqn agent receives the global observations and decides the actions of all the actuators so it has only one but a larger network with more neurons in each layer than the agents of iql and vdn vdn uses the same agent structure as iql in the control process but updates the joint action value q t o t in the training method while each iql agent updates its action value q i independently 2 3 training method the training process lasts thousands of episodes and each of them consists of two steps interaction and update in the interaction process of each episode agents explore different actions through step by step simulation of the uds under all the training rainfall events the control actions a t a t i i n are generated with observations o t through epsilon greedy by each agent as eq 3 and fig 1 3 a t rando m a a a i f rando m p u 0 1 p ε arg max a a q o t a e l s e where the probability ε is initialized as 1 and decays exponentially in episodes p is a real number that follows the uniform distribution u 0 1 the agents conduct random actions to explore more choices in early episodes as the training process goes on the agents are more likely to choose actions with the largest q value after the actions a t change the settings of the actuators in time step t the environment provides the observations o t 1 in the next time step and the reward r t through simulation and evaluation the operation records of the entire rainfall event o t a t r t o t 1 t t are collected and restored in the experience replay buffer as the transition data the oldest data are discarded if the buffer is full the update process is to minimize the loss value by updating the parameters of the neural networks through gradient descent a mini batch of transition data o j a j r j o j j m is randomly sampled from the replay buffer to calculate the future discounted reward y j and the loss value l through mean squared error dqn and iql define the loss function using the traditional deep q learning method for each agent mnih et al 2015 dqn only needs to update the central agent using the loss function l eq 4 while the neural network q i of each iql agent gets updated individually by minimizing its loss function l i eq 5 as for vdn since the q i values of the agents add up to the joint action value q t o t the loss function is designed using q t o t as eq 6 4 l 1 m j 1 m y j q o j a j 2 1 m j 1 m r j γ m a x a a q o j a q o j a j 2 5 l i 1 m j 1 m y j q i o j i a j i 2 1 m j 1 m r j γ m a x a a q i o j i a q i o j i a j i 2 6 l 1 m j 1 m y j q tot o j a j 2 1 m j 1 m r j γ q tot o j a j q tot o j a j 2 1 m j 1 m r j γ i 1 n max a a q i o j i a i 1 n q i o j i a j i 2 where q o j a j is the action value of dqn and q i o j i a j i is the action value of each iql or vdn agent the target action value is estimated and maximized through the next observations o j and the target networks q i and q which have the same structures as the original value networks and get updated with them per episode each sample j has a reward value r j that depends on the system state o j and the action a j and the reward function r o a is defined concerning the control objectives m is the batch size through minimizing the loss function l with gradients l θ i the parameters θ i of value networks of the agents are updated fig 2 shows the interaction and update process of vdn for example dqn and iql adopt the same interaction process as fig 2 but differ in the update mechanisms as stated before 2 4 multi agent reinforcement learning control for urban drainage systems the rtc problem of the uds is formulated with real time information water level rainfall monitoring as observations multiple flow control devices pumps valves or orifices as actuators and the cso or flooding reduction as control objectives rainfall monitoring is not considered as the observation of rl the simulation model of the uds is formulated as the environment e with a real time data interface to get observations and execute control actions during the modeling process each control agent is designed as a neural network which calculates action values with real time information and implements the action with the maximum value as actions are conducted in the simulation model hydraulic characteristics are adjusted to balance the drainage loads in the uds the evaluation of the control objective provides the rewards r t as the feedback to show the goodness of control actions the three control strategies differ in the control and training structures in the online control process dqn deploys a centralized agent which uses global information to decide the actions of all the actuators both iql and vdn use decentralized agents at the storage tanks to control the orifices or pumps with partial observations in the offline training process dqn updates the central agent with a trainer using global data and the iql agents are trained independently with limited information vdn gathers the information of all the decentralized agents in a centralized trainer through offline coordination to calculate the loss value and update their network parameters their control and training structures are shown in fig 3 2 5 communication robustness evaluation as sensors and actuators are spatially dispersed in the entire uds they rely on wireless telecommunication to connect with the control agent there are possibilities of communication failure or signal delay that observations are not accessible for the agent or the control signals cannot reach the actuators in real time therefore the robustness of different structures needs evaluation in communication failure scenarios two communication processes are investigated including observations from sensors to agents and actions from agents to actuators in observation communication failure scenarios rl agents are assumed to use the previously received data as the observation when sensors are disconnected all the 3 rl structures may encounter observation communication failure as sensors are installed far away from the agent even for decentralized control iql and vdn in real world cases in action communication failure scenarios only the centralized control dqn suffers from the failure of control signals and local actuators are assumed to remain in the current setting if they have no backup strategies since communication may fail at any time and device it is assumed that there is a failure probability for each device in each control step 50 parallel experiments are simulated in each failure scenario with the probability δ between 10 and 90 the observations and actions in failure scenarios are determined in eq 7 and eq 8 7 o o b s t j o o b s t 1 j i f rando m p u 0 1 p δ o t j e l s e 8 a l o c t i a l o c t 1 i i f rando m p u 0 1 p δ a t i e l s e 9 δ x i x i x 0 x 0 where o o b s t j represents the observation for the agent o t j is the actual observation value from sensor j a l o c t i is the setting adopted at the local actuator i and a t i represents the control action decided by the centralized agent in step t the control effects such as the total cso volumes in failure scenarios x i are calculated and the results with perfect communication x 0 are provided as a reference to evaluate the performance loss rate as eq 9 to deal with action communication failure scenarios an integrated control structure is formulated with a central agent to control all the actuators remotely and multiple decentralized agents to take over at the local level as fig 4 a set of default settings or rules can also be applied locally the decentralized and default strategies are regarded as local backups to show their effects on the enhancement of action communication robustness 3 case study this section describes the basic information of a benchmark drainage model case 1 and a real world drainage model case 2 used in the experiments the simulation model of uds swmm rossman 2015 is regarded as the virtual environment for the case study in each case a real time control problem is formulated including observations action space and reward function 3 1 case 1 a benchmark drainage model the astlingen swmm model a benchmark combined sewer system established and calibrated by schütze et al 2018 and sun et al 2020 is used as a testbed of rl strategies there are six storage tanks with outflow orifices in the system and four of them are controllable fig 5 in this case the control target is to mitigate the cso volume that occurred at both tanks and overflow structures in table 1 the joint observation o t o t i p t i h i n t i h t i h o u t t i i n includes the monitored precipitation p t i the water level of upstream node h i n t i storage tank h t i and downstream node h o u t t i of each tank i in step t with 5 minute interval where n is the set of tanks each set p t i h i n t i h t i h o u t t i represents a set of partial observations at tank i the joint action is a t a t i a i n where a t i is the control action of the outflow orifice of the tank i each orifice has optional settings that are evenly spaced between the minimum and the maximum settings in the action space a as the opening percentages determined by the throttle flows schütze et al 2018 the baseline setting is calculated by the nominal throttle flow and used as the base case bc control following the objective function of model predictive control in sun et al 2020 the overflow to different receiving water bodies wwtp inflow and control roughness is considered in the reward function eq 10 10 r t 2 v f t creek v f t river 0 1 v in t wwtp 0 01 i n tanks v out t i v out t 1 i v in t where v f t c r e e k v f t r i v e r are the total cso volume into the creek and the river respectively v o u t t i is the outflow volume of the tank i and v i n t w w t p v i n t are the total inflow volume into the treatment plant and the entire system respectively in step t a larger weight is given to overflow to the creek which is more sensitive than the river the reward r t is evaluated for each control step the control performance of the agents is investigated in independent rainfall events which are extracted from 10 year measured rainfall series using a two hour inter event interval sun et al 2020 fifty rainfalls from 2000 to 2006 are randomly sampled as the training events and another event on 08 22 2006 is used as the validation event to show the actual performance enhancement during the training process all the rainfalls with precipitation between 5 mm and 15 mm are extracted from 2007 to 2009 as the testing rainfall events 3 2 case 2 a real world drainage model since the astlingen model is a hypothetical benchmark model the strategies are further applied in the simulation model of a real world drainage network in chaohu city in eastern china the drainage system has two storage tanks with sewage pumps and storm pumps the sewage pumps can transfer water from the tanks to the downstream system and finally into the wastewater treatment plant in rainy periods the storm pumps can discharge excess water to the river as the cso and the downstream system is sensitive to urban flooding as the chaohu swmm model was developed and used in our previous studies its details refer to liao et al 2019 and zhi et al 2019 the rl agents provide control policies for the two pumping stations cc and jk as shown in table 2 the observations contain precipitation p t water depths of the tanks h t i upstream h i n t i and downstream nodes h o u t t i and the cso volume in the recent step v c s o t which are obtained from the simulation model in each step the cc station has 2 sewage pumps overlapped in fig 6 and 2 storm pumps and the jk station has one sewage pump and 2 storm pumps the agents need to decide the number of sewage and storm pumps to turn on as the action a t i for both pumping stations in each 10 minute control step the control target is to minimize urban flooding and cso volume throughout the entire rainfall event and the pumping stations should be managed properly to avoid surcharge in the storage tanks for safety and overuse of pumps for energy saving therefore the reward function r t is designed with flooding r f l o o d i n g t t a n k r f l o o d i n g t s y s t e m cso r c s o t water depth r d e p t h t and pump energy consumption r e n e r g y t in each simulation step the reward function is formulated as eq 11 11 r t 5 r f l o o d i n g t t a n k 2 r f l o o d i n g t s y s t e m r c s o t 2 r d e p t h t 0 1 r e

the inflow flooding and cso volume of tank i in step t correspondingly v f t s y s t e m is the total flooding volume in the system flooding at the storage tanks is punished as eq 12 whereas eq 13 and eq 14 represent the trade off between flooding and cso h t i is the water depth in the current step and h m a x i is the full depth of tank i considering the latency in the rainfall runoff and hydraulic processes of the upstream system the precipitation p t δ t in step t δ t is used to separate dry and wet periods for the tanks δ t is set as 30 minutes to represent the concentration time in the upstream system of the tanks the agents are encouraged to store more water in the tanks when rainwater inflows into the tanks while larger rewards are provided to keep the depths low in dry periods as eq 15 the total pumping energy kwh is also considered as eq 16 and scaled to a similar magnitude the weights of the reward items are set in order of importance in eq 11 in case 2 the currently used heuristic control hc method is regarded as the baseline strategy in which the pumps are controlled by a set of startup and shutoff threshold values of water depths details of the two storage tanks and the current hc threshold values are shown in table 3 twenty different rainfall events with return periods between 1 and 5 are generated for training through chicago hyetograph keifer chu 1957 using random values of parameters in a sampling range see supplementary materials obtained from the regional intensity duration frequency curve to establish the environment swmm api pichler 2022 pyswmm mcdonnell et al 2020 and pystorms rimer et al 2021 are used as the data interface to manipulate project files obtain real time information and implement step by step control 4 results and discussion 4 1 training results to develop the three control strategies the control agents are trained through simulations under 50 historical rainfall events in case 1 and 20 synthetic rainfall events in case 2 the training processes last for 5 000 episodes through recursive interactions and updates as stated in section 2 3 in each episode agents control the system under all the training events to collect experience and are trained for 10 epochs with historical experience since the total rewards are obtained with random actions for exploration the actual control effects of the agents are evaluated under a validation event which is not used for training every 10 training episodes details of the network architecture hyperparameters and training rainfall events are provided in supplementary materials figs 7 and 8 prove that all three rl algorithms can develop the control performance of agents in both cases through efficient exploration and training as the total rewards of all the steps in training events increase with the episodes and the cso and flooding volumes of the validation event gradually decrease and converge in the validation rainfall dqn achieves the least cso in the latter stage of case 1 and converges first in case 2 whereas iql is not stable in case 1 with a slight increase of the cso and the total volume in case 2 is the largest of the three in the decentralized control structure centralized training enhances the coordination among the vdn agents to achieve better performance than the independent learning strategy iql vdn connects all the agents to ensure cooperation towards the same objective and consistent gradients in the update process the validation performance in figs 7 and 8 indicates that training is not stable with multiple independent learning agents as each iql agent is updated individually with the global reward and ignores mutual effects from other learning agents the focus on the reward increase through a single agent may be misleading since the reward affects all the agents independent training may cause the lazy agent problem in which each agent may avoid self enhancement due to others contributions to the same reward sunehag et al 2018 4 2 control effects evaluation after the training process completes the well developed agents that obtain the largest reward in the training process are implemented to control the actuators in real time various rainfall events are tested to evaluate the control effects of the 3 strategies together with a baseline scenario and none of the testing events are included in the training data the system maximum performance maxred of each rainfall event is also investigated as the upper bound of rtc through optimization of the entire control trajectory with an infinite horizon liao et al 2022 van der werf et al 2021 4 2 1 case 1 the general performance of rl strategies is compared under 101 testing rainfall events from 2007 to 2009 the rl strategies are also tested in the whole year 2000 to compare with the model predictive control mpc result in sun et al 2020 the summarized results are shown in fig 9 and detailed testing results are shown in the supplementary materials the left side of fig 9 indicates that vdn has a close cso reduction performance to dqn while iql takes third place in the testing rainfalls as for the receiving water of overflow rl strategies reduce the cso to the creek to nearly half of the bc and approaches the maximum potential and more stormwater overflow to the river which is less sensitive in the reward function eq 7 dqn is aware of the global state including the downstream tank t1 where cso to the river is the most likely to occur so dqn achieves less overflow to the river and less total volume than decentralized control iql and vdn in contrast vdn reduces the upstream cso to the more sensitive creek significantly but it has the largest cso to the river of the three strategies iql has the worst performance of the three due to the lack of coordination but it is still effective to balance the overflow to receiving water with different sensitivities compared with bc as all the agents are trained by using global rewards as the supervisory information rl strategies are proven effective in cso reduction but they cannot outperform mpc as the right side of fig 9 different from mpc rl agents control the actuators through reactions to the current observations without predictive information therefore they cannot provide the best decision for future changes in real time the avoidance of online optimization leads to a shorter response time than mpc but also limits the control performance in addition training with limited numbers of rainfall events makes rl agents hard to generalize continuous simulation in a whole year considering the deep uncertainties of rainfall dynamics larger training datasets may improve the generalization performance but the exploration exploitation dilemma exists and recursive simulations make the training process also time consuming 4 2 2 case 2 four rainfall events are designed with the return periods of 1 2 3 and 5 years and regional parameters from liao et al 2019 the cumulative flooding and cso volume of the three strategies dqn iql and vdn and two baselines hc and maxred are shown in fig 10 the control performance is also tested under 100 rainfall events generated using return periods between 1 and 5 fig 10 indicates that the three rl strategies dqn iql and vdn can mitigate both flooding and cso volume compared with hc the cso reduction is more significant because overflow is directly related to the use of storm pumps however it needs system coordination to mitigate flooding in the downstream system which occurs due to excess water from sewage pumps according to the 100 average results dqn performs the best and approaches the maximum potential in both flooding and cso whereas vdn is close to dqn in cso reduction iql seems to be the worst out of the three as it causes a large overflow volume even in relatively mild rainfall events such as rain 1 and rain 2 due to the overuse of storm pumps see supplementary materials for detailed control processes of the four rainfall events according to fig 11 the rl strategies are effective in energy saving which is considered in the reward function eq 11 large energy consumption comes from the overuse of pumps especially storm pumps with large capacities therefore the cso reduction also leads to a side effect of energy saving as dqn and vdn can avoid unnecessary energy consumption and excess overflow in relatively mild rainfall events such as rain 1 and rain 2 dqn uses sewage pumps the most fig 11 but the flooding volume is the least of the three fig 10 which indicates that dqn can discharge sewage water in proper time to avoid severe flooding in the downstream system 4 2 3 summary the reduction performance in the two cases is shown in table 4 where the total cso volume is used to calculate the rate in case 1 and the cso and flooding volume is used with respect to the control objective in case 2 table 4 indicates that the centralized strategy outperforms other rl structures in both cases and decentralized agents can also perform well after centralized training the rl strategies are more effective in case 2 to achieve a significant increase compared with the currently used control rules the results in training events are better than that in testing events but the difference is limited considering the gap in the maximum potential of training and testing events although rl is an advanced reactive control method its performance cannot reach maxred and predictive control needs to be considered to approach the best solution 4 3 communication robustness as the rtc system may encounter signal loss in both observation and action communication processes the control effects of rl strategies in communication failure scenarios are investigated in this section the experiments are established in rainfall events of case 1 and the robustness is evaluated through performance loss as eq 9 4 3 1 observation communication robustness the accumulated cso volumes of three rl strategies under different failure probabilities are shown in fig 12 it shows that the rl performance decays and becomes uncertain as the failure probability increases but the accumulated cso volumes do not exceed the baseline bc before the 90 failure scenario iql and vdn are less effective than dqn in perfect information baselines but their performance losses in failure scenarios are smaller against perfect baselines than dqn the control performance of vdn may increase with small failure probabilities in the 08 22 2007 event because agents may explore better control actions through random noise in the input of the neural network there is a case that the cso volumes of dqn exceed vdn in the same failure probability despite that dqn may achieve the least cso volume its reduction performance is sensitive to observation communication failures which are incidental for the centralized structure with spatially distributed sensors in a catchment scale system the reason may come from the agent structure as fig 1 indicates that dqn integrates all the observations and actions in a large neural network which may enlarge the information errors to affect the decisions of all the actuators and induce sensitive performance loss in fig 12 in contrast multiple vdn agents provide much redundancy as signal loss occurred in a single agent has no impact on the others 4 3 2 action communication robustness fig 13 shows that the lack of action commands causes large uncertainties and negative impacts on the performance of dqn as the dqn none plots become wider and higher with larger failure probabilities the control effects are more stable but not good enough if actuators adopt the bc settings as dqn bc when the connection is lost the comparison indicates that decentralized agents can act as an effective backup when the centralized dqn agent fails to connect with the actuators as the performance of dqn iql and dqn vdn gradually approach the perfect iql and vdn scenario when failure probabilities increase in all the 4 events there are possibilities that agents function better with better actions explored by the randomness from imperfect communication based on the results in fig 13 the integrated control structure fig 4 is necessary to enhance the communication robustness of rtc systems the results of dqn none indicate that control signal loss induces large uncertainties and may cause significant performance deterioration if there is no backup it is a regular method to handle the disconnection problem with dqn bc which returns to local control such as static settings or rule based strategies fig 13 proves that a simple backup is not enough and the multi agent system can do much better well trained decentralized agents take over the actuators to limit the performance loss and vdn outperforms iql to provide a better backup due to pre developed implicit coordination by combining decentralized and centralized control the integrated structure enhances the robustness towards communication failure 4 3 3 summary in a drainage network with multiple actuators the rtc system needs to be decomposed into different hierarchies at global and local levels to form a distributed control structure lund et al 2018 which can keep the system well functioning even though communication fails according to the results centralized control tends to be more vulnerable to communication failure whereas multiple decentralized agents form a more robust structure with a smaller failure probability and less impact from information loss as for the sensitivities to observation and action communication failure fig 12 shows that observation deficiencies cause a more significant decrease in the control performance as the agent may generate biased actions with information errors to influence the control process the influence of action command loss on dqn is quite uncertain in fig 13 because the actuators may be stuck in different settings before heavy rainfall which results in different overflow levels 5 conclusions this paper presents a decentralized real time control method for overflow and flooding reduction in two urban drainage systems based on multi agent reinforcement learning marl a centralized method and a fully decentralized method are also proposed to compare the control effects and communication robustness of reinforcement learning strategies with different structures based on the results in a benchmark model and a real world model the main conclusions are summarized as follows all three strategies can effectively reduce the overflow or flooding volume in rainfalls compared with the baseline strategies in both cases centralized training can enhance the overall coordination of decentralized agents to achieve better performance than independently trained agents although it may not outperform the centralized control strategy the decentralized structure can provide a robust and fail safe option for communication failures the observation deficiencies have less impact on decentralized agents whereas the centralized agent is vulnerable to information errors decentralized agents can provide an effective backup at the local level when actuators cannot receive control signals from the centralized agent in general the application of marl for decentralized

15272,the real time control rtc of urban drainage systems can make full use of the capabilities of existing infrastructures to mitigate combined sewer overflow cso and urban flooding despite the benefits of rtc it may encounter potential risks and failures which need further consideration to enhance its robustness besides failures of hardware components such as sensors and actuators the rtc performance is also sensitive to communication failures between the devices that are spatially distributed in a catchment scale system this paper proposes a decentralized control strategy based on multi agent reinforcement learning to enhance communication robustness and coordinate the decentralized control agents through centralized training to investigate different control structures a centralized and a fully decentralized strategy are also developed based on reinforcement learning rl for comparison a benchmark drainage model and a real world drainage model are formulated as two cases and the control agents are trained to control the orifices or pumps for cso or flooding mitigation in each case the three rl strategies reduce the cso volume by 5 62 9 30 compared with a static baseline in historical rainfalls of the benchmark case and reduce the cso and flooding volume by 14 39 21 36 compared with currently used rule based control in synthetic rainfalls of the real world case benefitting from centralized training the decentralized agents can achieve similar performance to the centralized agent the decentralized control also enhances the communication robustness with smaller performance loss than the centralized control when observation communication fails and provides a robust backup at the local level to limit the uncertainties when action commands from the centralized agent are lost the results and findings indicate that multi agent rl contributes to a coordinated and robust solution for rtc of urban drainage systems graphical abstract image graphical

in the repository https github com zhiyu014 marl uds 1 introduction under the pressure of urbanization and climate change problems with the urban drainage system uds exist such as urban flooding and combined sewer overflow cso which results in unexpected environmental damage to receiving water owolabi et al 2022 real time control rtc has been proven as an efficient method for cso mitigation under the background of smart cities balla et al 2022 van der werf et al 2022 equipped with sensors and flow control actuators rtc can make full use of the storage and conveying capacities of uds through real time decisions and operations schütze et al 2004 as machine learning shows promising potential in urban drainage management troutman et al 2017 garzón et al 2022 reinforcement learning rl has been also implemented as an artificial intelligence method to control combined sewer networks tian et al 2022a and stormwater networks mullapudi et al 2020 with much smaller real time computational burden than widely used model predictive control the performance of rtc systems is exposed to potential threats from functioning failures in sensors actuators and also communication between different components the actuator failure is the major threat to the drainage system as blocked gates are unable to change their settings and broken pumps cannot discharge water anymore leading to increased cso or flooding volume directly garofalo et al 2017 van der werf et al 2022 the sensor error is also concerned with the robustness of rl control systems and existing literature has examined the abilities of rl agents to handle systematic and random information uncertainties such as data drifting and forecast error saliba et al 2020 zhang et al 2022 in addition rtc controllers need to keep connected with sensors to track the hydraulic states of the drainage network and send online control signals to local actuators concerning the real time requirements the control performance is sensitive to communication failures in both observation and action processes especially in centralized control systems that rely on extensive wireless communication networks van der werf et al 2022 possible solutions could be data filling techniques or local backup settings when observation or action information is lost palmitessa et al 2021 but additional efforts should be made to enhance communication robustness from the perspective of the control architecture in the centralized control structure an agent receives global information and controls multiple actuators which are spatially distributed in a drainage system centralized rl algorithms are reported effective in mitigating urban flooding risk zhang et al 2022 reducing cso volume tian et al 2022b and decreasing total suspended solids export bowes et al 2022 despite the potential optimality of centralized rl it relies on large scale data transmission and remote control in real time and there is possible information loss or delay during the communication process directly applying the overall decision making process to decide the set points of local actuators may be vulnerable to communication failure between the control center and local actuators mollerup et al 2017 decentralized control excludes a specific control center and each decentralized agent controls the local actuator with small information integration the relatively simple architecture of local control limits possible threats from communication failure some studies on the rtc of stormwater systems focused on the local control of an independent structure eulogi et al 2021 the lack of coordination may be the main drawback as there are non negligible relationships among distributed controllable subsystems in a catchment scale uds local controllers are scalable and shown effective in practical implementations but simple heuristic procedures like if then and fuzzy rules are not enough and there is potential for general performance enhancement with further coordination and more advanced control strategies multi agent reinforcement learning marl is a field of rl aimed at solving decentralized problems with partial observations and has been applied in unmanned aerial vehicles cluster control pham et al 2018 autonomous driving shalev shwartz et al 2016 and wastewater treatment plants control chen et al 2021 this paper proposes a decentralized control strategy for flooding and cso reduction based on a marl algorithm to coordinate distributed actuators following the centralized training and decentralized execution framework wang et al 2021 the controlled drainage network is modeled as a multi agent system in which each rl agent uses a neural network to decide control policies with partial real time observations independently and all the agents are trained centrally with global operation records different from distributed control that relies on explicit neighbor communication between actuators garofalo et al 2017 maiolo et al 2020 there is no real time communication between rl agents in this work but they are coordinated through offline global training which can be regarded as implicit communications fully centralized and decentralized control structures are also established in this paper using rl algorithms for comparison the rl agents are developed in a benchmark drainage model to control the outflow orifices of four tanks in case 1 and also implemented in a real world model to control two pumping stations in case 2 the robustness of different rl structures is also evaluated in communication failure scenarios to our knowledge this is the first attempt of marl for decentralized control of the uds 2 methodology in this section a cooperative marl algorithm called value decomposition network vdn sunehag et al 2018 is introduced for the real time control of the uds another two rl algorithms single agent deep q learning network dqn and independent q learning iql are also implemented for comparison to represent the fully centralized and fully decentralized control respectively the basic architectures training methods rtc formulations and robustness evaluation of the three value based rl algorithms are illustrated in this section 2 1 reinforcement learning in reinforcement learning control the uds is formulated as the environment controlled by rl agents in value based rl algorithms agents get observations o t from the environment and generate action values through an action value function q o t a t which is formed as a neural network the action a t with the largest value is chosen to control the actuator in the environment which gives a reward r t as feedback mnih et al 2015 to achieve promising control performance the agent is trained through q learning to estimate an action value function q o t a t defined as the expected sum of future rewards to evaluate the value of action a t with observation o t as eq 1 1 q o t a t e o t a t k 0 γ k r t k o t a t q o t a t α r t γ max a a q o t 1 a q o t a t where γ is the discount factor k is the future time step a is the action space and e o t a t represents the expectation when action a t is taken under the observation o t after training the action value function q o t a t with rewards r t the developed agent can estimate the performance of each action and conduct the best action with the largest action value a t argmax a a q o t a given the observation o t 2 2 multi agent reinforcement learning algorithms to deal with the decentralized control problem of multi actuators one direct idea is to train a central agent using q learning with all the information as the input and all the action values as the output as established in mullapudi et al 2020 it is an extension of the deep q network dqn to a multi agent system another option is a decentralized control approach independent q learning iql which separates the environment into several parts controlled by multiple individual agents tampuu et al 2017 each iql agent is formed as a single q network which decides the control policy of its actuator using the local observations and gets trained with the reward independently following the multi agent control structure of iql the value decomposition network vdn provides a different training method in which a summation layer connects the individual action value functions q i o t a t of all the agents to estimate the joint action value function q t o t o t a t in eq 2 sunehag et al 2018 2 q t o t o t a t q t o t o t 1 o t 2 o t n a t 1 a t 2 a t n i 1 n q i o t i a t i where q i is the estimation of the local action value q i that only depends on the local observations and actions the neural networks are trained together with the summation layer to ensure a consistent update target and establish the potential coordination for all the agents dqn iql and vdn establish one or several rl agents to control the environment and the structures of the agents are formulated in fig 1 the action value function is estimated through a neural network which uses observations as the input action values as the output the fully connected hidden layers include a multi layer perceptron mlp and a dueling layer wang et al 2016 the dqn agent receives the global observations and decides the actions of all the actuators so it has only one but a larger network with more neurons in each layer than the agents of iql and vdn vdn uses the same agent structure as iql in the control process but updates the joint action value q t o t in the training method while each iql agent updates its action value q i independently 2 3 training method the training process lasts thousands of episodes and each of them consists of two steps interaction and update in the interaction process of each episode agents explore different actions through step by step simulation of the uds under all the training rainfall events the control actions a t a t i i n are generated with observations o t through epsilon greedy by each agent as eq 3 and fig 1 3 a t rando m a a a i f rando m p u 0 1 p ε arg max a a q o t a e l s e where the probability ε is initialized as 1 and decays exponentially in episodes p is a real number that follows the uniform distribution u 0 1 the agents conduct random actions to explore more choices in early episodes as the training process goes on the agents are more likely to choose actions with the largest q value after the actions a t change the settings of the actuators in time step t the environment provides the observations o t 1 in the next time step and the reward r t through simulation and evaluation the operation records of the entire rainfall event o t a t r t o t 1 t t are collected and restored in the experience replay buffer as the transition data the oldest data are discarded if the buffer is full the update process is to minimize the loss value by updating the parameters of the neural networks through gradient descent a mini batch of transition data o j a j r j o j j m is randomly sampled from the replay buffer to calculate the future discounted reward y j and the loss value l through mean squared error dqn and iql define the loss function using the traditional deep q learning method for each agent mnih et al 2015 dqn only needs to update the central agent using the loss function l eq 4 while the neural network q i of each iql agent gets updated individually by minimizing its loss function l i eq 5 as for vdn since the q i values of the agents add up to the joint action value q t o t the loss function is designed using q t o t as eq 6 4 l 1 m j 1 m y j q o j a j 2 1 m j 1 m r j γ m a x a a q o j a q o j a j 2 5 l i 1 m j 1 m y j q i o j i a j i 2 1 m j 1 m r j γ m a x a a q i o j i a q i o j i a j i 2 6 l 1 m j 1 m y j q tot o j a j 2 1 m j 1 m r j γ q tot o j a j q tot o j a j 2 1 m j 1 m r j γ i 1 n max a a q i o j i a i 1 n q i o j i a j i 2 where q o j a j is the action value of dqn and q i o j i a j i is the action value of each iql or vdn agent the target action value is estimated and maximized through the next observations o j and the target networks q i and q which have the same structures as the original value networks and get updated with them per episode each sample j has a reward value r j that depends on the system state o j and the action a j and the reward function r o a is defined concerning the control objectives m is the batch size through minimizing the loss function l with gradients l θ i the parameters θ i of value networks of the agents are updated fig 2 shows the interaction and update process of vdn for example dqn and iql adopt the same interaction process as fig 2 but differ in the update mechanisms as stated before 2 4 multi agent reinforcement learning control for urban drainage systems the rtc problem of the uds is formulated with real time information water level rainfall monitoring as observations multiple flow control devices pumps valves or orifices as actuators and the cso or flooding reduction as control objectives rainfall monitoring is not considered as the observation of rl the simulation model of the uds is formulated as the environment e with a real time data interface to get observations and execute control actions during the modeling process each control agent is designed as a neural network which calculates action values with real time information and implements the action with the maximum value as actions are conducted in the simulation model hydraulic characteristics are adjusted to balance the drainage loads in the uds the evaluation of the control objective provides the rewards r t as the feedback to show the goodness of control actions the three control strategies differ in the control and training structures in the online control process dqn deploys a centralized agent which uses global information to decide the actions of all the actuators both iql and vdn use decentralized agents at the storage tanks to control the orifices or pumps with partial observations in the offline training process dqn updates the central agent with a trainer using global data and the iql agents are trained independently with limited information vdn gathers the information of all the decentralized agents in a centralized trainer through offline coordination to calculate the loss value and update their network parameters their control and training structures are shown in fig 3 2 5 communication robustness evaluation as sensors and actuators are spatially dispersed in the entire uds they rely on wireless telecommunication to connect with the control agent there are possibilities of communication failure or signal delay that observations are not accessible for the agent or the control signals cannot reach the actuators in real time therefore the robustness of different structures needs evaluation in communication failure scenarios two communication processes are investigated including observations from sensors to agents and actions from agents to actuators in observation communication failure scenarios rl agents are assumed to use the previously received data as the observation when sensors are disconnected all the 3 rl structures may encounter observation communication failure as sensors are installed far away from the agent even for decentralized control iql and vdn in real world cases in action communication failure scenarios only the centralized control dqn suffers from the failure of control signals and local actuators are assumed to remain in the current setting if they have no backup strategies since communication may fail at any time and device it is assumed that there is a failure probability for each device in each control step 50 parallel experiments are simulated in each failure scenario with the probability δ between 10 and 90 the observations and actions in failure scenarios are determined in eq 7 and eq 8 7 o o b s t j o o b s t 1 j i f rando m p u 0 1 p δ o t j e l s e 8 a l o c t i a l o c t 1 i i f rando m p u 0 1 p δ a t i e l s e 9 δ x i x i x 0 x 0 where o o b s t j represents the observation for the agent o t j is the actual observation value from sensor j a l o c t i is the setting adopted at the local actuator i and a t i represents the control action decided by the centralized agent in step t the control effects such as the total cso volumes in failure scenarios x i are calculated and the results with perfect communication x 0 are provided as a reference to evaluate the performance loss rate as eq 9 to deal with action communication failure scenarios an integrated control structure is formulated with a central agent to control all the actuators remotely and multiple decentralized agents to take over at the local level as fig 4 a set of default settings or rules can also be applied locally the decentralized and default strategies are regarded as local backups to show their effects on the enhancement of action communication robustness 3 case study this section describes the basic information of a benchmark drainage model case 1 and a real world drainage model case 2 used in the experiments the simulation model of uds swmm rossman 2015 is regarded as the virtual environment for the case study in each case a real time control problem is formulated including observations action space and reward function 3 1 case 1 a benchmark drainage model the astlingen swmm model a benchmark combined sewer system established and calibrated by schütze et al 2018 and sun et al 2020 is used as a testbed of rl strategies there are six storage tanks with outflow orifices in the system and four of them are controllable fig 5 in this case the control target is to mitigate the cso volume that occurred at both tanks and overflow structures in table 1 the joint observation o t o t i p t i h i n t i h t i h o u t t i i n includes the monitored precipitation p t i the water level of upstream node h i n t i storage tank h t i and downstream node h o u t t i of each tank i in step t with 5 minute interval where n is the set of tanks each set p t i h i n t i h t i h o u t t i represents a set of partial observations at tank i the joint action is a t a t i a i n where a t i is the control action of the outflow orifice of the tank i each orifice has optional settings that are evenly spaced between the minimum and the maximum settings in the action space a as the opening percentages determined by the throttle flows schütze et al 2018 the baseline setting is calculated by the nominal throttle flow and used as the base case bc control following the objective function of model predictive control in sun et al 2020 the overflow to different receiving water bodies wwtp inflow and control roughness is considered in the reward function eq 10 10 r t 2 v f t creek v f t river 0 1 v in t wwtp 0 01 i n tanks v out t i v out t 1 i v in t where v f t c r e e k v f t r i v e r are the total cso volume into the creek and the river respectively v o u t t i is the outflow volume of the tank i and v i n t w w t p v i n t are the total inflow volume into the treatment plant and the entire system respectively in step t a larger weight is given to overflow to the creek which is more sensitive than the river the reward r t is evaluated for each control step the control performance of the agents is investigated in independent rainfall events which are extracted from 10 year measured rainfall series using a two hour inter event interval sun et al 2020 fifty rainfalls from 2000 to 2006 are randomly sampled as the training events and another event on 08 22 2006 is used as the validation event to show the actual performance enhancement during the training process all the rainfalls with precipitation between 5 mm and 15 mm are extracted from 2007 to 2009 as the testing rainfall events 3 2 case 2 a real world drainage model since the astlingen model is a hypothetical benchmark model the strategies are further applied in the simulation model of a real world drainage network in chaohu city in eastern china the drainage system has two storage tanks with sewage pumps and storm pumps the sewage pumps can transfer water from the tanks to the downstream system and finally into the wastewater treatment plant in rainy periods the storm pumps can discharge excess water to the river as the cso and the downstream system is sensitive to urban flooding as the chaohu swmm model was developed and used in our previous studies its details refer to liao et al 2019 and zhi et al 2019 the rl agents provide control policies for the two pumping stations cc and jk as shown in table 2 the observations contain precipitation p t water depths of the tanks h t i upstream h i n t i and downstream nodes h o u t t i and the cso volume in the recent step v c s o t which are obtained from the simulation model in each step the cc station has 2 sewage pumps overlapped in fig 6 and 2 storm pumps and the jk station has one sewage pump and 2 storm pumps the agents need to decide the number of sewage and storm pumps to turn on as the action a t i for both pumping stations in each 10 minute control step the control target is to minimize urban flooding and cso volume throughout the entire rainfall event and the pumping stations should be managed properly to avoid surcharge in the storage tanks for safety and overuse of pumps for energy saving therefore the reward function r t is designed with flooding r f l o o d i n g t t a n k r f l o o d i n g t s y s t e m cso r c s o t water depth r d e p t h t and pump energy consumption r e n e r g y t in each simulation step the reward function is formulated as eq 11 11 r t 5 r f l o o d i n g t t a n k 2 r f l o o d i n g t s y s t e m r c s o t 2 r d e p t h t 0 1 r e

the inflow flooding and cso volume of tank i in step t correspondingly v f t s y s t e m is the total flooding volume in the system flooding at the storage tanks is punished as eq 12 whereas eq 13 and eq 14 represent the trade off between flooding and cso h t i is the water depth in the current step and h m a x i is the full depth of tank i considering the latency in the rainfall runoff and hydraulic processes of the upstream system the precipitation p t δ t in step t δ t is used to separate dry and wet periods for the tanks δ t is set as 30 minutes to represent the concentration time in the upstream system of the tanks the agents are encouraged to store more water in the tanks when rainwater inflows into the tanks while larger rewards are provided to keep the depths low in dry periods as eq 15 the total pumping energy kwh is also considered as eq 16 and scaled to a similar magnitude the weights of the reward items are set in order of importance in eq 11 in case 2 the currently used heuristic control hc method is regarded as the baseline strategy in which the pumps are controlled by a set of startup and shutoff threshold values of water depths details of the two storage tanks and the current hc threshold values are shown in table 3 twenty different rainfall events with return periods between 1 and 5 are generated for training through chicago hyetograph keifer chu 1957 using random values of parameters in a sampling range see supplementary materials obtained from the regional intensity duration frequency curve to establish the environment swmm api pichler 2022 pyswmm mcdonnell et al 2020 and pystorms rimer et al 2021 are used as the data interface to manipulate project files obtain real time information and implement step by step control 4 results and discussion 4 1 training results to develop the three control strategies the control agents are trained through simulations under 50 historical rainfall events in case 1 and 20 synthetic rainfall events in case 2 the training processes last for 5 000 episodes through recursive interactions and updates as stated in section 2 3 in each episode agents control the system under all the training events to collect experience and are trained for 10 epochs with historical experience since the total rewards are obtained with random actions for exploration the actual control effects of the agents are evaluated under a validation event which is not used for training every 10 training episodes details of the network architecture hyperparameters and training rainfall events are provided in supplementary materials figs 7 and 8 prove that all three rl algorithms can develop the control performance of agents in both cases through efficient exploration and training as the total rewards of all the steps in training events increase with the episodes and the cso and flooding volumes of the validation event gradually decrease and converge in the validation rainfall dqn achieves the least cso in the latter stage of case 1 and converges first in case 2 whereas iql is not stable in case 1 with a slight increase of the cso and the total volume in case 2 is the largest of the three in the decentralized control structure centralized training enhances the coordination among the vdn agents to achieve better performance than the independent learning strategy iql vdn connects all the agents to ensure cooperation towards the same objective and consistent gradients in the update process the validation performance in figs 7 and 8 indicates that training is not stable with multiple independent learning agents as each iql agent is updated individually with the global reward and ignores mutual effects from other learning agents the focus on the reward increase through a single agent may be misleading since the reward affects all the agents independent training may cause the lazy agent problem in which each agent may avoid self enhancement due to others contributions to the same reward sunehag et al 2018 4 2 control effects evaluation after the training process completes the well developed agents that obtain the largest reward in the training process are implemented to control the actuators in real time various rainfall events are tested to evaluate the control effects of the 3 strategies together with a baseline scenario and none of the testing events are included in the training data the system maximum performance maxred of each rainfall event is also investigated as the upper bound of rtc through optimization of the entire control trajectory with an infinite horizon liao et al 2022 van der werf et al 2021 4 2 1 case 1 the general performance of rl strategies is compared under 101 testing rainfall events from 2007 to 2009 the rl strategies are also tested in the whole year 2000 to compare with the model predictive control mpc result in sun et al 2020 the summarized results are shown in fig 9 and detailed testing results are shown in the supplementary materials the left side of fig 9 indicates that vdn has a close cso reduction performance to dqn while iql takes third place in the testing rainfalls as for the receiving water of overflow rl strategies reduce the cso to the creek to nearly half of the bc and approaches the maximum potential and more stormwater overflow to the river which is less sensitive in the reward function eq 7 dqn is aware of the global state including the downstream tank t1 where cso to the river is the most likely to occur so dqn achieves less overflow to the river and less total volume than decentralized control iql and vdn in contrast vdn reduces the upstream cso to the more sensitive creek significantly but it has the largest cso to the river of the three strategies iql has the worst performance of the three due to the lack of coordination but it is still effective to balance the overflow to receiving water with different sensitivities compared with bc as all the agents are trained by using global rewards as the supervisory information rl strategies are proven effective in cso reduction but they cannot outperform mpc as the right side of fig 9 different from mpc rl agents control the actuators through reactions to the current observations without predictive information therefore they cannot provide the best decision for future changes in real time the avoidance of online optimization leads to a shorter response time than mpc but also limits the control performance in addition training with limited numbers of rainfall events makes rl agents hard to generalize continuous simulation in a whole year considering the deep uncertainties of rainfall dynamics larger training datasets may improve the generalization performance but the exploration exploitation dilemma exists and recursive simulations make the training process also time consuming 4 2 2 case 2 four rainfall events are designed with the return periods of 1 2 3 and 5 years and regional parameters from liao et al 2019 the cumulative flooding and cso volume of the three strategies dqn iql and vdn and two baselines hc and maxred are shown in fig 10 the control performance is also tested under 100 rainfall events generated using return periods between 1 and 5 fig 10 indicates that the three rl strategies dqn iql and vdn can mitigate both flooding and cso volume compared with hc the cso reduction is more significant because overflow is directly related to the use of storm pumps however it needs system coordination to mitigate flooding in the downstream system which occurs due to excess water from sewage pumps according to the 100 average results dqn performs the best and approaches the maximum potential in both flooding and cso whereas vdn is close to dqn in cso reduction iql seems to be the worst out of the three as it causes a large overflow volume even in relatively mild rainfall events such as rain 1 and rain 2 due to the overuse of storm pumps see supplementary materials for detailed control processes of the four rainfall events according to fig 11 the rl strategies are effective in energy saving which is considered in the reward function eq 11 large energy consumption comes from the overuse of pumps especially storm pumps with large capacities therefore the cso reduction also leads to a side effect of energy saving as dqn and vdn can avoid unnecessary energy consumption and excess overflow in relatively mild rainfall events such as rain 1 and rain 2 dqn uses sewage pumps the most fig 11 but the flooding volume is the least of the three fig 10 which indicates that dqn can discharge sewage water in proper time to avoid severe flooding in the downstream system 4 2 3 summary the reduction performance in the two cases is shown in table 4 where the total cso volume is used to calculate the rate in case 1 and the cso and flooding volume is used with respect to the control objective in case 2 table 4 indicates that the centralized strategy outperforms other rl structures in both cases and decentralized agents can also perform well after centralized training the rl strategies are more effective in case 2 to achieve a significant increase compared with the currently used control rules the results in training events are better than that in testing events but the difference is limited considering the gap in the maximum potential of training and testing events although rl is an advanced reactive control method its performance cannot reach maxred and predictive control needs to be considered to approach the best solution 4 3 communication robustness as the rtc system may encounter signal loss in both observation and action communication processes the control effects of rl strategies in communication failure scenarios are investigated in this section the experiments are established in rainfall events of case 1 and the robustness is evaluated through performance loss as eq 9 4 3 1 observation communication robustness the accumulated cso volumes of three rl strategies under different failure probabilities are shown in fig 12 it shows that the rl performance decays and becomes uncertain as the failure probability increases but the accumulated cso volumes do not exceed the baseline bc before the 90 failure scenario iql and vdn are less effective than dqn in perfect information baselines but their performance losses in failure scenarios are smaller against perfect baselines than dqn the control performance of vdn may increase with small failure probabilities in the 08 22 2007 event because agents may explore better control actions through random noise in the input of the neural network there is a case that the cso volumes of dqn exceed vdn in the same failure probability despite that dqn may achieve the least cso volume its reduction performance is sensitive to observation communication failures which are incidental for the centralized structure with spatially distributed sensors in a catchment scale system the reason may come from the agent structure as fig 1 indicates that dqn integrates all the observations and actions in a large neural network which may enlarge the information errors to affect the decisions of all the actuators and induce sensitive performance loss in fig 12 in contrast multiple vdn agents provide much redundancy as signal loss occurred in a single agent has no impact on the others 4 3 2 action communication robustness fig 13 shows that the lack of action commands causes large uncertainties and negative impacts on the performance of dqn as the dqn none plots become wider and higher with larger failure probabilities the control effects are more stable but not good enough if actuators adopt the bc settings as dqn bc when the connection is lost the comparison indicates that decentralized agents can act as an effective backup when the centralized dqn agent fails to connect with the actuators as the performance of dqn iql and dqn vdn gradually approach the perfect iql and vdn scenario when failure probabilities increase in all the 4 events there are possibilities that agents function better with better actions explored by the randomness from imperfect communication based on the results in fig 13 the integrated control structure fig 4 is necessary to enhance the communication robustness of rtc systems the results of dqn none indicate that control signal loss induces large uncertainties and may cause significant performance deterioration if there is no backup it is a regular method to handle the disconnection problem with dqn bc which returns to local control such as static settings or rule based strategies fig 13 proves that a simple backup is not enough and the multi agent system can do much better well trained decentralized agents take over the actuators to limit the performance loss and vdn outperforms iql to provide a better backup due to pre developed implicit coordination by combining decentralized and centralized control the integrated structure enhances the robustness towards communication failure 4 3 3 summary in a drainage network with multiple actuators the rtc system needs to be decomposed into different hierarchies at global and local levels to form a distributed control structure lund et al 2018 which can keep the system well functioning even though communication fails according to the results centralized control tends to be more vulnerable to communication failure whereas multiple decentralized agents form a more robust structure with a smaller failure probability and less impact from information loss as for the sensitivities to observation and action communication failure fig 12 shows that observation deficiencies cause a more significant decrease in the control performance as the agent may generate biased actions with information errors to influence the control process the influence of action command loss on dqn is quite uncertain in fig 13 because the actuators may be stuck in different settings before heavy rainfall which results in different overflow levels 5 conclusions this paper presents a decentralized real time control method for overflow and flooding reduction in two urban drainage systems based on multi agent reinforcement learning marl a centralized method and a fully decentralized method are also proposed to compare the control effects and communication robustness of reinforcement learning strategies with different structures based on the results in a benchmark model and a real world model the main conclusions are summarized as follows all three strategies can effectively reduce the overflow or flooding volume in rainfalls compared with the baseline strategies in both cases centralized training can enhance the overall coordination of decentralized agents to achieve better performance than independently trained agents although it may not outperform the centralized control strategy the decentralized structure can provide a robust and fail safe option for communication failures the observation deficiencies have less impact on decentralized agents whereas the centralized agent is vulnerable to information errors decentralized agents can provide an effective backup at the local level when actuators cannot receive control signals from the centralized agent in general the application of marl for decentralized real time control in this paper contributes to an effective and robust option for advanced control of urban drainage systems declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

15273,understanding the effects of halogens on the production of macromolecular disinfection byproducts dbps is critical for drinking water safety the effects of br and i on the chemical diversity of dissolved organic matter dom during plasma preoxidation and the subsequent formation of macromolecular halogenated dbps after chlorination were deciphered plasma preoxidation changed dom diversity from aromatic component oriented to lignin and tannin component oriented resulting in 62 0 and 21 2 decreases in n dbps ckhnomnzclx formulas and c dbps ckhnomclx formulas after chlorination respectively br could induce the formation of organobromine compounds obrcs during plasma oxidation however the intensities of obrcs decreased by 56 3 cho formulas and 75 2 chon formulas after further chlorination obrcs still accounted for 79 8 of the total organohalogen compounds oxcs x cl or br due to the higher substitutability of bromine i promoted oic production in the dom preoxidation process and oics acted as intermediates to form oclcs during chlorination when br and i coexisted br promoted oic production in the dom preoxidation process therefore more obrcs and oclcs were generated due to intermediates of oics in subsequent chlorination connections between oxcs and their precursors were established using network computation the precursors of oclcs were located in the aromatic structure region 0 2 h c 0 7 o c 0 67 those of obrcs and oics were located in the lignin 0 7 h c 1 5 0 1 o c 0 67 and tannin 0 6 h c 1 5 0 67 o c 1 0 regions with relatively greater h c and o c ratios respectively graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords disinfection byproducts ft icr ms dissolved organic matter br i data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction dissolved organic matter dom is ubiquitously present in surface water and it can lead to the production of disinfection byproducts dbps via reactions with disinfectants wang et al 2020a there have been extensive studies about the effects of different sources and fractions of dom on the formation of dbps lavonen et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 andersson et al 2019 li et al 2020a phungsai et al 2016 2018 2019 used orbitrap mass spectrometry to reveal the changes of dom characteristics in water treatment processes and found that ozonation treatment increased the saturated structure and oxidation extent of dom promoting the generation of subsequent dbps iodide i and bromide br are common halogen ions that can lead to the production of i dbps and br dbps with higher toxicities gao et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 it is important to explore the underlying mechanisms of br dbps and i dbps formation and develop effective methods to control their risks previous studies reported that br and i were oxidized by hocl ocl to produce hobr and hoi during chlorination disinfection which then reacted with dom to form traditional br dbps and i dbps westerhoff et al 2004 li et al 2021 hoi has a propensity to react with amino acid groups while hobr tends to react with phenols liu et al 2022 i dbps can act as intermediates and be substituted by hclo clo to produce traditional cl dbps zhu et al 2016 advanced oxidation processes aops based on oxidative radicals are generally used as preoxidation or deep purification of drinking water supply during aops br and i can be oxidized to halogen radicals i e x x2 and hox x i or br reactions 1 12 which then further react with dom to form oxcs organohalogen compounds x cl br or i gao et al 2020 wang et al 2020b ye et al 2021 aops can alter dom significantly and then affect the formation of traditional dbps gao et al 2020 found that traditional dbp formation derived from humic acid ha decreased in the presence of br in an uv cl2 treatment system but increased in the presence of i ding et al 2019 found that uv h2o2 pre oxidation could destroy the aromatic and dissolved organic nitrogen components of natural organic matter resulting in the reduction of n dbps formation previous studies reported that plasma oxidation could effectively remove various pollutants including organic pollutants algae and bacteria reducing potential risks in later water purification wang et al 2015 2018 srivastav et al 2020 in our previous studies a gas phase discharge plasma oxidation system effectively reduced the dissolved organic carbon doc aromaticity and molecular weight of commercial ha and increased o containing functional groups thus leading to a 42 68 decrease in traditional cl dbp formation in subsequent chlorination wang et al 2016a hu et al 2022 however the behaviors and transformation of bromine and iodine in plasma processing have not been systematically reported previous studies regarding the effects of br and i on dbps were mainly focused on traditional small molecular dbps while more than 70 of total organic halogens remain unknown koudjonou and lebel 2006 these halogenated dbps are mainly detected using gas chromatography liquid chromatography mass spectrometry although some new polar and or thermally labile dbps have been identified yang et al 2019 macromolecular aromatic dbps without standard compounds cannot be detected 1 x h o xo h 2 xo h x h o 3 x x x 2 4 x x x 2 5 x 2 x x x 2 6 x 2 x 2 2 x x 2 7 x 2 h 2 o hox x h 8 hox o x h 9 o 3 x o 2 o x 10 h 2 o 2 ob r b r h 2 o o 2 11 ob r e h h o b r 12 hocl b r c l hobr recently the structural diversity of dom and macromolecular dbps without standard compounds have been successfully identified by fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms which greatly increases the identification of dbps koch et al 2006 zhang et al 2012a lv et al 2016 by using the ft icr ms zhang et al 2012b detected 1007 macromolecular cl dbps derived from dom relative to traditional dbps haloacetic acids haloacetonitriles trihalomethanes etc composition and structure information of macromolecular i dbps and br dbps were also successively reported and 478 previously unreported br dbps and i dbps were found zhang et al 2014 wang et al 2016b in our recent study 1984 macromolecular n dbps such as c18hnnmozclx and 2486 c dbps such as c11hnomclx were identified using ft icr ms during chlorination of algal organic matter and they decreased by 60 when the algal organic matter was pretreated by plasma oxidation prior to chlorination wang et al 2022 therefore it is presumed that i and br would affect the production of macromolecular i dbps and br dbps during dom preoxidation chlorination therefore ft icr ms was applied to decipher the effects of br and i on macromolecular halogenated dbps derived from dom in plasma preoxidation chlorination treatment first the molecular diversity of dom and the formation of macromolecular cl dbps were explored during plasma preoxidation and chlorination treatment subsequently the formation processes of macromolecular obrcs and competitive relationships with oclcs were assessed in the presence of br as well as the oics after adding i then the effects of coexisting br and i on the production of oxcs x cl br i as well as their competitive relationships were deciphered finally links between these macromolecular dbps and their precursors were established using network computation 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals humic acid ha sigma aldrich h16752 was used as a model of dom as reported previously hu et al 2022 to prepare the ha working solutions ha was dissolved in ultrapure water and filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane finally the ha concentration was approximately 7 5 mg l 1 and the solution ph was 7 0 methanol lc ms grade was purchased from oceanpak sweden 2 2 ha treatment by plasma preoxidation a plasma preoxidation equipment was used to produce various reactive species oh o2 1o2 etc for ha oxidation treatment which was mainly consisted of a high voltage alternating current power source dalian university of technology china a reaction vessel and an aerator connected to the air pump hu et al 2022 as introduced in text s1 in the supplementary materials for each experiment 220 ml of ha solution 7 5 mg l 1 was treated under an electric power of 17 8 w 2 3 chlorination treatment after ha treatment by the plasma preoxidation chlorination tests were conducted using sodium hypochlorite in a mass concentration ratio of 1 3 c doc c cl2 zhu et al 2019 which was conducted batchwise the chlorination reaction time was 36 h and the residual chlorine was quenched using stoichiometric amounts of na2s2o3 to explore the effects of coexisting br and i ten experimental groups were set up including 1 ha without any treatment marked as ck 2 ha with chlorination marked as cl2 3 ha with plasma oxidation marked as oxidation 4 ha with plasma oxidation and chlorination marked as oxidation cl2 5 ha and br after plasma oxidation marked as br oxidation 6 ha and br after plasma oxidation and chlorination marked as br oxidation cl2 7 ha and i after plasma oxidation marked as i oxidation 8 ha and i after plasma oxidation and chlorination marked as i oxidation cl2 9 coexisting ha br and i after plasma oxidation marked as br i oxidation 10 coexisting ha br and i after plasma oxidation and chlorination marked as br i oxidation cl2 as depicted in table s1 herein the br concentration was 3 mg l 1 and the i concentration was 0 3 mg l 1 2 4 chemical diversity and macromolecular dbp identification prior to ft icr ms detection removal of inorganic salts in the dom samples was performed by an agilent bond elut ppl resin lv et al 2016 and the procedure is introduced in text s2 a solarix ft icr mass spectrometer 15t bruker germany was applied to analyze the chemical diversity and macromolecular dbps in dom under negative ionization mode of the electrospray ionization source by injecting 200 μl of sample directly texts s3 s4 gonsior et al 2019 xiang et al 2020 a van krevelen plot was used to characterize the relationships of the o c and h c ratios in dom zhang et al 2012a and table s2 lists the stoichiometric ranges of the classifications dom characteristics were also described using the modified aromatic index aimod koch et al 2006 and double bond equivalent dbe zhang et al 2021 in text s5 connections between macromolecular dbps and their precursors were analyzed using network computation by gephi software tziotis et al 2011 and the details are described in text s6 3 results and discussion 3 1 molecular diversity of ha during plasma preoxidation treatment fig 1 figure s1 and figure s2 depict the van krevelen diagrams of chon ckhnomnz formulas and cho ckhnom formulas compounds in ha in different treatment groups seven regions corresponded to major components present in ha including aromatic structures tannins lignins unsaturated hydrocarbons carbohydrates lipids and proteins amino sugars table s2 pan et al 2020 wang et al 2022 most molecules with aromatic components were distributed in o c 0 67 and 0 2 h c 0 7 in the ck group however the proportion of the aromatic components decreased from 72 83 to 25 35 cho compounds and from 91 61 to 48 21 chon compounds in the oxidation group fig 1 the total intensities of the aromatic components also decreased by 69 03 cho compounds and 57 48 chon compounds compared with the ck group figure s2 conversely the proportion of polyphenolic source lignin and tannin components increased and the total intensities of lignin and tannin components increased by 62 79 and 617 39 for cho compounds and 223 26 and 1901 5 for chon compounds compared with the ck group respectively figure s2 plasma oxidation treatment could increase the intensity of oh hu et al 2022 intriguingly compared with the ck the total intensities of cho and chon compounds dbe and aimod were all reduced in the oxidation group tables s3 s4 the visualized cho ckhnom formulas and chon ckhnomnz formulas formulas in the ck and oxidation groups are shown in fig 2 the formulas were divided into four conditions according to text s4 after plasma oxidation 1601 cho formulas and 772 chon formulas assigned in the ck group were degraded while 1633 cho formulas and 928 chon formulas with relatively higher o c ratios were newly formed fig 2a 2c the same phenomena were also observed in those formulas observed in both ck and oxidation groups the formulas with increased intensity after plasma oxidation showed relatively higher mean of o c ratios 0 55 for cho formulas 0 60 for chon formulas than those of the formulas with decreased intensity 0 46 for cho formulas 0 51 for chon formulas fig 2b 2d the increased o c ratios after plasma oxidation were probably due to the production of hydroxylated components via h abstraction and oh addition from aromatic components goldstone et al 2002 sonntag 2007 3 2 macromolecular cl dbps formation previous studies reported that cl dbps could be generated by the reactions of hocl with dom through oxidation addition and electrophilic substitution reactions deborde and gunten 2008 jiang et al 2020 compared with the oxidation group the number of carbons and dbes of dom and the proportions of lignin components further decreased in the oxidation cl2 group fig 1 and tables s3 s4 low molecular weight organics could be formed due to reactions of chlorine with lignin components with electron abundant functional groups lee et al 2007 prasse et al 2020 rodriguez et al 2020 the reduction rates of the total intensities of cho and chon compounds in the oxidation cl2 group further reached 62 61 and 75 72 respectively oh can react with phenolic and aromatic structures resulting in a higher electron donating capacity edc of dom and stronger reactivity with chlorine mvula and sonntag 2003 remucal et al 2020 fig 3 and figure s3 depict the distribution patterns of organochlorine compounds oclcs in cho and chon during chlorination based on the aimod values formulas could be assigned to polycyclic aromatic moieties aimod 0 67 aromatic moieties aimod 0 5 0 67 and unsaturated and or phenolic moieties h c 1 5 and aimod 0 5 lv et al 2016 oclcs were mainly distributed in the aromatic structures for the cl2 group and they were converted into a smaller number of carbon and lower aimod and highly unsaturated and phenolic structures in the oxidation cl2 group li et al 2017 xiang et al 2020 fig 4 and figure s4 show the distribution of the oclcs in the cho and chon compounds respectively the distribution of oclcs became more dispersed and turned to higher o c ratios in the oxidation cl2 group and the total numbers of unknown cl dbps also decreased from 321 to 253 for cho formulas and from 150 to 57 for chon formulas compared with the cl2 group the most significant reduction was observed for the one chlorine containing compounds similarly the total absolute intensity of organic chlorine also decreased in the oxidation cl2 group tables s5 s6 plasma oxidation enhanced reactions between dom and chlorine but the decrease in the precursors dominated the reduction of tocl xiang et al 2020 connections between macromolecular dbps and their precursors can be visualized by network computation tziotis et al 2011 gonsior et al 2019 xiang et al 2020 fig 5 and figure s5 show the mass difference network of all c12 compounds for cho and c14 compounds for chon in the oxidation cl2 and cl2 groups the mass difference network of all c18 compounds is showed in figure s6 hocl addition and electrophilic substitution were considered the dominant chlorination pathways 85 c12hnom formulas and 46 c12 dbps were detected among which 80 c12hnom and 33 c12 dbps were connected by considering mass differences of clh 1 hocl h2 and o fig 5a similarly 70 c14hnomnx formulas and 14 c14 dbps were detected among which 54 c14hnomnx and 10 c14 dbps were connected fig 5b similar changes were also observed for the c18 compounds chlorination reactions hardly occurred with the position of o 8 therefore the o c ratio of the precursors of dbps could be defined through ft icr ms to further confirm this hypothesis the chemical compositions of the total oclcs precursors were evaluated as shown in fig 6 interestingly nearly all potential oclcs precursors for both hocl addition and chlorine substitution pathways were found to be located within the aromatic structure region of the van krevelen diagram a total of 62 42 and 58 00 of precursors of oclcs were assigned to chlorine substitution in coclcs and noclcs in the ck group respectively 53 10 and 46 00 of precursors were matched by hocl addition in coclcs and noclcs respectively table s7 plasma oxidation could reduce the matching degree for the oxidation group only 40 71 and 22 81 of the corresponding precursors were matched in coclcs and noclcs by chlorine substitution this phenomenon could be due to the increased reactivity and reaction type of altered dom with hocl by oxidation xiang et al 2020 in addition the h c and o c of screened precursors in the ck and oxidation groups were compared as shown in figure s7 the mean o c of cho formulas increased by 15 02 and 19 90 in the oxidation group for hocl addition and chlorine substitution respectively compared with those in the ck similar phenomena also occurred for the h c in general plasma oxidation resulted in higher h c and o c ratios of precursors which was due to the increased phenol groups and enhanced reactivity with chlorine rodriguez and gunten 2020 li et al 2020b figure s8 shows the changes in aimod of precursor found oclcs and precursor unfound oclcs in the cl2 and oxidation cl2 groups by two chlorination pathways for the cl2 group the mean aimod of precursor unfound groups decreased by 13 16 and 17 03 for cho and chon formulas by chlorine substitution pathway respectively compared with those of precursor found groups figure s8a the oxidation cl2 group exhibited more obvious decreases than the cl2 group figure s8c compared with the chlorine substitution pathway the reduction was relatively gentler for the hocl addition pathway and the mean aimod of the precursor unfound groups only decreased by 4 44 8 58 figure s8d therefore oclcs were converted into lower aimod highly unsaturated and phenolic structures after the plasma oxidation electron transfer et and electrophilic aromatic substitution eas are involved in the reactions between chlorine and phenolic compounds and these reactions are affected by the substituent position and electronic properties of the aromatic ring gallard and gunten 2002 due to the hydroxylation of dom and conversion to tannins and lignins after plasma oxidation the ratio of the et reaction would increase which would result in the formation of new oclcs 3 3 macromolecular br dbp formation induced by coexisting br br can compete for oh westerhoff et al 2004 and affects the degradation of ha which then results in the formation of br dbps plewa et al 2010 compared with the oxidation group the detected cho and chon formulas were shifted to the region with a lower o c ratio in the br oxidation group figure s1e similarly the br oxidation group exhibited lower h c and o c ratios than the oxidation group tables s3 s4 additionally aimod increased 23 91 for cho formulas and 15 79 for chon formulas and dbewa increased 16 21 for cho formulas and 13 12 for chon formulas in the br oxidation group compared with the oxidation group as well as the proportions of the aromatic components in cho and chon compounds fig 1 and figure s2 therefore br inhibited ha conversion during plasma oxidation which was due to the competition of br for radicals reactions 1 12 lee et al 2020 wang et al 2020c lei et al 2021 2021 resulting in reactions between hobr and dom and further obrcs formation the formed obrcs were mainly found in the aromatic structures with high carbon numbers fig 2c and figure s3c 336 cobrcs and 109 nobrcs formulas in 0 2 h c 1 5 and 0 3 o c 0 9 were detected in the br oxidation group fig 7 a and figure s9a compounds containing one br were the main products which could be attributed to the adequate reaction sites of dom and electron withdrawing groups br that led to lower reaction activities li et al 2020 the electron cloud density on the benzene ring could be reduced by halogens which hindered electrophilic substitution hu et al 2002 the br oxidation cl2 group exhibited lower numbers of carbon dbe aimod and total intensities of formulas after chlorination than the br oxidation group tables s3 s4 additionally the high carbon number of obrcs c 18 nearly disappeared after chlorination fig 3d and figure s3d the obrcs formed in the plasma oxidation process could partially consume hocl and then hobr was produced through reactions of released br and hocl reaction 12 resulting in the circulation of br and organobromine wang et al 2020 in the presence of br the number of formed oclcs was sharply reduced by 84 19 for cho formulas and 92 98 for chon formulas fig 4c and figure s4c for obrcs the number of br containing formulas was reduced by 56 25 for cho formulas and 75 23 for chon formulas fig 7b and figure s9b this could be attributed to the release of br during obrcs oxidation by hocl and substitution of bromine by chlorine detenchuk et al 2022 previous study reported that the released br would be reoxidized to hobr by chlorine which then resulted in electrophilic substitution of chlorinated dom sites wang et al 2020 notably compared with the oxidation cl2 group there were 74 18 96 60 decreases in the total absolute intensity of organic chlorine for cho and chon components in the br oxidation cl2 group obrcs and br can partially consume chlorine heeb et al 2014 2017 the higher reduction ratio for chon formulas may be due to the reaction of n containing moieties with bromine and chlorine through an oxidation reduction process which act as competitors with the phenolic groups heeb et al 2014 criquet et al 2015 additionally the high proportion of br oclcs in the total oclcs absolute intensity further proved that chlorine could react with obrcs resulting in the production of br cl dbps table s8 fig 5 and figure s10 show the mass difference network of all c12 compounds for cho and c14 compounds for chon in the br oxidation and br oxidation cl2 groups a total of 31 c12 obrcs and 75 c12hnom formulas were detected and connections were found between 30 c12 obrcs and 73 c12hnom formulas when mass differences of h2 o hobr and brh 1 were considered fig 5c similarly 7 c14 obrcs and 54 c14hnomnx formulas were detected and connections were found between 7 c14 obrcs and 39 c14hnomnx formulas fig 5d compared with chlorination bromination reactions were located in the region with a higher oxygen number this indicated that the precursors of obrcs might contain more oxygen than precursors of oclcs compared with the precursors of oclcs the detected precursors of obrcs were mainly in the lignin and tannin regions with higher ratios of h c and o c fig 8 a total of 86 90 and 95 08 of precursors of macromolecular obrcs were assigned to cho and chon compounds in the br oxidation group when bromine substitution was considered as the reaction pathway respectively while 74 70 and 70 49 of precursors were matched by hobr addition table s9 however the matching was reduced to 68 71 and 55 56 for cho and chon compounds by bromine substitution and 51 70 and 37 04 by hobr addition in the br oxidation cl2 group this could be attributed to the increase in the proportion of et reactions between altered dom and hox x br or cl after plasma oxidation resulting in precursors with lower aromaticity and number of carbons tables s3 s4 3 4 macromolecular i dbp formation induced by coexisting i the formation of i dbps has recently attracted wide attention due to their highly toxicological effects ye et al 2021 the i oxidation group exhibited a higher proportion of unsaturated hydrocarbon components in the cho and chon compounds than the oxidation group figure s1 and fig 1 i can be oxidized to hoi reactions 13 17 vogt et al 1999 halfacre et al 2019 and then converted into organoiodine compounds oics ye et al 2012 du et al 2022 compared with the oxidation group aimod and dbewa increased by 6 52 and 5 69 for cho formulas in the i oxidation group tables s3 s4 indicating a reduction in the removal of aromatic components and unsaturated bonds the formed oics were quite different from oclcs and obrcs since a large proportion of oics with highly unsaturated and or phenolic moieties was found aimod 0 50 fig 3e and figure s3e 92 coic and 66 noic formulas containing 1 2 iodine were detected in the i oxidation group fig 9 and figure s10 13 h 2 o 2 i o h hoi 14 2 i io 3 3 h 3 hoi 15 hocl i c l hoi 16 hocl hoi c l io 2 2 h 17 hocl io 2 c l io 3 h after further chlorination the total intensities decreased sharply by 51 16 and 62 60 for cho and chon components in the i oxidation cl2 group respectively as well as for dbewa and aimod tables s3 s4 fig 3f and figure s3f this indicated that the presence of i could promote the reaction between the chon component and chlorine resulting in the formation of carbohydrate and lipid components fig 1b and figure s2b a previous study also found that hoi was more likely to react with nitrogenous organic matter such as amino acids hu et al 2021 i promoted the formation of formulas containing one chlorine but decreased the number of formulas containing 2 3 chlorine elements fig 4d and figure s4d overall compared with the oxidation cl2 group the number of i containing formulas increased by 36 96 for coics and was slightly reduced by 10 61 for noics in the i oxidation cl2 group figure s11 and fig 9 i containing formulas with one iodine became the main oics which were mostly distributed in lignins cram like regions du et al 2022 different from bromine iodine would be further incorporated with dom during chlorination and hoi and new oics would be formed by reactions of inorganic iodine i2 i etc and hocl kristiana et al 2009 detenchuk et al 2022 notably there were 21 07 and 3 86 decreases in the total absolute intensity of organic chlorine for cho and chon components respectively and the tocl ti ratio also decreased for cho and chon formulas in the i oxidation cl2 group compared with no i presence the reduction of oclcs could be due to the partial consumption of chlorine by iodine in addition the total absolute intensity of organic chlorine in the i oxidation cl2 group was much higher than that in the br oxidation cl2 group since the bond energies of ccl c br and c i were ranked as ccl c br c i li et al 2021 the formed oics would function as intermediates and be substituted by hclo clo to produce oclcs zhu et al 2016 fig 5 and figure s12 show the mass difference network of all c12 compounds for cho and c14 compounds for chon in the i oxidation and i oxidation cl2 groups 13 c12 oics and 76 c12hnom formulas were detected and connections were found between 6 c12 oics and 73 c12hnom formulas fig 5e similarly 6 c14 oics and 62 c14hnomnx formulas were detected but no connections were found between c14 oics and c14hnomnx formulas fig 5f compared with chlorination and bromination reactions lower number of oics contributed to fewer connections compared with the precursors of oclcs and obrcs the detected precursors of oics had the highest o c and h c ratios fig 6 this could be due to the weakest strength of the c i bond and hoi would react more easily with altered dom with a higher o c ratio and more phenol groups li et al 2021 by considering electrophilic substitution and hoi addition as iodination pathways 29 35 and 25 00 of the corresponding precursors of unknown oics were matched in cho compounds in the i oxidation group by iodine substitution and hoi addition respectively table s10 in the i oxidation cl2 group only 15 87 and 11 11 of precursors were matched in cho compounds by iodine substitution and hoi addition respectively while no matching was observed for chon compounds 3 5 macromolecular x dbp formation induced by coexisting br and i according to previous study the generation of io3 is promoted by br in the chlorination process hu et al 2019 when chlorine bromide and iodide coexist hio io is easily produced via i oxidation by hbro bro and hclo clo and then i dbps are produced via reactions of hio io with organic matter subsequently br dbps and cl dbps are formed due to reactions of i dbps with hbro bro and hclo clo li et al 2021 the distribution of cho and chon compounds in van krevelen diagrams in the br i oxidation group was similar to that in the br oxidation group figure s1i but some formulas were concentrated in the unsaturated hydrocarbon components the concentrated unsaturated hydrocarbon components were probably iodine containing formulas and their markedly high proportion fig 1 indicated that br might promote the formation of unsaturated hydrocarbon components with iodine compared with the br oxidation group the aimod and dbewa of chon formulas in the br i oxidation group both decreased tables s3 s4 for the formed oxcs x br or i the distribution of obrcs and oics was markedly different in the aimod carbon number plot fig 3g and figure s3 g obrcs were mainly found in regions with carbon numbers less than 21 and aimod values above 0 5 while oics were partially found in highly unsaturated and phenolic structure regions the number of detected obrcs formulas decreased by 23 51 and 32 11 for cho and chon components in the br i oxidation group respectively fig 7c and figure s9c compared with those in the br oxidation group the number of two iodine containing formulas increased sharply by 135 71 for cho compounds and 200 for chon compounds in the br i oxidation group fig 9c and figure s11c respectively compared with those in the i oxidation group i2 can be generated by the reaction of hobr obr with i and br can enhance the kinetics of io3 formation criquet et al 2012 this promoted electrophilic iodocyclization yang et al 2011 resulted in the aggregation of abundant two iodine containing formulas in the unsaturated hydrocarbon region the unsaturated hydrocarbon components disappeared in the br i oxidation cl2 group figure s1j and the proportion of carbohydrates and lipids increased fig 1 the total intensities of the detected formulas decreased by 35 59 for cho formulas and 63 58 for chon formulas tables s3 s4 but were still higher than those in the br oxidation cl2 and i oxidation cl2 groups the distribution of oclcs and obrcs in the br i oxidation cl2 group was similar to that in the br oxidation cl2 group fig 3h and figure s3 h while the distribution of oics was similar to that in the i oxidation cl2 group the detailed distribution of oxcs is depicted in fig 4e and figure s4e oclcs fig 7d and figure s9d obrcs and fig 9d and figure s11d oics for oclcs the number of formed oclcs increased by 32 5 for cho formulas and 200 for chon formulas in the br i oxidation cl2 group compared with the absence of i for obrcs and oics the br i oxidation cl2 group exhibited a lower absolute intensity of organic bromine and iodine than the br i oxidation group i can promote the formation of oclcs and obrcs li et al 2021 and few changes in toi demonstrate the catalytic action of oics zhu et al 2016 peculiarly the significantly higher organohalogen increments might be attributed to the decreased electron density and weakened reactivity of oxcs x cl br by acylamino groups hu et al 2019 additionally the proportion of br oclcs absolute intensity in total oclcs absolute intensity was 54 25 for cho and 10 56 for chon compounds in the br i oxidation cl2 group the proportion of i oclcs in total oclcs absolute intensity was 6 19 for cho and 69 64 for chon compounds table s8 therefore the proportion of br oclcs in the coclcs was higher than that in the noclcs inversely the proportion of i oclcs in the noclcs was relatively higher fig 10 and figure s13 show the mass difference network of all c12 compounds for cho and c14 compounds for chon in the br i oxidation and br i oxidation cl2 groups the mass difference network of all c18 in the br i oxidation and br i oxidation cl2 groups is showed in figure s14 28 c12 obrcs 10 c12 oics and 72 c12hnom formulas were detected and connections were found between 26 c12 obrcs and 68 c12hnom formulas when mass differences of h2 o hobr and brh 1 were considered fig 10a connections were found between 5 c12 oics and 68 c12hnom formulas fig 10c similarly 7 c14 obrcs 3 c14 oics and 60 c14hnomnx formulas were detected and connections were found between 7 c14 obrcs and 44 c14hnomnx formulas fig 10b but no connections were found between c14 oics and c14hnomnx formulas fig 10d the bromination reaction and iodination reaction in the br i oxidation and br i oxidation cl2 groups had little distinction a total of 84 44 and 81 08 of precursors of macromolecular obrcs were assigned to cho and chon compounds in the br i oxidation group when bromine substitution was considered as the reaction pathway respectively table s9 and 71 21 and 68 92 of precursors were matched by hobr addition compared with the br oxidation group the reduction in the matching degree in the br i oxidation group could contribute to the participation of oics since hobr obr could react with oics to form obrcs similarly the matching degree of the corresponding precursors to unknown oics also decreased since br enhanced the formation of 2i oics after further chlorination the matching degree of oics in cho formulas increased to 19 86 for iodine substitution and 13 48 for hoi addition in the br i oxidation cl2 group this could be due to the increase in toi which consumed more hocl to form hoi more hoi could react with dom by electrophilic substitution to form oics hu et al 2019 4 conclusion this study found that plasma oxidation could effectively remove aromatic components in dom and increased the proportion of lignins and tannins therefore reducing oclcs production in subsequent chlorination br consumed radicals during dom preoxidation and promoted obrcs formation although these obrcs were reduced in the chlorination process the higher substitutability of bromine resulted in the predominance of br dbps in total x dbps oics acting as intermediates were substituted by hclo clo to produce oclcs especially chon formulas when br and i coexisted in water the formed two iodine containing formulas greatly increased in the dom preoxidation process and more reactive iodine was involved in the reactions between x hox and dom in chlorination therefore more obrcs and oclcs were produced in general i and br led to higher risks of macromolecular x dbp formation which should be given more attention the current van krevelen diagram applies only to the dom molecules being ppl extractable the detected formulas do not contain all molecules of dom additionally the structures of

15273,understanding the effects of halogens on the production of macromolecular disinfection byproducts dbps is critical for drinking water safety the effects of br and i on the chemical diversity of dissolved organic matter dom during plasma preoxidation and the subsequent formation of macromolecular halogenated dbps after chlorination were deciphered plasma preoxidation changed dom diversity from aromatic component oriented to lignin and tannin component oriented resulting in 62 0 and 21 2 decreases in n dbps ckhnomnzclx formulas and c dbps ckhnomclx formulas after chlorination respectively br could induce the formation of organobromine compounds obrcs during plasma oxidation however the intensities of obrcs decreased by 56 3 cho formulas and 75 2 chon formulas after further chlorination obrcs still accounted for 79 8 of the total organohalogen compounds oxcs x cl or br due to the higher substitutability of bromine i promoted oic production in the dom preoxidation process and oics acted as intermediates to form oclcs during chlorination when br and i coexisted br promoted oic production in the dom preoxidation process therefore more obrcs and oclcs were generated due to intermediates of oics in subsequent chlorination connections between oxcs and their precursors were established using network computation the precursors of oclcs were located in the aromatic structure region 0 2 h c 0 7 o c 0 67 those of obrcs and oics were located in the lignin 0 7 h c 1 5 0 1 o c 0 67 and tannin 0 6 h c 1 5 0 67 o c 1 0 regions with relatively greater h c and o c ratios respectively graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords disinfection byproducts ft icr ms dissolved organic matter br i data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction dissolved organic matter dom is ubiquitously present in surface water and it can lead to the production of disinfection byproducts dbps via reactions with disinfectants wang et al 2020a there have been extensive studies about the effects of different sources and fractions of dom on the formation of dbps lavonen et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 andersson et al 2019 li et al 2020a phungsai et al 2016 2018 2019 used orbitrap mass spectrometry to reveal the changes of dom characteristics in water treatment processes and found that ozonation treatment increased the saturated structure and oxidation extent of dom promoting the generation of subsequent dbps iodide i and bromide br are common halogen ions that can lead to the production of i dbps and br dbps with higher toxicities gao et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 it is important to explore the underlying mechanisms of br dbps and i dbps formation and develop effective methods to control their risks previous studies reported that br and i were oxidized by hocl ocl to produce hobr and hoi during chlorination disinfection which then reacted with dom to form traditional br dbps and i dbps westerhoff et al 2004 li et al 2021 hoi has a propensity to react with amino acid groups while hobr tends to react with phenols liu et al 2022 i dbps can act as intermediates and be substituted by hclo clo to produce traditional cl dbps zhu et al 2016 advanced oxidation processes aops based on oxidative radicals are generally used as preoxidation or deep purification of drinking water supply during aops br and i can be oxidized to halogen radicals i e x x2 and hox x i or br reactions 1 12 which then further react with dom to form oxcs organohalogen compounds x cl br or i gao et al 2020 wang et al 2020b ye et al 2021 aops can alter dom significantly and then affect the formation of traditional dbps gao et al 2020 found that traditional dbp formation derived from humic acid ha decreased in the presence of br in an uv cl2 treatment system but increased in the presence of i ding et al 2019 found that uv h2o2 pre oxidation could destroy the aromatic and dissolved organic nitrogen components of natural organic matter resulting in the reduction of n dbps formation previous studies reported that plasma oxidation could effectively remove various pollutants including organic pollutants algae and bacteria reducing potential risks in later water purification wang et al 2015 2018 srivastav et al 2020 in our previous studies a gas phase discharge plasma oxidation system effectively reduced the dissolved organic carbon doc aromaticity and molecular weight of commercial ha and increased o containing functional groups thus leading to a 42 68 decrease in traditional cl dbp formation in subsequent chlorination wang et al 2016a hu et al 2022 however the behaviors and transformation of bromine and iodine in plasma processing have not been systematically reported previous studies regarding the effects of br and i on dbps were mainly focused on traditional small molecular dbps while more than 70 of total organic halogens remain unknown koudjonou and lebel 2006 these halogenated dbps are mainly detected using gas chromatography liquid chromatography mass spectrometry although some new polar and or thermally labile dbps have been identified yang et al 2019 macromolecular aromatic dbps without standard compounds cannot be detected 1 x h o xo h 2 xo h x h o 3 x x x 2 4 x x x 2 5 x 2 x x x 2 6 x 2 x 2 2 x x 2 7 x 2 h 2 o hox x h 8 hox o x h 9 o 3 x o 2 o x 10 h 2 o 2 ob r b r h 2 o o 2 11 ob r e h h o b r 12 hocl b r c l hobr recently the structural diversity of dom and macromolecular dbps without standard compounds have been successfully identified by fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms which greatly increases the identification of dbps koch et al 2006 zhang et al 2012a lv et al 2016 by using the ft icr ms zhang et al 2012b detected 1007 macromolecular cl dbps derived from dom relative to traditional dbps haloacetic acids haloacetonitriles trihalomethanes etc composition and structure information of macromolecular i dbps and br dbps were also successively reported and 478 previously unreported br dbps and i dbps were found zhang et al 2014 wang et al 2016b in our recent study 1984 macromolecular n dbps such as c18hnnmozclx and 2486 c dbps such as c11hnomclx were identified using ft icr ms during chlorination of algal organic matter and they decreased by 60 when the algal organic matter was pretreated by plasma oxidation prior to chlorination wang et al 2022 therefore it is presumed that i and br would affect the production of macromolecular i dbps and br dbps during dom preoxidation chlorination therefore ft icr ms was applied to decipher the effects of br and i on macromolecular halogenated dbps derived from dom in plasma preoxidation chlorination treatment first the molecular diversity of dom and the formation of macromolecular cl dbps were explored during plasma preoxidation and chlorination treatment subsequently the formation processes of macromolecular obrcs and competitive relationships with oclcs were assessed in the presence of br as well as the oics after adding i then the effects of coexisting br and i on the production of oxcs x cl br i as well as their competitive relationships were deciphered finally links between these macromolecular dbps and their precursors were established using network computation 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals humic acid ha sigma aldrich h16752 was used as a model of dom as reported previously hu et al 2022 to prepare the ha working solutions ha was dissolved in ultrapure water and filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane finally the ha concentration was approximately 7 5 mg l 1 and the solution ph was 7 0 methanol lc ms grade was purchased from oceanpak sweden 2 2 ha treatment by plasma preoxidation a plasma preoxidation equipment was used to produce various reactive species oh o2 1o2 etc for ha oxidation treatment which was mainly consisted of a high voltage alternating current power source dalian university of technology china a reaction vessel and an aerator connected to the air pump hu et al 2022 as introduced in text s1 in the supplementary materials for each experiment 220 ml of ha solution 7 5 mg l 1 was treated under an electric power of 17 8 w 2 3 chlorination treatment after ha treatment by the plasma preoxidation chlorination tests were conducted using sodium hypochlorite in a mass concentration ratio of 1 3 c doc c cl2 zhu et al 2019 which was conducted batchwise the chlorination reaction time was 36 h and the residual chlorine was quenched using stoichiometric amounts of na2s2o3 to explore the effects of coexisting br and i ten experimental groups were set up including 1 ha without any treatment marked as ck 2 ha with chlorination marked as cl2 3 ha with plasma oxidation marked as oxidation 4 ha with plasma oxidation and chlorination marked as oxidation cl2 5 ha and br after plasma oxidation marked as br oxidation 6 ha and br after plasma oxidation and chlorination marked as br oxidation cl2 7 ha and i after plasma

br and i after plasma oxidation and chlorination marked as br i oxidation cl2 as depicted in table s1 herein the br concentration was 3 mg l 1 and the i concentration was 0 3 mg l 1 2 4 chemical diversity and macromolecular dbp identification prior to ft icr ms detection removal of inorganic salts in the dom samples was performed by an agilent bond elut ppl resin lv et al 2016 and the procedure is introduced in text s2 a solarix ft icr mass spectrometer 15t bruker germany was applied to analyze the chemical diversity and macromolecular dbps in dom under negative ionization mode of the electrospray ionization source by injecting 200 μl of sample directly texts s3 s4 gonsior et al 2019 xiang et al 2020 a van krevelen plot was used to characterize the relationships of the o c and h c ratios in dom zhang et al 2012a and table s2 lists the stoichiometric ranges of the classifications dom characteristics were also described using the modified aromatic index aimod koch et al 2006 and double bond equivalent dbe zhang et al 2021 in text s5 connections between macromolecular dbps and their precursors were analyzed using network computation by gephi software tziotis et al 2011 and the details are described in text s6 3 results and discussion 3 1 molecular diversity of ha during plasma preoxidation treatment fig 1 figure s1 and figure s2 depict the van krevelen diagrams of chon ckhnomnz formulas and cho ckhnom formulas compounds in ha in different treatment groups seven regions corresponded to major components present in ha including aromatic structures tannins lignins unsaturated hydrocarbons carbohydrates lipids and proteins amino sugars table s2 pan et al 2020 wang et al 2022 most molecules with aromatic components were distributed in o c 0 67 and 0 2 h c 0 7 in the ck group however the proportion of the aromatic components decreased from 72 83 to 25 35 cho compounds and from 91 61 to 48 21 chon compounds in the oxidation group fig 1 the total intensities of the aromatic components also decreased by 69 03 cho compounds and 57 48 chon compounds compared with the ck group figure s2 conversely the proportion of polyphenolic source lignin and tannin components increased and the total intensities of lignin and tannin components increased by 62 79 and 617 39 for cho compounds and 223 26 and 1901 5 for chon compounds compared with the ck group respectively figure s2 plasma oxidation treatment could increase the intensity of oh hu et al 2022 intriguingly compared with the ck the total intensities of cho and chon compounds dbe and aimod were all reduced in the oxidation group tables s3 s4 the visualized cho ckhnom formulas and chon ckhnomnz formulas formulas in the ck and oxidation groups are shown in fig 2 the formulas were divided into four conditions according to text s4 after plasma oxidation 1601 cho formulas and 772 chon formulas assigned in the ck group were degraded while 1633 cho formulas and 928 chon formulas with relatively higher o c ratios were newly formed fig 2a 2c the same phenomena were also observed in those formulas observed in both ck and oxidation groups the formulas with increased intensity after plasma oxidation showed relatively higher mean of o c ratios 0 55 for cho formulas 0 60 for chon formulas than those of the formulas with decreased intensity 0 46 for cho formulas 0 51 for chon formulas fig 2b 2d the increased o c ratios after plasma oxidation were probably due to the production of hydroxylated components via h abstraction and oh addition from aromatic components goldstone et al 2002 sonntag 2007 3 2 macromolecular cl dbps formation previous studies reported that cl dbps could be generated by the reactions of hocl with dom through oxidation addition and electrophilic substitution reactions deborde and gunten 2008 jiang et al 2020 compared with the oxidation group the number of carbons and dbes of dom and the proportions of lignin components further decreased in the oxidation cl2 group fig 1 and tables s3 s4 low molecular weight organics could be formed due to reactions of chlorine with lignin components with electron abundant functional groups lee et al 2007 prasse et al 2020 rodriguez et al 2020 the reduction rates of the total intensities of cho and chon compounds in the oxidation cl2 group further reached 62 61 and 75 72 respectively oh can react with phenolic and aromatic structures resulting in a higher electron donating capacity edc of dom and stronger reactivity with chlorine mvula and sonntag 2003 remucal et al 2020 fig 3 and figure s3 depict the distribution patterns of organochlorine compounds oclcs in cho and chon during chlorination based on the aimod values formulas could be assigned to polycyclic aromatic moieties aimod 0 67 aromatic moieties aimod 0 5 0 67 and unsaturated and or phenolic moieties h c 1 5 and aimod 0 5 lv et al 2016 oclcs were mainly distributed in the aromatic structures for the cl2 group and they were converted into a smaller number of carbon and lower aimod and highly unsaturated and phenolic structures in the oxidation cl2 group li et al 2017 xiang et al 2020 fig 4 and figure s4 show the distribution of the oclcs in the cho and chon compounds respectively the distribution of oclcs became more dispersed and turned to higher o c ratios in the oxidation cl2 group and the total numbers of unknown cl dbps also decreased from 321 to 253 for cho formulas and from 150 to 57 for chon formulas compared with the cl2 group the most significant reduction was observed for the one chlorine containing compounds similarly the total absolute intensity of organic chlorine also decreased in the oxidation cl2 group tables s5 s6 plasma oxidation enhanced reactions between dom and chlorine but the decrease in the precursors dominated the reduction of tocl xiang et al 2020 connections between macromolecular dbps and their precursors can be visualized by network computation tziotis et al 2011 gonsior et al 2019 xiang et al 2020 fig 5 and figure s5 show the mass difference network of all c12 compounds for cho and c14 compounds for chon in the oxidation cl2 and cl2 groups the mass difference network of all c18 compounds is showed in figure s6 hocl addition and electrophilic substitution were considered the dominant chlorination pathways 85 c12hnom formulas and 46 c12 dbps were detected among which 80 c12hnom and 33 c12 dbps were connected by considering mass differences of clh 1 hocl h2 and o fig 5a similarly 70 c14hnomnx formulas and 14 c14 dbps were detected among which 54 c14hnomnx and 10 c14 dbps were connected fig 5b similar changes were also observed for the c18 compounds chlorination reactions hardly occurred with the position of o 8 therefore the o c ratio of the precursors of dbps could be defined through ft icr ms to further confirm this hypothesis the chemical compositions of the total oclcs precursors were evaluated as shown in fig 6 interestingly nearly all potential oclcs precursors for both hocl addition and chlorine substitution pathways were found to be located within the aromatic structure region of the van krevelen diagram a total of 62 42 and 58 00 of precursors of oclcs were assigned to chlorine substitution in coclcs and noclcs in the ck group respectively 53 10 and 46 00 of precursors were matched by hocl addition in coclcs and noclcs respectively table s7 plasma oxidation could reduce the matching degree for the oxidation group only 40 71 and 22 81 of the corresponding precursors were matched in coclcs and noclcs by chlorine substitution this phenomenon could be due to the increased reactivity and reaction type of altered dom with hocl by oxidation xiang et al 2020 in addition the h c and o c of screened precursors in the ck and oxidation groups were compared as shown in figure s7 the mean o c of cho formulas increased by 15 02 and 19 90 in the oxidation group for hocl addition and chlorine substitution respectively compared with those in the ck similar phenomena also occurred for the h c in general plasma oxidation resulted in higher h c and o c ratios of precursors which was due to the increased phenol groups and enhanced reactivity with chlorine rodriguez and gunten 2020 li et al 2020b figure s8 shows the changes in aimod of precursor found oclcs and precursor unfound oclcs in the cl2 and oxidation cl2 groups by two chlorination pathways for the cl2 group the mean aimod of precursor unfound groups decreased by 13 16 and 17 03 for cho and chon formulas by chlorine substitution pathway respectively compared with those of precursor found groups figure s8a the oxidation cl2 group exhibited more obvious decreases than the cl2 group figure s8c compared with the chlorine substitution pathway the reduction was relatively gentler for the hocl addition pathway and the mean aimod of the precursor unfound groups only decreased by 4 44 8 58 figure s8d therefore oclcs were converted into lower aimod highly unsaturated and phenolic structures after the plasma oxidation electron transfer et and electrophilic aromatic substitution eas are involved in the reactions between chlorine and phenolic compounds and these reactions are affected by the substituent position and electronic properties of the aromatic ring gallard and gunten 2002 due to the hydroxylation of dom and conversion to tannins and lignins after plasma oxidation the ratio of the et reaction would increase which would result in the formation of new oclcs 3 3 macromolecular br dbp formation induced by coexisting br br can compete for oh westerhoff et al 2004 and affects the degradation of ha which then results in the formation of br dbps plewa et al 2010 compared with the oxidation group the detected cho and chon formulas were shifted to the region with a lower o c ratio in the br oxidation group figure s1e similarly the br oxidation group exhibited lower h c and o c ratios than the oxidation group tables s3 s4 additionally aimod increased 23 91 for cho formulas and 15 79 for chon formulas and dbewa increased 16 21 for cho formulas and 13 12 for chon formulas in the br oxidation group compared with the oxidation group as well as the proportions of the aromatic components in cho and chon compounds fig 1 and figure s2 therefore br inhibited ha conversion during plasma oxidation which was due to the competition of br for radicals reactions 1 12 lee et al 2020 wang et al 2020c lei et al 2021 2021 resulting in reactions between hobr and dom and further obrcs formation the formed obrcs were mainly found in the aromatic structures with high carbon numbers fig 2c and figure s3c 336 cobrcs and 109 nobrcs formulas in 0 2 h c 1 5 and 0 3 o c 0 9 were detected in the br oxidation group fig 7 a and figure s9a compounds containing one br were the main products which could be attributed to the adequate reaction sites of dom and electron withdrawing groups br that led to lower reaction activities li et al 2020 the electron cloud density on the benzene ring could be reduced by halogens which hindered electrophilic substitution hu et al 2002 the br oxidation cl2 group exhibited lower numbers of carbon dbe aimod and total intensities of formulas after chlorination than the br oxidation group tables s3 s4 additionally the high carbon number of obrcs c 18 nearly disappeared after chlorination fig 3d and figure s3d the obrcs formed in the plasma oxidation process could partially consume hocl and then hobr was produced through reactions of released br and hocl reaction 12 resulting in the circulation of br and organobromine wang et al 2020 in the presence of br the number of formed oclcs was sharply reduced by 84 19 for cho formulas and 92 98 for chon formulas fig 4c and figure s4c for obrcs the number of br containing formulas was reduced by 56 25 for cho formulas and 75 23 for chon formulas fig 7b and figure s9b this could be attributed to the release of br during obrcs oxidation by hocl and substitution of bromine by chlorine detenchuk et al 2022 previous study reported that the released br would be reoxidized to hobr by chlorine which then resulted in electrophilic substitution of chlorinated dom sites wang et al 2020 notably compared with the oxidation cl2 group there were 74 18 96 60 decreases in the total absolute intensity of organic chlorine for cho and chon components in the br oxidation cl2 group obrcs and br can partially consume chlorine heeb et al 2014 2017 the higher reduction ratio for chon formulas may be due to the reaction of n containing moieties with bromine and chlorine through an oxidation reduction process which act as competitors with the phenolic groups heeb et al 2014 criquet et al 2015 additionally the high proportion of br oclcs in the total oclcs absolute intensity further proved that chlorine could react with obrcs resulting in the production of br cl dbps table s8 fig 5 and figure s10 show the mass difference network of all c12 compounds for cho and c14 compounds for chon in the br oxidation and br oxidation cl2 groups a total of 31 c12 obrcs and 75 c12hnom formulas were detected and connections were found between 30 c12 obrcs and 73 c12hnom formulas when mass differences of h2 o hobr and brh 1 were considered fig 5c similarly 7 c14 obrcs and 54 c14hnomnx formulas were detected and connections were found between 7 c14 obrcs and 39 c14hnomnx formulas fig 5d compared with chlorination bromination reactions were located in the region with a higher oxygen number this indicated that the precursors of obrcs might contain more oxygen than precursors of oclcs compared with the precursors of oclcs the detected precursors of obrcs were mainly in the lignin and tannin regions with higher ratios of h c and o c fig 8 a total of 86 90 and 95 08 of precursors of macromolecular obrcs were assigned to cho and chon compounds in the br oxidation group when bromine substitution was considered as the reaction pathway respectively while 74 70 and 70 49 of precursors were matched by hobr addition table s9 however the matching was reduced to 68 71 and 55 56 for cho and chon compounds by bromine substitution and 51 70 and 37 04 by hobr addition in the br oxidation cl2 group this could be attributed to the increase in the proportion of et reactions between altered dom and hox x br or cl after plasma oxidation resulting in precursors with lower aromaticity and number of carbons tables s3 s4 3 4 macromolecular i dbp formation induced by coexisting i the formation of i dbps has recently attracted wide attention due to their highly toxicological effects ye et al 2021 the i oxidation group exhibited a higher proportion of unsaturated hydrocarbon components in the cho and chon compounds than the oxidation group figure s1 and fig 1 i can be oxidized to hoi reactions 13 17 vogt et al 1999 halfacre et al 2019 and then converted into organoiodine compounds oics ye et al 2012 du et al 2022 compared with the oxidation group aimod and dbewa increased by 6 52 and 5 69 for cho formulas in the i oxidation group tables s3 s4 indicating a reduction in the removal of aromatic components and unsaturated bonds the formed oics were quite different from oclcs and obrcs since a large proportion of oics with highly unsaturated and or phenolic moieties was found aimod 0 50 fig 3e and figure s3e 92 coic and 66 noic formulas containing 1 2 iodine were detected in the i oxidation group fig 9 and figure s10 13 h 2 o 2 i o h hoi 14 2 i io 3 3 h 3 hoi 15 hocl i c l hoi 16 hocl hoi c l io 2 2 h 17 hocl io 2 c l io 3 h after further chlorination the total intensities decreased sharply by 51 16 and 62 60 for cho and chon components in the i oxidation cl2 group respectively as well as for dbewa and aimod tables s3 s4 fig 3f and figure s3f this indicated that the presence of i could promote the reaction between the chon component and chlorine resulting in the formation of carbohydrate and lipid components fig 1b and figure s2b a previous study also found that hoi was more likely to react with nitrogenous organic matter such as amino acids hu et al 2021 i promoted the formation of formulas containing one chlorine but decreased the number of formulas containing 2 3 chlorine elements fig 4d and figure s4d overall compared with the oxidation cl2 group the number of i containing formulas increased by 36 96 for coics and was slightly reduced by 10 61 for noics in the i oxidation cl2 group figure s11 and fig 9 i containing formulas with one iodine became the main oics which were mostly distributed in lignins cram like regions du et al 2022 different from bromine iodine would be further incorporated with dom during chlorination and hoi and new oics would be formed by reactions of inorganic iodine i2 i etc and hocl kristiana et al 2009 detenchuk et al 2022 notably there were 21 07 and 3 86 decreases in the total absolute intensity of organic chlorine for cho and chon components respectively and the tocl ti ratio also decreased for cho and chon formulas in the i oxidation cl2 group compared with no i presence the reduction of oclcs could be due to the partial consumption of chlorine by iodine in addition the total absolute intensity of organic chlorine in the i oxidation cl2 group was much higher than that in the br oxidation cl2 group since the bond energies of ccl c br and c i were ranked as ccl c br c i li et al 2021 the formed oics would function as intermediates and be substituted by hclo clo to produce oclcs zhu et al 2016 fig 5 and figure s12 show the mass difference network of all c12 compounds for cho and c14 compounds for chon in the i oxidation and i oxidation cl2 groups 13 c12 oics and 76 c12hnom formulas were detected and connections were found between 6 c12 oics and 73 c12hnom formulas fig 5e similarly 6 c14 oics and 62 c14hnomnx formulas were detected but no connections were found between c14 oics and c14hnomnx formulas fig 5f compared with chlorination and bromination reactions lower number of oics contributed to fewer connections compared with the precursors of oclcs and obrcs the detected precursors of oics had the highest o c and h c ratios fig 6 this could be due to the weakest strength of the c i bond and hoi would react more easily with altered dom with a higher o c ratio and more phenol groups li et al 2021 by considering electrophilic substitution and hoi addition as iodination pathways 29 35 and 25 00 of the corresponding precursors of unknown oics were matched in cho compounds in the i oxidation group by iodine substitution and hoi addition respectively table s10 in the i oxidation cl2 group only 15 87 and 11 11 of precursors were matched in cho compounds by iodine substitution and hoi addition respectively while no matching was observed for chon compounds 3 5 macromolecular x dbp formation induced by coexisting br and i according to previous study the generation of io3 is promoted by br in the chlorination process hu et al 2019 when chlorine bromide and iodide coexist hio io is easily produced via i oxidation by hbro bro and hclo clo and then i dbps are produced via reactions of hio io with organic matter subsequently br dbps and cl dbps are formed due to reactions of i dbps with hbro bro and hclo clo li et al 2021 the distribution of cho and chon compounds in van krevelen diagrams in the br i oxidation group was similar to that in the br oxidation group figure s1i but some formulas were concentrated in the unsaturated hydrocarbon components the concentrated unsaturated hydrocarbon components were probably iodine containing formulas and their markedly high proportion fig 1 indicated that br might promote the formation of unsaturated hydrocarbon components with iodine compared with the br oxidation group the aimod and dbewa of chon formulas in the br i oxidation group both decreased tables s3 s4 for the formed oxcs x br or i the distribution of obrcs and oics was markedly different in the aimod carbon number plot fig 3g and figure s3 g obrcs were mainly found in regions with carbon numbers less than 21 and aimod values above 0 5 while oics were partially found in highly unsaturated and phenolic structure regions the number of detected obrcs formulas decreased by 23 51 and 32 11 for cho and chon components in the br i oxidation group respectively fig 7c and figure s9c compared with those in the br oxidation group the number of two iodine containing formulas increased sharply by 135 71 for cho compounds and 200 for chon compounds in the br i oxidation group fig 9c and figure s11c respectively compared with those in the i oxidation group i2 can be generated by the reaction of hobr obr with i and br can enhance the kinetics of io3 formation criquet et al 2012 this promoted electrophilic iodocyclization yang et al 2011 resulted in the aggregation of abundant two iodine containing formulas in the unsaturated hydrocarbon region the unsaturated hydrocarbon components disappeared in the br i oxidation cl2 group figure s1j and the proportion of carbohydrates and lipids increased fig 1 the total intensities of the detected formulas decreased by 35 59 for cho formulas and 63 58 for chon formulas tables s3 s4 but were still higher than those in the br oxidation cl2 and i oxidation cl2 groups the distribution of oclcs and obrcs in the br i oxidation cl2 group was similar to that in the br oxidation cl2 group fig 3h and figure s3 h while the distribution of oics was similar to that in the i oxidation cl2 group the detailed distribution of oxcs is depicted in fig 4e and figure s4e oclcs fig 7d and figure s9d obrcs and fig 9d and figure s11d oics for oclcs the number of formed oclcs increased by 32 5 for cho formulas and 200 for chon formulas in the br i oxidation cl2 group compared with the absence of i for obrcs and oics the br i oxidation cl2 group exhibited a lower absolute intensity of organic bromine and iodine than the br i oxidation group i can promote the formation of oclcs and obrcs li et al 2021 and few changes in toi demonstrate the catalytic action of oics zhu et al 2016 peculiarly the significantly higher organohalogen increments might be attributed to the decreased electron density and weakened reactivity of oxcs x cl br by acylamino groups hu et al 2019 additionally the proportion of br oclcs absolute intensity in total oclcs absolute intensity was 54 25 for cho and 10 56 for chon compounds in the br i oxidation cl2 group the proportion of i oclcs in total oclcs absolute intensity was 6 19 for cho and 69 64 for chon compounds table s8 therefore the proportion of br oclcs in the coclcs was higher than that in the noclcs inversely the proportion of i oclcs in the noclcs was relatively higher fig 10 and figure s13 show the mass difference network of all c12 compounds for cho and c14 compounds for chon in the br i oxidation and br i oxidation cl2 groups the mass difference network of all c18 in the br i oxidation and br i oxidation cl2 groups is showed in figure s14 28 c12 obrcs 10 c12 oics and 72 c12hnom formulas were detected and connections were found between 26 c12 obrcs and 68 c12hnom formulas when mass differences of h2 o hobr and brh 1 were considered fig 10a connections were found between 5 c12 oics and 68 c12hnom formulas fig 10c similarly 7 c14 obrcs 3 c14 oics and 60 c14hnomnx formulas were detected and connections were found between 7 c14 obrcs and 44 c14hnomnx formulas fig 10b but no connections were found between c14 oics and c14hnomnx formulas fig 10d the bromination reaction and iodination reaction in the br i oxidation and br i oxidation cl2 groups had little distinction a total of 84 44 and 81 08 of precursors of macromolecular obrcs were assigned to cho and chon compounds in the br i oxidation group when bromine substitution was considered as the reaction pathway respectively table s9 and 71 21 and 68 92 of precursors were matched by hobr addition compared with the br oxidation group the reduction in the matching degree in the br i oxidation group could contribute to the participation of oics since hobr obr could react with oics to form obrcs similarly the matching degree of the corresponding precursors to unknown oics also decreased since br enhanced the formation of 2i oics after further chlorination the matching degree of oics in cho formulas increased to 19 86 for iodine substitution and 13 48 for hoi addition in the br i oxidation cl2 group this could be due to the increase in toi which consumed more hocl to form hoi more hoi could react with dom by electrophilic substitution to form oics hu et al 2019 4 conclusion this study found that plasma oxidation could effectively remove aromatic components in dom and increased the proportion of lignins and tannins therefore reducing oclcs production in subsequent chlorination br consumed radicals during dom preoxidation and promoted obrcs formation although these obrcs were reduced in the chlorination process the higher substitutability of bromine resulted in the predominance of br dbps in total x dbps oics acting as intermediates were substituted by hclo clo to produce oclcs especially chon formulas when br and i coexisted in water the formed two iodine containing formulas greatly increased in the dom preoxidation process and more reactive iodine was involved in the reactions between x hox and dom in chlorination therefore more obrcs and oclcs were produced in general i and br led to higher risks of macromolecular x dbp formation which should be given more attention the current van krevelen diagram applies only to the dom molecules being ppl extractable the detected formulas do not contain all molecules of dom additionally the structures of

15274,sediment is the primary hotspot for microbial production of toxic and bio accumulative methylmercury mehg common remediation strategies such as sediment dredging and capping can be too expensive and cannot degrade mehg efficiently here we constructed an escherichia coli strain overexpressing merb gene dh5α j23106 and assessed the effectiveness of this recombinant strain in degradation of mehg in culture medium and sediment dh5α j23106 can efficiently degrade mehg with initial concentration from 0 01 to 50 ng ml to more than 81 6 in a culture medium under anoxic and oxic conditions enriched isotope addition 199hgcl2 revealed that this recombinant strain can degrade 78 6 of newly produced me199hg in actual sediment however the biodegradation decreased to 36 3 for intrinsic mehg degradation of spiked mehg after aging in anoxic and oxic sediments further demonstrated dh5α j23106 can efficiently degrade newly produced mehg and the degradation decreased with aging significantly especially for oxic sediment eight sediments were further assessed for the biodegradation of aged mehg by dh5α j23106 under oxic conditions with degradation ratios ranging from 9 0 to 66 9 when combined with nh4 2s2o3 leaching the degradation of mehg increased by 15 8 38 8 in on site and off site modes through enhanced mehg bioavailability in some of these sediments thus this recombinant strain dh5α j23106 can degrade mehg efficiently and have the potential for remediating bioavailable mehg in contaminated sediments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords methylmercury microbial remediation mehg sediment ammonium thiosulfate bioavailability data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction mercury hg as a potent neurotoxin can pose severe risks to ecology and human health even at very low environmental concentration driscoll et al 2013 zahir et al 2005 although all chemical forms of hg are toxic public health concerns are mainly focused on methylmercury mehg due to its bioaccumulation and biomagnification of humans by the consumption of contaminated fish davidson et al 1998 mozaffarian and rimm 2006 and rice li et al 2010 zhang et al 2010 in aquatic environments mehg is primarily produced by anaerobic hg methylating microorganisms in sediment ma et al 2019 regnell and watras 2019 and then diffused into overlying water benoit et al 2009 hammerschmidt et al 2006 resulting in mehg accumulation in aquatic food web therefore it is crucial to develop remediation techniques for mehg removal in sediment and thus reduce its risk to ecology and human health dredging and on site capping miller and gustin 2013 could be efficient in physical removal or barriering mehg as mehg is not chemically degraded in these processes subsequent transport and release of it is often inevitable e g resuspension of mehg with particle bloom and lasorsa 1999 kim et al 2006 and diffusion and uptake of mehg into overlying water and benthic organisms through tidal pumping groundwater flow and bioturbation curtis et al 2019 liu et al 2001 in recent decades low cost bioremediation especially biodegradation has been developed to treat mehg pollution omichinski 2007 however biodegradation using wild type organisms often has some shortcomings e g poor stress resistance low degradation efficiency and complex regulation network for the expression of target enzymes fortunato et al 2005 singh et al 2011 for 16 hg resistant bacteria isolated from hg contaminated sites the degradation efficiency of mehg ranged from 0 to 90 in culture medium with most strains less than 20 cabral et al 2013 a threshold concentration of organomercurial thiomersal was necessary for pseudomonas putida spi3 expressing mer operon in more cells to initiate its degradation fortunato et al 2005 to solve the shortcomings of traditional bioremediation synthetic biology as a more predictable tool has been used to integrate specific genes into suitable biological systems such as plants and microorganisms to enhance the tolerance to and the degradation efficiency of mehg capeness and horsfall 2020 singh et al 2011 among them the most well known method is integrating or increasing the expression of merb enzyme capable of cleaving the chg bound of organomercurials julien et al 2008 which could considerably increase the biodegradation of mehg barkay et al 2003 benison et al 2004 schaefer et al 2004 in early studies these merb transgenic attempts were focused on plants li et al 2020 nagata et al 2010 ruiz et al 2003 however the remediation by transgenic plants would be limited due to the facts that 1 the prerequisite for degradation of mehg by merb transgenic plants is its root absorption but the plant root biomass limits its contact with soil interface and subsequent internalization and degradation of mehg 2 soil is not a hotspot for microbial synthesis of mehg therefore the applicability of merb transgenic plants in sediment the concerned site of mehg production is still an open question compared with plants microorganisms have several cutting edges to degrade mehg including a higher growth rate the ability to thrive in a nutrient poor environment and a convenient genetic manipulation platform in recent years merb directly expressed or regulated by mer operon in microorganisms has been constructed to degrade mehg in culture medium or water kane et al 2016 takanezawa et al 2019 however the mehg degradation efficiency obtained by directly expressed method is unstable because merb gene is just an ancillary component of the mer operon chien et al 2010 in addition merb downstream of mer operon and its transcription is relatively weak huang et al 1999 therefore it is essential to design a strong promoter for merb gene to increase its degradation efficiency of mehg more importantly mehg in sediment is primarily associated with minerals zhong and wang 2010 and organic matters lawrence et al 1999 and often has low bioavailability thus a strategy should be developed to enhance the microbial availability of mehg and the degradation remediation of mehg in sediment considering the aspects mentioned above the objectives of this study were to 1 construct a recombinant e coli strain with overexpressing merb gene and 2 apply it to degrade mehg in contaminated sediment various recombinant merb overexpressed dh5α strains with different promoters were constructed and screened for mehg degradation after evaluating its mehg degradation efficiency in a culture medium a recombinant strain dh5α j23106 was used to degrade mehg in actual contaminated sediments and spiked sediments with different aging furthermore ammonium thiosulfate nh4 2s2o3 was applied as a leaching agent to enhance the on site or off site mehg degradation in different sediments using dh5α j23106 2 materials and methods 2 1 construction of recombinant strains expressing merb under the control of promoters with different strength the merb gene genbank

protein rfp expression from registry of standard biological parts http parts igem org part bba j23101 among the 7 promoters bba j23119 was the consensus promoter sequence and the others originated from it by sequence mutation table s1 firstly bba j23119 was inserted into the plasmid puc57 merb by amplifying the whole plasmid using primers j23119f and j23119r table s2 and then the generated linear pcr fragment was self ligated by t4 dna ligase to form plasmid puc57 merb j23119 sequence of puc57 merb j23119 was listed in table s3 then other 6 plasmids puc57 merb j23103 puc57 merb j23104 puc57 merb j23105 puc57 merb j23106 puc57 merb j23107 and puc57 merb j23109 were conducted by amplifying puc57 merb j23119 using corresponding primers table s2 and the generated linear pcr fragment was self ligated by t4 dna ligase the constructed plasmids were extracted and sequenced in sangon biotech beijing to ensure the accuracy of nucleotide sequence the resultant plasmids were transformed into competent e coli dh5α respectively to form recombinant strain dh5α j23103 dh5α j23104 dh5α j23105 dh5α j23106 dh5α j23107 dh5α j23109 and dh5α j23119 after that the recombinant strains were grown at 30 in luria bertani lb medium containing 100 μg ml ampicillin amp in room air in the meantime dh5α harboring puc57 plasmid was used as a control 2 2 assays of mehg degradation by a variety of recombinant strains in culture medium to evaluate the degradation effect residual mehg was measured after incubated with recombinant strains in a culture medium briefly recombinant strains were firstly cultured in lb medium and harvested at exponential phase optical density od 0 6 at 600 nm lb was later replaced by a bmaa medium to avoid possible complexation decreased mehg bioavailability stenzler et al 2017 then mehg was added to 10 ml bmaa medium to get a final 1 ng ml concentration for different strains with cell density of 0 6 109 cells ml this concentration is comparable to that of engineered strains to remediate hg pollution in previous studies fortunato et al 2005 zhang et al 2013 after incubation for 40 mins cell pellet and supernatant were separated by centrifugation at 9055 g for 10 min detailed procedures for sample digestion and mehg analysis are described in supporting information for quantifying the transcripts level of merb gene in different recombinant strains by real time quantitative pcr qpcr total rna of 7 recombinant strains were extracted using an rna extraction kit rnaprep pure cell bacteria kit tiangen china according to manufacturer s instruction residual genome dna was eliminated and cdna synthesis was performed at the same time by a fast king gdna dispelling rt supermix tiangen china to quantify merb transcript levels cdna of 7 recombinant strains was amplified by qpcr using sybr green i reagent sybr superreal premix plus tiangen china the primers for merb and 16srdna genes were as follows 16srdna forward primer 5 agagtttgatcatggctcagattga3 and 16srdna reverse primer 5 cgttatgcggtattagctaccg3 merb forward primer 5 tactgcgagagctcgccaagg3 and merb reverse primer 5 aagacatacgaagtctcgcgc3 j23119 was chosen as the control group to represent the change of the transcript level of merb in other 6 strains 2 3 assays of mehg degradation by dh5α j23106 in culture medium dh5α j23106 was selected for subsequent study due to its high mehg degradation efficiency tolerance of dh5α j23106 to mehg was firstly assessed by its growth curve in bmaa medium with 0 500 ng ml mehg cell density was monitored to evaluate its tolerance through its absorbance at 600 nm by microplate reader varoskan flash thermo scientific usa the growth curve of dh5α puc57 as control was monitored simultaneously mehg was primarily synthesized in anoxic sediment and then migrated to adjacent oxic water chen et al 2008 gill et al 1999 therefore the degradation efficiency of mehg by dh5α j23106 in both anoxic oxic conditions was evaluated anoxic medium was prepared in serum bottles and purged with ultrahigh purity nitrogen 400 ml min for 30 mins oxic medium was prepared in room air all mediums were sterilized with an autoclave sterilizer mls 3781 l phc corporation japan at 121 for 20 mins subsequent procedures for anoxic groups were carried out in an anoxic chamber atmosphere of 80 n2 10 h2 and 10 co2 aw400sg electrotek uk and oxic groups were treated in room air cells were harvested at mid log growth phase od600 0 6 in lb and washed three times with bmaa medium then dh5α j23106 was added to 10 ml bmaa medium and cell density was adjusted to 0 6 109 cells ml before mehg addition finally samples were retrieved at 10 40 and 90 mins after mehg addition and centrifuged to separate cell pellet and supernatant samples were frozen at 20 till analysis parallel in triplicate and control of dh5α puc57 was set for all experimental groups 2 4 sediment collection and preparation nine sediment samples from different lakes were collected to evaluate the degradation of mehg by dh5α j23106 sediment sa contaminated due to historical chlor alkali production was selected as an actual matrix to evaluate remediation effect total organic carbon toc and other geochemistry properties of sediment may influence the bioavailability of mehg liu et al 2008 shi et al 2005 and eight sediments s1 s8 with a range of toc content were used to evaluate mehg degradation samples were collected using shipek grab from different lakes and transferred to laboratory in black sealed bags after collection sa sediment was preserved at room temperature and s1 s8 sediment samples were freeze dried homogenized and sieved through 2 mm mesh additional site information and sediment geochemical properties are provided in table s4 2 5 degradation of newly produced me199hg and intrinsic aged mehg in mercury contaminated sediment mehg is primarily produced by anaerobic hg methylating microorganisms in sediment ma et al 2019 regnell and watras 2019 sample sa were selected to assess degradation effect of newly produced and intrinsic aged mehg in hg contaminated sediment enriched isotope 199hgcl2 was spiked to evaluate the degradation of newly produced me199hg by dh5α j23106 briefly 3 g fresh sediment were weighed into 50 ml corning vial in anoxic chamber then 199hgcl2 was spiked into the sediment to get a final concentration of 200 ng 199hg g sediment wet weight the spiked concentration of 199hg ⅱ was at approximately 9 5 of the ambient total hg samples without dh5α j23106 were set as control to evaluate

sediment triplicate was employed for each treatment after incubation for 24 h at 30 samples were taken out from anaerobic chamber and freeze dried at 40 for later analysis hg isotopes 202 200 199 were monitored for mehg by gas chromatography inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry gc icpms shen et al 2021 2 6 assay of newly formed and aged mehg degradation in sediment under anoxic oxic conditions to investigate the effect of aging and oxygen on mehg degradation by dh5α j23106 sediment s6 was randomly chosen for spiking experiment freeze dried sediment 350 g was weighed into a 500 ml glass beaker and sterilized at 121 for 2 h after that 200 ml of heating sterilized water was added to construct a slurry system for anoxic groups the slurry was purged with ultrahigh purity nitrogen 200 ml min for 2 h to remove oxygen and transferred to anoxic chamber then mehg was spiked to get the final concentration of 10 ng g calculated based on dry weight the spiked mehg concentration is much higher than mehg background 0 003 0 150 ng g in table s4 but similar to polluted sediments with mehg concentration of 4 90 ng g skyllberg et al 2007 after that the beakers were sealed with air permeable sealing film 16 16 mm diameter labgic technology co beijing china and covered with aluminum foil to prevent possible photolysis of mehg in an anoxic chamber except for purging with nitrogen oxic groups were prepared simultaneously and leaved at dark in room air considering that the bioavailability of mehg would be decreased with aging jonsson et al 2014 zhong and wang 2006 aging time 0 10 and 40 days of mehg in sediment was assessed on its degradation by dh5α j23106 in addition diffusive gradients in thin films dgt lspb ap dgt research ltd lancaster la2 0qj uk was used to monitor bioavailable mehg in anoxic oxic sediments aging for 10 days detailed information about dgt procedure was provided in supporting information after 0 10 or 40 days aging 30 g of well stirred slurry was added to a 50 ml sterilized beaker and then dh5α j23106 was added with a final density of 0 33 109 cells g concentration based on wet weight of sediment and divided into 15 ml corning tubes groups without any e coli strain or with dh5α were used for comparison total cultivated number of dh5α j23106 was measured by counting colony forming units cfu in anoxic oxic sediment after 24 h exposure detailed information was described in supporting information then triplicate vials for each trial were taken out after adding the strains defined as 0 h or after 24 h treatment and immediately frozen at 20 all samples were freeze dried at 40 by a vacuum freeze dryer pilot10 15 m biocool beijing china homogenized sieved 100 mesh and stored at 20 for further investigations 2 7 assays for mehg degradation by dh5α j23106 in combination with nh4 2s2o3 leaching for different sediments s1 s8 samples table s4 were evaluated for the degradation of mehg by dh5α j23106 after 40 days aging generally 40 g of freeze dried sediments were added to a 50 ml glass beaker and then sterilized at 121 for 2 h then sterilized water was added to obtain slurry without obvious overlying water detailed information in table s5 after that sediments were spiked with mehg to form a final concentration of 10 ng g calculated based on dry weight of sediment samples were covered with air permeable sealing film placed in dark and incubated for 40 days in room air nh4 2s2o3 can solubilize particle bound mehg in soils and enhance its bioavailability zhu et al 2015 in our study it was used to increase the bioavailable mehg and thus its degradation by dh5α j23106 after evaluating the influence of 1 50 mmol l nh4 2s2o3 on mehg degradation by dh5α j23106 and leachable ratio of sediment s6 10 mmol l nh4

dried at 60 in an oven until constant weight to monitor the moisture the residual sediment slurry samples were freeze dried at 40 for further investigation then 2 g dried sediments and 10 ml bmaa solution with or without 10 mmol l nh4 2s2o3 were added into 50 ml corning tubes and shaken at 300 rpm for 4 h four treatments were compared to evaluate the degradation efficiency of mehg by dh5α j23106 1 on site direct degradation where dh5α j23106 was added into the sediment directly 2 on site degradation combined with nh4 2s2o3 leaching where dh5α j23106 was added into the slurry after 4 h nh4 2s2o3 leaching 3 off site degradation combined with nh4 2s2o3 leaching in which after nh4 2s2o3 leaching the slurry was centrifuged at 9055 g for 5 mins and filtered with 0 45 μm membrane before dh5α j23106 addition into the filtrate 4 the control group where no dh5α j23106 were added into the sediment the final cell density of dh5α j23106 was 0 33 109 cells g for dry weight of sediment and samples were shaken at 30 for 24 h at 200 rpm in addition total cultivated number of dh5α j23106 in different sediments was measured after that the mixtures were centrifuged at 9055 g for 5 min then the supernatant was filtered by a 0 45 μm membrane and the sediment samples were freeze dried at 40 and stored at 20 for further analysis 2 8 determination of mehg and other ancillary parameters the supporting information provides detailed analytical procedures for mehg in cell pellet supernatant sediment and other ancillary parameters 2 9 quality assurance and quality control all reagents used in this study were of analytical or higher grade and obtained from shanghai chemicals company shanghai china or merck life science germany glassware was cleaned in 10 hcl and ultra pure water followed by burning in a muffle furnace 3 550 neytech usa at 500 for 30 min to ensure hg free triplicate analyses were employed for each treatment the relative standard deviations of triplicate samples ranged from 0 01 to 14 2 for mehg within the acceptable limits of epa 1630 method for mehg 15 the recoveries of mehg for matrix spikes and certified reference material sediment gbw08308 were 79 7 102 and 77 9 112 respectively which were within the acceptable recoveries of epa 1630 method 65 135 for mehg the procedure blank of mehg was 5 pg for a 0 2 ml sample for each sample batch 9 samples sample check blanks and standard solutions were included 2 10 statistical analysis statistical analysis of the data was performed using the spss 16 software one way analysis of variance anova with duncan s post hoc test was performed to test the differences between direct degradation on site degradation combined with nh4 2s2o3 leaching and off site degradation combined with nh4 2s2o3 leaching statistical significances were defined at p 0 05 indicating significant differences shapiro wilk test was applied to assess the normality of data and only ph was non normal distribution then pearson s correlation coefficient was applied to characterize the influence of sediments geochemistry toc fe and mn on mehg degradation by dh5α j23106 the relationships between mehg degradation by dh5α j23106 and nh4 2s2o3 leachable mehg for different sediments spearman s correlation coefficient was used to characterize ph on mehg degradation by dh5α j23106 3 results and discussion 3 1 construct recombinant e coli strains and evaluation of their performance on mehg degradation in a culture medium seven recombinant plasmids table s1 were transformed into e coli dh5α to form corresponding recombinant strains residual mehg was measured to evaluate the degradation efficiency of mehg by these recombinant strains in bmaa culture medium as shown in fig 1 a after 40 min incubation residual mehg was mainly present in on the cell 74 8 but not in the supernatant suggesting that the spiked mehg was adsorbed on or internalized in cell there was no significant degradation of mehg for e coli dh5α residual mehg 85 5 except for dh5α j23119 with the consensus promoter sequence bba j23119 residual mehg 24 9 and recombinant dh5α j23103 and dh5α j23109 residual mehg 81 4 other recombinant strains effectively degraded mehg with residual from 2 52 dh5α j23106 to 9 03 dh5α j23107 table s1 fig 1a the transcript of merb in these strains was confirmed by qpcr based on the transcript level of j23119 j23106 showed the highest increase about 28 4 fold then is j23105 10 2 fold and j23104 3 1 fold fig 1b no significant increase was observed for j23103 0 895 j23107 1 05 and j23109 showed an obvious decrease in the transcript level of merb 0 435 fig 1b the difference in transcript level of merb is well agree with the degradation efficiency of mehg by these7 recombinant strains further dh5α j23106 the strain with the highest mehg degradation was tested for its mehg tolerance with dh5α as a comparison cell density shows that growths of both dh5α and recombinant dh5α j23106 under 0 50 ng ml mehg exposure were very similar fig s1 mehg concentration at 100 ng ml decreased the growths of both dh5α and dh5α j23106 however the od600 at 180 min suggests recombinant dh5α j23106 is more tolerable towards mehg than dh5α the differential growth could be attributed to different toxicity of hg species as evident in fig 1a dh5α cannot degrade mehg while recombinant dh5α j23106 degrades mehg efficiently gas chromatography cold vapor atomic fluorescence spectrometry gccvafs analysis further shows that hg was still present in the form of mehg in dh5α group fig s2b and the peak of hg ⅱ increased obviously in dh5α j23106 group fig s2d demonstrating that recombinant dh5α j23106 can degrade mehg into hg ⅱ the growth of both dh5α and dh5α j23106 were inhibited at 500 ng ml mehg concentration due to its toxicity the tolerance concentration of dh5α j23106 towards mehg is higher than that of mehg in contaminated environments e g everglades 3 8 ng l and gold tailings pond 75 ng l liu et al 2008 rytuba 2003 implying that the growth of dh5α j23106 would not be influenced and dh5α j23106 could be potentially applied for mehg remediation in contaminated environment 3 2 mehg degradation by dh5α j23106 in anoxic oxic culture medium mehg degradation efficiency in the presence of dh5α j23106 was investigated at different initial mehg concentrations in anoxic oxic culture mediums fig 2 the much lower residual mehg with dh5α j23106 demonstrated a significant mehg degradation by recombinant strain the degradation of mehg at 90 min was more than 84 3 for environmental concentration 0 01 ng ml of mehg and 95 5 for high concentration 1 50 ng ml of mehg in anoxic conditions fig 2a b c d and the ratio was 81 6 and 96 7 under oxic conditions fig 2e f g h similar degradation under anoxic and oxic conditions demonstrate that dh5α j23106 as facultative anaerobic bacteria behaves well toward mehg degradation under both anoxic and oxic environments in contrast dh5α did not significantly degrade mehg under anoxic oxic conditions with 78 116 residual mehg at 90 min besides degradation ratio and rate the residual mehg should also be considered as which would still lead to hazards for organisms and ecosystems eckley et al 2020 after 90 mins degradation the concentration of residual mehg was 0 0016 1 4 ng ml and 0 0018 0 18 ng ml under anoxic and oxic conditions respectively these concentrations are much lower than previous studies in which residual organomercury was still over 160 ng ml after degradation by merb in e coli or pseudomonas putida spi3 fortunato et al 2005 kiyono et al 2003 this difference may be mainly attributed to promoters for merb protein j23106 promoter designed for merb is strong enough for high transcript of merb gene fig 1b and then efficient degradation of mehg however directly expressing or utilizing promoters of mer operon in previous studies would decrease the transcription of merb and further the degradation of low concentrations of organomercury fortunato et al 2005 huang et al 1999 priyadarshanee et al 2022 considering that mehg is primarily produced by anaerobic bacteria in aquatic environments including sediment or water column and then translocated to oxic environment eckley and hintelmann 2006 gilmour and riedel 1995 this facultative recombinant strain could degrade mehg under both anoxic and oxic environments and it could be a good candidate for efficient mehg remediation 3 3 dh5α j23106 degrades newly produced and ambient mehg in contaminated sediments under anoxic condition degradation of newly produced me199hg from spiked 199hg ii and ambient aged mehg were investigated in contaminated sediment fig 3 results show that there was a pronounced increase of me199hg after 24 h incubation and both of the newly produced me199hg and ambient mehg decreased after dh5α j23106 addition specifically the concentration of me199hg was 16 6 ng g and the methylation ratio of spiking 199hg ⅱ was about 8 3 for control for dh5α j23106 group me199hg concentration decreased to 3 56 ng g suggesting 78 6 of me199hg was degraded by dh5α j23106 the ambient aged mehg also decreased from 11 1 ng g for control to 7 00 ng g for dh5α j23106 group suggesting about 37 3 ambient mehg was degraded by dh5α j23106 this different degradation ratio may be attributed to aging induced decrease of mehg bioavailability ma et al 2015 3 4 dh5α j23106 degrades different aged mehg in spiked sediment under anoxic oxic conditions mehg spiked sediments with a range of aging time under anoxic and oxic conditions were used to assess the effect of aging and oxygen on the degradation of mehg fig 4 for newly spiked groups representing newly produced mehg fig 4a the residual mehg were 52 3 0 h and 37 3 after 24 h for anoxic sediment and 109 7 0 h and 42 1 after 24 h for oxic sediment respectively there was a pronounced decrease of mehg about 47 7 in anoxic sediment at 0 h group which may be attributed to degradation during a delay about 30 mins between dh5α j23106 addition and sampling from anoxic chamber after 24 h biodegradation residual mehg in anoxic and oxic sediments was still about 40 after aged 10 days fig 4b the residual mehg for dh5α j23106 degradations were 91 7 0 h and 44 2 after 24 h for anoxic sediment and 92 6 0 h and 93 3 after 24 h for oxic sediment respectively the higher residual of mehg 91 7 at 0 h for 10 days aged anoxic sediment than that without aging 52 3 fig 4a suggests anoxic aging of mehg significantly decreased the bioavailability and degradation of mehg similarly oxic aging for 10 days increased residual mehg at 24 h from 42 1 to 93 3 the mehg degradation by dh5α j23106 in anoxic sediment degradation ratio 55 8 after 24 h treatment was significantly different compared with control groups without any e coli strain or with dh5α p 0 05 however no obvious degradation was observed in oxic sediment degradation ratio 6 7 after 24 h treatment total cultivated number of dh5α j23106 in anoxic 2 2 0 45 107 cfu g and oxic sediment 2 5 0 66 107 cfu g table s6 was at comparable levels suggesting the different degradation may not be ascribed to dh5α j23106 concentration dgt result fig s3 shows that the concentration of bioavailable mehg in anoxic sediment was significantly higher than that in oxic sediment at 0 1 cm depth p 0 016 for 0 0 5 cm p 0 049 for 0 5 1 cm at the depth of 1 0 2 0 cm the standard deviation of bioavailable mehg was too high and there was no significant difference between these sections p 0 688 for 1 1 5 cm p 0 153 for 1 5 2 cm the total mehg enriched in the resin gel was 93 9 14 8 ng and 36 2 20 2 ng for anoxic and oxic sediment respectively this result clearly demonstrates that mehg was more bioavailable in anoxic sediment than that of oxic sediment overall the dgt results agree well with mehg degradation in anoxic and oxic sediment suggesting anoxic and oxic conditions control the bioavailability of mehg and thus its biodegradation in sediment by dh5α j23106 similar to 10 days aging after 40 days aging the residual mehg were 94 3 0 h and 56 9 after 24 h for anoxic sediment and 93 2 0 h and 89 3 after 24 h for oxic sediment respectively fig 4c obviously a higher degradation ratio occurred for the newly formed mehg 62 7 for 0 day while slightly lower for the aged mehg 55 8 for 10 days 43 1 for 40 days under anoxic environment in contrast to anoxic sediment there was a sharp decrease in mehg degradation for oxic sediment from 57 9 0 day to 6 7 10 days and 10 7 40 days for both anoxic and oxic sediments there was a decrease in mehg degradation with the increase of aging time which agree well with the lower degradation of intrinsic aged mehg 37 3 than that of newly produced me199hg 78 6 in actual sediment overall these results demonstrate that dh5α j23106 can efficiently degrade mehg in anoxic sediment but not aged mehg in oxic sediment and bioavailability of mehg is the main controlling factor for its degradation by dh5α j23106 thus further increase of bioavailability of aged mehg in oxic sediment is necessary to improve its degradation by dh5α j23106 3 5 dh5α j23106 combined with nh4 2s2o3 degrades aged mehg in different oxic sediments the degradation of spiked mehg in 8 sediments was investigated using dh5α j23106 nh4 2s2o3 was used to increase the bioavailability of mehg and facilitate its biodegradation in sediment as shown in fig s4a 1 50 mmol l nh4 2s2o3 would not influence the analysis and degradation of mehg by dh5α j23106 considering the leachability of mehg by nh4 2s2o3 for sediment s6 fig s4b 10 mmol l nh4 2s2o3 was selected generally contaminated areas with high pollutant bioavailability or mobility in runoff can be applied with off site remediation and on site remediation can be considered to reduce off site transport risk eckley et al 2020 to evaluate the remediation by dh5α j23106 in different oxic sediments on site and off site remediation strategies were both investigated in this study fig 5 shows a slight decrease of mehg 0 26 5 in non e coli control during 40 days of aging which may be attributed to the chemical degradation of mehg in these sediments xie et al 2019 when calculating the later degradation efficiency the spiked concentration after mehg aging in sediment was set as the initial value for on site direct treatment groups dh5α j23106 without nh4 2s2o3 leaching fig 5 second columns there was a noticeable degradation of mehg 9 0 66 9 furthermore a significant difference was observed except for s1 sample when compared with the control p 0 12 for s1 p 0 05 for other sediments demonstrating that dh5α j23106 can degrade mehg in most sediments high degradation ratios were observed in s2 66 9 and s4 51 0 samples while the degradation ratio was low less than 29 3 for other samples which follows the results in figs 3 and 4 where the aging of mehg decreased its biodegradation the total cultivated number of dh5α j23106 in these sediments were listed in table s7 and no significant correlation was observed between colony number and degradation ratio r 0 464 p 0 247 just like the different degradation in anoxic and oxic sediment the difference in degradation ratio may be ascribed to bioavailability of mehg but not dh5α j23106 concentration after leaching with nh4 2s2o3 mehg degradation efficiency significantly increased by 15 8 38 8 for on site or off site groups the third and fourth columns in fig 5 except for s2 s4 and s8 suggesting nh4 2s2o3 partially increases mehg bioavailability and its degradation by dh5α j23106 the difference in these sediments may be attributed to various properties of sediments e g thiol contents and thus their immobilization with mehg the strong binding of mehg with thiol in organic ligands benoit et al 2001 skyllberg 2008 would decrease nh4 2s2o3 leaching and thus subsequent bioavailability and biodegradation of mehg overall these results demonstrated that nh4 2s2o3 leaching efficiently enhances the degradation of mehg at least for aged mehg in some of the sediments fig s5 further demonstrates that the leachable mehg by nh4 2s2o3 varied 17 1 45 8 in different sediments and this fraction can be degraded off site by dh5α j23106 completely the degradation ratio in on site 29 2 67 6 and off site 26 2 65 8 groups combined with nh4 2s2o3 were generally very similar fig 5 suggesting that the degraded mehg in on site group should also come from nh4 2s2o3 leaching in addition there was a positive correlation between the leachability by nh4 2s2o3 and on site fig s6b r 0 639 p 0 088 or off site fig s6c r 0 868 p 0 005 mehg degradation when dh5α j23106 combined with nh4 2s2o3 these results suggest that the more leachable mehg from sediment by nh4 2s2o3 the higher mehg degradation the residual mehg that cannot be extracted by nh4 2s2o3 and degraded by dh5α j23106 can be considered non bioavailable and thus has low environmental risk four parameters toc ph fe and mn of sediments which were reported that would influence the bioavailability of hg chadwick et al 2006 zhong and wang 2008 zhu et al 2015 were employed to investigate the correlations between mehg degradation by dh5α j23106 and geochemistry of sediments no significant correlation was observed between toc content and direct degradation table s5 r 0 119 p 0 779 or off site degradation in combination with nh4 2s2o3 table s5 r 0 381 p 0 352 there was an inversely correlation between on site off site degradation in combination with nh4 2s2o3 and toc content table s8 r 0 738 p 0 037 for on site group r 0 578 p 0 133 for off site group although ph fe and mn could influence hg cycling and bioavailability in aquatic systems beutel et al 2008 chadwick et al 2006 no obvious correlations were observed between the degradation efficiency and these parameters in our study table s8 sediments as complex environmental matrixes vary from geochemistry and there should be multiple factors influencing the bioavailable mehg in sediments 4 conclusions bioavailable mehg in sediment is the critical fraction as a source for its bioaccumulation in aquatic food webs lee et al 2000 this study provides an efficient strategy for bioremediation of bioavailable mehg in sediment dh5α j23106 can effectively degrade mehg under both anoxic and oxic conditions in culture mediums further study revealed that this recombinant strain could also degrade newly produced and partial ambient aged mehg in actual contaminated sediments aging could decrease mehg degradation in sediment especially under oxic conditions nh4 2s2o3 leaching combined with on site or off site dh5α j23106 degradation could further increase mehg degradation at least in some of these sediments through enhanced mehg bioavailability the negative correlation between toc and degradation suggests that organic matter in sediments could decrease nh4 2s2o3 leaching the bioavailable mehg and therefore its biodegradation overall mehg degradation by dh5α j23106 provides a candidate to remediate mehg in contaminated sites however further studies are still necessary

15274,sediment is the primary hotspot for microbial production of toxic and bio accumulative methylmercury mehg common remediation strategies such as sediment dredging and capping can be too expensive and cannot degrade mehg efficiently here we constructed an escherichia coli strain overexpressing merb gene dh5α j23106 and assessed the effectiveness of this recombinant strain in degradation of mehg in culture medium and sediment dh5α j23106 can efficiently degrade mehg with initial concentration from 0 01 to 50 ng ml to more than 81 6 in a culture medium under anoxic and oxic conditions enriched isotope addition 199hgcl2 revealed that this recombinant strain can degrade 78 6 of newly produced me199hg in actual sediment however the biodegradation decreased to 36 3 for intrinsic mehg degradation of spiked mehg after aging in anoxic and oxic sediments further demonstrated dh5α j23106 can efficiently degrade newly produced mehg and the degradation decreased with aging significantly especially for oxic sediment eight sediments were further assessed for the biodegradation of aged mehg by dh5α j23106 under oxic conditions with degradation ratios ranging from 9 0 to 66 9 when combined with nh4 2s2o3 leaching the degradation of mehg increased by 15 8 38 8 in on site and off site modes through enhanced mehg bioavailability in some of these sediments thus this recombinant strain dh5α j23106 can degrade mehg efficiently and have the potential for remediating bioavailable mehg in contaminated sediments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords methylmercury microbial remediation mehg sediment ammonium thiosulfate bioavailability data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction mercury hg as a potent neurotoxin can pose severe risks to ecology and human health even at very low environmental concentration driscoll et al 2013 zahir et al 2005 although all chemical forms of hg are toxic public health concerns are mainly focused on methylmercury mehg due to its bioaccumulation and biomagnification of humans by the consumption of contaminated fish davidson et al 1998 mozaffarian and rimm 2006 and rice li et al 2010 zhang et al 2010 in aquatic environments mehg is primarily produced by anaerobic hg methylating microorganisms in sediment ma et al 2019 regnell and watras 2019 and then diffused into overlying water benoit et al 2009 hammerschmidt et al 2006 resulting in mehg accumulation in aquatic food web therefore it is crucial to develop remediation techniques for mehg removal in sediment and thus reduce its risk to ecology and human health dredging and on site capping miller and gustin 2013 could be efficient in physical removal or barriering mehg as mehg is not chemically degraded in these processes subsequent transport and release of it is often inevitable e g resuspension of mehg with particle bloom and lasorsa 1999 kim et al 2006 and diffusion and uptake of mehg into overlying water and benthic organisms through tidal pumping groundwater flow and bioturbation curtis et al 2019 liu et al 2001 in recent decades low cost bioremediation especially biodegradation has been developed to treat mehg pollution omichinski 2007 however biodegradation using wild type organisms often has some shortcomings e g poor stress resistance low degradation efficiency and complex regulation network for the expression of target enzymes fortunato et al 2005 singh et al 2011 for 16 hg resistant bacteria isolated from hg contaminated sites the degradation efficiency of mehg ranged from 0 to 90 in culture medium with most strains less than 20 cabral et al 2013 a threshold concentration of organomercurial thiomersal was necessary for pseudomonas putida spi3 expressing mer operon in more cells to initiate its degradation fortunato et al 2005 to solve the shortcomings of traditional bioremediation synthetic biology as a more predictable tool has been used to integrate specific genes into suitable biological systems such as plants and microorganisms to enhance the tolerance to and the degradation efficiency of mehg capeness and horsfall 2020 singh et al 2011 among them the most well known method is integrating or increasing the expression of merb enzyme capable of cleaving the chg bound of organomercurials julien et al 2008 which could considerably increase the biodegradation of mehg barkay et al 2003 benison et al 2004 schaefer et al 2004 in early studies these merb transgenic attempts were focused on plants li et al 2020 nagata et al 2010 ruiz et al 2003 however the remediation by transgenic plants would be limited due to the facts that 1 the prerequisite for degradation of mehg by merb transgenic plants is its root absorption but the plant root biomass limits its contact with soil interface and subsequent internalization and degradation of mehg 2 soil is not a hotspot for microbial synthesis of mehg therefore the applicability of merb transgenic plants in sediment the concerned site of mehg production is still an open question compared with plants microorganisms have several cutting edges to degrade mehg including a higher growth rate the ability to thrive in a nutrient poor environment and a convenient genetic manipulation platform in recent years merb directly expressed or regulated by mer operon in microorganisms has been constructed to degrade mehg in culture medium or water kane et al 2016 takanezawa et al 2019 however the mehg degradation efficiency obtained by directly expressed method is unstable because merb gene is just an ancillary component of the mer operon chien et al 2010 in addition merb downstream of mer operon and its transcription is relatively weak huang et al 1999 therefore it is essential to design a strong promoter for merb gene to increase its degradation efficiency of mehg more importantly mehg in sediment is primarily associated with minerals zhong and wang 2010 and organic matters lawrence et al 1999 and often has low bioavailability thus a strategy should be developed to enhance the microbial availability of mehg and the degradation remediation of mehg in sediment considering the aspects mentioned above the objectives of this study were to 1 construct a recombinant e coli strain with overexpressing merb gene and 2 apply it to degrade mehg in contaminated sediment various recombinant merb overexpressed dh5α strains with different promoters were constructed and screened for mehg degradation after evaluating its mehg degradation efficiency in a culture medium a recombinant strain dh5α j23106 was used to degrade mehg in actual contaminated sediments and spiked sediments with different aging furthermore ammonium thiosulfate nh4 2s2o3 was applied as a leaching agent to enhance the on site or off site mehg degradation in different sediments using dh5α j23106 2 materials and methods 2 1 construction of recombinant strains expressing merb under the control of promoters with different strength the merb gene genbank m15049 1 encoding mehg lyase was commercially synthesized sangon biotech shanghai china and then cloned into puc57 backbone to form recombinant plasmid puc57 merb to obtain a series of plasmids expressing merb 7 constitutive promoters bba j23103 bba j23104 bba j23105 bba j23106 bba j23107 bba j23109 bba j23119 with various strength were selected according to their strength in red fluorescent protein rfp expression from registry of standard biological parts http parts igem org part bba j23101 among the 7 promoters bba j23119 was the consensus promoter sequence and the others originated from it by sequence mutation table s1 firstly bba j23119 was inserted into the plasmid puc57 merb by amplifying the whole plasmid using primers j23119f and j23119r table s2 and then the generated linear pcr fragment was self ligated by t4 dna ligase to form plasmid puc57 merb j23119 sequence of puc57 merb j23119 was listed in table s3 then other 6 plasmids puc57 merb j23103 puc57 merb j23104 puc57 merb j23105 puc57 merb j23106 puc57 merb j23107 and puc57 merb j23109 were conducted by amplifying puc57 merb j23119 using corresponding primers table s2 and the generated linear pcr fragment was self ligated by t4 dna ligase the constructed plasmids were extracted and sequenced in sangon biotech beijing to ensure the accuracy of nucleotide sequence the resultant plasmids were transformed into competent e coli dh5α respectively to form recombinant strain dh5α j23103 dh5α j23104 dh5α j23105 dh5α j23106 dh5α j23107 dh5α j23109 and dh5α j23119 after that the recombinant strains were grown at 30 in luria bertani lb medium containing 100 μg ml ampicillin amp in room air in the meantime dh5α harboring puc57 plasmid was used as a control 2 2 assays of mehg degradation by a variety of recombinant strains in culture medium to evaluate the degradation effect residual mehg was measured after incubated with recombinant strains in a culture medium briefly recombinant strains were firstly cultured in lb medium and harvested at exponential phase optical density od 0 6 at 600 nm lb was later replaced by a bmaa medium to avoid possible complexation decreased mehg bioavailability stenzler et al 2017 then mehg was added to 10 ml bmaa medium to get a final 1 ng ml concentration for different strains with cell density of 0 6 109 cells ml this concentration is comparable to that of engineered strains to remediate hg pollution in previous studies fortunato et al 2005 zhang et al 2013 after incubation for 40 mins cell pellet and supernatant were separated by centrifugation at 9055 g for 10 min detailed procedures for sample digestion and mehg analysis are described in supporting information for quantifying the transcripts level of merb gene in different recombinant strains by real time quantitative pcr qpcr total rna of 7 recombinant strains were extracted using an rna extraction kit rnaprep pure cell bacteria kit tiangen china according to manufacturer s instruction residual genome dna was eliminated and cdna synthesis was performed at the same time by a fast king gdna dispelling rt supermix tiangen china to quantify merb transcript levels cdna of 7 recombinant strains was amplified by qpcr using sybr green i reagent sybr superreal premix plus tiangen china the primers for merb and 16srdna genes were as follows 16srdna forward primer 5 agagtttgatcatggctcagattga3 and 16srdna reverse primer 5 cgttatgcggtattagctaccg3 merb forward primer 5 tactgcgagagctcgccaagg3 and merb reverse primer 5 aagacatacgaagtctcgcgc3 j23119 was chosen as the control group to represent the change of the transcript level of merb in other 6 strains 2 3 assays of mehg degradation by dh5α j23106 in culture medium dh5α j23106 was selected for subsequent study due to its high mehg degradation efficiency tolerance of dh5α j23106 to mehg was firstly assessed by its growth curve in bmaa medium with 0 500 ng ml mehg cell density was monitored to evaluate its tolerance through its absorbance at 600 nm by microplate reader varoskan flash thermo scientific usa the growth curve of dh5α puc57 as control was monitored simultaneously mehg was primarily synthesized in anoxic sediment and then migrated to adjacent oxic water chen et al 2008 gill et al 1999 therefore the degradation efficiency of mehg by dh5α j23106 in both anoxic oxic conditions was evaluated anoxic medium was prepared in serum bottles and purged with ultrahigh purity nitrogen 400 ml min for 30 mins oxic medium was prepared in room air all mediums were sterilized with an autoclave sterilizer mls 3781 l phc corporation japan at 121 for 20 mins subsequent procedures for anoxic groups were carried out in an anoxic chamber atmosphere of 80 n2 10 h2 and 10 co2 aw400sg electrotek uk and oxic groups were treated in room air cells were harvested at mid log growth phase od600 0 6 in lb and washed three times with bmaa medium then dh5α j23106 was added to 10 ml bmaa medium and cell density was adjusted to 0 6 109 cells ml before mehg addition finally samples were retrieved at 10 40 and 90 mins after mehg addition and centrifuged to separate cell pellet and supernatant samples were frozen at 20 till analysis parallel in triplicate and control of dh5α puc57 was set for all experimental groups 2 4 sediment collection and preparation nine sediment samples from different lakes were collected to evaluate the degradation of mehg by dh5α j23106 sediment sa contaminated due to historical chlor alkali production was selected as an actual matrix to evaluate

table s4 2 5 degradation of newly produced me199hg and intrinsic aged mehg in mercury contaminated sediment mehg is primarily produced by anaerobic hg methylating microorganisms in sediment ma et al 2019 regnell and watras 2019 sample sa were selected to assess degradation effect of newly produced and intrinsic aged mehg in hg contaminated sediment enriched isotope 199hgcl2 was spiked to evaluate the degradation of newly produced me199hg by dh5α j23106 briefly 3 g fresh sediment were weighed into 50 ml corning vial in anoxic chamber then 199hgcl2 was spiked into the sediment to get a final concentration of 200 ng 199hg g sediment wet weight the spiked concentration of 199hg ⅱ was at approximately 9 5 of the ambient total hg samples without dh5α j23106 were set as control to evaluate

monitored for mehg by gas chromatography inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry gc icpms shen et al 2021 2 6 assay of newly formed and aged mehg degradation in sediment under anoxic oxic conditions to investigate the effect of aging and oxygen on mehg degradation by dh5α j23106 sediment s6 was randomly chosen for spiking experiment freeze dried sediment 350 g was weighed into a 500 ml glass beaker and sterilized at 121 for 2 h after that 200 ml of heating sterilized water was added to construct a slurry system for anoxic groups the slurry was purged with ultrahigh purity nitrogen 200 ml min for 2 h to remove oxygen and transferred to anoxic chamber then mehg was spiked to get the final concentration of 10 ng g calculated based on dry weight the spiked mehg concentration is much higher than mehg background 0 003 0 150 ng g in table s4 but similar to polluted sediments with mehg concentration of 4 90 ng g skyllberg et al 2007 after that the beakers were sealed with air permeable sealing film 16 16 mm diameter labgic technology co beijing china and covered with aluminum foil to prevent possible photolysis of mehg in an anoxic chamber except for purging with nitrogen oxic groups were prepared simultaneously and leaved at dark in room air considering that the bioavailability of mehg would be decreased with aging jonsson et al 2014 zhong and wang 2006 aging time 0 10 and 40 days of mehg in sediment was assessed on its degradation by dh5α j23106 in addition diffusive gradients in thin films dgt lspb ap dgt research ltd lancaster la2 0qj uk was used to monitor bioavailable mehg in anoxic oxic sediments aging for 10 days detailed information about dgt procedure was provided in supporting information after 0 10 or 40 days aging 30 g of well stirred slurry was added to a 50 ml sterilized beaker and then dh5α j23106 was added with a final density of 0 33 109 cells g concentration based on wet weight of sediment and divided into 15 ml corning tubes groups without any e coli strain or with dh5α were used for comparison total cultivated number of dh5α j23106 was measured by counting colony forming units cfu in anoxic oxic sediment after 24 h exposure

at 20 all samples were freeze dried at 40 by a vacuum freeze dryer pilot10 15 m biocool beijing china homogenized sieved 100 mesh and stored at 20 for further investigations 2 7 assays for mehg degradation by dh5α j23106 in combination with nh4 2s2o3 leaching for different sediments s1 s8 samples table s4 were evaluated for the degradation of mehg by dh5α j23106 after 40 days aging generally 40 g of freeze dried sediments were added to a 50 ml glass beaker and then sterilized at 121 for 2 h then sterilized water was added to obtain slurry without obvious overlying water detailed information in table s5 after that sediments were spiked with mehg to form a final concentration of 10 ng g calculated based on dry weight of sediment samples were covered with air permeable sealing film placed in dark and incubated for 40 days in room air nh4 2s2o3 can solubilize particle bound mehg in soils and enhance its bioavailability zhu et al 2015 in our study it was used to increase the bioavailable mehg and thus its degradation by dh5α j23106 after evaluating the influence of 1 50 mmol l nh4 2s2o3 on mehg degradation by dh5α j23106 and leachable ratio of sediment s6 10 mmol l nh4 2s2o3 was selected as leaching solution for later use detailed experimental procedure was provided in supporting information after 40 days of aging 1 g sediment was weighed using weighing bottles and dried at 60 in an oven until constant weight to monitor the moisture the residual sediment slurry samples were freeze dried at 40 for further investigation then 2 g dried sediments and 10 ml bmaa solution with or without 10 mmol l nh4 2s2o3 were added into 50 ml corning tubes and shaken at 300 rpm for 4 h four treatments were compared to evaluate the degradation efficiency of mehg by dh5α j23106 1 on site direct degradation where dh5α j23106 was added into the sediment directly 2 on site degradation combined with nh4 2s2o3 leaching where dh5α j23106 was added into the slurry after 4 h nh4 2s2o3 leaching 3 off site degradation combined with nh4 2s2o3 leaching in which after nh4 2s2o3 leaching the slurry was centrifuged at 9055 g for 5 mins and filtered with 0 45 μm membrane before dh5α j23106 addition into the filtrate 4 the control group where no dh5α j23106 were added into the sediment the final cell density of dh5α j23106 was 0 33 109 cells g for dry weight of sediment and samples were shaken at 30 for 24 h at 200 rpm in addition total cultivated number of dh5α j23106 in different sediments was measured after that the mixtures were centrifuged at 9055 g for 5 min then the supernatant was filtered by a 0 45 μm membrane and the sediment samples were freeze dried at 40 and stored at 20 for further analysis 2 8 determination of mehg and other ancillary parameters the supporting information provides detailed analytical procedures for mehg in cell pellet supernatant sediment and other ancillary parameters 2 9 quality assurance and quality control all reagents used in this study were of analytical or higher grade and obtained from shanghai chemicals company shanghai china or merck life science germany glassware was cleaned in 10 hcl and ultra pure water followed by burning in a muffle furnace 3 550 neytech usa at 500 for 30 min to ensure hg free triplicate analyses were employed for each treatment the relative standard deviations of triplicate samples ranged from 0 01 to 14 2 for mehg within the acceptable limits of epa 1630 method for mehg 15 the recoveries of mehg for matrix spikes and certified reference material sediment gbw08308 were 79 7 102 and 77 9 112 respectively which were within the acceptable recoveries of epa 1630 method 65 135 for mehg the procedure blank of mehg was 5 pg for a 0 2 ml sample for each sample batch 9 samples sample check blanks and standard solutions were included 2 10 statistical analysis statistical analysis of the data was performed using the spss 16 software one way analysis of variance anova with duncan s post hoc test was performed to test the differences between direct degradation on site degradation combined with nh4 2s2o3 leaching and off site degradation combined with nh4 2s2o3 leaching statistical significances were defined at p 0 05 indicating significant differences shapiro wilk test was applied to assess the normality of data and only ph was non normal distribution then pearson s correlation coefficient was applied to characterize the influence of sediments geochemistry toc fe and mn on mehg degradation by dh5α j23106 the relationships between mehg degradation by dh5α j23106 and nh4 2s2o3 leachable mehg for different sediments spearman s correlation coefficient was used to characterize ph on mehg degradation by dh5α j23106 3 results and discussion 3 1 construct recombinant e coli strains and evaluation of their performance on mehg degradation in a culture medium seven recombinant plasmids table s1 were transformed into e coli dh5α to form corresponding recombinant strains residual mehg was measured to evaluate the degradation efficiency of mehg by these recombinant strains in bmaa culture medium as shown in fig 1 a after 40 min incubation residual mehg was mainly present in on the cell 74 8 but not in the supernatant suggesting that the spiked mehg was adsorbed on or internalized in cell there was no significant degradation of mehg for e coli dh5α residual mehg 85 5 except for dh5α j23119 with the consensus promoter sequence bba j23119 residual mehg 24 9 and recombinant dh5α j23103 and dh5α j23109 residual mehg 81 4 other recombinant strains effectively degraded mehg with residual from 2 52 dh5α j23106 to 9 03 dh5α j23107 table s1 fig 1a the transcript of merb in these strains was confirmed by qpcr based on the transcript level of j23119 j23106 showed the highest increase about 28 4 fold then is j23105 10 2 fold and j23104 3 1 fold fig 1b no significant increase was observed for j23103 0 895 j23107 1 05 and j23109 showed an obvious decrease in the transcript level of merb 0 435 fig 1b the difference in transcript level of merb is well agree with the degradation efficiency of mehg by these7 recombinant strains further dh5α j23106 the strain with the highest mehg degradation was tested for its mehg tolerance with dh5α as a comparison cell density shows that growths of both dh5α and recombinant dh5α j23106 under 0 50 ng ml mehg exposure were very similar fig s1 mehg concentration at 100 ng ml decreased the growths of both dh5α and dh5α j23106 however the od600 at 180 min suggests recombinant dh5α j23106 is more tolerable towards mehg than dh5α the differential growth could be attributed to different toxicity of hg species as evident in fig 1a dh5α cannot degrade mehg while recombinant dh5α j23106 degrades mehg efficiently gas chromatography cold vapor atomic fluorescence spectrometry gccvafs analysis further shows that hg was still present in the form of mehg in dh5α group fig s2b and the peak of hg ⅱ increased obviously in dh5α j23106 group fig s2d demonstrating that recombinant dh5α j23106 can degrade mehg into hg ⅱ the growth of both dh5α and dh5α j23106 were inhibited at 500 ng ml mehg concentration due to its toxicity the tolerance concentration of dh5α j23106 towards mehg is higher than that of mehg in contaminated environments e g everglades 3 8 ng l and gold tailings pond 75 ng l liu et al 2008 rytuba 2003 implying that the growth of dh5α j23106 would not be influenced and dh5α j23106 could be potentially applied for mehg remediation in contaminated environment 3 2 mehg degradation by dh5α j23106 in anoxic oxic culture medium mehg degradation efficiency in the presence of dh5α j23106 was investigated at different initial mehg concentrations in anoxic oxic culture mediums fig 2 the much lower residual mehg with dh5α j23106 demonstrated a significant mehg degradation by recombinant strain the degradation of mehg at 90 min was more than 84 3 for environmental concentration 0 01 ng ml of mehg and 95 5 for high concentration 1 50 ng ml of mehg in anoxic conditions fig 2a b c d and the ratio was 81 6 and 96 7 under oxic conditions fig 2e f g h similar degradation under anoxic and oxic conditions demonstrate that dh5α j23106 as facultative anaerobic bacteria behaves well toward mehg degradation under both anoxic and oxic environments in contrast dh5α did not significantly degrade mehg under anoxic oxic conditions with 78 116 residual mehg at 90 min besides degradation ratio and rate the residual mehg should also be considered as which would still lead to hazards for organisms and ecosystems eckley et al 2020 after 90 mins degradation the concentration of residual mehg was 0 0016 1 4 ng ml and 0 0018 0 18 ng ml under anoxic and oxic conditions respectively these concentrations are much lower than previous studies in which residual organomercury was still over 160 ng ml after degradation by merb in e coli or pseudomonas putida spi3 fortunato et al 2005 kiyono et al 2003 this difference may be mainly attributed to promoters for merb protein j23106 promoter designed for merb is strong enough for high transcript of merb gene fig 1b and then efficient degradation of mehg however directly expressing or utilizing promoters of mer operon in previous studies would decrease the transcription of merb and further the degradation of low concentrations of organomercury fortunato et al 2005 huang et al 1999 priyadarshanee et al 2022 considering that mehg is primarily produced by anaerobic bacteria in aquatic environments including sediment or water column and then translocated to oxic environment eckley and hintelmann 2006 gilmour and riedel 1995 this facultative recombinant strain could degrade mehg under both anoxic and oxic environments and it could be a good candidate for efficient mehg remediation 3 3 dh5α j23106 degrades newly produced and ambient mehg in contaminated sediments under anoxic condition degradation of newly produced me199hg from spiked 199hg ii and ambient aged mehg were investigated in contaminated sediment fig 3 results show that there was a pronounced increase of me199hg after 24 h incubation and both of the newly produced me199hg and ambient mehg decreased after dh5α j23106 addition specifically the concentration of me199hg was 16 6 ng g and the methylation ratio of spiking 199hg ⅱ was about 8 3 for control for dh5α j23106 group me199hg concentration decreased to 3 56 ng g suggesting 78 6 of me199hg was degraded by dh5α j23106 the ambient aged mehg also decreased from 11 1 ng g for control to 7 00 ng g for dh5α j23106 group suggesting about 37 3 ambient mehg was degraded by dh5α j23106 this different degradation ratio may be attributed to aging induced decrease of mehg bioavailability ma et al 2015 3 4 dh5α j23106 degrades different aged mehg in spiked sediment under anoxic oxic conditions mehg spiked sediments with a range of aging time under anoxic and oxic conditions were used to assess the effect of aging and oxygen on the degradation of mehg fig 4 for newly spiked groups representing newly produced mehg fig 4a the residual mehg were 52 3 0 h and 37 3 after 24 h for anoxic sediment and 109 7 0 h and 42 1 after 24 h for oxic sediment respectively there was a pronounced decrease of mehg about 47 7 in anoxic sediment at 0 h group which may be attributed to degradation during a delay about 30 mins between dh5α j23106 addition and sampling from anoxic chamber after 24 h biodegradation residual mehg in anoxic and oxic sediments was still about 40 after aged 10 days fig 4b the residual mehg for dh5α j23106 degradations were 91 7 0 h and 44 2 after 24 h for anoxic sediment and 92 6 0 h and 93 3 after 24 h for oxic sediment respectively the higher residual of mehg 91 7 at 0 h for 10 days aged anoxic sediment than that without aging 52 3 fig 4a suggests anoxic aging of mehg significantly decreased the bioavailability and degradation of mehg similarly oxic aging for 10 days increased residual mehg at 24 h from 42 1 to 93 3 the mehg degradation by dh5α j23106 in anoxic sediment degradation ratio 55 8 after 24 h treatment was significantly different compared with control groups without any e coli strain or with dh5α p 0 05 however no obvious degradation was observed in oxic sediment degradation ratio 6 7 after 24 h treatment total cultivated number of dh5α j23106 in anoxic 2 2 0 45 107 cfu g and oxic sediment 2 5 0 66 107 cfu g table s6 was at comparable levels suggesting the different degradation may not be ascribed to dh5α j23106 concentration dgt result fig s3 shows that the concentration of bioavailable mehg in anoxic sediment was significantly higher than that in oxic sediment at 0 1 cm depth p 0 016 for 0 0 5 cm p 0 049 for 0 5 1 cm at the depth of 1 0 2 0 cm the standard deviation of bioavailable mehg was too high and there was no significant difference between these sections p 0 688 for 1 1 5 cm p 0 153 for 1 5 2 cm the total mehg enriched in the resin gel was 93 9 14 8 ng and 36 2 20 2 ng for anoxic and oxic sediment respectively this result clearly demonstrates that mehg was more bioavailable in anoxic sediment than that of oxic sediment overall the dgt results agree well with mehg degradation in anoxic and oxic sediment suggesting anoxic and oxic conditions control the bioavailability of mehg and thus its biodegradation in sediment by dh5α j23106 similar to 10 days aging after 40 days aging the residual mehg were 94 3 0 h and 56 9 after 24 h for anoxic sediment and 93 2 0 h and 89 3 after 24 h for oxic sediment respectively fig 4c obviously a higher degradation ratio occurred for the newly formed mehg 62 7 for 0 day while slightly lower for the aged mehg 55 8 for 10 days 43 1 for 40 days under anoxic environment in contrast to anoxic sediment there was a sharp decrease in mehg degradation for oxic sediment from 57 9 0 day to 6 7 10 days and 10 7 40 days for both anoxic and oxic sediments there was a decrease in mehg degradation with the increase of aging time which agree well with the lower degradation of intrinsic aged mehg 37 3 than that of newly produced me199hg 78 6 in actual sediment overall these results demonstrate that dh5α j23106 can efficiently degrade mehg in anoxic sediment but not aged mehg in oxic sediment and bioavailability of mehg is the main controlling factor for its degradation by dh5α j23106 thus further increase of bioavailability of aged mehg in oxic sediment is necessary to improve its degradation by dh5α j23106 3 5 dh5α j23106 combined with nh4 2s2o3 degrades aged mehg in different oxic sediments the degradation of spiked mehg in 8 sediments was investigated using dh5α j23106 nh4 2s2o3 was used to increase the bioavailability of mehg and facilitate its biodegradation in sediment as shown in fig s4a 1 50 mmol l nh4 2s2o3 would not influence the analysis and degradation of mehg by dh5α j23106 considering the leachability of mehg by nh4 2s2o3 for sediment s6 fig s4b 10 mmol l nh4 2s2o3 was selected generally contaminated areas with high pollutant bioavailability or mobility in runoff can be applied with off site remediation and on site remediation can be considered to reduce off site transport risk eckley et al 2020 to evaluate the remediation by dh5α j23106 in different oxic sediments on site and off site remediation strategies were both investigated in this study fig 5 shows a slight decrease of mehg 0 26 5 in non e coli control during 40 days of aging which may be attributed to the chemical degradation of mehg in these sediments xie et al 2019 when calculating the later degradation efficiency the spiked concentration after mehg aging in sediment was set as the initial value for on site direct treatment groups dh5α j23106 without nh4 2s2o3 leaching fig 5 second columns there was a noticeable degradation of mehg 9 0 66 9 furthermore a significant difference was observed except for s1 sample when compared with the control p 0 12 for s1 p 0 05 for other sediments demonstrating that dh5α j23106 can degrade mehg in most sediments high degradation ratios were observed in s2 66 9 and s4 51 0 samples while the degradation ratio was low less than 29 3 for other samples which follows the results in figs 3 and 4 where the aging of mehg decreased its biodegradation the total cultivated number of dh5α j23106 in these sediments were listed in table s7 and no significant correlation was observed between colony number and degradation ratio r 0 464 p 0 247 just like the different degradation in anoxic and oxic sediment the difference in degradation ratio may be ascribed to bioavailability of mehg but not dh5α j23106 concentration after leaching with nh4 2s2o3 mehg degradation efficiency significantly increased by 15 8 38 8 for on site or off site groups the third and fourth columns in fig 5 except for s2 s4 and s8 suggesting nh4 2s2o3 partially increases mehg bioavailability and its degradation by dh5α j23106 the difference in these sediments may be attributed to various properties of sediments e g thiol contents and thus their immobilization with mehg the strong binding of mehg with thiol in organic ligands benoit et al 2001 skyllberg 2008 would decrease nh4 2s2o3 leaching and thus subsequent bioavailability and biodegradation of mehg overall these results demonstrated that nh4 2s2o3 leaching efficiently enhances the degradation of mehg at least for aged mehg in some of the sediments fig s5 further demonstrates that the leachable mehg by nh4 2s2o3 varied 17 1 45 8 in different sediments and this fraction can be degraded off site by dh5α j23106 completely the degradation ratio in on site 29 2 67 6 and off site 26 2 65 8 groups combined with nh4 2s2o3 were generally very similar fig 5 suggesting that the degraded mehg in on site group should also come from nh4 2s2o3 leaching in addition there was a positive correlation between the leachability by nh4 2s2o3 and on site fig s6b r 0 639 p 0 088 or off site fig s6c r 0 868 p 0 005 mehg degradation when dh5α j23106 combined with nh4 2s2o3 these results suggest that the more leachable mehg from sediment by nh4 2s2o3 the higher mehg degradation the residual mehg that cannot be extracted by nh4 2s2o3 and degraded by dh5α j23106 can be considered non bioavailable and thus has low environmental risk four parameters toc ph fe and mn of sediments which were reported that would influence the bioavailability of hg chadwick et al 2006 zhong and wang 2008 zhu et al 2015 were employed to investigate the correlations between mehg degradation by dh5α j23106 and geochemistry of sediments no significant correlation was observed between toc content and direct degradation table s5 r 0 119 p 0 779 or off site degradation in combination with nh4 2s2o3 table s5 r 0 381 p 0 352 there was an inversely correlation between on site off site degradation in combination with nh4 2s2o3 and toc content table s8 r 0 738 p 0 037 for on site group r 0 578 p 0 133 for off site group although ph fe and mn could influence hg cycling and bioavailability in aquatic systems beutel et al 2008 chadwick et al 2006 no obvious correlations were observed between the degradation efficiency and these parameters in our study table s8 sediments as complex environmental matrixes vary from geochemistry and there should be multiple factors influencing the bioavailable mehg in sediments 4 conclusions bioavailable mehg in sediment is the critical fraction as a source for its bioaccumulation in aquatic food webs lee et al 2000 this study provides an efficient strategy for bioremediation of bioavailable mehg in sediment dh5α j23106 can effectively degrade mehg under both anoxic and oxic conditions in culture mediums further study revealed that this recombinant strain could also degrade newly produced and partial ambient aged mehg in actual contaminated sediments aging could decrease mehg degradation in sediment especially under oxic conditions nh4 2s2o3 leaching combined with on site or off site dh5α j23106 degradation could further increase mehg degradation at least in some of these sediments through enhanced mehg bioavailability the negative correlation between toc and degradation suggests that organic matter in sediments could decrease nh4 2s2o3 leaching the bioavailable mehg and therefore its biodegradation overall mehg degradation by dh5α j23106 provides a candidate to remediate mehg in contaminated sites however further studies are still necessary
