2000,because volcanic rocks have high permeability rainfall quickly infiltrates into the ground perennial rivers often do not exist in volcanic areas however available studies elucidating hydrologic characteristics and the mechanisms of stream formation in young volcanic areas are limited in number extent and coverage prohibiting a comprehensive understanding of runoff formation by measuring river discharge for two years we examined the characteristics of surface runoff in four adjacent headwater catchments within a young volcanic area of mt fuji the runoff coefficient r is small rainfall thresholds for discharge are large and the lag time tlag and duration d of rainfall runoff events are short these characteristics can be explained by the groundwater flow as the dominant runoff mechanism with high hydraulic conductivity due to differences in topography and the depth of groundwater some differences existed amongst the four adjacent catchments in addition a comparison of runoff characteristics between the young volcanic headwater catchments vhcs and non volcanic headwater catchments nvhcs reported in other studies established that young vhcs have a smaller r a shorter tlag and d and a larger runoff threshold for storm runoff than nvhcs these differences are attributed to differences in the hydraulic conductivity of the underlying geology these findings should help improve hydrological models and river structures for flood prevention keywords mt fuji volcanic area headwater catchments runoff characteristics data availability data will be made available on

and or lava however the term volcanic will sometimes be used in place of young volcanic for simplicity in the rest of the paper since stream water is seldom available or unreliable water resource

sources e g varekamp and kreulen 2000 have been studied for volcanic areas in contrast studies on surface runoff particularly those of rainfall runoff processes for young volcanic areas are quite limited in number extent and spatial coverage this is likely because of the lack of perennial flow izuka and abbott 2010 and a lack of observation data and facilities in these types of volcanic areas major and mark 2006 frequent changes in riverbed shape czuba et al 2012 hinder surface runoff measurements thus our general knowledge of surface hydrology in a young volcanic area i e that rainfall penetrates the ground quickly and that little to no surface streams exist e g aizawa et al 2009 izuka and abbott 2010 is based on a limited number of hydrologic case studies indeed there are currently also no review articles or books on surface runoff in young volcanic areas and books on volcanos or volcanology e g parfitt and wilson 2008 lockwood and hazlett 2010 generally do not include information on hydrology there are a few examples that report surface runoff characteristics for a young volcanic area charlier et al 2008 presented a detailed study for runoff within a small volcanic tropical watershed in basse terre island of guadeloupe french west indies and compared their results with previously reported results obtained for tropical catchments with similar permeable soils unfortunately it remains unclear if their findings are applicable to catchments located in different geological settings climatic conditions and or watershed sizes indeed the areas of the compared watersheds varied considerably from 7 5 10 2 km2 to 1 2 km2 kubota et al 1996 investigated runoff characteristics for four catchments located within young volcanic areas mt bandai and mt iwate in northeastern japan and mt merapi in indonesia as well as two other non volcanic catchments kiryu and yanagatani in western japan and compared calibrated parameters for a hydrologic model they concluded that storm runoff is much smaller in volcanic catchments than in non volcanic watersheds although their pioneering work on the hydrologic difference between volcanic and non volcanic watersheds is quite interesting the areas of compared watersheds ranged from 10 2 km2 to 101 km2 making interpretations of their results somewhat difficult ideally a comparison should be made between headwater catchments hcs of similar sizes for such a comparison the influence of other factors such as land use non uniform rainfall distribution within a watershed artificial flow systems in urban areas differences in topography etc can be minimized thus our focus is young volcanic headwater catchments vhcs particularly in comparison with non volcanic headwater catchments nvhcs defined in our study as headwater catchments underlain by the geology of largely non volcanic origin to address the knowledge gap outlined above we selected four young vhcs at the northeastern foot of mt fuji the highest volcano in japan to increase the number of studies on vhcs based on two years of river discharge measurements we scrutinized the characteristics of the runoff events and show that groundwater flow is the dominant runoff process moreover to put our results into perspective we compared our results to those reported in the past for both vhcs and nvhcs to gain comprehensive knowledge of the differences in runoff characteristics between the two thus the objectives of our study were first to report the runoff characteristics of four vhcs and second to advance our knowledge of rainfall runoff characteristics in vhcs by comparing them with those of nvhcs 2 methodology and materials 2 1 study area the four hcs oohori ichinosuna ichinohori and ninohori are located within the yamanakako basin the yamanakako basin fig 1 has an area of 62 5 km2 and an elevation between 980 and 2 045 m lake yamanakako with an area of 6 54 km2 and a depth of 14 3 m environment agency 1989 is located within the basin the northwestern side of the basin discharges lake water through the katsura river the only outflowing river discharge is regulated by a sluice for the purpose of electric power generation the basin is surrounded by the slope of mt fuji in the southwestern direction and by hills and mountains with elevations between 1 100 and 1 400 m in the other directions annual average precipitation within the basin is p 2 288 mm 1991 2020 a large portion of the annual precipitation 910 mm 40 of p occurs during the august october period and a small portion 249 mm 11 of p during winter december february the annual average air temperature t is 9 4 c and the monthly average t ranges from 2 4 c in january to 26 6 c in august japan meteorological agency jma 2021 each of the four study catchments has one ephemeral headwater river the oohori river the ichinosuna river the ichinohori river and the ninohori river flowing into lake yamanakako for this study a headwater river is defined as a small river of first or second order on a 1 100 000 scale map or as a river with a catchment area 10 km2 hill et al 2014 mainstone et al 2016 the four rivers satisfy the first condition and three rivers satisfy the second condition as a result of downward erosion the current river bed is 1 6 3 m table 1 below soil surfaces near the river mouth river cross sections of the four rivers are shown in fig s2 river flow is only observed during and shortly following rainfall and snowmelt periods the topography geology and other relevant information for each catchment are summarized in table 1 2 2 measurements and data sets 2 2 1 river discharge water level sensors u20 001 onset computer corp ma usa were installed on the riverbeds of the four rivers near their discharge points to the lake fig 1 to determine river discharge for approximately two years from june 2017 through may 2019 precipitation during this period mostly represents the precipitation characteristics in this area except for a very large rainfall event see section 3 4 water pressure data obtained at 5 min intervals were combined with local atmospheric pressure to produce water level data water level was then converted to river discharge by applying the gauckler manning gm formula e g brutsaert 2005 since the side slopes and banks of rivers are fixed with concrete along the lowest reach for around 2 km towards the river mouth and since their cross section fig s2 and mean slope were stable throughout the observation period the stage discharge relation was also stable riverbeds of the lower reach of the ichinohori river and ninohori river and the middle reach of the oohori river and ichinosuna river are also fixed with concrete while stones in a net cage are used to fix riverbeds within the lowest reach of the ichinosuna river and oohori river sandy materials accumulate on the riverbed of the oohori river roughness coefficients n 0 018 0 032 were derived from available past measurements of water level and flow velocity during rainfall runoff events and mean slope and cross sectional shape based on in situ surveys bi 2017 a crude error assessment in section s3 in the supplementary materials indicates that the uncertainty in the discharge is very small 10 2 to 10 1 m3 s 10 1 to 1 5 101 of the discharge and does not affect our main conclusions 2 2 2 groundwater the water level sensors mentioned above were also installed in two observation wells at the village office of yamanakako fig 1 to measure groundwater levels from 24 august 2018 until 1 june 2019 we also used groundwater level data as measured by the village office of yamanakako for these wells from 12 june 2017 through 28 february 2018 the time step for measurements was 1 h we utilized a compiled list of aquifer properties such as hydraulic conductivity ks determined by a pumping test and groundwater level data during october 2014 and february 2015 for 45 existing wells hagiwara boring company 2016 fig 1 seasonal change of groundwater level was small as the average depth and interquartile range of the 45 wells in october and february was 26 3 and 16 7 and 26 5 and 17 7 m respectively contour maps of the water table not shown were created to determine water table depth within the basin 2 2 3 precipitation and meteorological data we used precipitation data air temperature data at 10 min intervals and snow depth at variable intervals measured at the yamanaka amedas station of jma 992 m above sea level fig 1 precipitation data at 1 min intervals from the fuji iyashinomori woodland study center at the university of tokyo utf were additionally used live camera records from the village office of yamanakako and the utf helped to determine snow conditions within the study area snowfall and snow accumulation are often observed however the frequency and amount of snow are quite variable from one year to the next 2 3 runoff characteristic metrics we classified runoff events as two cases case 1 rainfall runoff and case 2 snowmelt runoff or runoff due to the combination of rainfall and snowmelt there were 201 events for case 1 and 17 events for case 2 as a result of the size of the database our main focus was placed on case 1 seasonal changes in precipitation and runoff classified using these case types are provided in fig s4 and details of the classification method are provided in section s5 of the supplementary materials for each catchment we determined the following five runoff characteristic metrics 1 the runoff coefficient r 2 rainfall thresholds above which an event runoff occurs 3 lag time of runoff responses to rainfall 4 runoff duration and 5 runoff frequency see description below 2 3 1 runoff coefficient the runoff coefficient r for each event is defined as qstot ptot for each event where qstot is total event storm runoff and ptot is total event precipitation since there was no baseflow in the four catchments qstot ptot qtot ptot where qtot indicates total event runoff the errors in the estimated discharge mentioned in section 2 2 1 should propagate into the runoff coefficient an error assessment in the supplementary materials s3 indicates that the magnitude of error is of the order of 10 4 10 3 for case 1 and 10 4 to 10 2 for case 2 this corresponds to the error of 10 1 to 1 5 101 the magnitude of the median value of r for each watershed is generally larger than the error except for cases 1 and 2 of ichinohori and for case 1 of ninohori for which the magnitude of error is the same as or larger than that of r thus such cases should be treated with caution 2 3 2 rainfall thresholds in hcs the rainfall threshold is often defined as total event rainfall ptot above which event total runoff qtot increases sharply wei et al 2020 although these features can be visually identified using a scatter plot of ptot vs qtot for our study a piecewise regression analysis farrick and branfireun 2014 wei et al 2020 was applied to all events of rainfall runoff case 1 in order to formally determine a threshold in subsequent comparison discussions for other hcs this parameter is referred to as the a threshold not all watersheds have an a threshold e g ross et al 2019 as a result another threshold the threshold above which runoff events occur e g kampf et al 2018 was also considered this threshold can also be a rainfall metric for actual implementation ptot was used as the rainfall metric and runoff occurrence was judged as a river stage 1 5 cm in the following discussion this threshold is referred to as the b threshold due to its definition the b threshold is particularly useful for ephemeral rivers 2 3 3 lag time streamflow responds to rainfall with a time delay i e the lag time cuevas et al 2019 we determined three types of lag time namely the onset delay time tlag onset defined as the time elapsed between the beginning of precipitation and initial hydrograph rise the peak delay time tlag defined as the time elapsed between peak rainfall and the discharge peak asano et al 2020 and the offset delay time tlag offset defined as the elapsed time between the end of precipitation and the end of hydrograph response 2 3 4 duration three types of duration were determined for each event rainfall duration dp runoff duration dr and rainfall runoff event duration de de is defined as the duration from the beginning of rainfall to the end of a rainfall runoff event which is the later of the end of rainfall or the end of runoff the rati o d d r d p was also determined 2 3 5 runoff frequency runoff frequency per year year 1 was simply determined using the number of runoff events divided by the length of the observation period 2 3 6 comparison to literature values metrics reported for hcs within the scientific literature 29 articles were additionally compiled section s6 in order to determine the difference between young vhcs and nvhcs although some past studies did not report specific metrics they contained the needed information to estimate the metrics the majority of land cover for selected hcs was a forest with slopes largely in the range of 5 25 the characteristics of the selected young vhcs can be summarized as follows 1 watersheds are located in the vicinity of a volcano mostly within 30 km with exception of two watersheds 40 and 90 km and 2 watersheds are underlain by relatively young geology mostly belonging to quaternary with one exception to early miocene 3 results and discussion 3 1 the characteristics of rainfall runoff within the yamanakako basin the mean median and mode of runoff metrics for the four watersheds within the yamanakako basin are provided in table 2 the histograms of the metrics fig 3 for r fig 4 for tlag and figs s6 s11 for others indicated that r varied over a wide range from 10 6 to 10 1 and many of the lag times duration metrics and ratiod were skewed towards larger values particularly for the two eastern catchments therefore the median or mode is likely more appropriate for representing the runoff characteristics of each watershed for r while the mean is more suitable for the t d and ratiod values in general the amount of river runoff was very small the median r was in the range of 10 4 r 10 2 for case 1 and 10 2 r 10 1 for case 2 table 2 while r determined for the entire period of observation was 0 05 for oohori 0 05 for ichinosuna 0 004 for ninohori and 0 01 for nonohori runoff duration was also short in comparison with rainfall duration with 0 3 ratiod 1 3 these are common characteristics observed for vhcs as will be discussed in section 3 3 however we also noticed some differences in metrics between the two western catchments ichinohori and ninohori and the two eastern catchments ichinosuna and oohori indeed a kruskal wallis test with a post hoc test dunn s test indicates that the median values of r tlag toffset lag dr and ratiod are significantly different at the 0 01 level the eastern catchments are characterized by more frequent runoff events higher runoff coefficients smaller rainfall thresholds for triggering discharge shorter onset lag times longer offset lag times and longer event duration naturally all of these characteristics are related higher runoff coefficients are the result of smaller rainfall thresholds to trigger discharge and longer durations which in turn are due to shorter onset lag times and longer offset lag times more frequent runoff events result from smaller rainfall thresholds to trigger discharge in the runoff metrics differences in r values and thresholds are particularly large with median r values being an order of magnitude higher and the b threshold being two orders of magnitude smaller for the eastern catchments as compared to the western catchments fig 5 note that a threshold cannot be determined for the western two catchments differences in the b threshold are likely caused by the difference in topography and the depth to groundwater the eastern catchments are characterized by general flat areas in the valley bottom floodplain and an alluvial fan form within the lower reach of the basin where the water table is very shallow while in western catchments this type of topography and geomorphology do not exist and the mountain slope extends towards the river mouth tables 1 and 3 and fig 2 also see section 2 1 the average time for infiltrated rainwater to reach the water table can be estimated for the lower and middle reaches based on the mean depths an assumed hydraulic gradient of one and a saturated hydraulic conductivity for this estimation we assumed a large infiltration capacity for a forested area the major type of surface cover for our study area and that rainfall infiltration that did not produce surface runoff e g murai and iwasaki 1975 who compiled and compared the infiltration capacity of forests grasslands and bare soils in japan due to high porosity and permeability infiltrated water should quickly percolate within a permeable soil column of andosols and regosols e g meek et al 2008 dahlgren et al 2008 nishiue et al 2014 so that we do not have to pay attention much to the processes within the soil layer the mean required time of 0 2 0 3 h table 3 is indeed very short for the lower reach of the eastern catchments thus infiltrated water quickly reaches the water table and a quick water table rise takes place in the eastern catchments together with channel precipitation this groundwater flow leads to smaller b thresholds for the eastern catchments although areas with shallow groundwater where infiltrated water quickly reaches groundwater should also exist within the western catchments likely along the riverbed and near the shorelines of the lake they only marginally contribute to river runoff because such areas are not very large concrete covered channels within the lower reach of western catchments also prohibited groundwater discharge to river channels these differences are confirmed by fig 6 which provides hydrographs for the four catchments together with the time series for the water table levels riverbed elevations close to observation wells within the lowest reach of each river are also provided in the water table panels the elevations indicate that the water table of ow2 located some 0 5 km away from the ninohori river on the volcano mountain slope is deep around 37 m and remained below the riverbed of the ninohori river thus groundwater cannot discharge to the river around ow2 river water that runs through these rivers during rainfall runoff events is therefore likely to be directly supplied from channel precipitation and groundwater along the riverbed where the water table is likely closer to the surface for the oohori and ichinosuna eastern catchments the water table of ow3 also remained below the riverbed most of the time however the water table is shallower around 9 m at its lowest level than that of ow2 and reached the riverbed during large runoff events based on this data groundwater discharge to rivers took place for 8 and 28 days respectively during heavy storm events dictated by a typhoon on 29 october 2017 ptot 158 mm and 29 september 2018 ptot 285 mm due to the shallower water table groundwater discharge to the river occurred more frequently and over a larger area along the riverbed the larger b threshold for the western catchments causes a longer tlag onset combined with a shorter tlag offset the runoff duration dr was shorter within the western catchments the shorter tlag offset is likely the result of a steeper slope table 1 fig 2 within the lower reach of the watershed which allows the quick recession of stream flow and the decrease in the water table the combination of a shorter dr and a larger b threshold resulted in much smaller r values for the western catchments 3 2 runoff differences between snow and rainfall runoff for the yamanakako basin rainfall runoff case 1 contributed 89 of annual runoff while snow affected runoff case 2 accounted for 11 the corresponding percentages of the annual precipitation were 85 and 15 respectively note that events of case 2 mainly occurred within the two western catchments median r values for case 2 snow runoff were generally larger than those for case 1 rainfall runoff particularly within the western catchments we attribute this partly to the accumulation of drifted snow within river channels although we do not have a continuous record of snow depth on riverbeds examples of accumulated snowfall are presented as photos fig s12 s17 a comparison of fig s12 s17 and the river cross section fig s2 gives a crude estimate of accumulated snow depth it was around 0 2 m 0 5 m on 25 january 2017 table s5 these numbers are generally larger than the snow depth measurement 0 09 m at the yamanaka amedas station on the same day fig 1 similarly on 7 february 2018 the snow depth was 0 2 1 m table s6 while it was 0 27 m at yamanaka amedas meteorological station as a result the water equivalent of accumulated snow within river channels became much larger than that of actual snowfall thus melted snow within river channels could increase the runoff coefficient how much the accumulated snow contributes to this increase should depend on the relative size of precipitation of the next runoff event and the accumulated snow for example in the case of the snow accumulation on 25 january 2017 the ratio of the snow water equivalent of the accumulated snow and total runoff was larger with 0 43 2 88 table s5 while it was only 0 01 0 15 for the snow accumulation on 7 february 2018 table s6 the difference stems mainly from that of precipitation and total runoff for a large precipitation event ptot 68 mm the contribution becomes small while it can be very large for a smaller precipitation event ptot 22 mm since snow accumulation within the river channel and valley bottoms can be expected in any watershed considering this factor as a possible cause for larger runoff r for snow runoff should be important 3 3 differences in runoff characteristics between young vhcs and nvhcs the median and interquartile range for the runoff metrics were also determined for young vhcs and nvhcs in table s4 and are shown in table 4 compared to nvhcs young vhcs are characterized by a smaller r a shorter lag time and duration and a larger a threshold ratiod was larger for nvhcs than vhcs and resulted in a smaller r a larger a threshold and a shorter tlag for vhcs among the metrics r the a threshold tlag and ratiod were judged significantly different at the 0 05 level by a mann whitney test the differences can largely be explained by the hydraulic conductivity ks of the underlying geology in general ks values are larger in young vhcs than in nvhcs karro and lahermo 1999 earle 2019 indeed the ks values reported for some of the nvhcs in table s4 are in the range of 10 4 to 10 8 m s a range that is much smaller than for the yamanakako basin table 1 a larger ks tends to induce quick percolation of rainfall if the water table is shallow this leads to a quick water table rise and runoff response however groundwater also quickly flows out and an elevated water table should quickly decline as such we expect shorter lag times a shorter duration and a small runoff coefficient for vhcs the larger a threshold for vhcs can also be explained by the high ks the a threshold represents the ptot above which the qtot sharply increases implying a condition in which the source area of discharge with saturated soils is extended over a large area within a watershed in young vhcs due to the quick response rise and decline of the water table as a result of a large ks such a scenario occurs less frequently than for nvhcs therefore a condition that satisfies the a threshold occurs only for a limited time and a limited area for vhcs so far we have argued that the infiltration and vertical percolation in the soil column are quick and therefore it is the speed of groundwater rise and decline that determines the runoff characteristics there is some evidence however that the lateral subsurface stormflow plays an important role in the runoff mechanism even in a volcanic area lohse and dietrich 2005 argued that a perched water table develops at subsurface ks contrast and water is drained laterally by demonstrating the presence of a clay layer in deeper soil with much larger ks than ks in upper soil in a 4 m year old soil profile in the hawaiian islands in situ irrigation experiments with deuterium tracer indeed indicated the lateral subsurface flow became more important than the vertical flow however such a clay layer was not found and the vertical flow was dominant in a 300 year old soil profile as soil weathering leads to an increase in clay content age appears important to differentiate hydrological behavior even within the same category of a volcanic area differences in flow regimes in young and old volcanic watersheds were also demonstrated in tague and grant 2004 but the target catchments were of a larger area with third to fifth order streams since our catchments are quite young 300 to 10 k year old the contribution of subsurface lateral flow is likely not very important in fact three available soil profile survey reports in the yamanakako basin national agriculture and food research organization 2022 do not show the presence of a clay layer the above argument was largely made based on table 4 which shows differences in the median of runoff metrics between young vhcs and nvhcs however paying attention to the variability of runoff metrics within vhcs or nvhcs is important the interquartile range table 4 and the individual data points table s4 indicate the large variation in runoff metrics figs 7 9 which provides violin plots of r a threshold and tlag for nvhcs and vhcs clearly illustrate this variation however the r value of vhcs is less variable and is concentrated within the range of r 0 1 while that of nvhcs is distributed over a larger range such variations occur due to the specifics of watersheds and factors that influence runoff characteristics specific reasons that result in smaller a threshold for some vhcs include a much smaller ks on the order of 10 5 10 6 m s farrick and branfireun 2014 in contrast to other vhcs and a lowered infiltration capacity due to volcanic ash which covers surfaces through repeated eruptions jitousono 1992 as the likely runoff mechanism for young vhcs outlined above indicates the depth of the water table is an important factor that controls runoff characteristics and can even make a difference amongst neighboring vhcs as explained in section 3 1 for the two western catchments within the yamanakako basin an elevated water table was rarely observed during rainfall runoff events due to the deep water table in contrast groundwater discharge to the river as subsurface stormflow occurred within eastern catchments with shallower water tables such a scenario has been previously reported for other vhcs e g blume et al 2008 charlier et al 2008 gómez delgado et al 2011 gabrielli et al 2012 see table s4 where the water table is at a shallow depth of approximately 1 5 m the depth of the water table depends on many factors in young volcanic regions the location in or around a volcano body is an important factor from the viewpoint of hydrogeology yamamoto 1970 and yasuhara et al 2007 classified the volcano slope of mt fuji into the following three zones the lower spring zone 800 m asl the intermediate recharge zone 800 2000 m asl and the upper recharge zone 2000 3800 m asl within the lower spring zone the water table generally exists at a shallow depth and perennial rivers and springs can be found within the intermediate recharge zone the water table exists at a lower elevation but at a deep depth and perennial rivers are rare within the upper recharge zone no perennial rivers exist the yamanakako basin is located within the intermediate recharge zone thus we should expect a larger r value for the spring zone and a smaller or zero r value for the upper recharging zone for the same volcanic region other factors that influence runoff characteristics are catchment area permeability slope land cover berne et al 2004 cristiano et al 2017 blaen et al 2016 the thickness of soil layers climate rainfall depth rainfall intensity evapotranspiration etc e g ross et al 2019 and surface land cover e g sriwongsitanon and taesombat 2011 however as mentioned in section 2 3 6 the catchment area slope and land cover of the watersheds listed in table s4 are roughly the same therefore variability in the thickness of soil layers and climate for the listed watersheds are likely factors that cause the variability in runoff metrics within vhcs or nvhcs 3 4 limitations of our findings based on 2 year observations our study was based on 2 years of water level measurements a natural question arises as to whether or not two years is a long enough period of time to capture the runoff characteristics within the yamanakako basin when the measurement period is too short and the sample size is too small sample characteristics may significantly differ from population characteristics and we may miss important runoff phenomena since runoff characteristics are largely controlled by the nature of precipitation we compared precipitation statistics over 30 years to those obtained during our study period to investigate the representativeness of our sample size table 5 compares 30 year precipitation characteristics for the yamanakako basin as well as precipitation characteristics obtained for our study period as the table indicates the statistics were quite similar for the two periods and we seemed to have captured most precipitation types over our 2 year study period an exception is the very large rainfall events of 300 mm d which occurred twice in the past no such event was observed during our 2 year study period a visual comparison of the intensity durationfrequency relationship of event precipitation for the two periods fig 10 also indicates the similarity with an exception for very high intensity and long duration events with a return period 400 years in summary our results based on 2 year observations are likely representatives of runoff characteristics within the yamanakako basin for the majority of precipitation events although the runoff characteristics of extremely large rainfall events were not captured by our study 4 conclusions our study determined that young volcanic headwater catchments vhcs have a smaller runoff coefficient r a shorter lag time and duration and a larger runoff threshold to cause storm runoff as compared to non volcanic headwater catchments nvhcs such differences can be explained by the difference in the hydraulic conductivity of the underlying geology young vhcs have generally higher hydraulic conductivity allowing the quick recharge of precipitation to groundwater and the water table rises and declines where the water table depth is not very deep areas for saturated overland flow occurrence should exist along river beds and within flood plains at downstream locations thus we found the depth of the water table is another important factor in explaining differences in the runoff responses for vhcs as young vhcs the most important runoff mechanism of the four catchments in the yamanakako basin was found to be groundwater flow the high permeability of the soil profile and lack of a clay layer which has been reported to exist in an old volcanic catchment to prevent percolation do not promote lateral subsurface storm flow or saturated overland flow yet even within vhcs in the yamanakako basin there are differences in runoff characteristics although the differences are much smaller than those found between young vhcs and nvhcs the western catchments have smaller runoff coefficients larger thresholds smaller lag times and a shorter runoff duration than the eastern catchments in the yamanakako basin such east west differences are caused by the presence of a valley bottom floodplain located within the lowest portions of eastern catchments with shallow groundwater this landform causes the faster response of eastern watersheds to rainfall events such areas do not exist within the western catchments the 2 year data set used in our study was judged to be representative of precipitation runoff within the yamanakako basin except for a lack of rainfall events with a very high intensity and a long duration return periods 400 years declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

2000,because volcanic rocks have high permeability rainfall quickly infiltrates into the ground perennial rivers often do not exist in volcanic areas however available studies elucidating hydrologic characteristics and the mechanisms of stream formation in young volcanic areas are limited in number extent and coverage prohibiting a comprehensive understanding of runoff formation by measuring river discharge for two years we examined the characteristics of surface runoff in four adjacent headwater catchments within a young volcanic area of mt fuji the runoff coefficient r is small rainfall thresholds for discharge are large and the lag time tlag and duration d of rainfall runoff events are short these characteristics can be explained by the groundwater flow as the dominant runoff mechanism with high hydraulic conductivity due to differences in topography and the depth of groundwater some differences existed amongst the four adjacent catchments in addition a comparison of runoff characteristics between the young volcanic headwater catchments vhcs and non volcanic headwater catchments nvhcs reported in other studies established that young vhcs have a smaller r a shorter tlag and d and a larger runoff threshold for storm runoff than nvhcs these differences are attributed to differences in the hydraulic conductivity of the underlying geology these findings should help improve hydrological models and river structures for flood prevention keywords mt fuji volcanic area headwater catchments runoff characteristics data availability data will be made available on

and or lava however the term volcanic will sometimes be used in place of young volcanic for simplicity in the rest of the paper since stream water is seldom available or unreliable water resource

sources e g varekamp and kreulen 2000 have been studied for volcanic areas in contrast studies on surface runoff particularly those of rainfall runoff processes for young volcanic areas are quite limited in number extent and spatial coverage this is likely because of the lack of perennial flow izuka and abbott 2010 and a lack of observation data and facilities in these types of volcanic areas

penetrates the ground quickly and that little to no surface streams exist e g aizawa et al 2009 izuka and abbott 2010 is based on a limited number of hydrologic case studies indeed there are currently also no review articles or books on surface runoff in young volcanic areas and books on volcanos or volcanology e g parfitt and wilson 2008 lockwood and hazlett 2010 generally do not include information on hydrology there are a few examples that report surface runoff characteristics for a young volcanic area charlier et al 2008 presented a detailed study for runoff within a small volcanic tropical watershed in basse terre island of guadeloupe french west indies and compared their results with previously reported results obtained for tropical catchments with similar permeable soils unfortunately it remains unclear if their findings are applicable to catchments located in different geological settings climatic conditions and or watershed sizes indeed the areas of the compared watersheds varied considerably from 7 5 10 2 km2 to 1 2 km2 kubota et al 1996 investigated runoff characteristics for four catchments located within young volcanic areas mt bandai and mt iwate in northeastern japan and mt merapi in indonesia as well as two other non volcanic catchments kiryu and yanagatani in western japan and compared calibrated parameters for a hydrologic model they concluded that storm runoff is much smaller in volcanic catchments than in non volcanic watersheds although their pioneering work on the hydrologic difference between volcanic and non volcanic watersheds is quite interesting the areas of compared watersheds ranged from 10 2 km2 to 101 km2 making interpretations of their results somewhat difficult ideally a comparison should be made between headwater catchments hcs of similar sizes for such a comparison the influence of other factors such as land use non uniform rainfall distribution within a watershed artificial flow systems in urban areas differences in topography etc can be minimized thus our focus is young volcanic headwater catchments vhcs particularly in comparison with non volcanic headwater catchments nvhcs defined in our study as headwater catchments underlain by the geology of largely non volcanic origin to address the knowledge gap outlined above we selected four young vhcs at the northeastern foot of mt fuji the highest volcano in japan to increase the number of studies on vhcs based on two years of river discharge measurements we scrutinized the characteristics of the runoff events and show that groundwater flow is the dominant runoff process moreover to put our results into perspective we compared our results to those reported in the past for both vhcs and nvhcs to gain comprehensive knowledge of the differences in runoff characteristics between the two thus the objectives of our study were first to report the runoff characteristics of four vhcs and second to advance our knowledge of rainfall runoff characteristics in vhcs by comparing them with those of nvhcs 2 methodology and materials 2 1 study area the four hcs oohori ichinosuna ichinohori and ninohori are located within the yamanakako basin the yamanakako basin fig 1 has an area of 62 5 km2 and an elevation between 980 and 2 045 m lake yamanakako with an area of 6 54 km2 and a depth of 14 3 m environment agency 1989 is located within the basin the northwestern side of the basin discharges lake water through the katsura river the only outflowing river discharge is regulated by a sluice for the purpose of electric power generation the basin is surrounded by the slope of mt fuji in the southwestern direction and by hills and mountains with elevations between 1 100 and 1 400 m in the other directions annual average precipitation within the basin is p 2 288 mm 1991 2020 a large portion of the annual precipitation 910 mm 40 of p occurs during the august october period and a small portion 249 mm 11 of p during winter december february the annual average air temperature t is 9 4 c and the monthly average t ranges from 2 4 c in january to 26 6 c in august japan meteorological agency jma 2021 each of the four study catchments has one ephemeral headwater river the oohori river the ichinosuna river the ichinohori river and the ninohori river flowing into lake yamanakako for this study a headwater river is defined as a small river of first or second order on a 1 100 000 scale map or as a river with a catchment area 10 km2 hill et al 2014 mainstone et al 2016 the four rivers satisfy the first condition and three rivers satisfy the second condition as a result of downward erosion the current river bed is 1 6 3 m table 1 below soil surfaces near the river mouth river cross sections of the four rivers are shown in fig s2 river flow is only observed during and shortly following rainfall and snowmelt periods the topography geology and other relevant information for each catchment are summarized in table 1 2 2 measurements and data sets 2 2 1 river discharge water level sensors u20 001 onset computer corp ma usa were installed on the riverbeds of the four rivers near their discharge points to the lake fig 1 to determine river discharge for approximately two years from june 2017 through may 2019 precipitation during this period mostly represents the precipitation characteristics in this area except for a very large rainfall event see section 3 4 water pressure data obtained at 5 min intervals were combined with local atmospheric pressure to produce water level data water level was then converted to river discharge by applying the gauckler manning gm formula e g brutsaert 2005 since the side slopes and banks of rivers are fixed with concrete along the lowest reach for around 2 km towards the river mouth and since their cross section fig s2 and mean slope were stable throughout the observation period the stage discharge relation was also stable riverbeds of the lower reach of the ichinohori river and ninohori river and the middle reach of the oohori river and ichinosuna river are also fixed with concrete while stones in a net cage are used to fix riverbeds within the lowest reach of the ichinosuna river and oohori river sandy materials accumulate on the riverbed of the oohori river roughness coefficients n 0 018 0 032 were derived from available past measurements of water level and flow velocity during rainfall runoff events and mean slope and cross sectional shape based on in situ surveys bi 2017 a crude error assessment in section s3 in the supplementary materials indicates that the uncertainty in the discharge is very small 10 2 to 10 1 m3 s 10 1 to 1 5 101 of the discharge and does not affect our main conclusions 2 2 2 groundwater the water level sensors mentioned above were also installed in two observation wells at the village office of yamanakako fig 1 to measure groundwater levels from 24 august 2018 until 1 june 2019 we also used groundwater level data as measured by the village office of yamanakako for these wells from 12 june 2017 through 28 february 2018 the time step for measurements was 1 h we utilized a compiled list of aquifer properties such as hydraulic conductivity ks determined by a pumping test and groundwater level data during october 2014 and february 2015 for 45 existing wells hagiwara boring company 2016 fig 1 seasonal change of groundwater level was small as the average depth and interquartile range of the 45 wells in october and february was 26 3 and 16 7 and 26 5 and 17 7 m respectively contour maps of the water table not shown were created to determine water table depth within the basin 2 2 3 precipitation and meteorological data we used precipitation data air temperature data at 10 min intervals and snow depth at variable intervals measured at the yamanaka amedas station of jma 992 m above sea level fig 1 precipitation data at 1 min intervals from the fuji iyashinomori woodland study center at the university of tokyo utf were additionally used live camera records from the village office of yamanakako and the utf helped to determine snow conditions within the study area snowfall and snow accumulation are often observed however the frequency and amount of snow are quite variable from one year to the next 2 3 runoff characteristic metrics we classified runoff events as two cases case 1 rainfall runoff and case 2 snowmelt runoff or runoff due to the combination of rainfall and snowmelt there were 201 events for case 1 and 17 events for case 2 as a result of the size of the database our main focus was placed on case 1 seasonal changes in precipitation and runoff classified using these case types are provided in fig s4 and details of the classification method are provided in section s5 of the supplementary materials for each catchment we determined the following five runoff characteristic metrics 1 the runoff coefficient r 2 rainfall thresholds above which an event runoff occurs 3 lag time of runoff responses to rainfall 4 runoff duration and 5 runoff frequency see description below 2 3 1 runoff coefficient the runoff coefficient r for each event is defined as qstot ptot for each event where qstot is total event storm runoff and ptot is total event precipitation since there was no baseflow in the four catchments qstot ptot qtot ptot where qtot indicates total event runoff the errors in the estimated discharge mentioned in section 2 2 1 should propagate into the runoff coefficient an error assessment in the supplementary materials s3 indicates that the magnitude of error is of the order of 10 4 10 3 for case 1 and 10 4 to 10 2 for case 2 this corresponds to the error of 10 1 to 1 5 101 the magnitude of the median value of r for each watershed is generally larger than the error except for cases 1 and 2 of ichinohori and for case 1 of ninohori for which the magnitude of error is the same as or larger than that of r thus such cases should be treated with caution 2 3 2 rainfall thresholds in hcs the rainfall threshold is often defined as total event rainfall ptot above which event total runoff qtot increases sharply wei et al 2020 although these features can be visually identified using a scatter plot of ptot vs qtot for our study a piecewise regression analysis farrick and branfireun 2014 wei et al 2020 was applied to all events of rainfall runoff case 1 in order to formally determine a threshold in subsequent comparison discussions for other hcs this parameter is referred to as the a threshold not all watersheds have an a threshold e g ross et al 2019 as a result another threshold the threshold above which runoff events occur e g kampf et al 2018 was also considered this threshold can also be a rainfall metric for actual implementation ptot was used as the rainfall metric and runoff occurrence was judged as a river stage 1 5 cm in the following discussion this threshold is referred to as the b threshold due to its definition the b threshold is particularly useful for ephemeral rivers 2 3 3 lag time streamflow responds to rainfall with a time delay i e the lag time cuevas et al 2019 we determined three types of lag time namely the onset delay time tlag onset defined as the time elapsed between the beginning of precipitation and initial hydrograph rise the peak delay time tlag defined as the time elapsed between peak rainfall and the discharge peak asano et al 2020 and the offset delay time tlag offset defined as the elapsed time between the end of precipitation and the end of hydrograph response 2 3 4 duration three types of duration were determined for each event rainfall duration dp runoff duration dr and rainfall runoff event duration de de is defined as the duration from the beginning of rainfall to the end of a rainfall runoff event which is the later of the end of rainfall or the end of runoff the rati o d d r d p was also determined 2 3 5 runoff frequency runoff frequency per year year 1 was simply determined using the number of runoff events divided by the length of the observation period 2 3 6 comparison to literature values metrics reported for hcs within the scientific literature 29 articles were additionally compiled section s6 in order to determine the difference between young vhcs and nvhcs although some past studies did not report specific metrics they contained the needed information to estimate the metrics the majority of land cover for selected hcs was a forest with slopes largely in the range of 5 25 the characteristics of the selected young vhcs can be summarized as follows 1 watersheds are located in the vicinity of a volcano mostly within 30 km with exception of two watersheds 40 and 90 km and 2 watersheds are underlain by relatively young geology mostly belonging to quaternary with one exception to early miocene 3 results and discussion 3 1 the characteristics of rainfall runoff within the yamanakako basin the mean median and mode of runoff metrics for the four watersheds within the yamanakako basin are provided in table 2 the histograms of the metrics fig 3 for r fig 4 for tlag and figs s6 s11 for others indicated that r varied over a wide range from 10 6 to 10 1 and many of the lag times duration metrics and ratiod were skewed towards larger values particularly for the two eastern catchments therefore the median or mode is likely more appropriate for representing the runoff characteristics of each watershed for r while the mean is more suitable for the t d and ratiod values in general the amount of river runoff was very small the median r was in the range of 10 4 r 10 2 for case 1 and 10 2 r 10 1 for case 2 table 2 while r determined for the entire period of observation was 0 05 for oohori 0 05 for ichinosuna 0 004 for ninohori and 0 01 for nonohori runoff duration was also short in comparison with rainfall duration with 0 3 ratiod 1 3 these are common characteristics observed for vhcs as will be discussed in section 3 3 however we also noticed some differences in metrics between the two western catchments ichinohori and ninohori and the two eastern catchments ichinosuna and oohori indeed a kruskal wallis test with a post hoc test dunn s test indicates that the median values of r tlag toffset lag dr and ratiod are significantly different at the 0 01 level the eastern catchments are characterized by more frequent runoff events higher runoff coefficients smaller rainfall thresholds for triggering discharge shorter onset lag times longer offset lag times and longer event duration naturally all of these characteristics are related higher runoff coefficients are the result of smaller rainfall thresholds to trigger discharge and longer durations which in turn are due to shorter onset lag times and longer offset lag times more frequent runoff events result from smaller rainfall thresholds to trigger discharge in the runoff metrics differences in r values and thresholds are particularly large with median r values being an order of magnitude higher and the b threshold being two orders of magnitude smaller for the eastern catchments as compared to the western catchments fig 5 note that a threshold cannot be determined for the western two catchments differences in the b threshold are likely caused by the difference in topography and the depth to groundwater the eastern catchments are characterized by general flat areas in the valley bottom floodplain and an alluvial fan form within the lower reach of the basin where the water table is very shallow while in western catchments this type of topography and geomorphology do not exist and the mountain slope extends towards the river mouth tables 1 and 3 and fig 2 also see section 2 1 the average time for infiltrated rainwater to reach the water table can be estimated for the lower and middle reaches based on the mean depths an assumed hydraulic gradient of one and a saturated hydraulic conductivity for this estimation we assumed a large infiltration capacity for a forested area the major type of surface cover for our study area and that rainfall infiltration that did not produce surface runoff e g murai and iwasaki 1975 who compiled and compared the infiltration capacity of forests grasslands and bare soils in japan due to high porosity and permeability infiltrated water should quickly percolate within a permeable soil column of andosols and regosols e g meek et al 2008 dahlgren et al 2008 nishiue et al 2014 so that we do not have to pay attention much to the processes within the soil layer the mean required time of 0 2 0 3 h table 3 is indeed very short for the lower reach of the eastern catchments thus infiltrated water quickly reaches the water table and a quick water table rise takes place in the eastern catchments together with channel precipitation this groundwater flow leads to smaller b thresholds for the eastern catchments although areas with shallow groundwater where infiltrated water quickly reaches groundwater should also exist within the western catchments likely along the riverbed and near the shorelines of the lake they only marginally contribute to river runoff because such areas are not very large concrete covered channels within the lower reach of western catchments also prohibited groundwater discharge to river channels these differences are confirmed by fig 6 which provides hydrographs for the four catchments together with the time series for the water table levels riverbed elevations close to observation wells within the lowest reach of each river are also provided in the water table panels the elevations indicate that the water table of ow2 located some 0 5 km away from the ninohori river on the volcano mountain slope is deep around 37 m and remained below the riverbed of the ninohori river thus groundwater cannot discharge to the river around ow2 river water that runs through these rivers during rainfall runoff events is therefore likely to be directly supplied from channel precipitation and groundwater along the riverbed where the water table is likely closer to the surface for the oohori and ichinosuna eastern catchments the water table of ow3 also remained below the riverbed most of the time however the water table is shallower around 9 m at its lowest level than that of ow2 and reached the riverbed during large runoff events based on this data groundwater discharge to rivers took place for 8 and 28 days respectively during heavy storm events dictated by a typhoon on 29 october 2017 ptot 158 mm and 29 september 2018 ptot 285 mm due to the shallower water table groundwater discharge to the river occurred more frequently and over a larger area along the riverbed the larger b threshold for the western catchments causes a longer tlag onset combined with a shorter tlag offset the runoff duration dr was shorter within the western catchments the shorter tlag offset is likely the result of a steeper slope table 1 fig 2 within the lower reach of the watershed which allows the quick recession of stream flow and the decrease in the water table the combination of a shorter dr and a larger b threshold resulted in much smaller r values for the western catchments 3 2 runoff differences between snow and rainfall runoff for the yamanakako basin rainfall runoff case 1 contributed 89 of annual runoff while snow affected runoff case 2 accounted for 11 the corresponding percentages of the annual precipitation were 85 and 15 respectively note that events of case 2 mainly occurred within the two western catchments median r values for case 2 snow runoff were generally larger than those for case 1 rainfall runoff particularly within the western catchments we attribute this partly to the accumulation of drifted snow within river channels although we do not have a continuous record of snow depth on riverbeds examples of accumulated snowfall are presented as photos fig s12 s17 a comparison of fig s12 s17 and the river cross section fig s2 gives a crude estimate of accumulated snow depth it was around 0 2 m 0 5 m on 25 january 2017 table s5 these numbers are generally larger than the snow depth measurement 0 09 m at the yamanaka amedas station on the same day fig 1 similarly on 7 february 2018 the snow depth was 0 2 1 m table s6 while it was 0 27 m at yamanaka amedas meteorological station as a result the water equivalent of accumulated snow within river channels became much larger than that of actual snowfall thus melted snow within river channels could increase the runoff coefficient how much the accumulated snow contributes to this increase should depend on the relative size of precipitation of the next runoff event and the accumulated snow for example in the case of the snow accumulation on 25 january 2017 the ratio of the snow water equivalent of the accumulated snow and total runoff was larger with 0 43 2 88 table s5 while it was only 0 01 0 15 for the snow accumulation on 7 february 2018 table s6 the difference stems mainly from that of precipitation and total runoff for a large precipitation event ptot 68 mm the contribution becomes small while it can be very large for a smaller precipitation event ptot 22 mm since snow accumulation within the river channel and valley bottoms can be expected in any watershed considering this factor as a possible cause for larger runoff r for snow runoff should be important 3 3 differences in runoff characteristics between young vhcs and nvhcs the median and interquartile range for the runoff metrics were also determined for young vhcs and nvhcs in table s4 and are shown in table 4 compared to nvhcs young vhcs are characterized by a smaller r a shorter lag time and duration and a larger a threshold ratiod was larger for nvhcs than vhcs and resulted in a smaller r a larger a threshold and a shorter tlag for vhcs among the metrics r the a threshold tlag and ratiod were judged significantly different at the 0 05 level by a mann whitney test the differences can largely be explained by the hydraulic conductivity ks of the underlying geology in general ks values are larger in young vhcs than in nvhcs karro and lahermo 1999 earle 2019 indeed the ks values reported for some of the nvhcs in table s4 are in the range of 10 4 to 10 8 m s a range that is much smaller than for the yamanakako basin table 1 a larger ks tends to induce quick percolation of rainfall if the water table is shallow this leads to a quick water table rise and runoff response however groundwater also quickly flows out and an elevated water table should quickly decline as such we expect shorter lag times a shorter duration and a small runoff coefficient for vhcs the larger a threshold for vhcs can also be explained by the high ks the a threshold represents the ptot above which the qtot sharply increases implying a condition in which the source area of discharge with saturated soils is extended over a large area within a watershed in young vhcs due to the quick response rise and decline of the water table as a result of a large ks such a scenario occurs less frequently than for nvhcs therefore a condition that satisfies the a threshold occurs only for a limited time and a limited area for vhcs so far we have argued that the infiltration and vertical percolation in the soil column are quick and therefore it is the speed of groundwater rise and decline that determines the runoff characteristics there is some evidence however that the lateral subsurface stormflow plays an important role in the runoff mechanism even in a volcanic area lohse and dietrich 2005 argued that a perched water table develops at subsurface ks contrast and water is drained laterally by demonstrating the presence of a clay layer in deeper soil with much larger ks than ks in upper soil in a 4 m year old soil profile in the hawaiian islands in situ irrigation experiments with deuterium tracer indeed indicated the lateral subsurface flow became more important than the vertical flow however such a clay layer was not found and the vertical flow was dominant in a 300 year old soil profile as soil weathering leads to an increase in clay content age appears important to differentiate hydrological behavior even within the same category of a volcanic area differences in flow regimes in young and old volcanic watersheds were also demonstrated in tague and grant 2004 but the target catchments were of a larger area with third to fifth order streams since our catchments are quite young 300 to 10 k year old the contribution of subsurface lateral flow is likely not very important in fact three available soil profile survey reports in the yamanakako basin national agriculture and food research organization 2022 do not show the presence of a clay layer the above argument was largely made based on table 4 which shows differences in the median of runoff metrics between young vhcs and nvhcs however paying attention to the variability of runoff metrics within vhcs or nvhcs is important the interquartile range table 4 and the individual data points table s4 indicate the large variation in runoff metrics figs 7 9 which provides violin plots of r a threshold and tlag for nvhcs and vhcs clearly illustrate this variation however the r value of vhcs is less variable and is concentrated within the range of r 0 1 while that of nvhcs is distributed over a larger range such variations occur due to the specifics of watersheds and factors that influence runoff characteristics specific reasons that result in smaller a threshold for some vhcs include a much smaller ks on the order of 10 5 10 6 m s farrick and branfireun 2014 in contrast to other vhcs and a lowered infiltration capacity due to volcanic ash which covers surfaces through repeated eruptions jitousono 1992 as the likely runoff mechanism for young vhcs outlined above indicates the depth of the water table is an important factor that controls runoff characteristics and can even make a difference amongst neighboring vhcs as explained in section 3 1 for the two western catchments within the yamanakako basin an elevated water table was rarely observed during rainfall runoff events due to the deep water table in contrast groundwater discharge to the river as subsurface stormflow occurred within eastern catchments with shallower water tables such a scenario has been previously reported for other vhcs e g blume et al 2008 charlier et al 2008 gómez delgado et al 2011 gabrielli et al 2012 see table s4 where the water table is at a shallow depth of approximately 1 5 m the depth of the water table depends on many factors in young volcanic regions the location in or around a volcano body is an important factor from the viewpoint of hydrogeology yamamoto 1970 and yasuhara et al 2007 classified the volcano slope of mt fuji into the following three zones the lower spring zone 800 m asl the intermediate recharge zone 800 2000 m asl and the upper recharge zone 2000 3800 m asl within the lower spring zone the water table generally exists at a shallow depth and perennial rivers and springs can be found within the intermediate recharge zone the water table exists at a lower elevation but at a deep depth and perennial rivers are rare within the upper recharge zone no perennial rivers exist the yamanakako basin is located within the intermediate recharge zone thus we should expect a larger r value for the spring zone and a smaller or zero r value for the upper recharging zone for the same volcanic region other factors that influence runoff characteristics are catchment area permeability slope land cover berne et al 2004 cristiano et al 2017 blaen et al 2016 the thickness of soil layers climate rainfall depth rainfall intensity evapotranspiration etc e g ross et al 2019 and surface land cover e g sriwongsitanon and taesombat 2011 however as mentioned in section 2 3 6 the catchment area slope and land cover of the watersheds listed in table s4 are roughly the same therefore variability in the thickness of soil layers and climate for the listed watersheds are likely factors that cause the variability in runoff metrics within vhcs or nvhcs 3 4 limitations of our findings based on 2 year observations our study was based on 2 years of water level measurements a natural question arises as to whether or not two years is a long enough period of time to capture the runoff characteristics within the yamanakako basin when the measurement period is too short and the sample size is too small sample characteristics may significantly differ from population characteristics and we may miss important runoff phenomena since runoff characteristics are largely controlled by the nature of precipitation we compared precipitation statistics over 30 years to those obtained during our study period to investigate the representativeness of our sample size table 5 compares 30 year precipitation characteristics for the yamanakako basin as well as precipitation characteristics obtained for our study period as the table indicates the statistics were quite similar for the two periods and we seemed to have captured most precipitation types over our 2 year study period an exception is the very large rainfall events of 300 mm d which occurred twice in the past no such event was observed during our 2 year study period a visual comparison of the intensity durationfrequency relationship of event precipitation for the two periods fig 10 also indicates the similarity with an exception for very high intensity and long duration events with a return period 400 years in summary our results based on 2 year observations are likely representatives of runoff characteristics within the yamanakako basin for the majority of precipitation events although the runoff characteristics of extremely large rainfall events were not captured by our study 4 conclusions our study determined that young volcanic headwater catchments vhcs have a smaller runoff coefficient r a shorter lag time and duration and a larger runoff threshold to cause storm runoff as compared to non volcanic headwater catchments nvhcs such differences can be explained by the difference in the hydraulic conductivity of the underlying geology young vhcs have generally higher hydraulic conductivity allowing the quick recharge of precipitation to groundwater and the water table rises and declines where the water table depth is not very deep areas for saturated overland flow occurrence should exist along river beds and within flood plains at downstream locations thus we found the depth of the water table is another important factor in explaining differences in the runoff responses for vhcs as young vhcs the most important runoff mechanism of the four catchments in the yamanakako basin was found to be groundwater flow the high permeability of the soil profile and lack of a clay layer which has been reported to exist in an old volcanic catchment to prevent percolation do not promote lateral subsurface storm flow or saturated overland flow yet even within vhcs in the yamanakako basin there are differences in runoff characteristics although the differences are much smaller than those found between young vhcs and nvhcs the western catchments have smaller runoff coefficients larger thresholds smaller lag times and a shorter runoff duration than the eastern catchments in the yamanakako basin such east west differences are caused by the presence of a valley bottom floodplain located within the lowest portions of eastern catchments with shallow groundwater this landform causes the faster response of eastern watersheds to rainfall events such areas do not exist within the western catchments the 2 year data set used in our study was judged to be representative of precipitation runoff within the yamanakako basin except for a lack of rainfall events with a very high intensity and a long duration return periods 400 years declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

2001,small dams for power generation are increasingly being built around the world and the reported impact caused by these structures on sediment transport varies widely ranging from substantial to minimal or non existent alterations among different dams such variability is still poorly understood in this study we present an original application of fuzzy inference systems fis to extract knowledge concerning the effect of small dams on sediment transport providing understandings of how different variables related to watershed characteristics dam characteristics and hydrological variations can affect sedimentological responses of these structures numerous small dams have been built and many more are in development or proposed in rivers that drain into the pantanal a world renowned tropical wetland where we apply the methodology data on 23 hydropower facilities from the uplands of the pantanal region were used with a total of 535 records the models presented very good results ns equal to 0 92 for the most detailed fis model and provided a better understanding of the phenomenon through their explicit linguistic rules the upstream suspended sediment concentration ssc is the most determinant variable for the alteration caused by dams higher ssc entering the reservoir is related to higher sediment retention vegetation cover and soil type of the drainage area of dams also influence the alterations on ssc caused by these structures dams located in basins with greater vegetation cover tend to affect less sediment transport and dams located in basins with high percentages of agriculture and pasture tend to alter more fis models also confirmed that the size of dams is directly proportional to their capacity to alter sediment transport the methodologies developed for the interpretation of fuzzy rules proved to be useful for assessing how small dams affect sediment transport along river systems keywords suspended sediment concentration small dams fuzzy association rules data mining pantanal data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction dams are known for causing severe effects on hydrologic geomorphic and ecological systems brandt 2000 nilsson et al 2005 the barrier caused by dams disrupts the longitudinal connectivity of the river causing discontinuities in the flux of sediment and nutrients and blocking the upstream mobility of migratory fishes campos et al 2020 fantin cruz et al 2016 nilsson and svedmark 2002 concerning sediment transport the effects of large flow regulating dams are well documented dai and liu 2013 erskine 1985 wang et al 2018 wei et al 2021 however less attention has been given to the impact of smaller dams even though they are the most common type of dam being built around the world casserly et al 2021 fantin cruz et al 2020 magilligan et al 2021 especially in tropical rivers chong et al 2021 some studies suggest that even run of river and small storage capacity dams may affect the sediment transport and the channel morphology causing sedimentation upstream and in some cases erosion downstream of the dams baker et al 2011 couto and olden 2018 csiki and rhoads 2010 wildman and macbroom 2005 however they are commonly considered to be much less environmentally harmful than larger dams and therefore many countries established policies that promote small hydropower shp facilities with minimal environmental reviews couto and olden 2018 fantin cruz et al 2020 relatively few studies have investigated the effects of smaller dams on sediment transport casserly et al 2021 csiki and rhoads 2010 fantin cruz et al 2020 magilligan et al 2021 and the impact reported in these studies varies widely ranging from substantial baker et al 2011 casserly et al 2021 fantin cruz et al 2020 orr et al 2006 wildman and macbroom 2005 to minimal or non existent alterations among upstream and downstream of these structures ashley et al 2006 csiki and rhoads 2014 lindloff 2003 velinsky et al 2006 such variability is still poorly understood and depends on the watershed characteristics the sediment supply the rainfall patterns the characteristics of the dam and the capacity of river hydraulics to transport sediment over the dam csiki and rhoads 2010 in the upper paraguay river basin uprb specifically in the upland watersheds that drain into the pantanal floodplains the largest wetlands of the world there is a great environmental concern regarding the increase in shp facilities being built over the last few years in 2018 there were 47 hydropower facilities in operation mostly shp with an additional 138 projects under construction planned proposed or identified by the government as prospective sites oliveira et al 2020 in the last two years some studies have investigated the possible effects of these small dams on the pantanal tributaries including hydrological effects ely et al 2020 figueiredo et al 2021 jardim et al 2020 effects on sediment transport fantin cruz et al 2020 nutrient transport and water quality oliveira et al 2020 silva et al 2019 and fish and fisheries campos et al 2020 fantin cruz et al 2020 analysed the suspended and bedload sediment transport upstream and downstream of 29 current hydropower facilities in the uplands of the uprb the results indicated great variability among the analysed facilities including retention null alteration and release of sediment in some cases bedload sediment transport was a small component of total sediment transport representing less than 10 in most cases in addition a predictive model using artificial neural networks ann estimated the impact of 80 future shps on suspended sediment transport based on observations at current facilities the prediction indicated that the future shps would reduce the suspended sediment transport by 62 towards the pantanal wetland another important research related to sediment transport in the uprb is campos and pedrollo 2021 this study presented an ann based model to estimate suspended sediment transport in ungauged basins within the uprb by using qualitative variables that physically characterize the watersheds soil type land use drainage area and mean catchment slope and quantitative variables to represent temporal variability of the sediment transport turbidity discharge and previous rainfall this study highlighted the wide variation in the sediment transport among the watersheds of the uprb which is a consequence of its complex hydrological system and the great heterogeneity between the uplands and the floodplains of the pantanal this study provided information about the most important variables related to the variations of sediment transport in this region which can be useful for understanding the variations of the effects from different small dams ai models have been successfully applied to sediment transport estimations such as ann models atieh et al 2015 campos and pedrollo 2021 gholami et al 2018 jain 2001 jimeno sáez et al 2022 sari et al 2017 fuzzy rule based models buyukyildiz and kumcu 2017 kisi and shiri 2012 kumar et al 2019 shoaib et al 2018 sirabahenda et al 2017 teixeira et al 2020 and genetic programming aytek and kişi 2008 kisi et al 2012 yadav et al 2018 however these studies generally are focused on obtaining high and accurate performances for the estimations although the study of fantin cruz et al 2020 provided important information regarding the effects of current and future shps in the uprb a gap still remains concerning how different watershed characteristics dam characteristics and hydrological variations affect the sedimentological responses caused by the dams in order to overcome this gap an alternative way to assess these effects could be achieved by using data from the most important variables related to the sediment transport in this region as well as dam characteristics and applying artificial intelligence ai models focused on discovering knowledge or detecting patterns within data data mining so far studies applying ai models on data mining or discovering knowledge about sediment transport in rivers and the effects of small dams were not found in the present literature fuzzy inference systems fis are considered universal approximators meaning that they can be designed to approximate any continuous function with any chosen precision hornik et al 1989 wang 1992 these models can also be used as a tool for understanding data and their relationships the main advantage of fis models is their similarity to human reasoning kaya and alhajj 2003 providing human friendly representation through their linguistic variables and explicit fuzzy association rules lucchese et al 2021 the existence of explicit rules and linguistic descriptions provide interpretability to fis models and therefore provide a better understanding of the physical behaviour of the system guillaume 2001 lucchese et al 2021 pancho et al 2013 therefore the aim of our research is to use fis models for modelling the effects of current small hydroelectric facilities on suspended sediment transport within the uprb focusing mainly on their ability to discover knowledge and patterns within data for this we propose to experiment fis models focusing on capturing relationships through the fuzzy association rules regarding how different watershed characteristics dam characteristics and hydrological variations affect the sedimentological responses of these dams this objective requires the development of original methodologies for the interpretation of fuzzy rules 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and hydroelectric facilities this study was carried out on the rivers of watersheds that feed the pantanal wetland in the upper paraguay river basin uprb in the last decades this region has seen the number of hydroelectric facilities grow rapidly and currently has hundreds of projects being considered for the future fig 1 in brazil hydropower plants are classified as small when they have installed electrical generation capacities of less than 30 mw in the uprb 47 hydroelectric facilities are operating of which 40 are categorized as small hydropower plants shps installed capacity less than 30 mw and 7 as large hydropower facilities lhps installed capacity 30 mw more than half of the facilities are designed as run of river which generally have little storage and the rest are designed with conventional storage ana 2018 the uprb has two distinct regions with different topographic and hydrological characteristics the uplands and the pantanal floodplains the uplands altitudes ranging from 150 m to 1400 m are situated mainly in the north and east of the pantanal representing 59 of the basin area this region comprises deep soils and high slopes favouring rapid drainage and high sediment production the native vegetation is the cerrado a type of savannah but extensive areas were converted to agriculture or pasture currently 29 of the upland watershed area is being used for agriculture and 22 for pasture problems regarding water quality mostly involve diffuse pollution by soil erosion and agrochemicals from agriculture as well as local pollution by wastewater effluents usually in urban areas oliveira et al 2020 the pantanal floodplain comprises 41 of the basin area and presents altitudes below 150 m this region has complex hydraulic and hydrosedimentological dynamics due to the low flat and humid lands and the low riverbanks which make the drainage system unable to quickly transmit the water received from the uplands campos and pedrollo 2021 the pantanal is globally recognized as an important wetland ecosystem that contains unique aquatic habitats and landscapes with several endangered mammals and birds tomas et al 2019 the major economic activities within the pantanal are cattle ranching subsistence and recreational fishing and ecotourism fantin cruz et al 2020 according to the köppen geiger climate classification the climate of the uprb is tropical savanna with rainfall concentrated in the summer the annual average precipitation in the uprb ranges from 1200 to 1600 mm with the highest values occurring in the uplands about 80 of the annual rainfall occurs in the rainy season from october to april campos and pedrollo 2021 regarding evapotranspiration the uprb presents high values about 85 of the annual average precipitation ana 2018 2 2 data sources we selected 23 current hydropower facilities within the uplands of the uprb for this study based on availability of upstream and downstream ssc data the characteristics of the selected hydropower facilities are shown in table 1 from the selected facilities 18 are considered shps and 5 exceed 30 mw lhps however the large facilities selected have dams and reservoirs similar in size to the shps and one of the shps são lourenço 29 mw creates a reservoir comparable in size to the facility with the highest installed capacity ponte de pedra 176 mw therefore all the analysed facilities are considered small in this study which of 13 are run of river dams and 10 are conventional storage dams we used data on ssc and flow sampled upstream and downstream of the hydroelectric facilities most of the data used in this research were collected on 13 dates spanning the wet and dry seasons from october 2018 to may 2019 data from reports submitted by hydropower companies to the state environmental agencies were also included ranging from 2003 to 2019 the sample collection and analysis of ssc and discharge as well as the characteristics of current and future hydropower facilities were provided by the brazilian corporation for agricultural research embrapa and the federal university of mato grosso ufmt through a project funded by the brazilian national water agency and the eliseu alves foundation more detailed descriptions of the sample collection and analysis are found in fantin cruz et al 2020 overall the selected facilities have a minimum of 10 pairs of data which means data on ssc and flow upstream and downstream of the hydroelectric facilities measured on the same date but several have more pairs of data in total we used 535 pairs of data data regarding the facility characteristics reservoir area reservoir volume and detention time and data regarding the facility watersheds such as drainage area land use and land cover soil type and rainfall were also employed the land use and land cover in the uprb was based on the mapbioma project this project is a multi institutional initiative to annually map the coverage and use of land in brazil and monitor changes in the territory souza et al 2020 since most of the ssc data were collected between 2018 and 2019 the map was made using images from 2019 taken by the landsat 8 satellite with a spatial resolution of 30 m the soil types of the uprb were characterized by following the brazilian soil type map at a scale of 1 5 000 000 santos et al 2018 initially the brazilian soil map had 13 classes for the uprb all the previous classes were simplified into five classes water bodies sandy soil medium soil clayey soil and outcrop in fig 2 the final maps of the land use and cover and the soil type of the uprb are presented precipitation data was taken from the merge product which is a combination of observed rainfall data and satellite information made available to all of south america the merge data come from the brazilian national institute of space research cptec inpe the merge product uses rainfall data estimated by remote sensing to fill in rainfall information in locations with insufficient in situ monitoring daily and hourly data are available in grids of 10 km further details can be found in rozante et al 2010 the daily merge data were downloaded for the period january 2003 to july 2019 which encompasses the data period of the ssc and flow measurements then the precipitation data were extracted for the drainage area of the facilities 2 3 modelling and data mining a summary of the methodological framework used in this research is presented below fig 3 first we selected several variables that are directly and indirectly related to the sediment transport in the uprb and variables related to the characteristics of the hydroelectric facilities mamdani fuzzy inference systems were used to model the effects caused by small dams over the sediment transport and to provide information on the variability of these effects by taking advantage of the inherent interpretability of these models the knowledge discovery data mining was performed by an original methodology developed in this research to assess fuzzy associative rules all models and procedures were custom programmed in matlab r2012b which favours occasional improvements to the methods 2 3 1 input and output model variables the selection of input variables was based on previous studies of sediment transport and small dams within the uprb campos and pedrollo 2021 fantin cruz et al 2020 we selected several variables related to watershed characteristics dam characteristics and hydrological variations to represent the great variability of the sediments in the region aiming to research how the facilities in this region variably affect the sediment transport 535 pairs of data on ssc and flow upstream and downstream of the 23 studied facilities were used the output variable was the alteration of ssc given by the following equation 1 alteration of ssc downstream ssc upstream ssc where the values of ssc are given in mg l and the alteration of ssc can assume negative and positive values depending on retention or release of sediment variables related to the watershed characteristics of each dam comprise watershed area km2 land use cover only the forest grassland pasture and agriculture classes and soil type only the sandy soil silty soil and clayey soil classes the classes of urbanization water bodies and wetlands of land use cover and classes of outcrop and water bodies of the soil type were not included in the models wetlands and water bodies mostly occur in the floodplain and since the shps are in the uplands these classes are not relevant to the models outcrops and urbanization appear only in specific small parts of the basin and represent less than 0 01 of the area of the study region therefore they are also not relevant to the models the selected classes of soil type and land use cover were included as proportions of the basin area each class of soil type and land use cover was included in the models as an input variable regarding dam characteristics we used data on reservoir area km2 reservoir volume dam3 and detention time days the detention time was calculated by the following equation 2 detention t i m e days re s e r v o i r v o l u m e m 3 inflow m 3 s 86400 furthermore we used inflow m3 s exponentially weighted moving averages ewma of past rainfall mm and upstream ssc mg l as input variables these variables refer to the hydrological variations which can influence the sedimentological responses of the dams the ewma of past rainfall has been used in several studies involving data driven models and sediment transport campos and pedrollo 2021 oliveira et al 2017 teixeira et al 2020 and provides better estimates than those obtained using only rainfall data without this resource the ewma of past rainfall assigns greater weight to more recent precipitation in the composition of the moving average promoting a synthesis of recent precipitation information in the form of a representative value the ewma is applied to precipitation time series with constant intervals according to eqs 3 and 4 3 ewma t 1 ewma t 1 p t 4 1 0 5 1 h where pt is the precipitation at time t and h is the half life parameter given in days the ewma was applied to the precipitation data obtained from the merge product for the 23 watershed areas of the analysed shps we used ewma of rainfalls with the half life parameter h 1 which means that a resulting value of the ewma of rainfall gives 50 importance weight to the current day value and 50 to past days decreasing exponentially towards the past higher values of the half life parameter will give greater weight to past rains overall the ewma of past rainfall is a function that can represent single rainy days as well as long rainy periods the value of the half life parameter was chosen from a preliminary analysis of linear correlations between the time series of ewma of rainfalls and upstream ssc of the dams we tested different half life parameters and h 1 day showed the strongest linear correlation with the upstream ssc variable fig 4 presents a summary of the input variables selected to estimate the alteration of ssc the output variable among the hydroelectric facilities within the uprb the entire dataset is available in the supplementary files 2 3 2 partition data for the modelling stage data were divided into three samples training validation and verification the dataset was divided by selecting data from 2 4 of the facilities for the training 1 4 for the validation and 1 4 for the verification facilities with extreme values maximum and minimum were included in the training samples to provide spatial balance facilities from different sub catchments were included in both training validation and verification samples 2 3 3 fuzzy model design a fuzzy inference system is a qualitative modelling scheme in which the system behaviour is described by using natural language lohani et al 2007 mamdani fuzzy inference systems mamdani 1977 are the most comprehensible and interpretable fis due to their linguistic terms in the antecedent and in the consequent maintaining verbal formalization during their whole inference process casillas 2003 the mamdani fis are generally composed of the following components lucchese et al 2021 1 fuzzification of the input and output variables 2 a rule base or knowledge base 3 fuzzy inference mechanism and 4 defuzzification of the fuzzy output into a crisp number fig 5 the fuzzification process is performed through membership functions mfs which can be designed in different formats such as triangular sinusoidal or trapezoidal all the mfs have a prototype which is the point where the fuzzy set achieves maximum membership value corresponding to the point where the next fuzzy sets have a null membership value mv through the mfs each variable belongs to a maximum of two fuzzy sets whose sum of values always results in 1 lucchese et al 2021 the rule base is the most important aspect of a fis design since the interpretability and accuracy of the model heavily rely on it fuzzy rules are simple relations between fuzzy variables e g if x is low then y is high where low and high are labels of fuzzy sets and x and y are crisp values zadeh 1973 the rule base can be designed through expert driven approaches or data driven approaches among the data driven approaches many algorithms have been developed in the last decades from simple and non iterative methods which generate complete linguistic rules from data wang and mendel 1992 to methods based on computational intelligence such as adaptative network based fuzzy inference systems jang 1993 fuzzy wavelet networks ho et al 2001 and support vector machine fis jeng and lee 1999 although advanced data driven approaches for rule base designs tend to increase the accuracy of the model they make it more difficult to interpret the system chen et al 2018 the fuzzy inference mechanism refers to the fuzzy implication methods and the fuzzy composition operators after the fuzzification of crisp data rules are fired for each membership degree and the implication method is performed to evaluate the rules and produce output fuzzy values the implication of the fired rules are aggregated to finally obtain the fuzzy output then the fuzzy output is converted into a specific value this process is carried out by the defuzzification process through multiple options such as centroid of area or bisector of area matía et al 2011 fis are mainly characterized by two features that assess the quality of the obtained model zadeh 1973 i interpretability which refers to the ability of the fis model to express the behaviour of the system in an understandable way ii accuracy which refers to the ability of the fis model to faithfully represent the modelled phenomena with high precision interpretability and accuracy are contradictory issues and achieving both criteria with a high degree is a difficult task pancho et al 2013 however fis offer the possibility of trading these features until the desired trade off is achieved dutu et al 2018 although when concerning the applications within the hydrological sciences more priority has until now been given to the accuracy of the models to provide good numerical estimations we developed five fis models with different fuzzy sets ranging from three to seven fuzzy sets to obtain both precise and interpretable fis models we used the inference method proposed by mamdani 1977 due to its fuzzy output set which provides more interpretability the rule base was generated from data based on the approach presented by wang and mendel 1992 which consists of fuzzification assigning rules and assigning weights to the rules by multiplying the membership values of the variables that generated the rule after this process extra rules can be added by the expert however unlike the original method we kept rules that indicate the same inputs but different outputs to provide an interpolation for these cases and therefore an intermediate position between two conceptual responses instead of eliminating the conflicting rule with the least weight all of them are maintained but with their weights multiplied by the relative frequency of the number of records that contributed to each conflicting rule thus conflicting rules incorporate frequency and less frequent rules tend to have their values reduced after the generation of the fuzzy rules adaptive training lucchese et al 2021 teixeira et al 2020 was also used which consists of optimizing by trial the types of functions and the values of their prototypes to find the best fit to the outputs by searching the lowest quadratic error the possible modification of the membership functions was to triangular sigmoidal trapezoidal and exponential the values of the prototypes were tested in partitions of 1 20 spacing between the adjacent prototypes to maintain the physical meaning of the verbalization adopted for each fuzzy set the training procedures generation of rules and adaptive training were performed using the sample selected for training the validation sampling was used at the end of the adaptive training as a criterion for accepting the results to favour the model s generalization capacity 2 3 4 performance evaluation of the models the model s performances were evaluated through quantitative and qualitative approaches the quantitative performance was evaluated within the verification sample by calculating the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient ns the percent bias pbias and the mean absolute error mae the ns is one of the most used performance statistics in modelling which facilitates comparison with other works the ns represents the proportion of data variance that is explained by the model nash and sutcliffe 1970 the pbias measures the average tendency of the simulated data which may be larger or smaller than the observed tendencies the ideal pbias value is 0 positive values indicate model underestimation and negative values indicate model overestimation the mae is also widely used for predicting errors and corresponds to the mean absolute difference between observed and simulated values the lower its value is the better the model s performance to interpret the quantitative performance of the model via the ns and pbias the classification proposed by moriasi et al 2015 specifically for sediments was used in which the model is considered very good for ns 0 8 and pbias 10 good for 0 7 ns 0 8 and 10 pbias 15 satisfactory for 0 45 ns 0 7 and 15 pbias 20 and not satisfactory for ns 0 45 and pbias 20 the qualitative performance was evaluated based on the number of correct estimates in each previously defined output fuzzy set each data calculated and observed after fuzzification always belongs to two fuzzy sets whose sum of the mv is equal to one for the analysis of qualitative performance the output fuzzy set with the highest mv was considered subsequently the number of correct classifications and the proportion of correct estimates in each output fuzzy set were calculated through this analysis it is possible to know if the model correctly estimates the class to which the output variable belongs 2 3 5 feature importance analysis the relative importance of each input variable was calculated using the recursive feature elimination technique which consists of excluding one or more input variables from the model and evaluating the model s performance statistics without them from a complete fis model other models with the same architecture as the complete model were generated leaving one variable out at a time the performance statistics ns pbias and mae of the complete model and the models with eliminated features were normalized through the min max normalization wherethe minimum value corresponds to the performance statistics produced by the complete model and the maximum value corresponds to the values produced by the worst model lastly the normalized performance statistics were summed and weighted resulting in the factor of relative importance fri which corresponds to the percentage of the performance reduction of the model in relation to the complete model 2 3 6 mining fuzzy associative rules despite the inherent simplicity and interpretability of fis models an issue still remains regarding the interpretation of a large number of rules lucchese et al 2021 which generally occur in cases of managing high dimensional problems with a large number of input variables therefore we developed a technique to interpret a large set of fuzzy associative rules in high dimensional fis models the analysis and interpretation of fis rules were performed by three distinct approaches the first is the analysis of the frequencies of occurrence of each input fuzzy set in each output fuzzy set the point is to investigate how the inputs acting as independent variables relate to each observed result the second approach is the selection of some rules generated during the fis training according to an established criterion the criterion is based on the weights and occurrences of the rules although the weights of the rules indicate the most reliable rules they do not include the frequency with which each rule will be activated when submitted to a representative set of input output samples therefore a factor that simultaneously contemplates the weight and frequency of each rule is proposed to select the most important rule for each output fuzzy set finally the third approach is carried out by searching for rules similar to each other in order to identify the differences observed in both input and output sets the fuzzy rule mining was therefore performed through the following steps 1 frequency analysis of fuzzy sets 2 rule ranking based on a factor and 3 similarity analysis of fuzzy rules 1 by using the rules generated for a fis model the frequency distribution of each input fuzzy set was calculated for each output fuzzy set in this way it is possible to observe which classes of input variables are more frequent in certain types of alterations of ssc caused by small dams the frequency distribution was calculated by using all samples training validation and verification together since this step no longer involves model calibration but analysis of the behaviour of the data sample identified by the model 2 the number of times each rule has been activated hereafter called occurrences multiplied by its weight is a factor which produces a score for each rule generated previously in the model training the rules are ordered according to this score and then a number of rules for each output set are selected for analysis 3 the similarity number of coincident fuzzy sets to a chosen rule was used as a criterion for ordering the other rules whose most similar rules with up to one different variable are analysed if the output fuzzy set of the other rules is different it can be verified from the differences in the input fuzzy sets which of them caused the difference in the output set if the output set is the same it is possible to identify the differences within the input sets that do not change the output the similarity analysis was performed for some of the best rules of each output fuzzy set according to the factor score defined in 2 3 results and discussions 3 1 quantitative performance five fis models were generated with different numbers of fuzzy sets table 2 all selected input variables are included in the models the same partition of fuzzy sets is used for the input upstream ssc and the output alteration of ssc but not necessarily for other input variables the metrics of the models indicated that fis models can predict the alterations of ssc caused by small dams with very satisfactory performance when using input variables related to watershed characteristics dam characteristics and hydrological variations the fis 01 where the smallest partition of fuzzy sets was employed is considered good according to the classification of moriasi et al 2015 for sediment models 0 7 ns 0 8 the fis 02 03 04 and 05 are considered very good ns 0 8 and pbias 10 the more discretization for the fuzzy sets is employed the better the performance of the fis models in fig 6 the observed and calculated alterations of ssc from three of the most important models within the verification sample are shown the three main models can satisfactorily represent the alterations of ssc caused by the dams in the pantanal basins however the models with more partitions of the fuzzy sets better represent the extreme changes both in the retention and in the release of sediments 3 2 fuzzy sets and qualitative performance among the developed fis models with very good classifications fis 03 is the chosen model for further analysis and interpretation of the rules due to its smaller number of generated rules and smaller number of fuzzy sets in most input variables 3 fuzzy sets in fig 7 and fig 8 membership functions and prototype locations of the fis 03 are shown for most of the input variables the fuzzy sets used were low lo medium me and high hi for the upstream ssc the fuzzy sets used were extremely low el low lo low medium lm medium me high hi very high vh and extremely high eh for the alteration of ssc the fuzzy sets used were negative very high nvh negative high nh negative medium nm negative low nl null nu positive low pl and positive high ph the qualitative performance of fis 03 is shown in table 3 the total estimates the correct estimates and the proportion of correct estimates in each fuzzy set were calculated and compared with the observed occurrences it is possible to observe that the proportions of correct estimates are above 90 for most fuzzy sets for the nvh and nh sets the model can correctly estimate all occurrences the model tends to overestimate the nu set and on the other hand it tends to underestimate the occurrences of the nl and pl sets this happens because the prototypes of these three sets are numerically closer it is also observed that the model does not estimate most of the occurrences of the pl set indicating model difficulties to explain positive alterations downstream of dams part of the positive alterations probably occurs due to the erosion of the channel downstream of the dam which is a consequence of the environment trying to re establish the balance interrupted by the dam however there are no input variables in the model that represent this phenomenon regarding the frequency of occurrences in each fuzzy set most occurrences about 61 are classified as nu 30 of occurrences indicate some level of retention caused by dams ranging from nl to nvh and about 9 indicate higher ssc downstream of dams pl and ph although most of the occurrences indicate null alterations negative low alterations with are the second most frequent occurrences can cause significant loss of sediment and nutrients downstream over time and represent economic costs for the operation of these dams which will have problems related to silting furthermore our analyses investigated the individual alterations caused by the dams based on watershed characteristics dam characteristics and hydrological variations however many of these small dams form cascades in the same river which enhance their negative effect as shown by fantin cruz et al 2020 3 3 feature importance analysis the feature importance analysis fig 9 indicates that the upstream ssc is the most important input variable of the model with the highest fri detention time is also very important when these two variables are excluded from the complete model the performance in terms of ns pbias and mae decreases considerably reservoir area and volume are at the bottom of the list as the model doesn t lose as much performance when we remove those this happens because the detention time continues to indirectly explain the size of the dam however even if these variables are correlated models without one of them still lose performance and therefore we kept all the variables in the analysis in addition we also wanted to confirm the individual influence of the variables related to the size of the dam on the ssc alteration the exclusion of all other input variables causes some degree of performance reduction compared to the complete model indicating that the best estimate of ssc alterations caused by dams is made when using all the input variables selected in this study 3 4 frequency analysis the results of the frequency analysis are shown in fig 10 the extreme fuzzy sets of the output variable negative very high and positive high were disregarded because both are rare occurrences having only two observed pairs of data within the dataset therefore the frequency analysis is presented for the alterations of ssc classified as negative high negative medium negative low null and positive low the input variables related to dam characteristics fig 10 a b and c presented clear patterns along the fuzzy sets of the output both reservoir volume reservoir area and detention time have more frequencies in the hi and me fuzzy sets for negative high and negative medium alterations they also present higher frequency in the lo fuzzy set for null negative low and positive low alterations these results confirm that larger reservoirs with greater volume and area and longer detention times cause more alterations due to more reduction of the velocities in the water flux entering the reservoir conversely smaller dams whose classifications for reservoir area reservoir volume and detention time are lo are more frequent in null and low alterations however there are about 25 of dams classified as lo in the negative medium and negative high alterations indicating that smaller dams can also cause great ssc alterations in some cases for the variable watershed area fig 10 d it is noted that negative high and negative medium alterations are more frequent in larger drainage basins classified as hi but also occur with a smaller proportion in small basins lo sets watershed basins classified as me tend to alter less than watershed basins classified as hi watershed basins classified as lo do not show a clear pattern and may cause null low or high alterations in general dams located in larger catchments tend to alter ssc more this can be explained by the fact that larger dams which are more related to great negative alterations are usually located in larger basins regarding soil type fig 10 e f and g sandy soils and silty soils presented clear correlations with the alterations caused by dams no evident pattern was observed for clayey soils sandy soil and silty soil show opposite patterns the presence of sandy soils within the watershed of small dams is more related to null and low alterations in ssc while dams located in basins with more silty soils are more related to negative high and negative medium ssc alterations these results confirm that the types of sediment in the river system which depend on the watershed characteristics affect the reservoir sedimentation and the ssc downstream this opposite characteristic between sandy soils and silty soils might be related to the differences in the size of the particles silty soils are smaller and therefore easier transported in suspension on the other hand sandy soils are composed of bigger particles 0 2 mm and might move mostly near the streambed moving rolling and sliding in contact with the streambed cantalice et al 2015 vercruysse et al 2017 thereby basins with silty soil might have greater suspended material while sandy soil basins tend to have less suspended material in the water and more material being transported in the bedload for the land use variables fig 10 h i j and k it is possible to notice an opposite pattern between areas with natural land cover forest and grassland and anthropic uses agriculture and pasture most of the dams that cause negative high alterations have less percentage of forest and grassland within their basin 75 of the forest fuzzy sets are classified as lo and more percentage of pasture and agriculture 60 of the agriculture fuzzy sets are classified as hi forest and grassland present a similar pattern indicating that dams with high percentages of natural areas within their watershed tend to cause less effect on sediment transport oppositely agriculture and pasture occur more in drainage areas of dams which cause greater ssc alterations therefore this result confirms that the presence of vegetation cover protects the environment against dams and reduces the disruption of sediment transport caused by dams the vegetation canopy directly decreases the amount of rainfall reaching the ground and vegetation on the ground can weaken the gravitational energy of raindrops diffusing the runoff energy moreover the root system of plants can also reduce soil erosion by enhancing its porosity increasing the penetrability of precipitation and reducing runoff the root systems of plants interlace which may enhance the soil s anti erosion power yu et al 2006 conversely agricultural expansion is well recognized for its effects of increasing soil erosion in the brazilian cerrado where the study area of this research is located the agricultural expansion from 2000 to 2012 increased sediment production by 16 gomes et al 2019 regarding the input variables related to hydrological variations inflow fig 10 l did not present a clear pattern with the alterations caused by dams the effects of the studied dams whether null or pronounced are not related to the magnitude of the inflows lo and me inflows are frequent in all output classes with some unclear variations this result might indicate that the rivers studied in our research are similar with similar flow magnitudes and few measurements performed at high flows hi fuzzy sets therefore when inflows are analysed individually in relation to the changes in ssc caused by dams it does not show influence however sediment transport is a consequence of flows and ssc and therefore higher flows under the same ssc transport more sediments thus for dams with conventional storage where flows are regulated and often reduced even if the dam produces null changes in ssc sediment transport downstream is affected the ewma of past rainfalls fig 10 m appears to influence the alterations caused by dams the frequency of moderate rainfall me fuzzy sets increases in the fuzzy sets that represent greater ssc alterations null alterations are more related to lo classifications of ewma of rainfall which means little or no rainfall interestingly positive low alterations are more related to hi classes of ewma of rainfalls which represent heavier rainfalls although 25 of occurrences are classified as lo overall these results indicate that rainy periods provide an increase in the supply of sediments and are therefore related to alterations in ssc caused by dams precipitation and subsequent runoff are the main agents of soil erosion and sediment transport precipitation also influences the erosion of the riverbed and banks furthermore erosion hotspots such as gullies can form on fields during storm events causing an increased contribution of sediment from a specific source vercruysse et al 2017 herewith it is expected that rainy periods are related to greater retention of sediments in the reservoir since there is an increase in the sediment supply in the river during this period extreme rain events produce a larger input of sediments into the river as well as the resuspension of part of the bedload therefore causing positive alterations ultimately the upstream ssc fig 10 n was found to be the input variable most related to the variability of the alterations caused by dams when the ssc is high in the inflow entering the reservoir the dam tends to alter more the downstream ssc causing greater differences negative high alterations resulted from upstream ssc always classified as vh or hi on the other hand null and low alterations resulted from upstream ssc mostly classified as el and lo overall the higher the ssc entering the reservoir the bigger the retention caused by small dams 3 5 rule ranking the fis models developed in this research have an average of 243 rules fis 03 has 200 rules making it difficult to directly interpret all the rules in the rule generation method used in this research some rules have high weights but are rarely activated while others even if they have lower weights are widely used therefore the use of the proposed factor was justified as an alternative to combining both effects providing a score for all rules generated based on this factor the best 6 rules for each output fuzzy set are highlighted for fis 03 table 4 the rule number corresponds to the order of the rule in the complete rule base regarding the 200 rules of fis 03 rules 1 and 2 correspond to negative very high alterations rare occurrences therefore only two rules rules 3 to 13 belong to the negative high alterations rules 14 to 29 belong to the negative medium alterations rules 30 to 84 belong to the negative low alterations rules 85 to 168 belong to the class null rules 169 to 199 belong to the positive low and rule 200 refers to the positive high alterations also rare occurrences null alterations of ssc have more occurrences and weightier rules followed by negative low positive low negative medium and negative high the number of rules generated for each fuzzy output set is directly related to the number of occurrences in the dataset the best rules of the output fuzzy sets have similar patterns to those observed in the frequency analysis the upstream ssc is directly related to the output the higher the classification of upstream ssc the greater the alteration indicated by the rule hi classifications for watershed areas appear more in the negative high and negative medium rules and me and lo watershed areas appear more in negative low positive low and null alterations for the variables related to dam characteristics both reservoir area volume and detention time are classified as hi and me in the best rules related to negative high and negative medium alterations while lo classifications appear more in the rules of the negative low null and positive low alterations the dam characteristics were classified in the same input fuzzy set i e if the reservoir area is low the reservoir volume and detention time are also classified as low this correlation makes physical sense since smaller dams generally have reduced detention times also depending on the inflow entering the reservoir hi and me classes of vegetation cover appear more in the null and low alterations while low classes appear more in the alterations of greater magnitude in contrast hi and me classifications of agriculture and pasture appear more frequently in the alterations of greater magnitude for the soil type the main rules also indicate that silty soil is more related to negative high and negative medium alterations and sandy soils appear more in null and low alterations regarding ewma of rainfall hi classes are more present in the rules for positive low alterations me classes appear more in the negative high negative medium and negative low alterations null alterations have more ewma of rainfall classified as lo 3 6 similarity analysis some of the best rules for each output fuzzy set were selected for the similarity analysis rules 6 25 37 54 147 171 from the selected rule the ordering of other rules was done according to the similarity proximity the presentation of all ordered rules from the most similar to the most different is not practicable therefore similar rules with up to one different variable are presented table 5 this analysis allows the identification of the differences in the input fuzzy set that do or do not change the output fuzzy set for most of the analysed rules the upstream ssc is the main responsible for changing the output fuzzy set for rule 6 the upstream ssc is vh when this variable is classified as me rule 15 the level of alteration changes from negative high to negative medium equally when the upstream ssc is classified as lo rule 46 the alteration of ssc is negative low instead a similar pattern is found for the analysed rules 25 37 54 and 147 when the classification of upstream ssc changes within similar rules the output fuzzy set also changes in most cases in rules 5 and 67 the changes in the ewma of past rainfall do not change the class of the output variable however in rules 159 188 96 36 94 and 177 the change in the classification of the ewma of past rainfalls alters the classification of the output fuzzy set reduction of rainfalls also reduces the level of alteration on ssc caused by dams whereas hi classifications for this variable result in positive low alterations once again the presence of heavy rains hi appears to be related to positive alterations some rules have the same classifications for the input fuzzy sets but different output fuzzy sets this is the case of rules 4 and 16 65 and 142 38 and 97 54 and 160 and 96 and 36 this reflects the model s interpolation for a given occurrence two rules can be activated and the result will be an interpolation between them for the rules similar to rule 147 the increase of the silty soil in rule 70 was the factor which changed the null alteration to negative low furthermore even if most of the variables that cause changes of greater magnitude are classified as lo such as watershed area dam characteristics agriculture and ewma of past rainfall the occurrence of upstream ssc classified as very high rule 8 makes the output to be negative high overall all analyses indicated the upstream ssc as the most determinant variable for the alterations on ssc downstream the results also confirmed that larger dams and larger watershed basins are more related to great negative alterations among the watershed characteristics silty soils agriculture and pasture are more related to dams that cause greater ssc alterations vegetation cover and sandy soil are more related to less or null alterations the ewma of past rainfalls was also found to influence the alterations caused by dams more rains tend to cause more alterations by the dams heavy rains can cause sediment release from the dams through our fuzzy association rules analysis we provide an alternative solution for the interpretation of fis models with high dimensional issues i e a large number of input variables which leads to a large number of fuzzy rules the frequency analysis allows the identification of patterns within the input fuzzy sets that are more frequent in the output fuzzy sets through the rule ranking and the rule similarity analysis the most important and most used rules are highlighted and discussed providing new and important knowledge about the effect of small dams on sediment transport within the pantanal region a limitation of this research is the low availability of data minimum 10 and maximum 47 pairs of data per dam which leads to some uncertainties due to the lack of data in general the lack of long ssc time series is common in most parts of the world due to the costs involved in sampling this variable therefore we recommend that more data on ssc are sampled upstream and downstream of dams to reduce uncertainties in future studies 4 implications and recommendations for the pantanal wetland dams located in rivers that drain towards pantanal and that naturally present high ssc will tend to alter more the downstream ssc and therefore reduce the amount of ssc and the amount of nutrients that enter the wetland most of the rivers with the highest ssc are yet undammed including the vermelho coxim upper taquari miranda and aquidauana rivers therefore the construction of dams in these rivers would cause great reductions in sediment transport towards pantanal according to fantin cruz et al 2020 there are currently 26 shps proposed for the taquari subbasin including the coxim jauru and upper taquari rivers most forming cascades the taquari river transports about 1500 tons day of suspended sediments to the pantanal and presents the highest ssc average along the uprb considering the results of the fis models this basin could suffer major consequences if the proposed dams are implemented these dams would suffer high siltation processes and the downstream wetland will lose the high input of sediments that this subbasin naturally offers the cuiabá river also carries relatively high ssc about 750 tons day according to fantin cruz et al 2020 and it is considered one of the most important tributaries of pantanal due to its high flows 6 cascade shps are being considered for this river these facilities are relatively close to the beginning of the pantanal wetland and therefore would cause a high reduction in the ssc that enters the wetland through this subbasin rivers that already have dams near the entrance to the pantanal and which naturally have low ssc such as the correntes itiquira jauru mt juba and sepotuba rivers ponte de pedra itiquira jauru dams respectively are rivers that can be strategic for the implementation of new dams since these rivers are already dammed the future dams that are proposed upstream of the existing dams may cause less impact on sediment transport towards pantanal the inclusion of new dams upstream of existing dams can also be interesting for reducing silting in downstream dams furthermore our results showed that the vegetation cover is an important feature that protects the basins and consequently the reservoirs dams located in basins with greater protection offered by vegetation cover tend to cause less alteration in sediment transport therefore agriculture and pasture practices on the other hand offer more sediment input to the rivers therefore the use of sustainable land management practices in the basins that drain into the pantanal such as maintaining the natural vegetation cover and promoting more sustainable agriculture and pasture practices are essential for the preservation of the largest wetland in the world this research assessed the effects of small dams on sediment transport in a more general way we recommend the continuation of this research focusing on the current scenario of hydropower plants within the pantanal wetland identifying relevant characteristics of each tributary river and providing a more specific analysis for the entire region 5 conclusion this study presents an original application of mamdani fuzzy inference systems to research knowledge of the effect of small dams on sediment transport and provides understandings of how different variables related to watershed characteristics dam characteristics and hydrological variations can affect sedimentological responses of small hydroelectric facilities we provide new strategies to overcome the difficulty to interpret a large set of rules in high dimensional fis models by performing frequency analysis within the rules as well as filtering out the most important rules and comparing them to similar rules fis rules can be directly observed and therefore help us to catch patterns within the variables to understand the phenomena upstream ssc is the most determinant variable of the ssc alteration that can be caused by the dams higher concentrations of sediment entering the reservoir tend to cause more retention null alterations are closely related to low upstream ssc and positive alterations occur mostly during rainy periods the soil type within the drainage area of dams also influences the downstream ssc dams located in basins with more silty soil tend to alter more conversely dams located in basins with more sandy soil tend to cause less alterations on ssc vegetation cover also proved to be important in the effects caused by dams dams located in basins with greater vegetation cover tend to affect less sediment transport in comparison with dams located in basins with high percentages of agriculture and pasture this result reinforces the importance of vegetation cover in protecting lands against accelerated erosion and consequently protecting the environment from the effects that a dam can cause fis models also confirmed that the size of dams is directly proportional to their capacity to alter sediment transport the greater the volume area and detention time of the reservoir the more potential to alter the ssc the findings of this study may help to develop guidelines related to the implementation of future hydroelectric facilities in the pantanal basin rivers with higher risk factors for ssc alteration can be mapped helping environmental managers in decision making funding the

2001,small dams for power generation are increasingly being built around the world and the reported impact caused by these structures on sediment transport varies widely ranging from substantial to minimal or non existent alterations among different dams such variability is still poorly understood in this study we present an original application of fuzzy inference systems fis to extract knowledge concerning the effect of small dams on sediment transport providing understandings of how different variables related to watershed characteristics dam characteristics and hydrological variations can affect sedimentological responses of these structures numerous small dams have been built and many more are in development or proposed in rivers that drain into the pantanal a world renowned tropical wetland where we apply the methodology data on 23 hydropower facilities from the uplands of the pantanal region were used with a total of 535 records the models presented very good results ns equal to 0 92 for the most detailed fis model and provided a better understanding of the phenomenon through their explicit linguistic rules the upstream suspended sediment concentration ssc is the most determinant variable for the alteration caused by dams higher ssc entering the reservoir is related to higher sediment retention vegetation cover and soil type of the drainage area of dams also influence the alterations on ssc caused by these structures dams located in basins with greater vegetation cover tend to affect less sediment transport and dams located in basins with high percentages of agriculture and pasture tend to alter more fis models also confirmed that the size of dams is directly proportional to their capacity to alter sediment transport the methodologies developed for the interpretation of fuzzy rules proved to be useful for assessing how small dams affect sediment transport along river systems keywords suspended sediment concentration small dams fuzzy association rules data mining pantanal data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction dams are known for causing severe effects on hydrologic geomorphic and ecological systems brandt 2000 nilsson et al 2005 the barrier caused by dams disrupts the longitudinal connectivity of the river causing discontinuities in the flux of sediment and nutrients and blocking the upstream mobility of migratory fishes campos et al 2020 fantin cruz et al 2016 nilsson and svedmark 2002 concerning sediment transport the effects of large flow regulating dams are well documented dai and liu 2013 erskine 1985 wang et al 2018 wei et al 2021 however less attention has been given to the impact of smaller dams even though they are the most common type of dam being built around the world casserly et al 2021 fantin cruz et al 2020 magilligan et al 2021 especially in tropical rivers chong et al 2021 some studies suggest that even run of river and small storage capacity dams may affect the sediment transport and the channel morphology causing sedimentation upstream and in some cases erosion downstream of the dams baker et al 2011 couto and olden 2018 csiki and rhoads 2010 wildman and macbroom 2005 however they are commonly considered to be much less environmentally harmful than larger dams and therefore many countries established policies that promote small hydropower shp facilities with minimal environmental reviews couto and olden 2018 fantin cruz et al 2020 relatively few studies have investigated the effects of smaller dams on sediment transport casserly et al 2021 csiki and rhoads 2010 fantin cruz et al 2020 magilligan et al 2021 and the impact reported in these studies varies widely ranging from substantial baker et al 2011 casserly et al 2021 fantin cruz et al 2020 orr et al 2006 wildman and macbroom 2005 to minimal or non existent alterations among upstream and downstream of these structures ashley et al 2006 csiki and rhoads 2014 lindloff 2003 velinsky et al 2006 such variability is still poorly understood and depends on the watershed characteristics the sediment supply the rainfall patterns the characteristics of the dam and the capacity of river hydraulics to transport sediment over the dam csiki and rhoads 2010 in the upper paraguay river basin uprb specifically in the upland watersheds that drain into the pantanal floodplains the largest wetlands of the world there is a great environmental concern regarding the increase in shp facilities being built over the last few years in 2018 there were 47 hydropower facilities in operation mostly shp with an additional 138 projects under construction planned proposed or identified by the government as prospective sites oliveira et al 2020 in the last two years some studies have investigated the possible effects of these small dams on the pantanal tributaries including hydrological effects ely et al 2020 figueiredo et al 2021 jardim et al 2020 effects on sediment transport fantin cruz et al 2020 nutrient transport and water quality oliveira et al 2020 silva et al 2019 and fish and fisheries campos et al 2020 fantin cruz et al 2020 analysed the suspended and bedload sediment transport upstream and downstream of 29 current hydropower facilities in the uplands of the uprb the results indicated great variability among the analysed facilities including retention null alteration and release of sediment in some cases bedload sediment transport was a small component of total sediment transport representing less than 10 in most cases in addition a predictive model using artificial neural networks ann estimated the impact of 80 future shps on suspended sediment transport based on observations at current facilities the prediction indicated that the future shps would reduce the suspended sediment transport by 62 towards the pantanal wetland another important research related to sediment transport in the uprb is campos and pedrollo 2021 this study presented an ann based model to estimate suspended sediment transport in ungauged basins within the uprb by using qualitative variables that physically characterize the watersheds soil type land use drainage area and mean catchment slope and quantitative variables to represent temporal variability of the sediment transport turbidity discharge and previous rainfall this study highlighted the wide variation in the sediment transport among the watersheds of the uprb which is a consequence of its complex hydrological system and the great heterogeneity between the uplands and the floodplains of the pantanal this study provided information about the most important variables related to the variations of sediment transport in this region which can be useful for understanding the variations of the effects from different small dams ai models have been successfully applied to sediment transport estimations such as ann models atieh et al 2015 campos and pedrollo 2021 gholami et al 2018 jain 2001 jimeno sáez et al 2022 sari et al 2017 fuzzy rule based models buyukyildiz and kumcu 2017 kisi and shiri 2012 kumar et al 2019 shoaib et al 2018 sirabahenda et al 2017 teixeira et al 2020 and genetic programming aytek and kişi 2008 kisi et al 2012 yadav et al 2018 however these studies generally are focused on obtaining high and accurate performances for the estimations although the study of fantin cruz et al 2020 provided important information regarding the effects of current and future shps in the uprb a gap still remains concerning how different watershed characteristics dam characteristics and hydrological variations affect the sedimentological responses caused by the dams in order to overcome this gap an alternative way to assess these effects could be achieved by using data from the most important variables related to the sediment transport in this region as well as dam characteristics and applying artificial intelligence ai models focused on discovering knowledge or detecting patterns within data data mining so far studies applying ai models on data mining or discovering knowledge about sediment transport in rivers and the effects of small dams were not found in the present literature fuzzy inference systems fis are considered universal approximators meaning that they can be designed to approximate any continuous function with any chosen precision hornik et al 1989 wang 1992 these models can also be used as a tool for understanding data and their relationships the main advantage of fis models is their similarity to human reasoning kaya and alhajj 2003 providing human friendly representation through their linguistic variables and explicit fuzzy association rules lucchese et al 2021 the existence of explicit rules and linguistic descriptions provide interpretability to fis models and therefore provide a better understanding of the physical behaviour of the system guillaume 2001 lucchese et al 2021 pancho et al 2013 therefore the aim of our research is to use fis models for modelling the effects of current small hydroelectric facilities on suspended sediment transport within the uprb focusing mainly on their ability to discover knowledge and patterns within data for this we propose to experiment fis models focusing on capturing relationships through the fuzzy association rules regarding how different watershed characteristics dam characteristics and hydrological variations affect the sedimentological responses of these dams this objective requires the development of original methodologies for the interpretation of fuzzy rules 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and hydroelectric facilities this study was carried out on the rivers of watersheds that feed the pantanal wetland in the upper paraguay river basin uprb in the last decades this region has seen the number of hydroelectric facilities grow rapidly and currently has hundreds of projects being considered for the future fig 1 in brazil hydropower plants are classified as small when they have installed electrical generation capacities of less than 30 mw in the uprb 47 hydroelectric facilities are operating of which 40 are categorized as small hydropower plants shps installed capacity less than 30 mw and 7 as large hydropower facilities lhps installed capacity 30 mw more than half of the facilities are designed as run of river which generally have little storage and the rest are designed with conventional storage ana 2018 the uprb has two distinct regions with different topographic and hydrological characteristics the uplands and the pantanal floodplains the uplands altitudes ranging from 150 m to 1400 m are situated mainly in the north and east of the pantanal representing 59 of the basin area this region comprises deep soils and high slopes favouring rapid drainage and high sediment production the native vegetation is the cerrado a type of savannah but extensive areas were converted to agriculture or pasture currently 29 of the upland watershed area is being used for agriculture and 22 for pasture problems regarding water quality mostly involve diffuse pollution by soil erosion and agrochemicals from agriculture as well as local pollution by wastewater effluents usually in urban areas oliveira et al 2020 the pantanal floodplain comprises 41 of the basin area and presents altitudes below 150 m this region has complex hydraulic and hydrosedimentological dynamics due to the low flat and humid lands and the low riverbanks which make the drainage system unable to quickly transmit the water received from the uplands campos and pedrollo 2021 the pantanal is globally recognized as an important wetland ecosystem that contains unique aquatic habitats and landscapes with several endangered mammals and birds tomas et al 2019 the major economic activities within the pantanal are cattle ranching subsistence and recreational fishing and ecotourism fantin cruz et al 2020 according to the köppen geiger climate classification the climate of the uprb is tropical savanna with rainfall concentrated in the summer the annual average precipitation in the uprb ranges from 1200 to 1600 mm with the highest values occurring in the uplands about 80 of the annual rainfall occurs in the rainy season from october to april campos and pedrollo 2021 regarding evapotranspiration the uprb presents high values about 85 of the annual average precipitation ana 2018 2 2 data sources we selected 23 current hydropower facilities within the uplands of the uprb for this study based on availability of upstream and downstream ssc data the characteristics of the selected hydropower facilities are shown in table 1 from the selected facilities 18 are considered shps and 5 exceed 30 mw lhps however the large facilities selected have dams and reservoirs similar in size to the shps and one of the shps são lourenço 29 mw creates a reservoir comparable in size to the facility with the highest installed capacity ponte de pedra 176 mw therefore all the analysed facilities are considered small in this study which of 13 are run of river dams and 10 are conventional storage dams we used data on ssc and flow sampled upstream and downstream of the hydroelectric facilities most of the data used in this research were collected on 13 dates spanning the wet and dry seasons from october 2018 to may 2019 data from reports submitted by hydropower companies to the state environmental agencies were also included ranging from 2003 to 2019 the sample collection and analysis of ssc and discharge as well as the characteristics of current and future hydropower facilities were provided by the brazilian corporation for agricultural research embrapa and the federal university of mato grosso ufmt through a project funded by the brazilian national water agency and the eliseu alves foundation more detailed descriptions of the sample collection and analysis are found in fantin cruz et al 2020 overall the selected facilities have a minimum of 10 pairs of data which means data on ssc and flow upstream and downstream of the hydroelectric facilities measured on the same date but several have more pairs of data in total we used 535 pairs of data data regarding the facility characteristics reservoir area reservoir volume and detention time and data regarding the facility watersheds such as drainage area land use and land cover soil type and rainfall were also employed the land use and land cover in the uprb was based on the mapbioma project this project is a multi institutional initiative to annually map the coverage and use of land in brazil and monitor changes in the territory souza et al 2020 since most of the ssc data were collected between 2018 and 2019 the map was made using images from 2019 taken by the landsat 8 satellite with a spatial resolution of 30 m the soil types of the uprb were characterized by following the brazilian soil type map at a scale of 1 5 000 000 santos et al 2018 initially the brazilian soil map had 13 classes for the uprb all the previous classes were simplified into five classes water bodies sandy soil medium soil clayey soil and outcrop in fig 2 the final maps of the land use and cover and the soil type of the uprb are presented precipitation data was taken from the merge product which is a combination of observed rainfall data and satellite information made available to all of south america the merge data come from the brazilian national institute of space research cptec inpe the merge product uses rainfall data estimated by remote sensing to fill in rainfall information in locations with insufficient in situ monitoring daily and hourly data are available in grids of 10 km further details can be found in rozante et al 2010 the daily merge data were downloaded for the period january 2003 to july 2019 which encompasses the data period of the ssc and flow measurements then the precipitation data were extracted for the drainage area of the facilities 2 3 modelling and data mining a summary of the methodological framework used in this research is presented below fig 3 first we selected several variables that are directly and indirectly related to the sediment transport in the uprb and variables related to the characteristics of the hydroelectric facilities mamdani fuzzy inference systems were used to model the effects caused by small dams over the sediment transport and to provide information on the variability of these effects by taking advantage of the inherent interpretability of these models the knowledge discovery data mining was performed by an original methodology developed in this research to assess fuzzy associative rules all models and procedures were custom programmed in matlab r2012b which favours occasional improvements to the methods 2 3 1 input and output model variables the selection of input variables was based on previous studies of sediment transport and small dams within the uprb campos and pedrollo 2021 fantin cruz et al 2020 we selected several variables related to watershed characteristics dam characteristics and hydrological variations to represent the great variability of the sediments in the region aiming to research how the facilities in this region variably affect the sediment transport 535 pairs of data on ssc and flow upstream and downstream of the 23 studied facilities were used the output variable was the alteration of ssc given by the following equation 1 alteration of ssc downstream ssc upstream ssc where the values of ssc are given in mg l and the alteration of ssc can assume negative and positive values depending on retention or release of sediment variables related to the watershed characteristics of each dam comprise watershed area km2 land use cover only the forest grassland pasture and agriculture classes and soil type only the sandy soil silty soil and clayey soil classes the classes of urbanization water bodies and wetlands of land use cover and classes of outcrop and water bodies of the soil type were not included in the models wetlands and water bodies mostly occur in the floodplain and since the shps are in the uplands these classes are not relevant to the models outcrops and urbanization appear only in specific small parts of the basin and represent less than 0 01 of the area of the study region therefore they are also not relevant to the models the selected classes of soil type and land use cover were included as proportions of the basin area each class of soil type and land use cover was included in the models as an input variable regarding dam characteristics we used data on reservoir area km2 reservoir volume dam3 and detention time days the detention time was calculated by the following equation 2 detention t i m e days re s e r v o i r v o l u m e m 3 inflow m 3 s 86400 furthermore we used inflow m3 s exponentially weighted moving averages ewma of past rainfall mm and upstream ssc mg l as input variables these variables refer to the hydrological variations which can influence the sedimentological responses of the dams the ewma of past rainfall has been used in several studies involving data driven models and sediment transport campos and pedrollo 2021 oliveira et al 2017 teixeira et al 2020 and provides better estimates than those obtained using only rainfall data without this resource the ewma of past rainfall assigns greater weight to more recent precipitation in the composition of the moving average promoting a synthesis of recent precipitation information in the form of a representative value the ewma is applied to precipitation time series with constant intervals according to eqs 3 and 4 3 ewma t 1 ewma t 1 p t 4 1 0 5 1 h where pt is the precipitation at time t and h is the half life parameter given in days the ewma was applied to the precipitation data obtained from the merge product for the 23 watershed areas of the analysed shps we used ewma of rainfalls with the half life parameter h 1 which means that a resulting value of the ewma of rainfall gives 50 importance weight to the current day value and 50 to past days decreasing exponentially towards the past higher values of the half life parameter will give greater weight to past rains overall the ewma of past rainfall is a function that can represent single rainy days as well as long rainy periods the value of the half life parameter was chosen from a preliminary analysis of linear correlations between the time series of ewma of rainfalls and upstream ssc of the dams we tested different half life parameters and h 1 day showed the strongest linear correlation with the upstream ssc variable fig 4 presents a summary of the input variables selected to estimate the alteration of ssc the output variable among the hydroelectric facilities within the uprb the entire dataset is available in the supplementary files 2 3 2 partition data for the modelling stage data were divided into three samples training validation and verification the dataset was divided by selecting data from 2 4 of the facilities for the training 1 4 for the validation and 1 4 for the verification facilities with extreme values maximum and minimum were included in the training samples to provide spatial balance facilities from different sub catchments were included in both training validation and verification samples 2 3 3 fuzzy model design a fuzzy inference system is a qualitative modelling scheme in which the system behaviour is described by using natural language lohani et al 2007 mamdani fuzzy inference systems mamdani 1977 are the most comprehensible and interpretable fis due to their linguistic terms in the antecedent and in the consequent maintaining verbal formalization during their whole inference process casillas 2003 the mamdani fis are generally composed of the following components lucchese et al 2021 1 fuzzification of the input and output variables 2 a rule base or knowledge base 3 fuzzy inference mechanism and 4 defuzzification of the fuzzy output into a crisp number fig 5 the fuzzification process is performed through membership functions mfs which can be designed in different formats such as triangular sinusoidal or trapezoidal all the mfs have a prototype which is the point where the fuzzy set achieves maximum membership value corresponding to the point where the next fuzzy sets have a null membership value mv through the mfs each variable belongs to a maximum of two fuzzy sets whose sum of values always results in 1 lucchese et al 2021 the rule base is the most important aspect of a fis design since the interpretability and accuracy of the model heavily rely on it fuzzy rules are simple relations between fuzzy variables e g if x is low then y is high where low and high are labels of fuzzy sets and x and y are crisp values zadeh 1973 the rule base can be designed through expert driven approaches or data driven approaches among the data driven approaches many algorithms have been developed in the last decades from simple and non iterative methods which generate complete linguistic rules from data wang and mendel 1992 to methods based on computational intelligence such as adaptative network based fuzzy inference systems jang 1993 fuzzy wavelet networks ho et al 2001 and support vector machine fis jeng and lee 1999 although advanced data driven approaches for rule base designs tend to increase the accuracy of the model they make it more difficult to interpret the system chen et al 2018 the fuzzy inference mechanism refers to the fuzzy implication methods and the fuzzy composition operators after the fuzzification of crisp data rules are fired for each membership degree and the implication method is performed to evaluate the rules and produce output fuzzy values the implication of the fired rules are aggregated to finally obtain the fuzzy output then the fuzzy output is converted into a specific value this process is carried out by the defuzzification process through multiple options such as centroid of area or bisector of area matía et al 2011 fis are mainly characterized by two features that assess the quality of the obtained model zadeh 1973 i interpretability which refers to the ability of the fis model to express the behaviour of the system in an understandable way ii accuracy which refers to the ability of the fis model to faithfully represent the modelled phenomena with high precision interpretability and accuracy are contradictory issues and achieving both criteria with a high degree is a difficult task pancho et al 2013 however fis offer the possibility of trading these features until the desired trade off is achieved dutu et al 2018 although when concerning the applications within the hydrological sciences more priority has until now been given to the accuracy of the models to provide good numerical estimations we developed five fis models with different fuzzy sets ranging from three to seven fuzzy sets to obtain both precise and interpretable fis models we used the inference method proposed by mamdani 1977 due to its fuzzy output set which provides more interpretability the rule base was generated from data based on the approach presented by wang and mendel 1992 which consists of fuzzification assigning rules and assigning weights to the rules by multiplying the membership values of the variables that generated the rule after this process extra rules can be added by the expert however unlike the original method we kept rules that indicate the same inputs but different outputs to provide an interpolation for these cases and therefore an intermediate position between two conceptual responses instead of eliminating the conflicting rule with the least weight all of them are maintained but with their weights multiplied by the relative frequency of the number of records that contributed to each conflicting rule thus conflicting rules incorporate frequency and less frequent rules tend to have their values reduced after the generation of the fuzzy rules adaptive training lucchese et al 2021 teixeira et al 2020 was also used which consists of optimizing by trial the types of functions and the values of their prototypes to find the best fit to the outputs by searching the lowest quadratic error the possible modification of the membership functions was to triangular sigmoidal trapezoidal and exponential the values of the prototypes were tested in partitions of 1 20 spacing between the adjacent prototypes to maintain the physical meaning of the verbalization adopted for each fuzzy set the training procedures generation of rules and adaptive training were performed using the sample selected for training the validation sampling was used at the end of the adaptive training as a criterion for accepting the results to favour the model s generalization capacity 2 3 4 performance evaluation of the models the model s performances were evaluated through quantitative and qualitative approaches the quantitative performance was evaluated within the verification sample by calculating the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient ns the percent bias pbias and the mean absolute error mae the ns is one of the most used performance statistics in modelling which facilitates comparison with other works the ns represents the proportion of data variance that is explained by the model nash and sutcliffe 1970 the pbias measures the average tendency of the simulated data which may be larger or smaller than the observed tendencies the ideal pbias value is 0 positive values indicate model underestimation and negative values indicate model overestimation the mae is also widely used for predicting errors and corresponds to the mean absolute difference between observed and simulated values the lower its value is the better the model s performance to interpret the quantitative performance of the model via the ns and pbias the classification proposed by moriasi et al 2015 specifically for sediments was used in which the model is considered very good for ns 0 8 and pbias 10 good for 0 7 ns 0 8 and 10 pbias 15 satisfactory for 0 45 ns 0 7 and 15 pbias 20 and not satisfactory for ns 0 45 and pbias 20 the qualitative performance was evaluated based on the number of correct estimates in each previously defined output fuzzy set each data calculated and observed after fuzzification always belongs to two fuzzy sets whose sum of the mv is equal to one for the analysis of qualitative performance the output fuzzy set with the highest mv was considered subsequently the number of correct classifications and the proportion of correct estimates in each output fuzzy set were calculated through this analysis it is possible to know if the model correctly estimates the class to which the output variable belongs 2 3 5 feature importance analysis the relative importance of each input variable was calculated using the recursive feature elimination technique which consists of excluding one or more input variables from the model and evaluating the model s performance statistics without them from a complete fis model other models with the same architecture as the complete model were generated leaving one variable out at a time the performance statistics ns pbias and mae of the complete model and the models with eliminated features were normalized through the min max normalization wherethe minimum value corresponds to the performance statistics produced by the complete model and the maximum value corresponds to the values produced by the worst model lastly the normalized performance statistics were summed and weighted resulting in the factor of relative importance fri which corresponds to the percentage of the performance reduction of the model in relation to the complete model 2 3 6 mining fuzzy associative rules despite the inherent simplicity and interpretability of fis models an issue still remains regarding the interpretation of a large number of rules lucchese et al 2021 which generally occur in cases of managing high dimensional problems with a large number of input variables therefore we developed a technique to interpret a large set of fuzzy associative rules in high dimensional fis models the analysis and interpretation of fis rules were performed by three distinct approaches the first is the analysis of the frequencies of occurrence of each input fuzzy set in each output fuzzy set the point is to investigate how the inputs acting as independent variables relate to each observed result the second approach is the selection of some rules generated during the fis training according to an established criterion the criterion is based on the weights and occurrences of the rules although the weights of the rules indicate the most reliable rules they do not include the frequency with which each rule will be activated when submitted to a representative set of input output samples therefore a factor that simultaneously contemplates the weight and frequency of each rule is proposed to select the most important rule for each output fuzzy set finally the third approach is carried out by searching for rules similar to each other in order to identify the differences observed in both input and output sets the fuzzy rule mining was therefore performed through the following steps 1 frequency analysis of fuzzy sets 2 rule ranking based on a factor and 3 similarity analysis of fuzzy rules 1 by using the rules generated for a fis model the frequency distribution of each input fuzzy set was calculated for each output fuzzy set in this way it is possible to observe which classes of input variables are more frequent in certain types of alterations of ssc caused by small dams the frequency distribution was calculated by using all samples training validation and verification together since this step no longer involves model calibration but analysis of the behaviour of the data sample identified by the model 2 the number of times each rule has been activated hereafter called occurrences multiplied by its weight is a factor which produces a score for each rule generated previously in the model training the rules are ordered according to this score and then a number of rules for each output set are selected for analysis 3 the similarity number of coincident fuzzy sets to a chosen rule was used as a criterion for ordering the other rules whose most similar rules with up to one different variable are analysed if the output fuzzy set of the other rules is different it can be verified from the differences in the input fuzzy sets which of them caused the difference in the output set if the output set is the same it is possible to identify the differences within the input sets that do not change the output the similarity analysis was performed for some of the best rules of each output fuzzy set according to the factor score defined in 2 3 results and discussions 3 1 quantitative performance five fis models were generated with different numbers of fuzzy sets table 2 all selected input variables are included in the models the same partition of fuzzy sets is used for the input upstream ssc and the output alteration of ssc but not necessarily for other input variables the metrics of the models indicated that fis models can predict the alterations of ssc caused by small dams with very satisfactory performance when using input variables related to watershed characteristics dam characteristics and hydrological variations the fis 01 where the smallest partition of fuzzy sets was employed is considered good according to the classification of moriasi et al 2015 for sediment models 0 7 ns 0 8 the fis 02 03 04 and 05 are considered very good ns 0 8 and pbias 10 the more discretization for the fuzzy sets is employed the better the performance of the fis models in fig 6 the observed and calculated alterations of ssc from three of the most important models within the verification sample are shown the three main models can satisfactorily represent the alterations of ssc caused by the dams in the pantanal basins however the models with more partitions of the fuzzy sets better represent the extreme changes both in the retention and in the release of sediments 3 2 fuzzy sets and qualitative performance among the developed fis models with very good classifications fis 03 is the chosen model for further analysis and interpretation of the rules due to its smaller number of generated rules and smaller number of fuzzy sets in most input variables 3 fuzzy sets in fig 7 and fig 8 membership functions and prototype locations of the fis 03 are shown for most of the input variables the fuzzy sets used were low lo medium me and high hi for the upstream ssc the fuzzy sets used were extremely low el low lo low medium lm medium me high hi very high vh and extremely high eh for the alteration of ssc the fuzzy sets used were negative very high nvh negative high nh negative medium nm negative low nl null nu positive low pl and positive high ph the qualitative performance of fis 03 is shown in table 3 the total estimates the correct estimates and the proportion of correct estimates in each fuzzy set were calculated and compared with the observed occurrences it is possible to observe that the proportions of correct estimates are above 90 for most fuzzy sets for the nvh and nh sets the model can correctly estimate all occurrences the model tends to overestimate the nu set and on the other hand it tends to underestimate the occurrences of the nl and pl sets this happens because the prototypes of these three sets are numerically closer it is also observed that the model does not estimate most of the occurrences of the pl set indicating model difficulties to explain positive alterations downstream of dams part of the positive alterations probably occurs due to the erosion of the channel downstream of the dam which is a consequence of the environment trying to re establish the balance interrupted by the dam however there are no input variables in the model that represent this phenomenon regarding the frequency of occurrences in each fuzzy set most occurrences about 61 are classified as nu 30 of occurrences indicate some level of retention caused by dams ranging from nl to nvh and about 9 indicate higher ssc downstream of dams pl and ph although most of the occurrences indicate null alterations negative low alterations with are the second most frequent occurrences can cause significant loss of sediment and nutrients downstream over time and represent economic costs for the operation of these dams which will have problems related to silting furthermore our analyses investigated the individual alterations caused by the dams based on watershed characteristics dam characteristics and hydrological variations however many of these small dams form cascades in the same river which enhance their negative effect as shown by fantin cruz et al 2020 3 3 feature importance analysis the feature importance analysis fig 9 indicates that the upstream ssc is the most important input variable of the model with the highest fri detention time is also very important when these two variables are excluded from the complete model the performance in terms of ns pbias and mae decreases considerably reservoir area and volume are at the bottom of the list as the model doesn t lose as much performance when we remove those this happens because the detention time continues to indirectly explain the size of the dam however even if these variables are correlated models without one of them still lose performance and therefore we kept all the variables in the analysis in addition we also wanted to confirm the individual influence of the variables related to the size of the dam on the ssc alteration the exclusion of all other input variables causes some degree of performance reduction compared to the complete model indicating that the best estimate of ssc alterations caused by dams is made when using all the input variables selected in this study 3 4 frequency analysis the results of the frequency analysis are shown in fig 10 the extreme fuzzy sets of the output variable negative very high and positive high were disregarded because both are rare occurrences having only two observed pairs of data within the dataset therefore the frequency analysis is presented for the alterations of ssc classified as negative high negative medium negative low null and positive low the input variables related to dam characteristics fig 10 a b and c presented clear patterns along the fuzzy sets of the output both reservoir volume reservoir area and detention time have more frequencies in the hi and me fuzzy sets for negative high and negative medium alterations they also present higher frequency in the lo fuzzy set for null negative low and positive low alterations these results confirm that larger reservoirs with greater volume and area and longer detention times cause more alterations due to more reduction of the velocities in the water flux entering the reservoir conversely smaller dams whose classifications for reservoir area reservoir volume and detention time are lo are more frequent in null and low alterations however there are about 25 of dams classified as lo in the negative medium and negative high alterations indicating that smaller dams can also cause great ssc alterations in some cases for the variable watershed area fig 10 d it is noted that negative high and negative medium alterations are more frequent in larger drainage basins classified as hi but also occur with a smaller proportion in small basins lo sets watershed basins classified as me tend to alter less than watershed basins classified as hi watershed basins classified as lo do not show a clear pattern and may cause null low or high alterations in general dams located in larger catchments tend to alter ssc more this can be explained by the fact that larger dams which are more related to great negative alterations are usually located in larger basins regarding soil type fig 10 e f and g sandy soils and silty soils presented clear correlations with the alterations caused by dams no evident pattern was observed for clayey soils sandy soil and silty soil show opposite patterns the presence of sandy soils within the watershed of small dams is more related to null and low alterations in ssc while dams located in basins with more silty soils are more related to negative high and negative medium ssc alterations these results confirm that the types of sediment in the river system which depend on the watershed characteristics affect the reservoir sedimentation and the ssc downstream this opposite characteristic between sandy soils and silty soils might be related to the differences in the size of the particles silty soils are smaller and therefore easier transported in suspension on the other hand sandy soils are composed of bigger particles 0 2 mm and might move mostly near the streambed moving rolling and sliding in contact with the streambed cantalice et al 2015 vercruysse et al 2017 thereby basins with silty soil might have greater suspended material while sandy soil basins tend to have less suspended material in the water and more material being transported in the bedload for the land use variables fig 10 h i j and k it is possible to notice an opposite pattern between areas with natural land cover forest and grassland and anthropic uses agriculture and pasture most of the dams that cause negative high alterations have less percentage of forest and grassland within their basin 75 of the forest fuzzy sets are classified as lo and more percentage of pasture and agriculture 60 of the agriculture fuzzy sets are classified as hi forest and grassland present a similar pattern indicating that dams with high percentages of natural areas within their watershed tend to cause less effect on sediment transport oppositely agriculture and pasture occur more in drainage areas of dams which cause greater ssc alterations therefore this result confirms that the presence of vegetation cover protects the environment against dams and reduces the disruption of sediment transport caused by dams the vegetation canopy directly decreases the amount of rainfall reaching the ground and vegetation on the ground can weaken the gravitational energy of raindrops diffusing the runoff energy moreover the root system of plants can also reduce soil erosion by enhancing its porosity increasing the penetrability of precipitation and reducing runoff the root systems of plants interlace which may enhance the soil s anti erosion power yu et al 2006 conversely agricultural expansion is well recognized for its effects of increasing soil erosion in the brazilian cerrado where the study area of this research is located the agricultural expansion from 2000 to 2012 increased sediment production by 16 gomes et al 2019 regarding the input variables related to hydrological variations inflow fig 10 l did not present a clear pattern with the alterations caused by dams the effects of the studied dams whether null or pronounced are not related to the magnitude of the inflows lo and me inflows are frequent in all output classes with some unclear variations this result might indicate that the rivers studied in our research are similar with similar flow magnitudes and few measurements performed at high flows hi fuzzy sets therefore when inflows are analysed individually in relation to the changes in ssc caused by dams it does not show influence however sediment transport is a consequence of flows and ssc and therefore higher flows under the same ssc transport more sediments thus for dams with conventional storage where flows are regulated and often reduced even if the dam produces null changes in ssc sediment transport downstream is affected the ewma of past rainfalls fig 10 m appears to influence the alterations caused by dams the frequency of moderate rainfall me fuzzy sets increases in the fuzzy sets that represent greater ssc alterations null alterations are more related to lo classifications of ewma of rainfall which means little or no rainfall interestingly positive low alterations are more related to hi classes of ewma of rainfalls which represent heavier rainfalls although 25 of occurrences are classified as lo overall these results indicate that rainy periods provide an increase in the supply of sediments and are therefore related to alterations in ssc caused by dams precipitation and subsequent runoff are the main agents of soil erosion and sediment transport precipitation also influences the erosion of the riverbed and banks furthermore erosion hotspots such as gullies can form on fields during storm events causing an increased contribution of sediment from a specific source vercruysse et al 2017 herewith it is expected that rainy periods are related to greater retention of sediments in the reservoir since there is an increase in the sediment supply in the river during this period extreme rain events produce a larger input of sediments into the river as well as the resuspension of part of the bedload therefore causing positive alterations ultimately the upstream ssc fig 10 n was found to be the input variable most related to the variability of the alterations caused by dams when the ssc is high in the inflow entering the reservoir the dam tends to alter more the downstream ssc causing greater differences negative high alterations resulted from upstream ssc always classified as vh or hi on the other hand null and low alterations resulted from upstream ssc mostly classified as el and lo overall the higher the ssc entering the reservoir the bigger the retention caused by small dams 3 5 rule ranking the fis models developed in this research have an average of 243 rules fis 03 has 200 rules making it difficult to directly interpret all the rules in the rule generation method used in this research some rules have high weights but are rarely activated while others even if they have lower weights are widely used therefore the use of the proposed factor was justified as an alternative to combining both effects providing a score for all rules generated based on this factor the best 6 rules for each output fuzzy set are highlighted for fis 03 table 4 the rule number corresponds to the order of the rule in the complete rule base regarding the 200 rules of fis 03 rules 1 and 2 correspond to negative very high alterations rare occurrences therefore only two rules rules 3 to 13 belong to the negative high alterations rules 14 to 29 belong to the negative medium alterations rules 30 to 84 belong to the negative low alterations rules 85 to 168 belong to the class null rules 169 to 199 belong to the positive low and rule 200 refers to the positive high alterations also rare occurrences null alterations of ssc have more occurrences and weightier rules followed by negative low positive low negative medium and negative high the number of rules generated for each fuzzy output set is directly related to the number of occurrences in the dataset the best rules of the output fuzzy sets have similar patterns to those observed in the frequency analysis the upstream ssc is directly related to the output the higher the classification of upstream ssc the greater the alteration indicated by the rule hi classifications for watershed areas appear more in the negative high and negative medium rules and me and lo watershed areas appear more in negative low positive low and null alterations for the variables related to dam characteristics both reservoir area volume and detention time are classified as hi and me in the best rules related to negative high and negative medium alterations while lo classifications appear more in the rules of the negative low null and positive low alterations the dam characteristics were classified in the same input fuzzy set i e if the reservoir area is low the reservoir volume and detention time are also classified as low this correlation makes physical sense since smaller dams generally have reduced detention times also depending on the inflow entering the reservoir hi and me classes of vegetation cover appear more in the null and low alterations while low classes appear more in the alterations of greater magnitude in contrast hi and me classifications of agriculture and pasture appear more frequently in the alterations of greater magnitude for the soil type the main rules also indicate that silty soil is more related to negative high and negative medium alterations and sandy soils appear more in null and low alterations regarding ewma of rainfall hi classes are more present in the rules for positive low alterations me classes appear more in the negative high negative medium and negative low alterations null alterations have more ewma of rainfall classified as lo 3 6 similarity analysis some of the best rules for each output fuzzy set were selected for the similarity analysis rules 6 25 37 54 147 171 from the selected rule the ordering of other rules was done according to the similarity proximity the presentation of all ordered rules from the most similar to the most different is not practicable therefore similar rules with up to one different variable are presented table 5 this analysis allows the identification of the differences in the input fuzzy set that do or do not change the output fuzzy set for most of the analysed rules the upstream ssc is the main responsible for changing the output fuzzy set for rule 6 the upstream ssc is vh when this variable is classified as me rule 15 the level of alteration changes from negative high to negative medium equally when the upstream ssc is classified as lo rule 46 the alteration of ssc is negative low instead a similar pattern is found for the analysed rules 25 37 54 and 147 when the classification of upstream ssc changes within similar rules the output fuzzy set also changes in most cases in rules 5 and 67 the changes in the ewma of past rainfall do not change the class of the output variable however in rules 159 188 96 36 94 and 177 the change in the classification of the ewma of past rainfalls alters the classification of the output fuzzy set reduction of rainfalls also reduces the level of alteration on ssc caused by dams whereas hi classifications for this variable result in positive low alterations once again the presence of heavy rains hi appears to be related to positive alterations some rules have the same classifications for the input fuzzy sets but different output fuzzy sets this is the case of rules 4 and 16 65 and 142 38 and 97 54 and 160 and 96 and 36 this reflects the model s interpolation for a given occurrence two rules can be activated and the result will be an interpolation between them for the rules similar to rule 147 the increase of the silty soil in rule 70 was the factor which changed the null alteration to negative low furthermore even if most of the variables that cause changes of greater magnitude are classified as lo such as watershed area dam characteristics agriculture and ewma of past rainfall the occurrence of upstream ssc classified as very high rule 8 makes the output to be negative high overall all analyses indicated the upstream ssc as the most determinant variable for the alterations on ssc downstream the results also confirmed that larger dams and larger watershed basins are more related to great negative alterations among the watershed characteristics silty soils agriculture and pasture are more related to dams that cause greater ssc alterations vegetation cover and sandy soil are more related to less or null alterations the ewma of past rainfalls was also found to influence the alterations caused by dams more rains tend to cause more alterations by the dams heavy rains can cause sediment release from the dams through our fuzzy association rules analysis we provide an alternative solution for the interpretation of fis models with high dimensional issues i e a large number of input variables which leads to a large number of fuzzy rules the frequency analysis allows the identification of patterns within the input fuzzy sets that are more frequent in the output fuzzy sets through the rule ranking and the rule similarity analysis the most important and most used rules are highlighted and discussed providing new and important knowledge about the effect of small dams on sediment transport within the pantanal region a limitation of this research is the low availability of data minimum 10 and maximum 47 pairs of data per dam which leads to some uncertainties due to the lack of data in general the lack of long ssc time series is common in most parts of the world due to the costs involved in sampling this variable therefore we recommend that more data on ssc are sampled upstream and downstream of dams to reduce uncertainties in future studies 4 implications and recommendations for the pantanal wetland dams located in rivers that drain towards pantanal and that naturally present high ssc will tend to alter more the downstream ssc and therefore reduce the amount of ssc and the amount of nutrients that enter the wetland most of the rivers with the highest ssc are yet undammed including the vermelho coxim upper taquari miranda and aquidauana rivers therefore the construction of dams in these rivers would cause great reductions in sediment transport towards pantanal according to fantin cruz et al 2020 there are currently 26 shps proposed for the taquari subbasin including the coxim jauru and upper taquari rivers most forming cascades the taquari river transports about 1500 tons day of suspended sediments to the pantanal and presents the highest ssc average along the uprb considering the results of the fis models this basin could suffer major consequences if the proposed dams are implemented these dams would suffer high siltation processes and the downstream wetland will lose the high input of sediments that this subbasin naturally offers the cuiabá river also carries relatively high ssc about 750 tons day according to fantin cruz et al 2020 and it is considered one of the most important tributaries of pantanal due to its high flows 6 cascade shps are being considered for this river these facilities are relatively close to the beginning of the pantanal wetland and therefore would cause a high reduction in the ssc that enters the wetland through this subbasin rivers that already have dams near the entrance to the pantanal and which naturally have low ssc such as the correntes itiquira jauru mt juba and sepotuba rivers ponte de pedra itiquira jauru dams respectively are rivers that can be strategic for the implementation of new dams since these rivers are already dammed the future dams that are proposed upstream of the existing dams may cause less impact on sediment transport towards pantanal the inclusion of new dams upstream of existing dams can also be interesting for reducing silting in downstream dams furthermore our results showed that the vegetation cover is an important feature that protects the basins and consequently the reservoirs dams located in basins with greater protection offered by vegetation cover tend to cause less alteration in sediment transport therefore agriculture and pasture practices on the other hand offer more sediment input to the rivers therefore the use of sustainable land management practices in the basins that drain into the pantanal such as maintaining the natural vegetation cover and promoting more sustainable agriculture and pasture practices are essential for the preservation of the largest wetland in the world this research assessed the effects of small dams on sediment transport in a more general way we recommend the continuation of this research focusing on the current scenario of hydropower plants within the pantanal wetland identifying relevant characteristics of each tributary river and providing a more specific analysis for the entire region 5 conclusion this study presents an original application of mamdani fuzzy inference systems to research knowledge of the effect of small dams on sediment transport and provides understandings of how different variables related to watershed characteristics dam characteristics and hydrological variations can affect sedimentological responses of small hydroelectric facilities we provide new strategies to overcome the difficulty to interpret a large set of rules in high dimensional fis models by performing frequency analysis within the rules as well as filtering out the most important rules and comparing them to similar rules fis rules can be directly observed and therefore help us to catch patterns within the variables to understand the phenomena upstream ssc is the most determinant variable of the ssc alteration that can be caused by the dams higher concentrations of sediment entering the reservoir tend to cause more retention null alterations are closely related to low upstream ssc and positive alterations occur mostly during rainy periods the soil type within the drainage area of dams also influences the downstream ssc dams located in basins with more silty soil tend to alter more conversely dams located in basins with more sandy soil tend to cause less alterations on ssc vegetation cover also proved to be important in the effects caused by dams dams located in basins with greater vegetation cover tend to affect less sediment transport in comparison with dams located in basins with high percentages of agriculture and pasture this result reinforces the importance of vegetation cover in protecting lands against accelerated erosion and consequently protecting the environment from the effects that a dam can cause fis models also confirmed that the size of dams is directly proportional to their capacity to alter sediment transport the greater the volume area and detention time of the reservoir the more potential to alter the ssc the findings of this study may help to develop guidelines related to the implementation of future hydroelectric facilities in the pantanal basin rivers with higher risk factors for ssc alteration can be mapped helping environmental managers in decision making funding the

doc source is insufficient to support doc concentration keeping pace with the increasing discharge zarnetske et al 2018 a flat invariable doc concentration with discharge near zero slope b has also been observed and it is usually called chemostatic suggesting that a uniform distribution of solutes and changes in hydrological connections do not affect doc concentration moatar et al 2017 most previous studies have documented an increased doc concentration with discharge at the catchment scale including wetland dominated catchments with higher organic carbon content and coastal catchments with abundant precipitation and frequent extreme storms hinton et al 1997 ågren et al 2007 raymond and saiers 2010 zarnetske et al 2018 mu et al 2019 moreover hysteresis analysis of the c q relationship of selected storm events has also been routinely applied to diagnose catchment doc dynamics and to identify flow pathways evans and davies 1998 lloyd et al 2016a b vaughan et al 2018 vaughan et al 2019 wagner et al 2019 pohle et al 2021 the anticlockwise hysteresis of the c q plot of a storm event i e doc concentration on the rising limb is lower than doc concentration on the falling limb indicates doc export is attributed to delayed delivery of doc because saturated areas expand to the doc rich source area that were hydrologically isolated from the stream anticlockwise hysteresis suggests doc export is determined by hydrological transport processes strohmeier et al 2013 wagner et al 2019 wang et al 2019 in contrast a clockwise hysteresis pattern indicates that doc export is attributed to early flushing and depletion effects and the doc source limit the supply of doc to the stream hornberger et al 1994 pacific et al 2010 evans and davies 1998 provided a generic three component model to illustrating how doc concentration of groundwater cg soil water cso surface event water cse can produce various hysteresis patterns these components reflect an emphasis on the geographic source chanat et al 2002 dynamic source distribution is also responsible for hysteresis patterns saiers et al 2021 for example doc enriched riparian runoff on the rising limb and doc poor hillslope contributions on the falling limb of the hydrographs led to clockwise hysteresis pattern mcglynn and mcdonnell 2003 pohle et al 2021 combined the export regimes power law equations and hysteresis patterns to distinguish the c q relationship into nine types therefore export regime hysteresis patterns and doc source distribution should be considered synthetically for a better understanding of doc specific export characteristics previous field studies have shown that catchment doc export was transport limited or source limited or chemostatic based on low frequency observations moatar et al 2017 zarnetske et al 2018 in contrast to such data high temporal resolution of doc measurement provides the opportunity to investigate sub storm doc dynamics and characterize temporal variation of the relationships between discharge and doc concentration based on high frequency observation boix canadell et al 2019 reported that doc export regimes shift from chemostasis to transport limitation as alpine glacier shrinkage and wang et al 2019 observed three hysteresis patterns in a semi arid catchment whether shift from a transport limited regime to a source limited regime exists is very important for understanding doc export dynamics at the catchment scale such a shift might occur in regions with relatively abundant doc sources and frequent flash floods which are typically characterized as rapid response unpredictable short duration and extremely high flow failure to account for the possible shift in such regions can lead to significant overestimation of doc export at regional and global scales however long term doc monitoring e g at weekly or monthly timescales lacks the temporal resolution to identify the sub storm doc dynamics and the possible shift in doc export regimes in a typical flash flood headwater catchment hinton et al 1997 clark et al 2007 špitalar et al 2014 especially those experiencing extremely storms flash floods defined as rapid surface water response to rainfall from intense storm calianno et al 2013 are considered to be one of the important drivers of doc export from upland regions to streams looman et al 2016 abril and borges 2019 for a typical flash flood mountainous headwater catchment the riparian wetland lacks of organic matter accumulation and the upland doc source acts as a size limited reservoir therefore the shift in doc export regimes from transport limited to source limited may exist in a typical mountainous flash flood catchment during storm events demonstration of such a shift is very important for understanding the overall paradigms of doc export from land to streams and for correctly estimating the amount of doc export in order to demonstrate whether doc export can shift from transport limited to source limited regimes a field experiment was established in a typical mountainous forested catchment with frequent flash floods streamflow doc in this catchment was sampled at a high frequency approximately every 15 min during flooding periods and daily during inter storm periods to reveal doc dynamics the objective of this study was to answer two key questions 1 does a shift in doc export regimes from transport limited to source limited exist in a typical mountainous flash flood catchment 2 how significant is the relative contribution of storm events to doc yield in a typical flash flood catchment 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study was conducted in the huanggou catchment denoted as hgc that is part of the eco hydrological research experimental station of wuhan university located in danjiangkou hubei province china fig 1 hgc is within the headwater region of the danjiangkou reservoir 32 42 n 110 83 e that serves as the source of the middle route of the south north water transfer project this headwater catchment covers an area of 180 ha with an elevation from 308 to 818 m a s l the channel is narrow and the bedrock underlying the hgc is comprised of rock and coarse gravel the topography of hgc is characterized by steep slopes with an average slope gradient of 27 hgc has a subtropical monsoonal climate i e hot and humid summers cold and dry winters with an average annual temperature of 12 8 c the mean annual precipitation is about 935 mm of which approximately 25 falls as storm events in august resulting in a high frequency of flash floods e g 25 august 2010 4 august 2012 9 august 2015 20 august 2020 fig s1 wu et al 2021 hgc is almost entirely forested with the dominant tree species being quercus variabilis and pinus massoniana the soil layer in hgc is thin due to serious soil erosion by floods and is categorized as yellowish brown soil the majority of soil in hgc is an acidic dystrophic with stone throughout the profile and a high organic matter content in the surface soil layer 2 2 hydrometeorological observations discharge m3 s 1 was observed using a triangular profile weir for discharge 0 125 m3 s 1 and a triangular notch 90 v notch thin plate weir for small discharge 0 125 m3 s 1 installed at the outlet of hgc according to the common standards and specifications for weir flow measurements ministry of water resources 2011 the two weirs were 5 m apart along the stream and did not influence each other water depth was recorded every 1 min at each weir using a data logger attached to a pressure transducer and an ultrasonic transducer discharge was calculated by the calibrated rating curves between water depth and discharge for each weir precipitation mm and air temperature c were continuously observed and recorded at 30 min and 1 min intervals respectively flash flood is defined as a specific type of flood that occurs in a short time frame after a precipitation event we used a method for storm event identification in terms of rainfall intensity rather than precipitation according to long term observations in hgc 2009 2015 fig s1 moderate storm events were 10 mm h 1 and extreme storm events were 20 mm h 1 the start of a storm event was defined when an increase in water depth was observed immediately following rainfall input and the end of the event occurred when the water level was relatively stable 2 3 sampling of streamflow doc and soil organic carbon streamflow water samples were collected using a portable automatic sampler no 6712 isco deployed at the outlet of hgc a total of 713 streamflow water samples were collected during the flood season of 1 august to 31 october in 2020 the sampling interval varied with the rate of discharge high frequency sampling was carried out during the storm events and a nonuniform sampling mode was programmed to sample streamflow at intervals ranging from 15 min to 6 h samples of baseflow were performed about every two days all stream water samples were immediately filtered through a 0 45 μm pore size filter sterile membrane the filtered samples were stored in pre cleaned by acid and ultra pure water 250 ml high density polyethylene bottles and stored at 4 c in the dark until analyzed the doc samples were analyzed using an elementar vario select analyzer germany designed to employ a high temperature combustion technique doc was calculated as the difference between total dissolved carbon and dissolved inorganic carbon for each sample to ensure quality control each sample was measured by three parallel analyses and the coefficient of variation of repeated results was less than 10 soil organic carbon soc is a substrate for doc production sawicka et al 2016 the distribution of soc within the soil profile was investigated in hgc as well five soc sampling sites were selected along the hilltop hillside riparian gradient each of the soil profiles was divided into three soil layers litter layer upper soil horizon and lower soil horizon resulting in 15 soil samples being collected each time soc were determined using an elemental analyzer vario elementar germany 2 4 data analysis an exponential equation was employed as complement to divided the three phase relationship between doc concentration c and discharge q based on the observed data n 713 as follows 2 c m n e q k parameters m n and k were calibrated by maximizing the coefficient of determination r2 two additional criteria were also employed to assess the goodness of fit of the c q relationship including nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and root mean square error rmse power law equation was used to identify doc export regime of each phase the quickflow i e overland flow and interflow flow path through the doc rich soil layer had a notable effect on doc export during storm events to quantify the contribution of the different streamflow components to doc yield streamflow was separated into quickflow and baseflow using the lyne hollick method shown in fig s2 lyne and hollick 1979 cheng et al 2020 baseflow was separated from the total flow with three passes forward backward and forward and the filter parameter recession constant was set to 0 925 nathan and mcmahon 1990 cheng et al 2021 cheng et al 2022 doc yield during the study period was calculated as the summation of each

total number of observations 3 results 3 1 characteristics of study catchment five storm events were observed during the 2020 flood season fig 2 and table 1 including two extreme storm events e0817 e0820 and three moderate storm events e0808 e0922 and e1003 precipitation over the study period was 531 mm of which 86 455 mm fell as the storm events discharge dynamics exhibited three patterns fig s3 including a slow recession during inter storm periods a slow increase during moderate storm events and a rapid increase during extreme storm events for inter storm periods discharge dominated by baseflow ranged from 0 001 to 0 030 m3 s 1 moderate storm events had relatively small rainfall intensity hydrological connectivity slowly increased allowing more upland runoff to contribute to the stream discharge slowly increased and peak discharge in this pattern was less than 0 54 m3 s 1 for extreme storm events hydrological connectivity rapidly increased and the saturated upland stream continuum led to a steep increase in discharge rainfall intensity up to 47 mm h 1 occurred during the storm event of e0817 fig 2b the largest storm among the five storm events despite precipitation of only 24 7 mm the discharge of the e0817 increased from the pre event value of 0 003 up to 2 04 m3 s 1 within 25 min the largest amount of precipitation 141 7 mm was recorded for the e0820 and the peak rainfall intensity was 24 mm h 1 fig 2c the highest peak discharge 4 03 m3 s 1 over the study period was recorded during this event soc distribution in hgc was not uniform in the catchment and mainly exhibited two spatial gradients fig 3 one soc gradient was a gradual decrease from the hilltop to the riparian regions the other soc gradient was a strong decrease with soil depth 3 2 three phase doc concentration and discharge relationship the c q relationship is shown in fig 4 a including all observations n 713 from both storm periods and inter storm periods the exponential equation for the c q relationship was fitted against all of the observations the performance of the established relationship was quite good with r2 nse and rmse values of 0 91 0 91 and 0 81 mg l 1 respectively fig s4 most importantly the exponential equation adequately captures the physical reality of the three phase relationship between doc concentration and discharge in the typical flash flood catchment comparison of the performance between the exponential equation and the power law equation shown in the fig s4 the traditional power law equation also performed agreeably in term of statistical index but it failed to capture the shift of doc concentration over the whole range of discharge the c q relationship in fig 4a showed three distinct phases i e the slow increase phase p1 the rapid increase phase p2 and the flat phase p3 that corresponded to inter storm periods moderate storm events and extreme storm events respectively the separation values of the three c q phases were identified by combining the discharge dynamics and the proposed exponential c q relationship the separation value between p1 and p2 was the threshold value for the rise of storm runoff 0 03 m3 s 1 which is the dominant driver of doc export in the study catchment the discharge of 0 63 m3 s 1 was identified as the separation value between p2 and p3 because the fitted exponential c q relationship approached its maximum doc value when discharge was greater than this value in the study catchment more observations should be collected in the future to identify the separation values amongst different phases more rigorously for p1 slope b 0 1 doc concentration slowly increased with increasing discharge ranging from 3 0 to 6 8 mg l 1 for p2 slope b 0 25 the event based doc concentrations quickly increased with increasing discharge ranging from 4 2 to 14 0 mg l 1 for p3 slope b 0 02 doc reached peak concentrations and remained relatively stable as discharge increased from 0 63 to 4 03 m3 s 1 the transition from the increase phase p1 and p2 to the flat phase p3 suggested that the doc export shifted from transport limited during the inter storm period and the moderate storm events to source limited during the extreme storm events in hgc 3 3 hysteresis in event based doc concentration and discharge relationship the event based hysteresis analyses are shown in fig 4b e the e1003 storm event was excluded from the hysteresis analysis because of a malfunction of the automatic water sampler and missing observations during the rising stage of hydrological processes fig 2e both clockwise patterns and anticlockwise patterns were observed the anticlockwise patterns were observed during the moderate storm events of e0808 and e0922 fig 4b 4e for e0808 doc concentration was 8 7 mg l 1 at the peak discharge 0 26 m3 s 1 and then reached a peak value of 10 0 mg l 1 about 90 min later the clockwise patterns were observed during the extreme storm events of e0817 and e0820 fig 4c 4d for e0820 the clockwise pattern of this event was observed for discharge values greater than 1 2 m3 s 1 doc concentration increased with discharge and then remained relatively stable at a concentration of 14 5 mg l 1 the peak doc concentrations occurred approximately 165 min prior to peak discharge and doc concentration on the rising limb was higher than doc concentration on the falling limb observations of both anticlockwise and clockwise patterns indicated that the doc export regime shifted from transport limited during the moderate storm events to source limited during the extreme storm events in hgc 3 4 total doc yield in a flash flood catchment estimation of doc yield in hgc during the study period is shown in table 1 total doc yield was 14 24 kg c ha 1 of which 95 6 13 61 kg c ha 1 was exported during the storm events the highest doc yield was associated with the extreme storm event of e0820 that yielded 9 50 kg c ha 1 and accounted for 67 of the total doc yield the storm event of e1003 also yielded doc of about 1 89 kg c ha 1 13 quickflow was observed during the periods of storm events and accounted for 95 0 13 53 kg c ha 1 of the total doc yield the baseflow only accounted for a small proportion 5 0 71 kg c ha 1 of total doc yield during the study period storm event was the dominant driver of doc yield in hgc during the study period 4 discussion 4 1 doc concentration and discharge dynamics of the flat phase a three phase c q relationship was observed in hgc the flat phase and three phase doc export dynamics show in fig 4a have rarely been observed before for low frequency monitoring at the catchment scale the two increasing phases p1 and p2 were consistent with many previous studies that indicated doc export was transport limited yoon and raymond 2012 dhillon and inamdar 2013 zhu et al 2020 previous studies have described the flat phase as chemostatic suggesting a uniform distribution of solutes in the catchment and that hydrological connections do not affect solute concentration musolff et al 2015 moatar et al 2017 however in hgc the flat phase was not considered as chemostatic but rather source limited soc distribution in hgc was not uniform in the catchment and mainly exhibited two spatial gradients fig 3 thus the flat phase in hgc is not the same as the chemostatic regime with uniform solute distribution the flat phase during the highest flows in the hgc was considered as the transient stage from increase to decrease in doc concentration this transitions during extreme storm events can be explained by a doc export regime combined soil organic carbon gradients and catchment characteristics during extreme storm event runoff responds rapidly to rainfall due to the catchment characteristics of steep slope and narrow riparian zone rapidly established flow pathway provided a connection between the hilltop doc source area and steam the soc gradient indicated that the narrow riparian zone lacked organic accumulation and doc was primarily sourced from the size limited upland doc reservoir in the hgc under higher level of flushing the limited hillslope doc source was insufficient to support doc concentration keeping pace with increasing discharge during extreme storm events the supply of doc would have to be finite to produce the shift from increase phase to flat phase doc export did not experience long term source limited processes due to the short duration of the extremely high flow of flood water leading to doc concentrations showing no decrease with increasing discharge but rather a flat response thus the flat phase was the result of a slowly diminishing supply of available doc in the soil and considered as the source limited regime 4 2 doc dynamics of event based hysteresis patterns the doc concentration increased at beginning of each storm events and afterwards variation of the hysteresis loops depended on the intensity of storm events both anticlockwise and clockwise patterns of doc vs discharge were observed in hgc as shown in fig 4b e and these observations have rarely been reported based on low frequency observation before in a single catchment anticlockwise patterns were observed during the moderate storm events following the taxonomy of the c q loops provided by evans and davies 1998 this pattern can be classified as type a2 indicating a highly consistent component ranking of cso cse cg under these episodes soil water represented the larger contribution to stream doc storm events may increase the hydrological connectivity between the upland regions and streams the higher hydrological connectivity allowed doc rich upland soil water to contribute to streamflow along flow pathways on the falling limb of the c q plot pacific et al 2010 wang et al 2019 the clockwise patterns were observed during the extreme storm events following the taxonomy of the c q loops provided by evans and davies 1998 this pattern can be classified as type c2 indicating a highly consistent component ranking of cse cso cg under these episodes surface event water was the leading contributor to stream doc the rapid establishment of saturated flow connectivity across the upland stream continuum during the extreme storm events caused the doc pool to be diluted by the flood water due to the limited supply of doc source material doc concentration was higher at the beginning of storm runoff than on the falling limb for a given discharge mcglynn and mcdonnell 2003 pacific et al 2010 the hypothesis that the hysteresis form could be transformed from a2 to c2 proposed by evans and davies 1998 was observed in the typical flash flood catchment with increasing levels of flushing thus event based hysteresis analysis suggests that the extreme storm events shifted doc export from transport limited to source limited in the typical flash flood catchment 4 3 joint controls of hydrological pathways and doc source on the shift from transport limited to source limited regimes the three phase c q relationship of all observations and the two hysteresis patterns during storm events in hgc can be explained by the doc source and the degree of hydrological pathways and connectivity across the upland stream continuum that is influenced by the attributes of a typical flash flood catchment and rainfall intensity the typical flash flood catchment attributes of hgc were characterized as steep slope thin soil layers and poor soil water storage capacity all of these catchment attributes led to rapidly increasing the hydrological connectivity during storm events and contributed to the upland doc transport to the stream the shift in doc export regimes from transport limited to source limited is illustrated by the schematic diagram shown in fig 5 that represents the controls of hydrological processes and doc source on doc export in a typical flash flood catchment the three phase c q relationship corresponds to the three pattern discharge dynamic because the degree of hydrological connectivity determined the flow pathways of doc to the stream during the inter storm periods fig 5a the initial doc concentration was generally lower because of the baseflow path through the deep layer with lower doc concentration pacific et al 2010 and doc increased slowly with the increasing discharge during storm events cg was lower than cse and cso and the doc concentration of stream was consistently higher during the event than it is at baseflow thus the hysteresis loops was convex c2 or a2 in this typical flash flood catchment for the moderate storm events in fig 5b the water infiltration and the main flow pathway shifted from the lower mineral layer where doc is absorbed to the shallow organic layer where doc is produced clark et al 2007 the saturated area gradually extends from the riparian to the upland region and the groundwater table rises into the shallow doc rich soil layer leading to rapidly increased doc concentration in the stream runoff weiler and mcdonnell 2006 under these episodes surface event water generally generated by saturation excess overland flow and close to the stream with relative lower doc thus soil water was the main contributor to the stream doc associated with ranking of cso cse cg type a2 the increasing hydrological connectivity leads to upland doc rich soil water contributed to the stream on the falling limb of the c q plot for the extreme storm events fig 5c larger rainfall intensity resulted in rapidly increasing upland stream hydrological connectivity at the beginning of extreme storm events han et al 2020 doc rich surface event water and soil water contributed to the streamflow leading to doc concentration rapidly increasing with discharge during the highest flow period of extreme storm events the saturation excess area extended to the hilltop and the hydrological connectivity across the upland stream continuum was entirely established under these episodes the surface event flow with high doc concentration tended to dominate the stream doc it was thus generated hysteresis types c2 cse cso cg the highly connected flow pathways allowed the flood to flushing the doc pool flushing is likely to generate the peak stream doc concentration at the episode of the doc rich hilltop surface doc source contribute to the stream doc followed that the size limited upland doc pool was diluted and tend to exhaustion doc concentration failed to increase with discharge at the same pace as the moderate storm events thus the doc source limitation dominated doc export leading to the flat phase and the clockwise patterns in hgc during the highest flow period of extreme storm events 4 4 dominant role of the storm on doc export in a mountainous flash flood catchment doc source limitation significantly decreased doc concentrations during extreme storm events in hgc in previous studies doyle et al 2005 meybeck and moatar 2012 moatar et al 2017 power law equations were used to depict the c q relationship by fitting the power law equation to the individual storm event in hgc further analysis showed that power law equation can well capture the c q relationship and also performed agreeably in term of statistical index fig 6 but significantly overestimated the doc concentration compared with the exponential equation during the source limited stage of the extreme storm events fig 6b 6c comparing with exponential equation the power law equation overestimated the doc export of 9 3 and 9 4 during the source limited stage of the e0817 and e0820 event respectively overestimation may be much greater than estimated here as c q relationship shown in the fig 4a may drop quickly if discharge continues to increase which have not been observed during the study period but could happen in future thus if failure to consider the shift in doc export regimes from transport limited to source limited the doc concentration can be significantly overestimated at regional and global scales however this speculation is made from one typical catchment only more observations and studies should be carried out in the future storm events almost entirely determined the dynamics of doc concentration during the study period the observed doc concentrations ranging from 3 0 to 15 7 mg l 1 in hgc were similar to concentrations observed in most temperate forest catchments but lower than in wetland dominated catchments with higher carbon content and higher than in forest catchments with large amounts of precipitation table s1 the storm associated doc yield in hgc was quite large and even exceeded the hurricane associated doc yield in a coastal forest catchment at the same latitude for example the extreme storm event of e0820 contributed doc yield of 9 50 kg c ha 1 and this yield was more than the doc yield 3 3 kg c ha 1 observed from hurricane irene in the chesapeake bay usa in 2011 dhillon and inamdar 2013 a larger proportion 95 0 of the doc yield through quickflow was observed proving that overland flow and interflow cause the doc rich zone to contribute to the streamflow in a typical flash flood catchment during storm events 5 conclusions a large number of studies have previously examined doc dynamics especially at wetland dominated catchments or catchments with abundant precipitation and or frequent storm events but few of these studies have examined doc export in typical flash flood catchments or explored doc export mechanisms during extremely high flow using high frequency sampling consistent with previous research studies this study observed the increasing c q relationship during inter storm periods and moderate storms indicating that doc export was transport limited more importantly this study found that extreme storm events lowered the increasing c q relationship during moderate storm events to a flat response and shifted the anticlockwise hysteresis pattern to clockwise these new findings indicate that extreme storm events can shift doc export regime from transport limited to source limited this has rarely if ever been reported before due to a lack of high frequency data during extreme storm events further analysis showed that doc yield in this typical flash flood catchment was almost exclusively driven by storm events thus global carbon models need to incorporate the shift in doc export regimes defined in this study

2002,dissolved organic carbon doc export regimes are co determined by doc source supply and hydrological transport field studies have indicated that catchment doc export is a single regime source or transport limited or chemostatic if a shift between doc export regimes exists as has been rarely reported before based on low frequency observation then conceptual paradigms regarding lateral carbon export need to be revised doc dynamics of a flash flood catchment were investigated in this study with high frequency observations during flood seasons a three phase doc concentration and discharge relationship n 713 was observed i e slow increase rapid increase and flat phases that occurred during the inter storm moderate storm and extreme storm periods respectively further hysteresis analysis showed that the anticlockwise pattern observed during moderate storms shifted to a clockwise pattern during extreme storms these transitions suggest that extreme storm events shifted doc export from transport limited to source limited failure to consider such a shift can cause significant overestimation of doc yield in flash flood catchments where doc yield is largely driven by storms keywords

been widely recognized schindler 1999 battin et al 2009 however the regimes underlying doc export remain unclear because the controls associated with carbon source variations and hydrological transport processes are complex chorover et al 2017 zhang et al 2022 therefore exploring the carbon source and hydrological processes controlling doc delivery from terrestrial ecosystems to aquatic systems is critical to advancing the understanding of the carbon budget doc export from terrestrial uplands to streams is primarily sourced from doc reservoirs in riparian wetlands that are always connected with streamflow and in upland unsaturated root zone areas that are only temporally and hydrologically connected with streamflow during storm events brooks et al 1999 leith et al 2015 thus

three component model to illustrating how doc concentration of groundwater cg soil water cso surface event water cse can produce various hysteresis patterns these components reflect an emphasis on the geographic source chanat et al 2002 dynamic source distribution is also responsible for hysteresis patterns saiers et al 2021 for example doc enriched riparian runoff on the rising limb and doc poor hillslope contributions on the falling limb of the hydrographs led to clockwise hysteresis pattern mcglynn and mcdonnell 2003 pohle et al 2021 combined the export regimes power law equations and hysteresis patterns to distinguish the c q relationship into nine types therefore export regime hysteresis patterns and doc source distribution should be considered synthetically for a better understanding of doc specific export characteristics previous field studies have shown that catchment doc export was transport limited or source limited or chemostatic based on low frequency observations moatar et al 2017 zarnetske et al 2018 in contrast to such data high temporal resolution of doc measurement provides the opportunity to investigate sub storm doc dynamics and characterize temporal variation of the relationships between discharge and doc concentration based on high frequency observation boix canadell et al 2019 reported that doc export regimes shift from chemostasis to transport limitation as alpine glacier shrinkage and wang et al 2019 observed three hysteresis patterns in a semi arid catchment whether shift from a transport limited regime to a source limited regime exists is very important for understanding doc export dynamics at the catchment scale such a shift might occur in regions with relatively abundant doc sources and frequent flash floods which are typically characterized as rapid response unpredictable short duration and extremely high flow failure to account for the possible shift in such regions can lead to significant overestimation of doc export at regional and global scales however long term doc monitoring e g at weekly or monthly timescales lacks the temporal resolution to identify the sub storm doc dynamics and the possible shift in doc export regimes in a typical flash flood headwater catchment hinton et al 1997 clark et al 2007 špitalar et al 2014 especially those experiencing extremely storms flash floods defined as rapid surface water response to rainfall from intense storm calianno et al 2013 are considered to be one of the important drivers of doc export from upland regions to streams looman et al 2016 abril and borges 2019 for a typical flash flood mountainous headwater catchment the riparian wetland lacks of organic matter accumulation and the upland doc source acts as a size limited reservoir therefore the shift in doc export regimes from transport limited to source limited may exist in a typical mountainous flash flood catchment during storm events demonstration of such a shift is very important for understanding the overall paradigms of doc export from land to streams and for correctly estimating the amount of doc export in order to demonstrate whether doc export can shift from transport limited to source limited regimes a field experiment was established in a typical mountainous forested catchment with frequent flash floods streamflow doc in this catchment was sampled at a high frequency approximately every 15 min during flooding periods and daily during inter storm periods to reveal doc dynamics the objective of this study was to answer two key questions 1 does a shift in doc export regimes from transport limited to source limited exist in a typical mountainous flash flood catchment 2 how significant is the relative contribution of storm events to doc yield in a typical flash flood catchment 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study was conducted in the huanggou catchment denoted as hgc that is part of the eco hydrological research experimental station of wuhan university located in danjiangkou hubei province china fig 1 hgc is within the headwater region of the danjiangkou reservoir 32 42 n 110 83 e that serves as the source of the middle route of the south north water transfer project this headwater catchment covers an area of 180 ha with an elevation from 308 to 818 m a s l the channel is narrow and the bedrock underlying the hgc is comprised of rock and coarse gravel the topography of hgc is characterized by steep slopes with an average slope gradient of 27 hgc has a subtropical monsoonal climate i e hot and humid summers cold and dry winters with an average annual temperature of 12 8 c the mean annual precipitation is about 935 mm of which approximately 25 falls as storm events in august resulting in a high frequency of flash floods e g 25 august 2010 4 august 2012 9 august 2015 20 august 2020 fig s1 wu et al 2021 hgc is almost entirely forested with the dominant tree species being quercus variabilis and pinus massoniana the soil layer in hgc is thin due to serious soil erosion by floods and is categorized as yellowish brown soil the majority of soil in hgc is an acidic dystrophic with stone throughout the profile and a high organic matter content in the surface soil layer 2 2 hydrometeorological observations discharge m3 s 1 was observed using a triangular profile weir for discharge 0 125 m3 s 1 and a triangular notch 90 v notch thin plate weir for small discharge 0 125 m3 s 1 installed at the outlet of hgc according to the common standards and specifications for weir flow measurements ministry of water resources 2011 the two weirs were 5 m apart along the stream and did not influence each other water depth was recorded every 1 min at each weir using a data logger attached to a pressure transducer and an ultrasonic transducer discharge was calculated by the calibrated rating curves between water depth and discharge for each weir precipitation mm and air temperature c were continuously observed and recorded at 30 min and 1 min intervals respectively flash flood is defined as a specific type of flood that occurs in a short time frame after a precipitation event we used a method for storm event identification in terms of rainfall intensity rather than precipitation according to long term observations in hgc 2009 2015 fig s1 moderate storm events were 10 mm h 1 and extreme storm events were 20 mm h 1 the start of a storm event was defined when an increase in water depth was observed immediately following rainfall input and the end of the event occurred when the water level was relatively stable 2 3 sampling of streamflow doc and soil organic carbon streamflow water samples were collected using a portable automatic sampler no 6712 isco deployed at the outlet of hgc a total of 713 streamflow water samples were collected during the flood season of 1 august to 31 october in 2020 the sampling interval varied with the rate of discharge high frequency sampling was carried out during the storm events and a nonuniform sampling mode was programmed to sample streamflow at intervals ranging from 15 min to 6 h samples of baseflow were performed about every two days all stream water samples were immediately filtered through a 0 45 μm pore size filter sterile membrane the filtered samples were stored in pre cleaned by acid and ultra pure water 250 ml high density polyethylene bottles and stored at 4 c in the dark until analyzed the doc samples were analyzed using an elementar vario select analyzer germany designed to employ a high temperature combustion technique doc was calculated as the difference between total dissolved carbon and dissolved inorganic carbon for each sample to ensure quality control each sample was measured by three parallel analyses and the coefficient of variation of repeated results was less than 10 soil organic carbon soc is a substrate for doc production sawicka et al 2016 the distribution of soc within the soil profile was investigated in hgc as well five soc sampling sites were selected along the hilltop hillside riparian gradient each of the soil profiles was divided into three soil layers litter layer upper soil horizon and lower soil horizon resulting in 15 soil samples being collected each time soc were determined using an elemental analyzer vario elementar germany 2 4 data analysis an exponential equation was employed as complement to divided the three phase relationship between doc concentration c and discharge q based on the observed data n 713 as follows 2 c m n e q k parameters m n and k were calibrated by maximizing the coefficient of determination r2 two additional criteria were also employed to assess the goodness of fit of the c q relationship including nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and root mean square error rmse power law equation was used to identify doc export regime of each phase the quickflow i e overland flow and interflow flow path through the doc rich soil layer had a notable effect on doc export during storm events to quantify the contribution of the different streamflow components to doc yield streamflow was separated into quickflow and baseflow using the lyne hollick method shown in fig s2 lyne and hollick 1979 cheng et al 2020 baseflow was separated from the total flow with three passes forward backward and forward and the filter parameter recession constant was set to 0 925 nathan and mcmahon 1990 cheng et al 2021 cheng et al 2022 doc yield during the study period was calculated as the summation of each

total number of observations 3 results 3 1 characteristics of study catchment five storm events were observed during the 2020 flood season fig 2 and table 1 including two extreme storm events e0817 e0820 and three moderate storm events e0808 e0922 and e1003 precipitation over the study period was 531 mm of which 86 455 mm fell as the storm events discharge dynamics exhibited three patterns fig s3 including a slow recession during inter storm periods a slow increase during moderate storm events and a rapid increase during extreme storm events for inter storm periods discharge dominated by baseflow ranged from 0 001 to 0 030 m3 s 1 moderate storm events had relatively small rainfall intensity hydrological connectivity slowly increased allowing more upland runoff to contribute to the stream discharge slowly increased and peak discharge in this pattern was less than 0 54 m3 s 1 for extreme storm events hydrological connectivity rapidly increased and the saturated upland stream continuum led to a steep increase in discharge rainfall intensity up to 47 mm h 1 occurred during the storm event of e0817 fig 2b the largest storm among the five storm events despite precipitation of only 24 7 mm the discharge of the e0817 increased from the pre event value of 0 003 up to 2 04 m3 s 1 within 25 min the largest amount of precipitation 141 7 mm was recorded for the e0820 and the peak rainfall intensity was 24 mm h 1 fig 2c the highest peak discharge 4 03 m3 s 1 over the study period was recorded during this event soc distribution in hgc was not uniform in the catchment and mainly exhibited two spatial gradients fig 3 one soc gradient was a gradual decrease from the hilltop to the riparian regions the other soc gradient was a strong decrease with soil depth 3 2 three phase doc concentration and discharge relationship the c q relationship is shown in fig 4 a including all observations n 713 from both storm periods and inter storm periods the exponential equation for the c q relationship was fitted against all of the observations the performance of the established relationship was quite good with r2 nse and rmse values of 0 91 0 91 and 0 81 mg l 1 respectively fig s4 most importantly the exponential equation adequately captures the physical reality of the three phase relationship between doc concentration and discharge in the typical flash flood catchment comparison of the performance between the exponential equation and the power law equation shown in the fig s4 the traditional power law equation also performed agreeably in term of statistical index but it failed to capture the shift of doc concentration over the whole range of discharge the c q relationship in fig 4a showed three distinct phases i e the slow increase phase p1 the rapid increase phase p2 and the flat phase p3 that corresponded to inter storm periods moderate storm events and extreme storm events respectively the separation values of the three c q phases were identified by combining the discharge dynamics and the proposed exponential c q relationship the separation value between p1 and p2 was the threshold value for the rise of storm runoff 0 03 m3 s 1 which is the dominant driver of doc export in the study catchment the discharge of 0 63 m3 s 1 was identified as the separation value between p2 and p3 because the fitted exponential c q relationship approached its maximum doc value when discharge was greater than this value in the study catchment more observations should be collected in the future to identify the separation values amongst different phases more rigorously for p1 slope b 0 1 doc concentration slowly increased with increasing discharge ranging from 3 0 to 6 8 mg l 1 for p2 slope b 0 25 the event based doc concentrations quickly increased with increasing discharge ranging from 4 2 to 14 0 mg l 1 for p3 slope b 0 02 doc reached peak concentrations and remained relatively stable as discharge increased from 0 63 to 4 03 m3 s 1 the transition from the increase phase p1 and p2 to the flat phase p3 suggested that the doc export shifted from transport limited during the inter storm period and the moderate storm events to source limited during the extreme storm events in hgc 3 3 hysteresis in event based doc concentration and discharge relationship the event based hysteresis analyses are shown in fig 4b e the e1003 storm event was excluded from the hysteresis analysis because of a malfunction of the automatic water sampler and missing observations during the rising stage of hydrological processes fig 2e both clockwise patterns and anticlockwise patterns were observed the anticlockwise patterns were observed during the moderate storm events of e0808 and e0922 fig 4b 4e for e0808 doc concentration was 8 7 mg l 1 at the peak discharge 0 26 m3 s 1 and then reached a peak value of 10 0 mg l 1 about 90 min later the clockwise patterns were observed during the extreme storm events of e0817 and e0820 fig 4c 4d for e0820 the clockwise pattern of this event was observed for discharge values greater than 1 2 m3 s 1 doc concentration increased with discharge and then remained relatively stable at a concentration of 14 5 mg l 1 the peak doc concentrations occurred approximately 165 min prior to peak discharge and doc concentration on the rising limb was higher than doc concentration on the falling limb observations of both anticlockwise and clockwise patterns indicated that the doc export regime shifted from transport limited during the moderate storm events to source limited during the extreme storm events in hgc 3 4 total doc yield in a flash flood catchment estimation of doc yield in hgc during the study period is shown in table 1 total doc yield was 14 24 kg c ha 1 of which 95 6 13 61 kg c ha 1 was exported during the storm events the highest doc yield was associated with the extreme storm event of e0820 that yielded 9 50 kg c ha 1 and accounted for 67 of the total doc yield the storm event of e1003 also yielded doc of about 1 89 kg c ha 1 13 quickflow was observed during the periods of storm events and accounted for 95 0 13 53 kg c ha 1 of the total doc yield the baseflow only accounted for a small proportion 5 0 71 kg c ha 1 of total doc yield during the study period storm event was the dominant driver of doc yield in hgc during the study period 4 discussion 4 1 doc concentration and discharge dynamics of the flat phase a three phase c q relationship was observed in hgc the flat phase and three phase doc export dynamics show in fig 4a have rarely been observed before for low frequency monitoring at the catchment scale the two increasing phases p1 and p2 were consistent with many previous studies that indicated doc export was transport limited yoon and raymond 2012 dhillon and inamdar 2013 zhu et al 2020 previous studies have described the flat phase as chemostatic suggesting a uniform distribution of solutes in the catchment and that hydrological connections do not affect solute concentration musolff et al 2015 moatar et al 2017 however in hgc the flat phase was not considered as chemostatic but rather source limited soc distribution in hgc was not uniform in the catchment and mainly exhibited two spatial gradients fig 3 thus the flat phase in hgc is not the same as the chemostatic regime with uniform solute distribution the flat phase during the highest flows in the hgc was considered as the transient stage from increase to decrease in doc concentration this transitions during extreme storm events can be explained by a doc export regime combined soil organic carbon gradients and catchment characteristics during extreme storm event runoff responds rapidly to rainfall due to the catchment characteristics of steep slope and narrow riparian zone rapidly established flow pathway provided a connection between the hilltop doc source area and steam the soc gradient indicated that the narrow riparian zone lacked organic accumulation and doc was primarily sourced from the size limited upland doc reservoir in the hgc under higher level of flushing the limited hillslope doc source was insufficient to support doc concentration keeping pace with increasing discharge during extreme storm events the supply of doc would have to be finite to produce the shift from increase phase to flat phase doc export did not experience long term source limited processes due to the short duration of the extremely high flow of flood water leading to doc concentrations showing no decrease with increasing discharge but rather a flat response thus the flat phase was the result of a slowly diminishing supply of available doc in the soil and considered as the source limited regime 4 2 doc dynamics of event based hysteresis patterns the doc concentration increased at beginning of each storm events and afterwards variation of the hysteresis loops depended on the intensity of storm events both anticlockwise and clockwise patterns of doc vs discharge were observed in hgc as shown in fig 4b e and these observations have rarely been reported based on low frequency observation before in a single catchment anticlockwise patterns were observed during the moderate storm events following the taxonomy of the c q loops provided by evans and davies 1998 this pattern can be classified as type a2 indicating a highly consistent component ranking of cso cse cg under these episodes soil water represented the larger contribution to stream doc storm events may increase the hydrological connectivity between the upland regions and streams the higher hydrological connectivity allowed doc rich upland soil water to contribute to streamflow along flow pathways on the falling limb of the c q plot pacific et al 2010 wang et al 2019 the clockwise patterns were observed during the extreme storm events following the taxonomy of the c q loops provided by evans and davies 1998 this pattern can be classified as type c2 indicating a highly consistent component ranking of cse cso cg under these episodes surface event water was the leading contributor to stream doc the rapid establishment of saturated flow connectivity across the upland stream continuum during the extreme storm events caused the doc pool to be diluted by the flood water due to the limited supply of doc source material doc concentration was higher at the beginning of storm runoff than on the falling limb for a given discharge mcglynn and mcdonnell 2003 pacific et al 2010 the hypothesis that the hysteresis form could be transformed from a2 to c2 proposed by evans and davies 1998 was observed in the typical flash flood catchment with increasing levels of flushing thus event based hysteresis analysis suggests that the extreme storm events shifted doc export from transport limited to source limited in the typical flash flood catchment 4 3 joint controls of hydrological pathways and doc source on the shift from transport limited to source limited regimes the three phase c q relationship of all observations and the two hysteresis patterns during storm events in hgc can be explained by the doc source and the degree of hydrological pathways and connectivity across the upland stream continuum that is influenced by the attributes of a typical flash flood catchment and rainfall intensity the typical flash flood catchment attributes of hgc were characterized as steep slope thin soil layers and poor soil water storage capacity all of these catchment attributes led to rapidly increasing the hydrological connectivity during storm events and contributed to the upland doc transport to the stream the shift in doc export regimes from transport limited to source limited is illustrated by the schematic diagram shown in fig 5 that represents the controls of hydrological processes and doc source on doc export in a typical flash flood catchment the three phase c q relationship corresponds to the three pattern discharge dynamic because the degree of hydrological connectivity determined the flow pathways of doc to the stream during the inter storm periods fig 5a the initial doc concentration was generally lower because of the baseflow path through the deep layer with lower doc concentration pacific et al 2010 and doc increased slowly with the increasing discharge during storm events cg was lower than cse and cso and the doc concentration of stream was consistently higher during the event than it is at baseflow thus the hysteresis loops was convex c2 or a2 in this typical flash flood catchment for the moderate storm events in fig 5b the water infiltration and the main flow pathway shifted from the lower mineral layer where doc is absorbed to the shallow organic layer where doc is produced clark et al 2007 the saturated area gradually extends from the riparian to the upland region and the groundwater table rises into the shallow doc rich soil layer leading to rapidly increased doc concentration in the stream runoff weiler and mcdonnell 2006 under these episodes surface event water generally generated by saturation excess overland flow and close to the stream with relative lower doc thus soil water was the main contributor to the stream doc associated with ranking of cso cse cg type a2 the increasing hydrological connectivity leads to upland doc rich soil water contributed to the stream on the falling limb of the c q plot for the extreme storm events fig 5c larger rainfall intensity resulted in rapidly increasing upland stream hydrological connectivity at the beginning of extreme storm events han et al 2020 doc rich surface event water and soil water contributed to the streamflow leading to doc concentration rapidly increasing with discharge during the highest flow period of extreme storm events the saturation excess area extended to the hilltop and the hydrological connectivity across the upland stream continuum was entirely established under these episodes the surface event flow with high doc concentration tended to dominate the stream doc it was thus generated hysteresis types c2 cse cso cg the highly connected flow pathways allowed the flood to flushing the doc pool flushing is likely to generate the peak stream doc concentration at the episode of the doc rich hilltop surface doc source contribute to the stream doc followed that the size limited upland doc pool was diluted and tend to exhaustion doc concentration failed to increase with discharge at the same pace as the moderate storm events thus the doc source limitation dominated doc export leading to the flat phase and the clockwise patterns in hgc during the highest flow period of extreme storm events 4 4 dominant role of the storm on doc export in a mountainous flash flood catchment doc source limitation significantly decreased doc concentrations during extreme storm events in hgc in previous studies doyle et al 2005 meybeck and moatar 2012 moatar et al 2017 power law equations were used to depict the c q relationship by fitting the power law equation to the individual storm event in hgc further analysis showed that power law equation can well capture the c q relationship and also performed agreeably in term of statistical index fig 6 but significantly overestimated the doc concentration compared with the exponential equation during the source limited stage of the extreme storm events fig 6b 6c comparing with exponential equation the power law equation overestimated the doc export of 9 3 and 9 4 during the source limited stage of the e0817 and e0820 event respectively overestimation may be much greater than estimated here as c q relationship shown in the fig 4a may drop quickly if discharge continues to increase which have not been observed during the study period but could happen in future thus if failure to consider the shift in doc export regimes from transport limited to source limited the doc concentration can be significantly overestimated at regional and global scales however this speculation is made from one typical catchment only more observations and studies should be carried out in the future storm events almost entirely determined the dynamics of doc concentration during the study period the observed doc concentrations ranging from 3 0 to 15 7 mg l 1 in hgc were similar to concentrations observed in most temperate forest catchments but lower than in wetland dominated catchments with higher carbon content and higher than in forest catchments with large amounts of precipitation table s1 the storm associated doc yield in hgc was quite large and even exceeded the hurricane associated doc yield in a coastal forest catchment at the same latitude for example the extreme storm event of e0820 contributed doc yield of 9 50 kg c ha 1 and this yield was more than the doc yield 3 3 kg c ha 1 observed from hurricane irene in the chesapeake bay usa in 2011 dhillon and inamdar 2013 a larger proportion 95 0 of the doc yield through quickflow was observed proving that overland flow and interflow cause the doc rich zone to contribute to the streamflow in a typical flash flood catchment during storm events 5 conclusions a large number of studies have previously examined doc dynamics especially at wetland dominated catchments or catchments with abundant precipitation and or frequent storm events but few of these studies have examined doc export in typical flash flood catchments or explored doc export mechanisms during extremely high flow using high frequency sampling consistent with previous research studies this study observed the increasing c q relationship during inter storm periods and moderate storms indicating that doc export was transport limited more importantly this study found that extreme storm events lowered the increasing c q relationship during moderate storm events to a flat response and shifted the anticlockwise hysteresis pattern to clockwise these new findings indicate that extreme storm events can shift doc export regime from transport limited to source limited this has rarely if ever been reported before due to a lack of high frequency data during extreme storm events further analysis showed that doc yield in this typical flash flood catchment was almost exclusively driven by storm events thus global carbon models need to incorporate the shift in doc export regimes defined in this study

2003,ongoing changes in climate and carbon dioxide cs in the atmosphere have profound effects on plant transpiration and consequently on the water balance land surface models lsms reflect plant response to these changes by simulation of stomatal conductance gs however the plant response is not well understood and varies with climate in this study the simulation of gs within different lsms is reviewed and a new approach a mixed generalized additive model mgam for gs simulation is developed the alternative gs estimation is proposed as a solution for the high parameterisation uncertainty in

mae mean absolute error 1 introduction the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration cs has global direct and indirect effects on the earth system yiqi et al 1999 the cs has increased from 275 to 415 ppm since the industrial revolution in 1760 the change in the cs has profoundly affected the climate system and earth s primary productivity friedlingstein et al 2020 high levels of cs may inhibit photorespiration and increase the net photosynthesis rate an hence providing better growth and yield productivity ahmed et al 2019 additionally cs significantly stimulates light saturated photosynthesis and reduces transpiration which collectively leads to higher light use efficiency and water use efficiency wue in plants consequently changing ecosystem water balance reinecke et al 2021 yiqi et al 1999 therefore an accurate simulation model to clearly reveal the effects of cs on plants is highly required in plants stomata consist of microscopic pores formed by a pair of guard cells that control the exchange of water energy and cs between leaf and atmosphere via regulating stomatal conductance gs wu et al 2021 the elevated cs effects on gs is highly variable between climates li et al 2019 yang et al 2021 yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 and vegetation donohue et al 2017 zhu et al 2021 which is not well understood the effect of cs on gs has been shown contradictory in different studies leading to uncertainty in gs simulation for example a reduction in gs or transpiration rate has been claimed to be caused by increasing cs faralli et al 2019 gimeno et al 2016 leuzinger and korner 2007 lin et al 2001 ward et al 2012 in contrast others have argued that a cs increase does not significantly reduce the gs uddling et al 2009 walker et al 2019 moreover increasing leaf area index lai by elevated cs may offsets the reduction in gs in unmature plants duursma et al 2016 norby and zak 2011 purcell et al 2018 the effect of cs on gs is more complex due to interactions of cs and other climate variables such as atmospheric water vapour net radiation r or air temperature tair arora et al 2020 ceppi and gregory 2017 de kauwe et al 2021 haworth et al 2013 liao et al 2021 medlyn et al 2001 several studies have claimed that high vapour pressure deficit vpd outweighs the decreasing effect of cs on gs flexas et al 2004 morgan et al 2004 xu et al 2016 moreover in some locations with dry conditions and high temperature cs has an increasing effect on gs purcell et al 2018 the dynamic vegetation response to climate variables e g humidity vpd temperature and cs has been introduced into various land surface models lsms since the early 2000s blyth et al 2021 damour et al 2010 lei et al 2014 liu and mishra 2017 reinecke et al 2021 the gs simulation in lsms can be categorised into semi empirical and empirical approaches the semi empirical approaches integrate biological physical and biochemical processes in plants lawrence et al 2020 lawrence et al 2019 the semi empirical gs simulations are constrained due to large uncertainties caused by model parameterisations jiménez et al 2011 seneviratne et al 2010 in addition gs simulations with this approach do not account for important stress processes related to plant hydraulics such as water humidity or the cs effect green et al 2019 wang et al 2009 vegetation responds differently to climate variables and cs changes xu et al 2016 however the sensitivity of gs to cs and environmental conditions is not well established in semi empirical gs simulation approaches franks et al 2017 jarvis et al 1976 konings et al 2017 alternatively empirical gs simulations use statistical correlations between gs environmental factors and transpiration li et al 2019 pan et al 2015 the empirical gs simulation includes simplifying assumptions and does not consider the net photosynthesis rate an while the an is generally part of the semi empirical approaches damour et al 2010 empirical gs simulation models usually do consider the stress functions of plants however the definition of appropriate stress functions is challenging in these models for example noah lsm includes a jarvis empirical gs simulation model jarvis et al 1976 in which multiplicative combinations of stress functions e g r tair soil moisture and vpd are applied to scale down stomatal conductance from the optimal condition kumar et al 2011 the equations of these stress functions vary among different studies granier and loustau 1994 wang et al 2020 wang et al 2016 zeppel et al 2008 the cs effect on leaf stomatal conductance can also be added into a jarvis type model however the addition of cs effects on gs simulation as a simple linear or hyperbolic function is another challenging issue in these models li et al 2019 despite extensive research on lsms large uncertainties still exist in quantifying the magnitude of environmental variables on gs friedlingstein et al 2020 the large discrepancy among independent studies can be attributed to deficiencies in model structures lack of sufficient measurements ill calibrated model parameters and uncertainty in forcing data pan et al 2020 the uncertainty sources not only stem from meteorological conditions and soil moisture but are also intensified by the physiology and structure of vegetation best et al 2015 damour et al 2010 knowledge of the uncertainties in the gs and transpiration estimated from different sources is a prerequisite for future water balance prediction blyth et al 2021 the objective of this study is to evaluate and improve leaf stomatal conductance gs simulation in lsms the data from the free air carbon dioxide enrichment face experiment with leaf level measurement of gs by duursma et al 2016 and gimeno et al 2016 is used in this study we first review gs simulation in semi empirical and empirical approaches in different lsms to identify the sources of uncertainty and sensitivity to cs changes and climate variables then we propose a new mixed generalized additive model mgam for the gs simulation with lower uncertainty and capable of accounting for the interactions of various environmental influences on gs the aim of this research is to provide an alternative solution for future lsm model development through the study of vegetation responses to key climate interactions the results of this analysis will allow us to predict the effects of anthropogenic climate change on water balance 2 methodology and data sources 2 1 overview of approaches to gs estimation the gs is a key variable in hydrological modelling of plant water use wu et al 2021 the stomatal regulation of gs and transpiration in plants are quantified by lsms blyth et al 2021 the lsms incorporate cs effects on gs by semi empirical and empirical modelling approaches as presented in table 1 2 1 1 semi empirical gs simulation approaches a common assumption in the semi empirical gs simulation approach is the big leaf theory a representation of the leaf level photosynthesis that treats the canopy like one big leaf farquhar 1989 the equation clm5 gs eq 2 table 1 is a well known semi empirical gs simulation model developed by ball et al 1987 and is used in the lsm community land model clm ball 1987 in this method gs responds to an relative humidity hs and cs the clm5 gs eq 2 method has been criticised for its use of inaccurately simulated an values damour et al 2010 therefore leuning 1990 1995 modified the clm5 gs eq 2 method by adding the co2 compensatory point l and replacing the hs with vpd to form the clm5 gs eq 3 method this method was further improved to clm5 gs eq 4 by modifying the incorrect gs simulation when cs is equal to l arneth et al 2002 the joint uk land environment simulator jules uses a big leaf approach in jules gs eq 5 where gs is connected to leaf air co2 exchange so the intercellular carbon dioxide ci variable is added to the equation cox et al 1999 table 1 in other studies the ci is replaced by a function of cs c i x c s where x is a calibrated parameter knauer et al 2015 knorr 2000 this replacement was implemented in jules gs eq 6 and used in cases where the ci is not available the lund potsdam jena managed land lpjml model uses a similar approach to jules however the gmin has been added as a vegetation specific minimum stomatal conductance table 1 which should be calibrated for different vegetation types sitch et al 2003 in all semi empirical lsms an an and gs relationship is included as a constraint to couple carbon and water processes however lsms have different representations of the an and gs relationship particularly in the capability for simulating the co2 concentration effect moreover the coupling or decoupling of gs and an is still debated among different studies ameye et al 2012 collatz et al 1992 drake et al 2018 krich et al 2022 schulze et al 1973 tuzet et al 2003 urban et al 2017b von caemmerer and evans 2015 yun et al 2020 therefore for comparing semi empirical lsms in gs simulation we have assumed gs is unknown and all other parameters including an and climate variables are known as input in the gs simulation equations in table 1 2 1 2 empirical gs simulation approaches in empirical models various interconnections between plant components and environmental conditions are defined via empirical mathematical concepts for the gs simulation these models estimate gs independent of the an variable the result of empirical gs models strongly depends on the quality of the observed input data jaiswal et al 2020 the effects of environmental conditions on plants are computed as stress functions one of the empirical gs simulation models is the jarvis equation integrated in the noah lsm which estimates gs directly by reducing a maximum gs for the optimal environmental condition using stress functions of actual environmental conditions liu et al 2019 in this research different forms of stress functions were reviewed from various studies table s1 most versions of the jarvis equation treat cs effects on gs as a simple linear process except the model used by li et al li et al 2019 another empirical gs simulation model is jsbach gs eq 8 table 1 this model uses a maximum value of an without stress instead of variable an and has a soil moisture stress function knauer et al 2015 the soil moisture stress function in jsbach has been modified in this study based on different soil moisture stress functions in table s1 2 1 3 mgam for gs simulation mgam is a powerful modelling technique to simulate complex nonlinear relationships between variables and responses wood et al 2016 this approach is used when at least one parameter or variable appears to be nonlinear the mgam simulation process is based on developing multiple nonlinear functions to predict the outcome of the dependent or independent variables and parameters with the help of the degree of relationship among them mgam uses flexible regression functions smoother function which model the relationships between covariates and outcomes where the shape of the function itself varies between different groups of datasets trevor et al 2009 apart from the regular smooth function s to reflect the nonlinearity of variables a tensor function ti can be used when the interaction between variables is statistically significant the generic form of the mgam model is 11 f x k 1 k β k b k x where f x is a smoother function b k are basis functions β k are corresponding coefficients and k is referred to as basis size or basis complexity the coefficients of the basis functions are optimised to ensure the appropriate complexity of the models the large basis size could lead to overfitting but it is counteracted by a penalty term to maximise the penalised log likelihood as in eq 12 12 l ρ l λ β t s β where l ρ is penalised log likelihood l is the model likelihood s is the penalty matrix β t s β is the penalty term for vector β and λ controls the trade off between log likelihood and penalty term wood 2016 at a low value of λ 0 the penalty has no effect and the model is too complex with high wiggliness but at high values of λ the penalty is high resulting in a simple linear model trevor et al 2009 wahba 1990 the nls and mgcv packages in r are used for mgam gs simulation in this study baty et al 2015 wood et al 2016 the structure of gs simulation in mgam can be described as eq 13 13 g s m 1 m f x m where m are the effective variables on gs e g climate variables cs and soil moisture each of the effective variables has the smoother function f x eq 11 which contains basis functions with relevant coefficients 2 2 description of the dataset and the case study the input data of this study were collected from the western sydney university website duursma 2015 duursma et al 2016 the data is the result of the eucalyptus face experiment eucface with eucalyptus dominated mature woodland in western sydney australia 33 37 s 150 44 e 30 m a s l from october 2012 to november 2013 duursma et al 2016 the case study is characterised as a humid temperate subtropical transitional climate duursma et al 2016 gimeno et al 2016 the mean annual precipitation is 800 mm and the mean annual temperature is 17 c from 1881 to 2014 the estimated potential evapotranspiration pet is 1350 mm from 1950 to 2000 duursma et al 2016 zomer et al 2008 the soil at this site is loamy sand with more than 75 sand content in the top 50 cm and sandy clay loam with more than 30 silt and clay from 50 to 300 cm depth crous et al 2015 duursma et al 2016 the eucface consisted of six 25 m diameter circular plots rings each ring having 39 3 canopy trees with approximately 17 dominant and co dominant canopy forming trees seven campaigns of leaf gas exchange and water potential measurements were performed the leaf level co2 and h2o exchange measurements were performed with four open flow portable photosynthesis systems li 6400 li cor inc lincoln ne usa the an and gs were measured under 1800 µmol m 2 s 1 photon flux density provided by the in built li 6400 red blue led lamp the cs level was increased gradually from ambient level 390 μmol co2 mol 1 to elevated level 540 μmol co2 mol 1 starting from september 2012 and reached to full operation model in february 2013 three rings were exposed to elevated cs while the three ambient rings were used as control plots the elevated cs does not affect lai of the mature trees in the case study duursma et al 2016 this study focuses on 160 observed data points over 11 days which had all the necessary variables for both the semi empirical and empirical gs simulation models the rest of the data does not contain all variables the main objective of this study is finding the effects of co2 changes on gs and available data had the full coverage for the co2 range from ambient to elevated level and covered all seasons 2012 2013 2 3 calibration and validation processes of gs simulation models 2 3 1 mcmc bayesian calibration bayesian inference is an important approach for calibration especially in complex environmental and ecological models speich et al 2021 the markov chain monte carlo mcmc algorithm is the methodological backbone of the bayesian approach speich et al 2021 the evaluation of parameterisation in bayesian theory is based on the likelihood as the goodness of fit the likelihood p d θ is defined as a probability of observation data d occurring given the model parameterisation with θ the term θ represents different parameterisations of the model the best choice for θ is the value with the highest likelihood maximum likelihood estimation defined in eq 14 hartig et al 2012 14 p d θ e m θ d 2 2 σ 2 where m θ are the model prediction results from the parameterisation θ d is the observed data and σ is the standard deviation of the error moreover additional independent information related to parameters should be investigated in the parameterisation we have used bayes theory to merge independent information into the likelihood function as shown in eq 15 15 p θ d p d θ p θ p d where p θ d is posterior density or probability density that summarises the information for probable values of θ the posterior density p θ d depends on the likelihood p d θ and a new term of p θ that is called the prior in each iteration this new information will be merged with the existing information by using the posterior distribution from the old data as the prior for the new data hartig et al 2012 the posterior density calculation in bayesian inference is computationally demanding due to its high dimensionality therefore mcmc was used to generate a sample of data from the posterior distribution to solve this problem the mcmc performs a random walk in parameter space by the stochastic markov process the markov process was chosen such that the probability of each parameter combination is proportional to its posterior density there are different algorithms for the markov process such as metropolis hastings gibb s sampling sequential monte carlo or differential evolution dezs speich et al 2021 the dezs process was chosen in this study as the mcmc algorithm as it is more efficient than other methods in dezs different datasets run in parallel therefore choosing an appropriate scale and orientation of the distribution is more efficient than other markov algorithms ter braak and vrugt 2008 the bayesiantools and mcmc packages in r are used for the calibration process in this study geyer and johnson 2020 hartig et al 2019 2 3 2 cross validation technique 160 observed data points were used in this study for the gs simulation 80 of the data was used to train the models and for the calibration processes while 20 was used to test the models a 10th fold cross validation was used with ten iterations the training data were randomly split into 10 folds and the model was trained by 9 folds then it was validated by the remaining 10th fold the caret package in r was used for the cross validation kuhn 2021 2 4 intrinsic water use efficiency response from gs models the intrinsic water use efficiency iwue is defined as the ratio of carbon assimilation μmol m2s an over gs eq 16 which is used to measure the adaptability of plants to changes in environmental conditions zhang et al 2019 16 i w u e a n g s the iwue has received considerable attention due to the recent increase in iwue in many ecosystems several observational keenan et al 2013 mastrotheodoros et al 2017 and theoretical knauer et al 2017 studies attributed this phenomenon to rising cs zhang et al 2019 in lsms iwue is a new index that reflects plants adaptability to changing environmental conditions blyth et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 in this study the observed an and simulated gs for the various referenced models were used to estimate iwue the response of iwue to the cs scenarios is calculated from different gs simulation models 2 5 sensitivity analysis the sobol sensitivity analysis is used to determine how much of the variability or the uncertainty of the output model depends on each of the input indices variables and parameters also it determines if these indices act singularly or if there are interactions between different indices the sobol method is a variance based uncertainty and sensitivity analysis that represents the first second and total order of variance based estimators to understand how output variance is attributed to individual indices or the interaction between indices puy et al 2021 it is a common approach to measure local sensitivity or one at a time analysis to define the model output changes in terms of one index variation when all other indices are maintained at a fixed value saltelli et al 2019 this approach does not sufficiently identify the interactions between indices the sobol method as a global sensitivity analysis fills this gap by studying the interactions of uncertain parameters on the output of the simulation model even for nonlinear systems saltelli et al 2008 the sobol method perturbs input indices based on their ranges and then defines the model output uncertainty using variance as in eq 17 puy et al 2021 saltelli et al 2008 17 v y v x i e x i y x i e x i v x i y x i where v xi e x i y x i and e xi v x i y x i are the first order effects of the x i and residual respectively e and v are the mean and variance operators y f x is a scalar output and x x 1 x 2 x k are uncertain inputs parameters x i denotes all parameters except x i v y can be decomposed to all partial variances up to the kth order as eqs 18 19 saltelli et al 2008 18 v y i 1 v i i i j v i j v 1 2 k where v i v x i e x i y x i 19 v i j v x i x j e x i j y x i x j v x i e x i y x i v x j e x j y x j the sobol indices are then calculated as eq 20 saltelli et al 2008 20 s i v i v y s i j v i j v y where s i is the first order effects of x i and s ij is the second order effect of x i x j total order index t i which is the first order effects of x i and its interactions with all other parameters can be measured by eq 21 saltelli et al 2008 21 t i 1 v x i e x i y x i v y e x i v x i y x i v y as an example for a three dimensional model the total order index of x 1 is the sum of the first second and third order effects of x 1 as in eq 22 22 t 1 s 1 s 1 2 s 1 3 s 1 2 3 the methodology used in this study has been summarised in fig 1 the input data was divided to train and test data for calibration and test of gs simulation approaches in different lsms the input data including an climate variables and calibrated parameters were defined for each gs simulation approach in lsms mcmc bayesian calibration process was performed for gs simulation in semi empirical and empirical models the calibration process requires a calibration range for each fitted parameter in semi empirical and empirical models fig s1 the 10th fold cross validation process was performed for all simulation models mgam is independent of an and mcmc bayesian calibration the differences between the various gs simulation approaches in lsms and mgam are evaluated through gs simulation iwue estimation and global sensitivity analysis 3 results 3 1 gs simulation results the calibration process for semi empirical and empirical gs simulation models has been performed with the bayesian and mcmc method table 1 the results of the gs simulation for all models were compared with the observed gs values for both the training and testing data fig 2 simulation performance was measured by assessment criteria such as correlation coefficients pearson spearman and kendall nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae fig 3 the semi empirical gs simulation approaches performed well based on all the assessment criteria for testing and training the coefficient values for pearson spearman kendall and nse for test data were 88 97 91 97 75 89 and 73 94 respectively the error values for semi empirical gs simulation models were 0 03 0 07 and 0 02 0 05 mol m2s for rmse and mae respectively the results of the empirical gs simulation models showed a lower accuracy compared to the semi empirical gs simulation models the jsbach gs eq 8 showed 82 76 59 and 66 for pearson spearman kendall and nse coefficient respectively while these values for the noah gs eq 9 were 73 71 53 and 52 respectively the jsbach gs eq 8 rmse and mae values were respectively 0 08 and 0 06 mol m2s while noah gs eq 8 error values were respectively 0 11 and 0 09 mol m2s the results of the mgam gs simulation model in correlation and efficiency coefficients were 87 85 65 and 71 for respectively pearson spearman kendall and nse coefficients in test data the error values in the mgam gs model were 0 07 and 0 06 mol m2s for respectively rmse and mae this demonstrates that the mgam gs simulation model has better results than the empirical gs simulation approaches for the test data it is worth noting that all models shown in fig 3 have been cross validated so there is no overfitting or underfitting between the training and test results the slight improvement in test data for the mgam model may result from model performance on unseen and randomly chosen test datasets or a low number of test data samples 3 2 the impact of gs on iwue the scatter plot in fig 4 confirms that elevated cs will increase the iwue as expected the iwue for all gs simulation models increased by 18 to 25 for the cs gradual rise from 390 to 540 μmol co2 mol 1 the results for the semi empirical gs simulation models of iwue for both scenarios show a better fit however for the gs values less than 0 1 mol m2s the simulated iwue was lower than the observed iwue especially for clm4 5 gs eq 1 and clm5 gs eq 2 a similar result was observed for the gs less than 0 1 mol m2s in jsbach gs eq 8 noah gs eq 9 and mgam gs eq 10 however the dispersion was mostly located in the lower part of the iwue gs curve while the upper part of the curve was more concentrated for both simulated and observed iwue expect few points for elevated cs in noah gs eq 9 3 3 sensitivity analysis of gs to control indices the variance based sensitivity analysis of gs to control indices all parameters and variables in each gs simulation approach was performed fig 5 and table 2 the first order effects of indices si which define the dominating indices in the gs uncertainty are shown in red bars in fig 5 the second sij and total order effects ti which define the effects of the interaction of two and all indices are shown in green and purple bars respectively eqs 18 19 in this part all input indices have been perturbed fig s1 and then the most effective indices which contribute to the gs variability have been ranked among different variables e g an hs s vpd ci cs tm and calibrated parameters e g a a1 a4 d0 gmin g0 g1 l m for each gs simulation equation sensitivity values lower than 0 05 were eliminated to distinguish the dominating indices better from the unimportant ones zhang et al 2015 hence the ti values in some indices were higher than the sum of si and sij all semi empirical gs simulation approaches show high sensitivities to the indices table 2 the first order effects of indices are high 75 to 94 the high value of si in semi empirical gs simulation models was attributed to calibrated parameters such as b and m in clm4 5 gs eq 1 g0 in all clm5 gs eq 2 3 4 a in jules gs eq 6 and gmin and l in lpjml gs eq 7 an also had high effects on gs variance in all semi empirical gs simulation models except lpjml gs eq 7 the gs sensitivity in semi empirical gs simulation models was significantly affected by calibrated parameters which shows the high gs uncertainty to calibrated parameters there was no effective interaction second order sensitivity between variables in these approaches the gs sensitivity in jsbach gs eq 8 was highly affected by the calibrated parameter a1 the si value was 0 86 however there was no effective interaction between indices for gs variation the gs sensitivity in noah gs eq 9 was different because gs was less sensitive to indices si 0 33 the key control indices in noah gs eq 9 were the calibrated parameter a2 and the s variable there was little interaction between vpd a2 and vpd s which was negligible the mgam gs eq 10 model was expected to have a different sensitivity of gs to input variables we have obtained the basis functions in mgam by testing all possible combinations of environmental variables and the combination with the highest simulation accuracy has been suggested in table 1 the basis functions which illustrate the influence of interactive environmental effects on gs vary based on the type of vegetation since as reported previously each type of vegetation is sensitive to the specific interactive environmental effects kimm et al 2020 yang et al 2022 as a result sensitivity analyses for different basis functions are not necessary for this type of vegetation the mgam had lower first order sensitivity si 0 33 to key climate variables such as vpd tm cs hs and s the gs variation was more sensitive to vpd and tm while other variables indirectly affected gs due to their interactions the mgam also has considerable interaction between vpd cs and vpd tm as second order sensitivity 4 discussion 4 1 semi empirical and empirical gs simulation approaches in this study the semi empirical gs simulation models appear to have high accuracy in gs simulation performance this result is not surprising because these gs equations contain the an variable which is highly correlated with gs and directs stomatal behaviour radin et al 1988 however the large uncertainties to parameterisation and the an variable simplification of tree canopy as a big leaf in semi empirical gs simulation models constrains semi empirical gs simulation models in global scale blyth et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 in contrast the empirical gs simulation models such as noah gs eq 9 and jsbach gs eq 8 have reduced the uncertainties and limitations of semi empirical gs simulation models however finding the appropriate mathematical functions regarding environmental factors and complex calibration processes affects the efficiency of empirical models in gs simulation knauer et al 2015 lhomme et al 1998 moreover applying the proper value for gsmax and anmax in noah gs eq 9 and jsbach gs eq 8 respectively are other limitations of these models as mentioned above the limitations of semi empirical and empirical gs simulation approaches call for a new method for gs simulation the mgam gs simulation model does not require the an variable and calculates gs directly from environmental variables bypassing the need for ranges of unknown fitted parameters in the mcmc bayesian calibration process gsmax and anmax values climate variables e g cs hs vpd tm and soil water content s were used to simulate gs in this new approach the mgam gs model has the following advantages it relaxes the assumptions and limitations of semi empirical gs simulation models it simulates gs independent of the an variable it can simulate gs accurately as a result there is less first order uncertainty regarding key climate variables compared to semi empirical models and more complex mathematical concepts regarding stress functions are removed from empirical models 4 2 the impact of gs on iwue the gs impact on iwue gives another viewpoint to the gs simulation model s performance in all models the iwue was enhanced when cs increased however there were some differences depending on the gs value higher or lower than 0 1 mol m2s similar results have been reported li et al 2017 mathias and thomas 2021 zhang et al 2019 suggesting iwue improvements in cs enrichments scenarios however there was no identification of the different impact of gs on iwue regarding gs values to the best of our knowledge it is the first time that the impact of gs on iwue has been evaluated based on the different values of gs the results show that most of the lsms underestimate simulated iwue for gs value less than 0 1 mol m2s however they performed better at higher gs values the underestimation of the simulated iwue for low gs values gs lower than 0 1 mol m2s was greater using jsbach gs eq 8 noah gs eq 9 and mgam gs eq 10 noah gs eq 9 has shown both overestimation and underestimation for the simulated iwue at low gs values especially for the elevated cs scenario 4 3 the importance of sensitivity analysis of gs simulation approaches the gs sensitivity analysis results presented in section 3 3 and the key controlling indices that affect gs variance were identified for each gs simulation approach the semi empirical gs simulation models showed high first order sensitivity to calibrated parameters and the an variable the sensitivity of gs to calibrated parameters which change by vegetation type makes these models computationally demanding however these models did not show any interaction between variables as second order sensitivity fig 5 jiménez et al 2011 applied an intercomparison of lsms output and highlighted the difficulties in using lsms models and the necessity of improve formulations to cope with model uncertainties jiménez et al 2011 blyth et al 2021 have suggested that lsms need improvements to represent important processes in the real world such as interactions between climate variables and vegetations blyth et al 2021 the new mgam gs simulation approach can define interaction between key climate variables effects on gs which has consistency to the real world the sensitivity analysis results in fig 5 and fig s1 for mgam gs eq 10 show that vpd and tm are key climate variables which affect gs variation in addition to the interaction between vpd tm and vpd cs the increase in vpd causes a reduction in gs values fig s1 for mgam gs eq 10 which confirms previous studies creese et al 2014 inoue et al 2021 jiao et al 2019 in higher vpd conditions the guard cells two cells that surround a stoma are vulnerable to turgor loss and close the stomata to decrease the conductance of gas diffusion and water loss via stomata inoue et al 2021 the tm variable increases gs for a small margin fig s1 the increase in gs by tm can be explained by mesophyll conductance increase which supplies more water for evaporation and increases guard cell turgor and stomata aperture urban et al 2017a when gs is increased by a high temperature the trees increase their rate of evaporative cooling to survive in hot and dry conditions urban et al 2017a since the increase in temperature enhances the vpd the interaction between vpd tm on gs is important von caemmerer and evans 2015 the global sensitivity analysis of mgam gs eq 10 shows the interaction between vpd tm fig 5 the interaction between vpd tm was shown in several studies when vpd is high the effect of temperature on gs is larger than when vpd is low purcell et al 2018 urban et al 2017a another interaction between climate variables that affect gs simulation in mgam is vpd cs interaction fig 5 many studies have shown that elevated cs cause a reduction in gs however for the higher cs values increased vpd offsets this reduction flexas et al 2004 xu et al 2016 the interaction of vpd tm and vpd cs is justified based on the literature review as shown above however the plant physiological mechanisms are complex and require continuous datasets with a higher quantity and well controlled environment that is hard to achieve urban et al 2017a 4 4 towards a robust approach in cs gs simulation the effects of cs and other climate variables interactions on gs and transpiration changes are still debated nadal sala et al 2021 the semi empirical and empirical gs simulation models have different viewpoints in reflecting cs effects on gs the jarvis equation uses a linear function to present this relationship jarvis et al 1976 wang et al 2005 produced a hyperbolic model to represent gs response to cs concentration they found that the rate of decreasing gs gradually lessened with cs increase wang et al 2005 li et al 2019 compared versions of the cs gs relationship to find the best physiological and theoretical relationship they used a combination of linear and hyperbolic equations as a modified hyperbolic model to improve the accuracy and reliability of cs gs estimation li et al 2019 this study selected the modified hyperbolic in the jarvis equation in noah gs eq 9 because it had better result than other cs gs simulation approaches table 1 and s1 it is worth noting that in several studies the understanding of the plant response to cs changes was through the assumption of keeping other variables at a fixed level massmann et al 2019 this assumption is far from the real world processes due to the interaction between the different variables the mgam gs model can reflect the combinational effects of key climate variables on gs changes although this new approach highlights the interaction of vpd cs and vpd tm in gs variation more details should be linked to vegetation growth stages however due to the absence of a comprehensive and continuous dataset for a whole year justification of the climate interactions by cs through the whole growth period of a plant was not possible therefore more studies on the mgam approach are suggested for different climates and vegetation types 5 conclusion the intercomparison of gs models and their global sensitivity analysis showed the high sensitivity and dependency of semi empirical gs simulation models to parameterisation and an this makes it difficult to extend these models to a global scale to improve gs simulation the complex climate vegetation interactions should be understood the gs simulation in empirical models considered climate variables effects on vegetation however their calibration process and complex plants stress functions make it challenging to use them in new locations with different climates the introduced approach of mgam gs captures important processes in real world soil atmosphere vegetation interactions while maintaining an appropriate level of parsimony to permit global scale simulations without requiring ranges for fitted parameters by the mcmc bayesian calibration process mgam can represent the interaction of different key climate variables in gs simulation accomplished by global sensitivity analysis this achievement improves our understanding of gs simulation from individual indices level to understanding the gs variation affected by indices interactions a robust nonlinear gs simulation with mgam gs highlights the effects of vpd cs and vpd tm interaction on gs value this new approach provides an alternative method for land surface modelling of transpiration simulation and water balance prediction further mgam testing with comprehensive data for more vegetation types at the global scale and the full plant growth stage is required credit authorship contribution statement nastaran chitsaz conceptualization methodology data curation

2003,ongoing changes in climate and carbon dioxide cs in the atmosphere have profound effects on plant transpiration and consequently on the water balance land surface models lsms reflect plant response to these changes by simulation of stomatal conductance gs however the plant response is not well understood and varies with climate in this study the simulation of gs within different lsms is reviewed and a new approach a mixed generalized additive model mgam for gs simulation is developed the alternative gs estimation is proposed as a solution for the high parameterisation uncertainty in semi empirical gs simulation models and high dependency on mathematical functions for environmental stress factors in empirical gs simulation models mgam has high pearson and spearman correlations 87 and 85 respectively and efficiency coefficients 71 with low error values 0 07 mol m2s in gs simulation the global sensitivity analysis of the mgam approach shows the necessity of considering the

mae mean absolute error 1 introduction the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration cs has global direct and indirect effects on the earth system yiqi et al 1999 the cs has increased from 275 to 415 ppm since the industrial revolution in 1760 the change in the cs has profoundly affected the climate system and earth s primary productivity friedlingstein et al 2020 high levels of cs may inhibit photorespiration and increase the net photosynthesis rate an hence providing better growth and yield productivity ahmed et al 2019 additionally cs significantly stimulates light saturated photosynthesis and reduces transpiration which collectively leads to higher light use efficiency and water use efficiency wue in plants consequently changing ecosystem water balance reinecke et al 2021 yiqi et al 1999 therefore an accurate simulation model to clearly reveal the effects of cs on plants is highly required in plants stomata consist of microscopic pores formed by a pair of guard cells that control the exchange of water energy and cs between leaf and atmosphere via regulating stomatal conductance gs wu et al 2021 the elevated cs effects on gs is highly variable between climates li et al 2019 yang et al 2021 yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 and vegetation donohue et al 2017 zhu et al 2021 which is not well understood the effect of cs on gs has been shown contradictory in different studies leading to uncertainty in gs simulation for example a reduction in gs or transpiration rate has been claimed to be caused by increasing cs faralli et al 2019 gimeno et al 2016 leuzinger and korner 2007 lin et al 2001 ward et al 2012 in contrast others have argued that a cs increase does not significantly reduce the gs uddling et al 2009 walker et al 2019 moreover increasing leaf area index lai by elevated cs may offsets the reduction in gs in unmature plants duursma et al 2016 norby and zak 2011 purcell et al 2018 the effect of cs on gs is more complex due to interactions of cs and other climate variables such as atmospheric water vapour net radiation r or air temperature tair arora et al 2020 ceppi and gregory 2017 de kauwe et al 2021 haworth et al 2013 liao et al 2021 medlyn et al 2001 several studies have claimed that high vapour pressure deficit vpd outweighs the decreasing effect of cs on gs flexas et al 2004 morgan et al 2004 xu et al 2016 moreover in some locations with dry conditions and high temperature cs has an increasing effect on gs purcell et al 2018 the dynamic vegetation response to climate variables e g humidity vpd temperature and cs has been introduced into various land surface models lsms since the early 2000s blyth et al 2021 damour et al 2010 lei et al 2014 liu and mishra 2017 reinecke et al 2021 the gs simulation in lsms can be categorised into semi empirical and empirical approaches the semi empirical approaches integrate biological physical and biochemical processes in plants lawrence et al 2020 lawrence et al 2019 the semi empirical gs simulations are constrained due to large uncertainties caused by model parameterisations jiménez et al 2011 seneviratne et al 2010 in addition gs simulations with this approach do not account for important stress processes related to plant hydraulics such as water humidity or the cs effect green et al 2019 wang et al 2009 vegetation responds differently to climate variables and cs changes xu et al 2016 however the sensitivity of gs to cs and environmental conditions is not well established in semi empirical gs simulation approaches franks et al 2017 jarvis et al 1976 konings et al 2017 alternatively empirical gs simulations use statistical correlations between gs environmental factors and transpiration li et al 2019 pan et al 2015 the empirical gs simulation includes simplifying assumptions and does not consider the net photosynthesis rate an while the an is generally part of the semi empirical approaches damour et al 2010 empirical gs simulation models usually do consider the stress functions of plants however the definition of appropriate stress functions is challenging in these models for example noah lsm includes a jarvis empirical gs simulation model jarvis et al 1976 in which multiplicative combinations of stress functions e g r tair soil moisture and vpd are applied to scale down stomatal conductance from the optimal condition kumar et al 2011 the equations of these stress functions vary among different studies granier and loustau 1994 wang et al 2020 wang et al 2016 zeppel et al 2008 the cs effect on leaf stomatal conductance can also be added into a jarvis type model however the addition of cs effects on gs simulation as a simple linear or hyperbolic function is another challenging issue in these models li et al 2019 despite extensive research on lsms large uncertainties still exist in quantifying the magnitude of environmental variables on gs friedlingstein et al 2020 the large discrepancy among independent studies can be attributed to deficiencies in model structures lack of sufficient measurements ill calibrated model parameters and uncertainty in forcing data pan et al 2020 the uncertainty sources not only stem from meteorological conditions and soil moisture but are also intensified by the physiology and structure of vegetation best et al 2015 damour et al 2010 knowledge of the uncertainties in the gs and transpiration estimated from different sources is a prerequisite for future water balance prediction blyth et al 2021 the objective of this study is to evaluate and improve leaf stomatal conductance gs simulation in lsms the data from the free air carbon dioxide enrichment face experiment with leaf level measurement of gs by duursma et al 2016 and gimeno et al 2016 is used in this study we first review gs simulation in semi empirical and empirical approaches in different lsms to identify the sources of uncertainty and sensitivity to cs changes and climate variables then we propose a new mixed generalized additive model mgam for the gs simulation with lower uncertainty and capable of accounting for the interactions of various environmental influences on gs the aim of this research is to provide an alternative solution for future lsm model development through the study of vegetation responses to key climate interactions the results of this analysis will allow us to predict the effects of anthropogenic climate change on water balance 2 methodology and data sources 2 1 overview of approaches to gs estimation the gs is a key variable in hydrological modelling of plant water use wu et al 2021 the stomatal regulation of gs and transpiration in plants are quantified by lsms blyth et al 2021 the lsms incorporate cs effects on gs by semi empirical and empirical modelling approaches as presented in table 1 2 1 1 semi empirical gs simulation approaches a common assumption in the semi empirical gs simulation approach is the big leaf theory a representation of the leaf level photosynthesis that treats the canopy like one big leaf farquhar 1989 the equation clm5 gs eq 2 table 1 is a well known semi empirical gs simulation model developed by ball et al 1987 and is used in the lsm community land model clm ball 1987 in this method gs responds to an relative humidity hs and cs the clm5 gs eq 2 method has been criticised for its use of inaccurately simulated an values damour et al 2010 therefore leuning 1990 1995 modified the clm5 gs eq 2 method by adding the co2 compensatory point l and replacing the hs with vpd to form the clm5 gs eq 3 method this method was further improved to clm5 gs eq 4 by modifying the incorrect gs simulation when cs is equal to l arneth et al 2002 the joint uk land environment simulator jules uses a big leaf approach in jules gs eq 5 where gs is connected to leaf air co2 exchange so the intercellular carbon dioxide ci variable is added to the equation cox et al 1999 table 1 in other studies the ci is replaced by a function of cs c i x c s where x is a calibrated parameter knauer et al 2015 knorr 2000 this replacement was implemented in jules gs eq 6 and used in cases where the ci is not available the lund potsdam jena managed land lpjml model uses a similar approach to jules however the gmin has been added as a vegetation specific minimum stomatal conductance table 1 which should be calibrated for different vegetation types sitch et al 2003 in all semi empirical lsms an an and gs relationship is included as a constraint to couple carbon and water processes however lsms have different representations of the an and gs relationship particularly in the capability for simulating the co2 concentration effect moreover the coupling or decoupling of gs and an is still debated among different studies ameye et al 2012 collatz et al 1992 drake et al 2018 krich et al 2022 schulze et al 1973 tuzet et al 2003 urban et al 2017b von caemmerer and evans 2015 yun et al 2020 therefore for comparing semi empirical lsms in gs simulation we have assumed gs is unknown and all other parameters including an and climate variables are known as input in the gs simulation equations in table 1 2 1 2 empirical gs simulation approaches in empirical models various interconnections between plant components and environmental conditions are defined via empirical mathematical concepts for the gs simulation these models estimate gs independent of the an variable the result of empirical gs models strongly depends on the quality of the observed input data jaiswal et al 2020 the effects of environmental conditions on plants are computed as stress functions one of the empirical gs simulation models is the jarvis equation integrated in the noah lsm which estimates gs directly by reducing a maximum gs for the optimal environmental condition using stress functions of actual environmental conditions liu et al 2019 in this research different forms of stress functions were reviewed from various studies table s1 most versions of the jarvis equation treat cs effects on gs as a simple linear process except the model used by li et al li et al 2019 another empirical gs simulation model is jsbach gs eq 8 table 1 this model uses a maximum value of an without stress instead of variable an and has a soil moisture stress function knauer et al 2015 the soil moisture stress function in jsbach has been modified in this study based on different soil moisture stress functions in table s1 2 1 3 mgam for gs simulation mgam is a powerful modelling technique to simulate complex nonlinear relationships between variables and responses wood et al 2016 this approach is used when at least one parameter or variable appears to be nonlinear the mgam simulation process is based on developing multiple nonlinear functions to predict the outcome of the dependent or independent variables and parameters with the help of the degree of relationship among them mgam uses flexible regression functions smoother function which model the relationships between covariates and outcomes where the shape of the function itself varies between different groups of datasets trevor et al 2009 apart from the regular smooth function s to reflect the nonlinearity of variables a tensor function ti can be used when the interaction between variables is statistically significant the generic form of the mgam model is 11 f x k 1 k β k b k x where f x is a smoother function b k are basis functions β k are corresponding coefficients and k is referred to as basis size or basis complexity the coefficients of the basis functions are optimised to ensure the appropriate complexity of the models the large basis size could lead to overfitting but it is counteracted by a penalty term to maximise the penalised log likelihood as in eq 12 12 l ρ l λ β t s β where l ρ is penalised log likelihood l is the model likelihood s is the penalty matrix β t s β is the penalty term for vector β and λ controls the trade off between log likelihood and penalty term wood 2016 at a low value of λ 0 the penalty has no effect and the model is too complex with high wiggliness but at high values of λ the penalty is high resulting in a simple linear model trevor et al 2009 wahba 1990 the nls and mgcv packages in r are used for mgam gs simulation in this study baty et al 2015 wood et al 2016 the structure of gs simulation in mgam can be described as eq 13 13 g s m 1 m f x m where m are the effective variables on gs e g climate variables cs and soil moisture each of the effective variables has the smoother function f x eq 11 which contains basis functions with relevant coefficients 2 2 description of the dataset and the case study the input data of this study were collected from the western sydney university website duursma 2015 duursma et al 2016 the data is the result of the eucalyptus face experiment eucface with eucalyptus dominated mature woodland in western sydney australia 33 37 s 150 44 e 30 m a s l from october 2012 to november 2013 duursma et al 2016 the case study is characterised as a humid temperate subtropical transitional climate duursma et al 2016 gimeno et al 2016 the mean annual precipitation is 800 mm and the mean annual temperature is 17 c from 1881 to 2014 the estimated potential evapotranspiration pet is 1350 mm from 1950 to 2000 duursma et al 2016 zomer et al 2008 the soil at this site is loamy sand with more than 75 sand content in the top 50 cm and sandy clay loam with more than 30 silt and clay from 50 to 300 cm depth crous et al 2015 duursma et al 2016 the eucface consisted of six 25 m diameter circular plots rings each ring having 39 3 canopy trees with approximately 17 dominant and co dominant canopy forming trees seven campaigns of leaf gas exchange and water potential measurements were performed the leaf level co2 and h2o exchange measurements were performed with four open flow portable photosynthesis systems li 6400 li cor inc lincoln ne usa the an and gs were measured under 1800 µmol m 2 s 1 photon flux density provided by the in built li 6400 red blue led lamp the cs level was increased gradually from ambient level 390 μmol co2 mol 1 to elevated level 540 μmol co2 mol 1 starting from september 2012 and reached to full operation model in february 2013 three rings were exposed to elevated cs while the three ambient rings were used as control plots the elevated cs does not affect lai of the mature trees in the case study duursma et al 2016 this study focuses on 160 observed data points over 11 days which had all the necessary variables for both the semi empirical and empirical gs simulation models the rest of the data does not contain all variables the main objective of this study is finding the effects of co2 changes on gs and available data had the full coverage for the co2 range from ambient to elevated level and covered all seasons 2012 2013 2 3 calibration and validation processes of gs simulation models 2 3 1 mcmc bayesian calibration bayesian inference is an important approach for calibration especially in complex environmental and ecological models speich et al 2021 the markov chain monte carlo mcmc algorithm is the methodological backbone of the bayesian approach speich et al 2021 the evaluation of parameterisation in bayesian theory is based on the likelihood as the goodness of fit the likelihood p d θ is defined as a probability of observation data d occurring given the model parameterisation with θ the term θ represents different parameterisations of the model the best choice for θ is the value with the highest likelihood maximum likelihood estimation defined in eq 14 hartig et al 2012 14 p d θ e m θ d 2 2 σ 2 where m θ are the model prediction results from the parameterisation θ d is the observed data and σ is the standard deviation of the error moreover additional independent information related to parameters should be investigated in the parameterisation we have used bayes theory to merge independent information into the likelihood function as shown in eq 15 15 p θ d p d θ p θ p d where p θ d is posterior density or probability density that summarises the information for probable values of θ the posterior density p θ d depends on the likelihood p d θ and a new term of p θ that is called the prior in each iteration this new information will be merged with the existing information by using the posterior distribution from the old data as the prior for the new data hartig et al 2012 the posterior density calculation in bayesian inference is computationally demanding due to its high dimensionality therefore mcmc was used to generate a sample of data from the posterior distribution to solve this problem the mcmc performs a random walk in parameter space by the stochastic markov process the markov process was chosen such that the probability of each parameter combination is proportional to its posterior density there are different algorithms for the markov process such as metropolis hastings gibb s sampling sequential monte carlo or differential evolution dezs speich et al 2021 the dezs process was chosen in this study as the mcmc algorithm as it is more efficient than other methods in dezs different datasets run in parallel therefore choosing an appropriate scale and orientation of the distribution is more efficient than other markov algorithms ter braak and vrugt 2008 the bayesiantools and mcmc packages in r are used for the calibration process in this study geyer and johnson 2020 hartig et al 2019 2 3 2 cross validation technique 160 observed data points were used in this study for the gs simulation 80 of the data was used to train the models and for the calibration processes while 20 was used to test the models a 10th fold cross validation was used with ten iterations the training data were randomly split into 10 folds and the model was trained by 9 folds then it was validated by the remaining 10th fold the caret package in r was used for the cross validation kuhn 2021 2 4 intrinsic water use efficiency response from gs models the intrinsic water use efficiency iwue is defined as the ratio of carbon assimilation μmol m2s an over gs eq 16 which is used to measure the adaptability of plants to changes in environmental conditions zhang et al 2019 16 i w u e a n g s the iwue has received considerable attention due to the recent increase in iwue in many ecosystems several observational keenan et al 2013 mastrotheodoros et al 2017 and theoretical knauer et al 2017 studies attributed this phenomenon to rising cs zhang et al 2019 in lsms iwue is a new index that reflects plants adaptability to changing environmental conditions blyth et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 in this study the observed an and simulated gs for the various referenced models were used to estimate iwue the response of iwue to the cs scenarios is calculated from different gs simulation models 2 5 sensitivity analysis the sobol sensitivity analysis is used to determine how much of the variability or the uncertainty of the output model depends on each of the input indices variables and parameters also it determines if these indices act singularly or if there are interactions between different indices the sobol method is a variance based uncertainty and sensitivity analysis that represents the first second and total order of variance based estimators to understand how output variance is attributed to individual indices or the interaction between indices puy et al 2021 it is a common approach to measure local sensitivity or one at a time analysis to define the model output changes in terms of one index variation when all other indices are maintained at a fixed value saltelli et al 2019 this approach does not sufficiently identify the interactions between indices the sobol method as a global sensitivity analysis fills this gap by studying the interactions of uncertain parameters on the output of the simulation model even for nonlinear systems saltelli et al 2008 the sobol method perturbs input indices based on their ranges and then defines the model output uncertainty using variance as in eq 17 puy et al 2021 saltelli et al 2008 17 v y v x i e x i y x i e x i v x i y x i where v xi e x i y x i and e xi v x i y x i are the first order effects of the x i and residual respectively e and v are the mean and variance operators y f x is a scalar output and x x 1 x 2 x k are uncertain inputs parameters x i denotes all parameters except x i v y can be decomposed to all partial variances up to the kth order as eqs 18 19 saltelli et al 2008 18 v y i 1 v i i i j v i j v 1 2 k where v i v x i e x i y x i 19 v i j v x i x j e x i j y x i x j v x i e x i y x i v x j e x j y x j the sobol indices are then calculated as eq 20 saltelli et al 2008 20 s i v i v y s i j v i j v y where s i is the first order effects of x i and s ij is the second order effect of x i x j total order index t i which is the first order effects of x i and its interactions with all other parameters can be measured by eq 21 saltelli et al 2008 21 t i 1 v x i e x i y x i v y e x i v x i y x i v y as an example for a three dimensional model the total order index of x 1 is the sum of the first second and third order effects of x 1 as in eq 22 22 t 1 s 1 s 1 2 s 1 3 s 1 2 3 the methodology used in this study has been summarised in fig 1 the input data was divided to train and test data for calibration and test of gs simulation approaches in different lsms the input data including an climate variables and calibrated parameters were defined for each gs simulation approach in lsms mcmc bayesian calibration process was performed for gs simulation in semi empirical and empirical models the calibration process requires a calibration range for each fitted parameter in semi empirical and empirical models fig s1 the 10th fold cross validation process was performed for all simulation models mgam is independent of an and mcmc bayesian calibration the differences between the various gs simulation approaches in lsms and mgam are evaluated through gs simulation iwue estimation and global sensitivity analysis 3 results 3 1 gs simulation results the calibration process for semi empirical and empirical gs simulation models has been performed with the bayesian and mcmc method table 1 the results of the gs simulation for all models were compared with the observed gs values for both the training and testing data fig 2 simulation performance was measured by assessment criteria such as correlation coefficients pearson spearman and kendall nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae fig 3 the semi empirical gs simulation approaches performed well based on all the assessment criteria for testing and training the coefficient values for pearson spearman kendall and nse for test data were 88 97 91 97 75 89 and 73 94 respectively the error values for semi empirical gs simulation models were 0 03 0 07 and 0 02 0 05 mol m2s for rmse and mae respectively the results of the empirical gs simulation models showed a lower accuracy compared to the semi empirical gs simulation models the jsbach gs eq 8 showed 82 76 59 and 66 for pearson spearman kendall and nse coefficient respectively while these values for the noah gs eq 9 were 73 71 53 and 52 respectively the jsbach gs eq 8 rmse and mae values were respectively 0 08 and 0 06 mol m2s while noah gs eq 8 error values were respectively 0 11 and 0 09 mol m2s the results of the mgam gs simulation model in correlation and efficiency coefficients were 87 85 65 and 71 for respectively pearson spearman kendall and nse coefficients in test data the error values in the mgam gs model were 0 07 and 0 06 mol m2s for respectively rmse and mae this demonstrates that the mgam gs simulation model has better results than the empirical gs simulation approaches for the test data it is worth noting that all models shown in fig 3 have been cross validated so there is no overfitting or underfitting between the training and test results the slight improvement in test data for the mgam model may result from model performance on unseen and randomly chosen test datasets or a low number of test data samples 3 2 the impact of gs on iwue the scatter plot in fig 4 confirms that elevated cs will increase the iwue as expected the iwue for all gs simulation models increased by 18 to 25 for the cs gradual rise from 390 to 540 μmol co2 mol 1 the results for the semi empirical gs simulation models of iwue for both scenarios show a better fit however for the gs values less than 0 1 mol m2s the simulated iwue was lower than the observed iwue especially for clm4 5 gs eq 1 and clm5 gs eq 2 a similar result was observed for the gs less than 0 1 mol m2s in jsbach gs eq 8 noah gs eq 9 and mgam gs eq 10 however the dispersion was mostly located in the lower part of the iwue gs curve while the upper part of the curve was more concentrated for both simulated and observed iwue expect few points for elevated cs in noah gs eq 9 3 3 sensitivity analysis of gs to control indices the variance based sensitivity analysis of gs to control indices all parameters and variables in each gs simulation approach was performed fig 5 and table 2 the first order effects of indices si which define the dominating indices in the gs uncertainty are shown in red bars in fig 5 the second sij and total order effects ti which define the effects of the interaction of two and all indices are shown in green and purple bars respectively eqs 18 19 in this part all input indices have been perturbed fig s1 and then the most effective indices which contribute to the gs variability have been ranked among different variables e g an hs s vpd ci cs tm and calibrated parameters e g a a1 a4 d0 gmin g0 g1 l m for each gs simulation equation sensitivity values lower than 0 05 were eliminated to distinguish the dominating indices better from the unimportant ones zhang et al 2015 hence the ti values in some indices were higher than the sum of si and sij all semi empirical gs simulation approaches show high sensitivities to the indices table 2 the first order effects of indices are high 75 to 94 the high value of si in semi empirical gs simulation models was attributed to calibrated parameters such as b and m in clm4 5 gs eq 1 g0 in all clm5 gs eq 2 3 4 a in jules gs eq 6 and gmin and l in lpjml gs eq 7 an also had high effects on gs variance in all semi empirical gs simulation models except lpjml gs eq 7 the gs sensitivity in semi empirical gs simulation models was significantly affected by calibrated parameters which shows the high gs uncertainty to calibrated parameters there was no effective interaction second order sensitivity between variables in these approaches the gs sensitivity in jsbach gs eq 8 was highly affected by the calibrated parameter a1 the si value was 0 86 however there was no effective interaction between indices for gs variation the gs sensitivity in noah gs eq 9 was different because gs was less sensitive to indices si 0 33 the key control indices in noah gs eq 9 were the calibrated parameter a2 and the s variable there was little interaction between vpd a2 and vpd s which was negligible the mgam gs eq 10 model was expected to have a different sensitivity of gs to input variables we have obtained the basis functions in mgam by testing all possible combinations of environmental variables and the combination with the highest simulation accuracy has been suggested in table 1 the basis functions which illustrate the influence of interactive environmental effects on gs vary based on the type of vegetation since as reported previously each type of vegetation is sensitive to the specific interactive environmental effects kimm et al 2020 yang et al 2022 as a result sensitivity analyses for different basis functions are not necessary for this type of vegetation the mgam had lower first order sensitivity si 0 33 to key climate variables such as vpd tm cs hs and s the gs variation was more sensitive to vpd and tm while other variables indirectly affected gs due to their interactions the mgam also has considerable interaction between vpd cs and vpd tm as second order sensitivity 4 discussion 4 1 semi empirical and empirical gs simulation approaches in this study the semi empirical gs simulation models appear to have high accuracy in gs simulation performance this result is not surprising because these gs equations contain the an variable which is highly correlated with gs and directs stomatal behaviour radin et al 1988 however the large uncertainties to parameterisation and the an variable simplification of tree canopy as a big leaf in semi empirical gs simulation models constrains semi empirical gs simulation models in global scale blyth et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 in contrast the empirical gs simulation models such as noah gs eq 9 and jsbach gs eq 8 have reduced the uncertainties and limitations of semi empirical gs simulation models however finding the appropriate mathematical functions regarding environmental factors and complex calibration processes affects the efficiency of empirical models in gs simulation knauer et al 2015 lhomme et al 1998 moreover applying the proper value for gsmax and anmax in noah gs eq 9 and jsbach gs eq 8 respectively are other limitations of these models as mentioned above the limitations of semi empirical and empirical gs simulation approaches call for a new method for gs simulation the mgam gs simulation model does not require the an variable and calculates gs directly from environmental variables bypassing the need for ranges of unknown fitted parameters in the mcmc bayesian calibration process gsmax and anmax values climate variables e g cs hs vpd tm and soil water content s were used to simulate gs in this new approach the mgam gs model has the following advantages it relaxes the assumptions and limitations of semi empirical gs simulation models it simulates gs independent of the an variable it can simulate gs accurately as a result there is less first order uncertainty regarding key climate variables compared to semi empirical models and more complex mathematical concepts regarding stress functions are removed from empirical models 4 2 the impact of gs on iwue the gs impact on iwue gives another viewpoint to the gs simulation model s performance in all models the iwue was enhanced when cs increased however there were some differences depending on the gs value higher or lower than 0 1 mol m2s similar results have been reported li et al 2017 mathias and thomas 2021 zhang et al 2019 suggesting iwue improvements in cs enrichments scenarios however there was no identification of the different impact of gs on iwue regarding gs values to the best of our knowledge it is the first time that the impact of gs on iwue has been evaluated based on the different values of gs the results show that most of the lsms underestimate simulated iwue for gs value less than 0 1 mol m2s however they performed better at higher gs values the underestimation of the simulated iwue for low gs values gs lower than 0 1 mol m2s was greater using jsbach gs eq 8 noah gs eq 9 and mgam gs eq 10 noah gs eq 9 has shown both overestimation and underestimation for the simulated iwue at low gs values especially for the elevated cs scenario 4 3 the importance of sensitivity analysis of gs simulation approaches the gs sensitivity analysis results presented in section 3 3 and the key controlling indices that affect gs variance were identified for each gs simulation approach the semi empirical gs simulation models showed high first order sensitivity to calibrated parameters and the an variable the sensitivity of gs to calibrated parameters which change by vegetation type makes these models computationally demanding however these models did not show any interaction between variables as second order sensitivity fig 5 jiménez et al 2011 applied an intercomparison of lsms output and highlighted the difficulties in using lsms models and the necessity of improve formulations to cope with model uncertainties jiménez et al 2011 blyth et al 2021 have suggested that lsms need improvements to represent important processes in the real world such as interactions between climate variables and vegetations blyth et al 2021 the new mgam gs simulation approach can define interaction between key climate variables effects on gs which has consistency to the real world the sensitivity analysis results in fig 5 and fig s1 for mgam gs eq 10 show that vpd and tm are key climate variables which affect gs variation in addition to the interaction between vpd tm and vpd cs the increase in vpd causes a reduction in gs values fig s1 for mgam gs eq 10 which confirms previous studies creese et al 2014 inoue et al 2021 jiao et al 2019 in higher vpd conditions the guard cells two cells that surround a stoma are vulnerable to turgor loss and close the stomata to decrease the conductance of gas diffusion and water loss via stomata inoue et al 2021 the tm variable increases gs for a small margin fig s1 the increase in gs by tm can be explained by mesophyll conductance increase which supplies more water for evaporation and increases guard cell turgor and stomata aperture urban et al 2017a when gs is increased by a high temperature the trees increase their rate of evaporative cooling to survive in hot and dry conditions urban et al 2017a since the increase in temperature enhances the vpd the interaction between vpd tm on gs is important von caemmerer and evans 2015 the global sensitivity analysis of mgam gs eq 10 shows the interaction between vpd tm fig 5 the interaction between vpd tm was shown in several studies when vpd is high the effect of temperature on gs is larger than when vpd is low purcell et al 2018 urban et al 2017a another interaction between climate variables that affect gs simulation in mgam is vpd cs interaction fig 5 many studies have shown that elevated cs cause a reduction in gs however for the higher cs values increased vpd offsets this reduction flexas et al 2004 xu et al 2016 the interaction of vpd tm and vpd cs is justified based on the literature review as shown above however the plant physiological mechanisms are complex and require continuous datasets with a higher quantity and well controlled environment that is hard to achieve urban et al 2017a 4 4 towards a robust approach in cs gs simulation the effects of cs and other climate variables interactions on gs and transpiration changes are still debated nadal sala et al 2021 the semi empirical and empirical gs simulation models have different viewpoints in reflecting cs effects on gs the jarvis equation uses a linear function to present this relationship jarvis et al 1976 wang et al 2005 produced a hyperbolic model to represent gs response to cs concentration they found that the rate of decreasing gs gradually lessened with cs increase wang et al 2005 li et al 2019 compared versions of the cs gs relationship to find the best physiological and theoretical relationship they used a combination of linear and hyperbolic equations as a modified hyperbolic model to improve the accuracy and reliability of cs gs estimation li et al 2019 this study selected the modified hyperbolic in the jarvis equation in noah gs eq 9 because it had better result than other cs gs simulation approaches table 1 and s1 it is worth noting that in several studies the understanding of the plant response to cs changes was through the assumption of keeping other variables at a fixed level massmann et al 2019 this assumption is far from the real world processes due to the interaction between the different variables the mgam gs model can reflect the combinational effects of key climate variables on gs changes although this new approach highlights the interaction of vpd cs and vpd tm in gs variation more details should be linked to vegetation growth stages however due to the absence of a comprehensive and continuous dataset for a whole year justification of the climate interactions by cs through the whole growth period of a plant was not possible therefore more studies on the mgam approach are suggested for different climates and vegetation types 5 conclusion the intercomparison of gs models and their global sensitivity analysis showed the high sensitivity and dependency of semi empirical gs simulation models to parameterisation and an this makes it difficult to extend these models to a global scale to improve gs simulation the complex climate vegetation interactions should be understood the gs simulation in empirical models considered climate variables effects on vegetation however their calibration process and complex plants stress functions make it challenging to use them in new locations with different climates the introduced approach of mgam gs captures important processes in real world soil atmosphere vegetation interactions while maintaining an appropriate level of parsimony to permit global scale simulations without requiring ranges for fitted parameters by the mcmc bayesian calibration process mgam can represent the interaction of different key climate variables in gs simulation accomplished by global sensitivity analysis this achievement improves our understanding of gs simulation from individual indices level to understanding the gs variation affected by indices interactions a robust nonlinear gs simulation with mgam gs highlights the effects of vpd cs and vpd tm interaction on gs value this new approach provides an alternative method for land surface modelling of transpiration simulation and water balance prediction further mgam testing with comprehensive data for more vegetation types at the global scale and the full plant growth stage is required credit authorship contribution statement nastaran chitsaz conceptualization methodology data curation

2004,artificial recharge in urban aquifers is of vital importance due to the increase in urbanization resulting in a reduction in natural recharge along with groundwater overdraft in many regions across the globe despite existing several managed aquifer recharge mar technologies land availability for installation and limited municipal budget restrict their usage especially in urbanized areas hence drywells were introduced as a vadose zone recharge vzr facilitating the recharge of stressed aquifers with low land impact and financial resources also identifying suitable sites for drywell implementation is complex due to the number of driving factors involved in this paper the integrated fuzzy analytical hierarchy process fahp and technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis approach was proposed to delineate a site suitability map for artificial groundwater recharge using drywells in the city of kayseri turkey nine decision criteria were selected and the weights of each sub criterion were determined through the fahp the results indicated that hydraulic conductivity depth to groundwater soil texture and land use land cover were the most determining criteria with 33 9 17 8 11 2 and 10 1 of weights respectively also the stability and robustness of the criteria weights attained were validated through sensitivity analysis within the fahp framework finally the study area was divided into 54 sub regions based on the road network and the topsis was applied to prioritize the sub regions to help identify promising areas for the vadose zone wells construction here a similar approach can be adopted by municipalities lacking guidelines and standards for sitting drywells keywords managed aquifer recharge vadose zone well fuzzy ahp topsis multi criteria decision making urban aquifer data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater is among the vital natural resources for the vast majority of the world s population and can be regarded as the only fresh water source for many societies likewise groundwater resources provide nearly 30 and 40 of the worldwide water needs of households and irrigation respectively zheng et al 2021 still groundwater resources have been encountering severe challenges over the last decades such as chemical contamination depletion anthropogenic activities and seawater intrusion lall et al 2020 in turkey 70 of the entire water demand is supplied by groundwater which makes subsurface resources of paramount importance and essential to be sustained and secured against qualitative and quantitative degradations değirmenci et al 2011a yazıcı et al 2015 it is also worth mentioning that the study region focalized on within the scope of the current research i e kayseri province exclusively relies on subsurface resources due to the inherent variations in the climatic conditions especially stemming from climate change different groundwater management strategies were proposed to mitigate the threads faced by subsurface resources ranging from pumping rates optimization water use efficiency measures and groundwater governance frameworks frija et al 2014 lall et al 2020 however mar formerly named artificial recharge bouwer 2002 is one of the rewarding alternative technologies that can not only deal with the threats jeopardizing the amount of available groundwater resources but also enhance groundwater recharge therefore mar has been applied as a mechanism to replenish stressed aquifers limit seawater intrusions scale down land subsidence and store excess water during the wet season bachtouli and comte 2019 papadopoulos et al 2022 shi et al 2016 wendt et al 2021 as well as being a sustainable urban water management technology page et al 2018 iah commission on mar 2019 defined mar as the purposeful recharge of water to aquifers for subsequent recovery or environmental benefit according to dillon et al 2019 mar implementations cover many technologies popularly applied to recover overtaxed groundwater systems bouwer 2002 also provided the simplest classification of artificial recharge systems by dividing them into three main groups i e surface infiltration vadose zone recharge vzr and direct injection where water is directly introduced to the aquifer through deep wells surface infiltration refers to methods based on the infiltration process where water is spread out in wide areas using basins dams and channels to recharge an aquifer vzr structures also named vertical infiltration systems consist of trenches and drywells i e vadose zone wells open to the atmosphere and placed in the unsaturated zone to refill an unconfined aquifer using water of impaired quality e g municipal wastewater urban stormwater runoff for recharge etc bouwer 2002 science et al 1994 the primary objective of the mar projects is to inject as much reclaimed water into the system as possible however in addition to the physical parameters the appropriate mar technology for a particular project should be determined by considering the potential benefits and drawbacks for instance one of the challenges encountered in surface infiltration techniques is that they may lead to a loss of reclaimed water through evaporation due to their storage mechanisms edwards et al 2016 also they require permeable surfaces and consequent land availability making them less suited to urbanized environments despite these drawbacks surface infiltration technologies offer the greatest capacity for attenuating contaminants as opposed to deep injection systems which cause limited attenuation of pollutants implying water treatment before recharging and thereby inevitable additional costs the vzr structures can be regarded as useful tools for urbanized areas since the vzrs can be implemented with limited land impact and in impermeable areas while providing a certain level of contaminant attenuation in the vadose zone moreover händel et al 2014 conducted numerical simulations using the hydrus 2d 3d software šejna et al 2011 and compared the recharge performances of drywells and infiltration basins when the two systems operate under conditions commonly faced in field settings as a result of their research it has been found that two small vadose zone wells have a much higher recharge rate than a basin ten meters by six meters in size händel et al 2016 further combined field recharge experiments and numerical modeling to prove the viability of drywells in styria austria recently sasidharan et al 2021 also compared the performance of drywells and infiltration basins under various subsurface heterogeneity and steady state conditions it was found that a set of five drywells has a higher infiltration rate than a circular basin of 70 m in diameter and thereby further enhancing the reputation of vzr wells despite evidence suggested by research society regarding the potential of drywells to be used in recharging shallow unconsolidated aquifers for years few municipalities have adopted this mar technology associatively the vast majority of the municipalities still remain skeptical due to the challenges regarding the contamination potential of drywells hence it is not conceivable that they remain underrated with the advantages they have to replenish overtaxed urban aquifers over other mar methods it is also worth mentioning that some of the existing literature addressed that drywells are potentially causing contamination in the groundwater while some others reported that this challenge can be tackled through proper siting and continuously improved maintenance edwards et al 2016 likewise in arizona usa scottsdale municipality has successfully recharged water of impaired quality into its aquifer using drywells for nearly 20 years in addition brian 2018 stated that there has been no report of groundwater quality issues in scottsdale related to the artificial recharge on the one hand there are several benefits regarding the implementation of the mar techniques to deal with the over extracting of groundwater resources as addressed above on the other hand one of the major challenges during the design stage of a mar project is to locate suitable sites due to the large number of factors affecting the site suitability of the mar the existing literature recognized that several tools i e geophysical methods christy and lakshmanan 2017 geographical information systems gis brown et al 2005 and the integrated remote sensing gis chowdhury et al 2010 singh et al 2013 have been developed to overcome the corresponding complexities in addition given that the multi criteria decision analysis mcda methods warrant rewarding approaches in solving multi tiered decision making processes ekmekcioğlu et al 2021a koc et al 2021 these techniques have become one of the widely applied tools to identify the sites suitable for the mar applications sallwey et al 2019a tsangaratos et al 2017 in a similar vein gis based mcda frameworks offer comprehensive solution schemes for the analysis of mar projects with the less computational burden rahman et al 2012 although the pertinent literature covers extensive efforts that were devoted to the mcda methodologies for exploring some variants of the mar techniques such as surface infiltration ahmadi et al 2017 bonilla valverde et al 2016 tsangaratos et al 2017 and direct injection ahani amineh et al 2017 owusu et al 2017 little attention has paid concerning the vzr systems notably drywells in addition despite the analytical and numerical approaches presented to deal with drywells chahar et al 2012 edwards et al 2022 glass et al 2020 justino et al 2021 liang et al 2018 sasidharan et al 2019 the scholars mainly focalized on the infiltration performances clogging and groundwater quality that of these approaches are not able to delineate suitable sites for mar implementations the major novelties and corresponding contributions to the body of knowledge are as follows this research represents the initial attempt in investigating the site suitability of drywells through an integrated gis mcda technique most influencing factors for sitting drywells were spotted based on diligent investigation of peer reviewed studies guidelines and standards referring to the mar technology this study further explored the role of stormwater drainage network density and buffer distance from public wells which are overlooked in the pertinent literature on the site suitability assessments of drywells a focus group discussion involving experts from divergent backgrounds was conducted to standardize thematic layers for the first time and fahp was applied to determine the significance level of each decision criterion the profiles and the level of consistency of those experts were made accessible such that relevant literature lacks detail background of the experts which highly influences the robustness of the mar suitability mapping studies the validity of the attained criteria weights was evaluated based on comparing them with the weights those of previously found in other mar suitability mapping attempts that exist in the pertinent literature in addition a sensitivity analysis was performed with respect to different fuzziness degrees in order to highlight the stability and robustness of the findings the topsis was applied to determine the suitability index of alternatives i e sub regions and to generate the final drywells suitability map within the scope of the current research the city of kayseri turkey was selected as a case study to reveal the applicability of the proposed gis based hybrid mcda framework it is believed that the major outcomes of this research can effectively be used by scholars water resources authorities and governmental bodies to investigate the site suitability of drywells 2 review of recent gis mcda based mar opportunities mapping to meet the groundwater resources induced challenges several mar tools have been developed by the research society stefan and ansems 2018 established a mar inventory portal http marportal un igrac org by compiling and interpreting a total of 1200 mar case studies from 63 countries in this vein one can access the relevant information including site name location the operation year mar type influent water source used for recharge and the reference of each project through the corresponding portal the inowas research group also developed a different database https inowas com tools t04 database for gis mcda regarding the gis based mar suitability mapping studies where details on mar type water source criteria and decision rule method considered in each study can be retrieved sallwey et al 2019b yet these databases are not constantly updated and contain limited knowledge regarding the most recent gis mcda based mar suitability mapping studies thus the current research introduces a review of the recent attempts regarding the utilization of state of the art technologies in mar opportunities mapping table 1 here water table decline and water scarcity are the principal reason for artificial recharge requirement in the vast majority of the existing studies fuentes and vervoort 2020 hussaini et al 2021 kamangar et al 2019 kharazi et al 2019 papadopoulos et al 2022 tahvili et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 for instance aju et al 2021 conducted an integrated gis mcda approach and investigated the sites suitable to implement mar structures for recharging the groundwater in the vamanapuram river basin vrb south india that fall in the semi critical category in terms of water scarcity and water table decline along with these efforts mar based mapping studies further addressed other problems and or reasons such as salinization kazakis 2018 fluoride contamination arshad et al 2022 groundwater sustainability phankamolsil et al 2022 and emergency scenario soliman et al 2022 during the site screening process infeasible areas are excluded from the focalized regions and hence criteria such as slope land use land cover geology and distance from residential area are among the widely adopted constraints in identifying suitable sites for the mar implementation furthermore the criteria selected and decision rules applied for the suitability mapping phase show a significant diversity even though the considered mar type is the same in line russo et al 2015 highlighted that there is a lack of standard criteria set in mar suitability mapping for instance tahvili et al 2021 and chowdhury paul 2021 both investigated sites favorable for rainwater harvesting on the one hand tahvili et al 2021 found water quality groundwater drops percentage of vegetation average of annual rainfall soil depth soil permeability soil texture and electrical conductivity of soil were among the most effective criteria for rainwater harvesting site delineation on the other hand runoff soil slope lineament density drainage density land use landcover distance from road and distance from river were the most driving factors in mar suitability assessments concerning the study conducted by chowdhury paul 2021 yet data availability and accessibility as well as the definition of the problem play a determinant role in the identification of the criteria set used in mar studies bonilla valverde 2018 rahman et al 2012 in another respect sallwey et al 2019a reviewed the gis based mar studies available in the inowas database and revealed that weighted linear combination wlc ahp fuzzy logic fl decision tree and promethee are the commonly applied techniques to locate the sites favorable for the mar projects however in recent years other mcda tools such as fahp anp topsis edas and saw were also employed in the mar opportunities mapping as shown in table 1 for instance kamangar et al 2019 used anp and ahp for criteria weight assignment and topsis method to overlay thematic layers while kharazi et al 2019 applied different mcda methods such as ahp topsis and edas for prioritizing the sites suitable for underground dams in the semnan plain iran furthermore hussaini et al 2021 generated different mar suitability maps based on three techniques i e fl ahp and anp they found that the anp based map was more accurate and reliable compared to the maps generated through its counterparts this result can inherently be associated with the fact that the ahp method disregards the interrelationship among criteria while the anp method takes the interrelationships into account during the construction of hierarchical representations ekmekcioğlu et al 2022 in addition further attempts incorporated the fuzzy set theory introduced by zadeh zadeh 1965 to minimize the uncertainties that exist in the complex decision making mechanisms such that chowdhury and paul 2021 delineated suitable sites for rainwater harvesting structures i e ponds and pans percolation tank check dam and nala bunds by the fahp technique for criteria weight assessments and fuzzy gamma operator for combining the involved parameters similarly papadopoulos et al 2022 applied the fahp and fis for the assignment of the weights considered and the delineation of the sites auspicious for infiltration basins respectively some countries have notable histories in artificial groundwater recharge investigations based on the number of studies published and the availability of national guidelines on mar applications for instance nearly half of the existing studies regarding the mar application were conducted in india and iran sallwey et al 2019a hence once can argue that the mar implementation still represents a novice topic in some other parts of the world apaydin 2022 e g turkey which is the focalized region in the current research accordingly the only attempt at mar assessment in turkey was performed by sayit and yazicigil 2012 for the kucuk menderes river basin located in the western part of the country they performed numerical analysis under different scenarios to examine the effect of artificial recharge on the water table and groundwater storage in the present study suitable sites for vzr systems were investigated using gis mcda techniques for the first time for a pilot region located in turkey here the city of kayseri was selected as a case study due to the current situation of the shallow aquifers that need to be assessed in terms of the applicability of the artificial recharge technique 3 study area kayseri is among the most populated cities in turkey with more than one million residents and is located in central anatolia the study zone covers 218 53 km2 in total within the boundaries of kayseri province including the districts of melikgazi in large part and kocasinan small part in the north fig 1 the climate of the city reflects the cold semi arid climatic characteristics with nearly a hundred rainy days over a year and an average snow day of 36 turkish state meteorology service 2022 in addition the highest temperature reaches 38 c on hot days especially during july and august while the lowest temperatures are observed between 6 c and 2 c in winter değirmenci et al 2008 the lithology of the study area is predominated by alluvium deposits and pyroclastic rocks however units such as basalt andesite sandstone and agglomerate also exist the kayseri plain contains two aquifer systems that are separated by an impermeable or semi permeable layer mainly andesite and basalt as snowfall falls on the higher elevations of erciyes mountain 3917 m located in the vicinity of the focused region it recharges the lower pressurized volcanic aquifer which is the main aquifer whereas rainfall in the plain contributes negligibly it is estimated that groundwater flows from the south and southeast to the north and northwest of the region with a velocity of 15 20 cm day değirmenci et al 2011a moreover on top of it there is a shallow alluvial aquifer with a much lower yield due to its thickness and extension which constitutes a secondary aquifer yazıcı et al 2015 direct infiltration from precipitation in the plain mainly recharges this unconfined aquifer overall the hydraulic conductivity values measured in the alluvial aquifer in the study area vary between 1 1 10 5 and 6 4 10 4 m s the water demand of the city is majorly contingent upon the groundwater sources the records attained in 2010 illustrated that the municipality supply nearly 60 billion m3 of water for domestic purposes annually değirmenci et al 2011b and recent evidence addresses the unavertable increase in water consumption over the last decade the huge amount of the water demand is satisfied by the pressurized lower aquifer that has a consequent yield with water of high quality nuray ates et al 2021 and from a spring with a discharge of 300 l s değirmenci et al 2011a urbanization on the plain considerably downscales the natural recharge of the upper aquifer and rough usage of groundwater resources for irrigation purposes currently causing a decline in the water table therefore current conditions point out that more water is expected to be abstracted from the lower aquifer to meet irrigation demand if the shallow aquifer is depleted in the future a scenario that could lead to irreversible outcomes 4 materials and methods the present research contains a step wise approach to delineate and prioritize the sub regions in kayseri including 1 retrieving essential criteria that affect mar site suitability 2 assessment of the importance of the refined criteria list based on the fahp approach and 3 the identification of the suitable areas in accordance with the topsis technique fig 2 in the first step the relevant criteria were identified by means of the literature survey encompassing both the research articles and the reports accordingly 9 relevant criteria were selected to pin down sites favorable for vzr drywells this step also includes generating raster layers to be used in the suitability analysis all the gis applications were performed with open source qgis software qgis development team 2022 after gis based processing thematic layers were standardized and the ranking of the layers was attained as a result of the focus group discussion fgd session involving experts from divergent backgrounds the second phase of the process consists of conducting the ahp surveys a 9 by 9 questionnaire was performed with each expert and the consistencies of the experts were checked it is important to note that the experts failing to meet the consistency threshold i e less than 10 were repeated two rounds at maximum until ensuring an acceptable consistency ratio cr the third step covers determining the clusters and criteria weights using chang s extend analysis within the fahp method by replacing the crisp scales given by experts in the ahp survey with their equivalent triangular fuzzy numbers tfn along with the topsis implementation for prioritizing the alternative sites suitable for drywells in the kayseri plain 4 1 data source and derived spatial layers 4 1 1 data source the selection of relevant criteria for the drywell site suitability analysis was performed based on peer reviewed studies edwards et al 2016 and national guidelines geosyntec consultants 2020 portland gov 2016 us environmental protection agency 1999 that dealt with the mar technology table 2 presents a brief summary of the thematic layers utilized for the mapping purpose including the sources corresponding datasets format of the data and their references as can be seen from the table that the data regarding the slope criterion was obtained from the copernicus global digital surface model copernicus dsm glo by using opentopography dem downloader plugin in qgis european space agency 2021 among a variety of dems in raster format the copernicus dsm glo with 30 m 30 m resolution was selected in addition corine land cover clc dataset büttner et al 2017 was retrieved with a resolution of 100 m 100 m from the copernicus land monitoring service website geology data of kayseri province were provided by kaski in vector format along with other raw data such as public wells coordinates and the corresponding ground water levels lithology was obtained from the kaski in terms of the geology vector layer and converted into the raster format meanwhile the groundwater level vectors were subjected to the inverse distance weighted idw method for deriving the depth to ground water raster layer the information regarding the public wells coordinates was used to generate the buffer distances from public wells map similarly a buffer distance from main roads bdmr thematic layer was derived from openstreetmap osm by means of both the osm downloader and multi ring buffer plugins exist in qgis for the extraction of the roads and buffer generation respectively in addition kaski provided the drainage network of the city in cad drawing format based on this data nearly 90 of the drainage system of the city consists of a combined stormwater wastewater system while only 10 serves exclusively for draining surface runoff in addition değirmenci et al 2011a used a drastic model to delineate the groundwater protection zones and they further focused on the groundwater contamination assessment of the kayseri basin here the drastic model requires seven hydrogeological layers as input namely depth to groundwater table d net recharge r aquifer media a soil media s topography t impact of vadose zone i and hydraulic conductivity c shirazi et al 2012 hence this study acquired the soil texture and hydraulic conductivity maps from the report prepared by değirmenci et al 2011a and digitized them using the qgis software 4 1 2 descriptions of the utilized layers the current research included three different factors impacting the assessment of site suitability of drywells in each of three main clusters i e surface economy protection and aquifer thus slope land use land cover and soil texture criteria were considered within the surface cluster fig 4 also stormwater drainage network density buffer distance from public wells and buffer distance from main roads were taken into account within the economy protection cluster while depth to groundwater lithology and hydraulic conductivity were used in assessing the aquifer cluster below brief descriptions of each criterion as well as their relations with the mar site suitability are provided a slope is one of the most widely used decision criteria in gis mcda based mar studies the reason for the common adoption of the slope criterion is not only related to the availability and free access of a large number of dem data with lower resolution in recent years but also it controls the convergence and divergence of water which is affiliated with the infiltration capacity ahmadi et al 2017 ekmekcioğlu and koc 2022 in this regard mild slopes have higher infiltration rates compared to steep slopes chowdhury et al 2010 in addition well clogging due to the suspended sediments existing in the stormwater is one of the major concerns in drywells projects and is encountered by soil erosions that occur in regions having higher slopes b land use land cover contributes to the accurate prediction of the contaminant types in urban zones surrounding drywells sites and their effects on the aquifers edwards et al 2016 there are a number of studies illustrating the impact of land use on stormwater runoff in terms of pollutant discharges arbswrp 2018 us environmental protection agency 1999 different types of pollutants can be found in different land use classes for instance commercial and industrial areas are known to contain pollutants such as heavy metals bacteria oil and grease semi volatile organic compounds svocs volatile organic compounds vocs and total dissolved solids tds the major contaminants detected in stormwater samples collected from residential areas are bacteria heavy metals oil and grease and tds arbswrp 2018 this study categorized the lulc criterion into five classes i e 1 forest and seminatural areas 2 arable lands permanent crops pastures and heterogenous agricultural areas 3 urban fabric green urban areas sports and leisure facilities 4 industrial commercial and transport units 5 mine dump and construction sites fig 3 b c soil texture is another widely included factor in mar suitability assessments and is closely related to the ability of the soil to infiltrate large volumes of surface water into the sub surface arshad et al 2022 tahvili et al 2021 sites having coarse grained e g sand materials have high infiltration capacity with a relatively lower potential to attenuate contaminants in contrast soils containing higher clay yield promising performance in contaminant filtering whereas they have poor infiltration performance therefore great attention needs to be paid to account for the soil texture factor and providing a balance between infiltration performance and contaminants filtration ability of the vadose zone is essential for sitting drywells the soil texture map of the study area is available in fig 3c d stormwater drainage network density could have a significant impact on the site selection since the stormwater is generally regarded as the main water source in drywell projects hence the closer the installation of the drywells to the existing infrastructure the lower the need for financial resources in recharging the systems from the stormwater drainage networks some scholars indeed considered similar parameters by including in their model the distance between water supply sources and mar site but they generally refer to the distance to waste treatment plants ahmadi et al 2017 brown et al 2005 gdoura et al 2015 kallali et al 2007 tsangaratos et al 2017 in this context a density map of the stormwater drainage network of the city was generated and reclassified into five classes in the present work fig 3d e buffer distance from public wells was included in the proposed framework as the theories on the origin of the drywells highlight that vadose zone wells need to be away from pubic wells at a certain distance in order to provide a sufficient time of travel geosyntec consultants 2020 to exemplify there is a mandatory separation distance between drywells and public supply wells in the united states where the applications of drywells are widely embraced however it is especially worth mentioning that the corresponding threshold distance may vary according to the states mandates lock et al 2017 such that satisfying a horizontal distance of 60 m away from drinking wells at minimum in illinois while providing at least 150 m is essential in oregon the generated map regarding buffer distance from public wells criterion is provided in fig 3e f buffer distance from main roads is among the significant drivers of the mar implementations especially considering the stormwater runoff contamination due to the applied sodium chloride i e salt on roads and highways as a de icing agent existing body knowledge recognized that the corresponding practice results in considerable harm to the surrounding environment notably to surface and subsurface resources by contaminating the aquifer and surface water resources snodgrass et al 2017 in addition to the salt application von gunten et al 2020 reported that heavy metals penetrating from asphalt concrete that was found near roads and highways could have a detrimental impact on groundwater and nearby soil therefore a multi buffer distance from main roads spatial layer was generated for the focalized region fig 3f g depth to groundwater is regarded as another crucial factor in drywells applications as suggested by many state guidelines and standards in the u s typically drywells are designed to be 1 2 m diameter wells ending before reaching the water table hence similar to the horizontal distances mentioned in the earlier factors a vertical separation distance between the bottom of the drywell and the seasonal high water table is essential in constituting effective mar techniques the need for the corresponding vertical distance comes from the fact that the system benefits from the vadose zone as a contaminant attenuation mechanism in reducing the risk of pollution here the geologic conditions of the regions drive the required vertical distance and hence likewise the buffer distance from the public wells different threshold values were determined by divergent states of the u s lock et al 2017 the minimum vertical distance that is required to be satisfied across the u s is determined to be between 3 and 8 m based on the american river basin stormwater resource plan 2018 however for instance in some regions e g riverside county los angeles county arizona etc the mandatory vertical distance between the drywell bottom and the water table is specified as 3 m adeq 2018 cities and county of riverside 2012 county of los angeles 2009 the map produced for depth to groundwater criterion in the studied region is provided in fig 3g h lithology describes the physical characteristics of the rock that composes the geological formation as well as it is mineral content grain size and packing freeze and cherry 1979 the movement and occurrence of groundwater are closely related to the rock type of the region selvam et al 2016 selvarani et al 2017 thus having detailed information on the geological formations of the region is of utmost importance for attaining maximum benefit from artificial recharge the lithology map of the study area was obtained from the geology dataset of kayseri province here the plain is mostly dominated by alluvium deposits and pyroclastic rocks covering 54 and 20 of the study region respectively in addition north and north west cover the sandstone formation while volcanic rocks such as ignimbrite andesite and basalt accounting for 21 of the total formation are also available in the focalized region fig 3h i hydraulic conductivity is among the most important physical parameters of the aquifers and vital components in assessing mar projects the reason for it can be explained by the fact that some physical properties such as the transmissivity hydraulic conductivity and storage coefficient can be used to assess the volume of water that could be injected into the groundwater system ahani amineh et al 2017 addressed that aquifer characteristics are relevant indicators to estimate the capacity of the system to not only store but also recover the water therefore in the current research the hydraulic conductivity of the shallow aquifer obtained from değirmenci et al 2011 was incorporated into the criteria set and reclassified into five classes fig 3i 4 2 standardization this study assessed a total of 9 factors having different natures of data such as categorical i e land use land cover soil texture and lithology and numerical i e slope stormwater drainage network density buffer distance from public wells buffer distance from main roads depth to groundwater and hydraulic conductivity in the literature there are different methods including fuzzy membership ahp method linear and step functions that have been applied to adjust the decision criteria classes in a similar scale fuentes and vervoort 2020 kamangar et al 2019 papadopoulos et al 2022 rahman et al 2012 however this study adopted the standardization method in order to reduce the complexity of the analysis rather focus group discussions fgd involving all respondents having divergent expertise were performed which is the initial attempt in the mar related literature also cells having a higher potential for drywells success were assigned a scale of 5 while unsuitable ones received a ranking factor of 1 it is especially noteworthy to mention that the fgd methodology is one of the widely adopted qualitative assessment techniques grounded on the extracting of an expert group s decision that reflects the overall understanding of the participants rather than statistically selected representative samples pertaining to a broader population in the fgd respondents are purposively determined and encouraged to communicate with each other for concluding a decision that combines the specific knowledge of the experts resulting in collective views on the topic of interest in the present study the refined list of the sub criteria and their corresponding sub classes as well as their rating factors were determined based on the collective decisions of the fgd participants table 6 4 3 fuzzy analytic hierarchy process fahp the analytical hierarchy process ahp is a traditional multi criteria decision making method that was initially developed by saaty 1977 the ahp mainly provides the hierarchical representation of the challenging tasks based on the judgments of the experts the method further enables users to perform quantitative and qualitative assessments of the specified problems including criteria weighting and alternative prioritization besides the advantages of the ahp method some literature addressed that their limited capacity to reflect the inherent ambiguity of a human s decision making process is the soft spot of the ahp method therefore several techniques have been developed and incorporated into the traditional ahp to overcome this issue by taking the fuzzification of the experts decisions into account thus chang s 1996 extent analysis was pioneered based on the fuzzy set theory of zadeh 1965 in order for coping with the complex nature of the environment the fuzzy ahp framework implemented in the current research covers a set of steps as follows step 1 data collection linguistic variables based on a typical 1 9 likert scale were used to perform a pairwise comparison among decision criteria within the data collection step a questionnaire was introduced to experts and they were asked to evaluate the criteria covering three main clusters i e surface economy protection and aquifer each having three criteria following the acquirment of necessary information from the expert group table 3 triangular fuzzy ahp rationale was applied to the decisions of the respondents fig 4 although some other techniques e g interval fahp trapezoidal fahp etc have been introduced in the pertinent literature for fuzzifying the decision variables this study adopted triangular fahp due to its commonly applied feature and practicality in addition triangular fahp ensures the most likely smallest possible and largest possible variants of the respondents judgments accordingly reciprocals of linguistic variables related to the degree of importance of each criterion were incorporated into the participants judgments table 4 here l ij m ij and u ij denote the lower mean and upper width of the pairwise judgments of the participants attended the fahp survey for criterion i compared to the criterion j respectively step 2 consistency check the ahp analysis not only enables the evaluation of the respondents decisions but also provides the assessment of the consistency of the respondents by means of the consistency ratio cr cr value calculated for each decision matrix indicates the reliability of the decision making mechanism of the experts here 0 1 is the threshold value for cr and correspondingly attained values higher than the threshold indicate that the experts judgments are inconsistent to accomplish the computation of the cr consistency index ci and random index ri are used eq 1 and eq 2 refer to the process for identifying ci and cr respectively 1 ci λ max n n 1 2 cr ci ri in eq 1 which λ max is the maximum eigenvalue of a matrix and n is the number of criteria in the corresponding matrix to specify the ri value table 5 which was introduced by saaty saaty 2004 is used step 3 attaining the preference of group decisions the fuzzy equivalents of each linguistic variable are determined in this step thus eq 3 represents the way to compute the lower l ijk mean m ijk and upper u ijk width of the fuzzy equivalents based on the triangular membership function 3 l ij k 1 k l ijk 1 k m ij k 1 k m ijk 1 k u ij k 1 k u ijk 1 k where k denotes each expert while k refers to the total number of experts step 4 chang s extent analysis chang s extent analysis suggests considering each object to employ extent analysis for specific goals hence fuzzy quantities are attained via crisp mathematical notations in chang s extent analysis x x 1 x 2 x 3 x n is a set of objects and u u 1 u 2 u 3 u m is a set of goals the value of the fuzzy synthetic extent based on the object i is computed through eq 4 4 s i j 1 m m gi j j 1 n j 1 m m gi j 1 where m gi j denotes the triangular fuzzy numbers in addition the possibility degree is computed with the fuzzy synthetic extent value where m 1 l 1 m 1 u 1 and m 2 l 2 m 2 u 2 are two triangular fuzzy numbers the possibility degree of m 2 l 2 m 2 u 2 m 1 l 1 m 1 u 1 is defined by eq 5 5 v m 2 m 1 h t g m 1 m 2 1 if m 2 m 1 0 if l 1 u 2 l 1 u 2 m 2 u 2 m 1 l 1 otherwise following the calculation of the possibility degree for convex fuzzy numbers the weight vector is computed and the normalized weight vectors w indicating the finalized decisions of the respondents are identified 6 w d a 1 d a 2 d a n t step 5 sensitivity analysis this step is regarded as essential to empower the decisions regarding the importance degrees of the criteria considered ekmekcioğlu et al 2021b hence a sensitivity analysis was performed with respect to the different degree of fuzziness values to inspect the variations in criteria importance the initial value of the degree of fuzziness in the adopted fahp method was 1 as the distance between l m and u values table 4 whereas five additional fuzziness degrees i e 1 2 1 4 1 6 1 8 and 2 0 were also explored in the current research thus one can conclude that if the importance order does not change significantly the outcome of the decision analysis framework is reliable and insensitive to the changes in fuzziness degrees ishizaka and labib 2011 4 4 technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis hwang and yoon hwang and yoon 1981 initially proposed the topsis algorithm to deal with mcdm related problems grounded on alternative prioritization within the topsis method the best alternative is determined according to the distance to positive and negative ideal solutions where the shortest geometric distance to the positive ideal solution pis and longest geometric distance to the negative ideal solution nis make an alternative appropriate compared to its counterparts as the scenario covering the shortest distance to pis and longest distance to nis maximizes and minimizes the benefit and cost criteria respectively in a typical topsis application a number of six steps are embraced in the first step the evaluation matrix a ij mn is formed based on a set of alternatives m and criteria n as expressed in eq 7 7 a ij a 11 a 12 a 1 n a 21 a 22 a 2 n a m 1 a m 2 a mn where a ij is the importance of alternative i with respect to criteria j in the second step the normalization of the evaluation matrix is performed for each criterion individually by eq 8 8 r ij a ij k 1 m a kj 2 in the third step the weighted normalized matrix v is computed by integrating the normalized criteria weights of the sub criteria and their corresponding values 9 v v ij m n w j r ij m n in which w j is the weight of criterion j in the fourth step pis and nis also can be reformulated as a and a respectively are determined through eqs 10 and 11 10 a max i v ij j j min i v ij j j v 1 v 2 v n 11 a min i v ij j j max i v ij j j v 1 v 2 v n in the fifth step each alternative s distance to pis d i and nis d i are computed 12 d i j 1 n v ij v j 2 13 d i j 1 n v ij v j 2 in the sixth step the closeness coefficients cc i ensuring the final prioritization of alternatives are calculated 14 cc i d i d i d i it is worth mentioning that cc i values vary between 0 and 1 in which the higher the cc i value the more appropriate the alternative 5 results the primary purpose of the current study is to identify suitable zones for drywell implementations in the city of kayseri to accomplish the overarching aim of this research thematic layers of 9 parameters influencing the vadose zone wells were derived then the corresponding layers were standardized as a result of the fgd sessions and the significance of each decision criterion was determined via the fahp method based on the pairwise comparison questionnaire involving ten respondents lastly topsis was applied for computing the overall suitability index of each alternative and a total of 54 sub regions were prioritized according to the closeness coefficient values 5 1 decision criteria weighting analysis in gis mcda models one of the most challenging tasks is to refine the list of influential criteria and to determine the importance of each decision variable as these techniques highly depend on experts judgments thus the consistency of each respondent for each pairwise matrix was determined via the cr values at first table 6 in order to ensure the stability and legitimacy of the attained outcomes table 6 highlights that all the experts involved in the ahp questionnaire were consistent as the cr values are under the threshold value of 10 in addition table 7 is presented to illustrate the results of the fahp analysis containing the significance level of each criteria for the site suitability mapping task the findings indicate that the aquifer was assigned as the most determining cluster with a weight of 0 578 followed by the surface and economy protection clusters having weights of 0 289 and 0 133 respectively among the aquifer cluster hydraulic conductivity had the highest importance 0 586 in terms of local weight which also outperformed all other criteria with a global weight of 0 339 table 7 in addition table 7 quite reveals that the depth to groundwater was the second most important criterion among both the aquifer cluster and all criteria set with local and global weights of 0 309 and 0 178 respectively the acquired outcomes further highlighted the role of soil texture 0 112 and lulc 0 101 criteria that were placed in the 3rd and 4th order of importance within the overall assessments what is striking about the results is that despite the weight of the aquifer cluster being considerably higher than the other two clusters the lithology criterion has one of the lowest weights 0 061 according to the overall comparison scheme this result underlines the limited contribution of lithological variations in the site suitability analysis of the mar implementations accordingly buffer distance from main roads and stormwater drainage network density were the least two effective criteria receiving the lowest global weights of 0 018 and 0 037 respectively for drywell sitting table 7 this study further examined the sensitivities of the employed criteria to the fuzzy degrees in order for underpinning the stability and robustness of the fahp decision framework and its corresponding outcomes for this reason different fuzziness degrees namely 1 2 1 4 1 6 1 8 and 2 0 were taken into account and the alterations in the criteria weights were deduced the same fahp procedures were performed by considering the additional fuzziness degrees in which fig 5 exhibits the change in criteria weights based on the employed degree of fuzziness values fig 5 quite reveals that the proposed fahp scheme yielded stable results as no change was observed in the rankings of decision criteria 5 2 identification of zones auspicious for drywells the site suitability assessments were performed through partitioning the study area into smaller areas accounting for a total of 54 sub regions based on the main roads network of the city to accomplish this aim the topsis algorithm was used and the alternative distances from positive and negative ideal solutions were calculated for surface economy protection aquifer and overall clusters separately the closeness coefficient values and the corresponding ranks of regions regarding site suitability were also determined table 8 based on the jenks natural break method closeness coefficients were classified into five classes i e very high high moderate low and very low the results were then mapped for the different criteria group fig 6 as well as the overall suitability fig 7 the hybrid fahp topsis analysis suggests that regions suitable for drywells implementation vary according to different clusters for instance depending on surface criteria regions located in the southern southwestern sub regions 27 32 33 and 53 and northeastern sub regions 6 20 51 and 54 part of the study area fig 6a have high and very high suitability for artificial recharge through drywells this could not only be explained by the presence of sand and silt loam soil texture classes but also by the availability of nearly flat terrain and the absence of the least ranked lulc classes such as industrial commercial and transport units in the corresponding regions however the northern and northeastern sub regions 2 4 6 18 20 51 and 54 areas of the city have moderate suitability with regard to criteria pertaining to the economy protection cluster i e sdnd bdpw and bdmr fig 6b and this could be linked to the inexistence or presence of low stormwater drainage network in those sub regions additionally regions in the center sub regions 10 12 27 28 29 30 31 36 37 44 and 49 received low closeness coefficient values and were deemed less suitable related to the existence of the dense road networks that could lead to groundwater pollution and the limited runoff drainage networks it is also especially noteworthy to mention that drainage networks are currently available in those regions since they are mostly located in the city center however these regions have combined wastewater stormwater drainage systems which makes suitability assessments challenging hence evidence suggests that treatment would be required if water drained from such systems is used for recharge and draining water from combined sewers lead to a significant amount of costs causing prejudice to the economically friendly reputation of drywells portland gov 2016 contrary to the abovementioned clusters the most favorable regions are concentrated in the city center sub regions 3 10 11 12 23 24 28 29 44 and 49 in terms of the aquifer criteria group fig 6c the relatively higher closeness coefficient values can be explained by the existence of high hydraulic conductivity porous media and deep water table level in the corresponding zones in addition to the cluster specific analysis fig 7 is provided to illustrate the overall suitability containing the integrated assessment of the overall criteria according to the final results sub regions 6 21 47 3 and 49 were found as the five most suitable zones that were classified as very high suitability to the artificial recharge through the drywells strong evidence can further be seen regarding the moderately suitable sub regions that are mostly located in the northwestern and central parts of the study area on the other hand the least ranked and consequently very low suitability regions for drywell construction are located in the southwestern sub regions 27 33 and 32 and southeastern sub regions 41 and 39 of the area studied the reason behind their low rank based on the overall assessment is that the corresponding sub regions reflect considerably low values in the aquifer cluster that was found as the most influential cluster according to the fahp analysis to exemplify sub region 33 ranked at 6th 15th 49th and 49th according to the surface economy protection aquifer and overall criteria group respectively nevertheless this conclusion does not imply that the two other clusters are trivial compared to the aquifer cluster such that sub regions 6 and 20 had relatively high rankings with regard to the overall evaluations despite they had considerably low rankings in terms of the aquifer cluster 6 discussions 6 1 assessment of the criteria weights the importance level of criteria in suitability mapping with regard to mar implementations is closely related to the mar technology considered and the type of the aquifer i e confined or unconfined sallwey et al 2019a therefore on the one hand where deep injection dis structures i e aquifer storage and recovery are considered for mar to recharge a confined aquifer subsurface criteria or aquifer related parameters are favored in weight assessments on the other hand in studies dealing with surface infiltration sis techniques e g surface spreading in channel modification etc surface criteria acquire much importance compared to their counterparts in this regard we compared the weights obtained from the fahp method with the weights applied in the sis fig 8 a and dis fig 8b literature groups even though some of the criteria adopted in this paper show rareness in the existing literature they were compared to the weights assigned to similar parameters in order to ensure a fair and comprehensive datum line for instance although the stormwater drainage network density was reported in none of the mar suitability mapping studies it reflects similarity to some other criteria such as distance to wastewater treatment plant distance from hydrographic network and source water availability anane et al 2008 lahaye et al 2021 papadopoulos et al 2022 rahman et al 2013 tsangaratos et al 2017 hence they were re grouped under the umbrella of proximity to water sources for comparison purposes fig 8 and the same approach was embraced for other criteria such as the buffer distance from main road chezgi et al 2016 kazakis 2018 and hydraulic conductivity gibson and campana 2018 nasiri et al 2013 rahimi et al 2014 singh et al 2013 being under road network density and transmissivity hydraulic conductivity umbrellas respectively concerning the sis literature group the slope is one of the most utilized criteria in the existing studies and has weights with an interquartile range of iqr of 11 6 and a median of 12 8 fig 8a in addition a considerable amount of studies in the sis group also used land use land cover and soil texture here the weights assigned to those two criteria in our study significantly coincide with the median of the respective sets what is further important regarding the comparisons that the road network density criterion has the lowest iqr representing the being least considered criteria based on the existing literature and accordingly it had the lowest weight according to our results however a significant difference can be observed regarding the hydraulic conductivity criterion as the weight computed for this factor in our assessments is the largest even compared to the study that gave the highest importance to hydraulic conductivity this can be explained by the fact that some authors have assigned significantly greater values to the weights of other criteria mahmoud et al 2014 for instance assigned an influence of 42 6 to the soil texture criterion while the median in that set is 13 1 likewise bonilla valverde et al 2016 allocated an importance level of 43 0 to the geology factor and thus gets the title of the study having the highest weighted criterion in the considered literature based on the studies regarding the dis literature group the slope is used in two third of the reported literature in that group however it dropped to the second place surpassing the proximity to water sources criterion depth to groundwater was among the least used criterion for sis studies with only 3 applications over 17 studies but in the dis five of the reported nine studies took the corresponding criterion into account fig 8b similar to the sis group the weight assigned to the hydraulic conductivity in our study represents the highest value for the dis set nevertheless tsangaratos et al 2017 assigned much larger weights than the hydraulic conductivity to the depth to groundwater and lithology criteria by giving them an equal weight of 39 8 furthermore the weights obtained for land use land cover soil texture and depth to groundwater criteria based on our study match with the median of the respective set which illustrates that most of the outcomes of the current research accord with the earlier observations performed in the literature overall the major outcomes of the present research strongly corroborate the findings introduced in the pertinent literature although some distinctions can be observed one should take the variability of the working principles of the adopted methodologies and the considered criteria into account in site suitability assessments it is also worth noting that the characteristics of the focalized regions the objectives of the study and the fact that the mcdm methods heavily rely on the subjective judgments of the experts may lead to variations in the importance levels of the criteria within the relevant literature 6 2 assessment of the proposed framework and implications for future attempts in the past decade a considerable number of studies successfully applied a combined gis mcda approach to delineate sites suitable for mar structures anane et al 2008 chezgi et al 2016 kazakis 2018 nasiri et al 2013 rajasekhar et al 2021 sargaonkar et al 2011 however the mar technologies mostly assessed in those studies could have limited application in highly urbanized environments since they require consequent land availability e g surface spreading for implementations or are not economically friendly to municipal budgets e g deep injections in terms of initial operation and maintenance costs arbswrp 2018 händel et al 2016 sasidharan et al 2018 in this paper we therefore proposed a hybrid mcda framework to delineate sites suitable to construct drywells which are recently considered one of the most reliable mar technologies to address shallow urban aquifers but underrated by the non existence of guidelines and standards to identify proper sites for their installation in most countries existing research recognizes the fact that there is a burden in identifying relevant criteria especially when dealing with mcda problems the corresponding concern is also a challenge in mar suitability assessments where the parameters selected are heavily influenced by the technology being used by conducting a thorough literature review the most dominant criteria for sitting drywells were identified in this study for the first time and each was described another major concern also lies in selecting the right experts to participate in the pairwise comparison survey since the subjective decisions of the respondent attended to surveys have a significant impact on the robustness of the proposed mcda framework nevertheless the pertinent literature provides limited information regarding the description of the experts who are targeted to evaluate the importance level of criteria in mar suitability mapping yet the present study described the background of the participants who performed the pairwise comparisons in detail including their professional positions affiliations and their experience in the field furthermore the consistency of each survey conducted by each expert was reported in order to enhance the transparency of the analysis representing an initial attempt in the literature due to its very systematic procedure and popularity in many decision making problems the standard ahp has long been one of the most used mcda methods for the criteria weight assessment in mar site suitability analysis sallwey et al 2019a however many criticisms have been raised regarding the ahp s ability to take the uncertainty of human judgments into account claiming that the subjective expert judgments obtained with crisp values may be less reliable therefore the fuzzified version of the ahp is an effective method for studies that rely on expert judgments since it incorporates the inherent fuzziness of the human decision making mechanism into the judgments of the participants hence the current study not only employed the fahp analysis but also adopted the sensitivity analysis which can be regarded as an essential step for the generation of suitability maps extracted through stable and robust implementations sallwey et al 2019a from a conceptual facet this study also has some similarities and distinctions compared to the existing body of knowledge for instance stormwater contaminants and the fact that drywells have moderate pollutants attenuation capacities are some of the reasons for the research society being skeptical about the drywells through land use and buffer distances from main roads criteria this study indirectly assessed stormwater contaminants potential by assigning lower suitability to risky areas also despite that newly industrialized drywells come equipped with pretreatment chambers capable of handling some pollutants a thorough investigation of pollutant concentrations must be conducted before implementation in any location where drywell construction is being considered stormwater quality monitoring should be conducted over an appropriate period to capture seasonal trends edwards et al 2016 similarly to take maximum advantage of the recharged water for future use it is important to assess the quality of the groundwater before injecting water into the system the proposed model can further be extended in the future by including parameters such as electrical conductivity and chloride concentrations in the aquifer finally model validation represents another challenging issue in mar suitability mapping due to the rareness of locating reported successful artificial recharge projects in most countries however validation of the drywells suitability maps by using runoff hydro chemical data could be fertile for future research directions in the neighborhood where drywells are identified as favorable based on the suitability mapping having information on the stormwater pollutants concentration in the corresponding area would give further the green light to construct whether recorded pollutants in the runoff are below the threshold level likewise there is still room for improvement concerning the mcda methods adopted for the weight assessment process but also for the calculation of the suitability index to exemplify the anp taking the potential interrelationship among criteria into account can be used to determine the criteria weights in the follow up attempts even though prior studies have used anp in the focalized topic it is worth noting that they applied the method to the whole criteria set even when they had parameters with no relationship between them hussaini et al 2021 kamangar et al 2019 here exploring the utilization of both ahp and anp for criteria posing non interdependence and those having interrelationships among each other respectively in the same mcda framework could be a valuable research direction for future studies in addition topsis offers a more sophisticated mathematical background for computing the suitability index than the often used gis overlay techniques employed in the pertinent literature yet it needs to be proven that this method has a higher accuracy in prioritizing and ranking the potential mar sites than the weighted and sum overlays hence adapting other mcda methodologies such as vikor and their fuzzified variants i e fuzzy topsis and fuzzy vikor handling some of the limitations of topsis could also serve as a guideline for future research it is evident that drywell suitability maps would be helpful for the decision makers since they allow them to narrow down the investigation area and concentrate their assessment on the limit zones nonetheless these maps should not be used as an end product but rather as part of the pre planning phase of a project jamali et al 2014 essentially such limitations are due to the fact that they do not account for the subsurface heterogeneity that affects not only drywell infiltration performance but also contaminants fate and transport according to händel et al 2014 the horizontal component of the hydraulic conductivity influences the recharge rate of drywells more than the vertical component in a similar vein sasidharan et al 2019 focalized on the role of subsurface heterogeneity in drywells infiltration performances through numerical and stochastic modeling the authors concluded that a much more thorough investigation of the subsurface is not required if only the recharge rate in drywell projects is a concern but if water quality is assessed including the fate and transport of pathogenic microbial contaminants besides infiltration performances a much more detailed estimation of the subsurface is expected therefore the follow up attempts containing the combination of drywells suitability maps and numerical modeling can not only enhance the robustness of the analysis but also help assess the infiltration performances and the contaminant attenuation potential of the vadose zone 7 conclusion drywells have proven their effectiveness and benefits compared to most mar technologies in recharging shallow urban aquifers throughout the years yet they are handicapped by the nonexistence of proper guidelines and standards regarding their implementation in most countries accordingly the fundamental goal of the current research is to identify the most determining factors regarding the implementation of drywells and hence a case study conducted in the urban city of kayseri to explore the areas suitable for artificial recharge through drywells by means of the integrated gis based mcda approach nine decision criteria were selected in relation to their influence on drywell sitting and recharge mechanism success and standardized through the fgd sessions in this vein the importance level of each criterion was determined using the fahp method while the application of the topsis model was performed to calculate the closeness coefficients of the alternatives i e sub regions with not only respect to the different criteria group but also the overall suitability the major outcomes of this study indicate that hydraulic conductivity depth to groundwater and soil texture play determinant roles in site suitability assessments while buffer distance from main roads is the least significant decision criterion the obtained weights were later compared to those adopted in the existing literature thus it was revealed that assigned weights are strongly consistent with the median of each pre defined set i e surface infiltration technologies and deep injection technologies for most criterion except hydraulic conductivity which display a much larger importance level in this study in contrast to other mar sites suitability mapping studies according to the site suitability maps generated for different criteria groups the findings pointed out the variations in regions closeness coefficient values and ranking for individual clusters however based on the overall suitability the city center shows very high to medium suitability for constructing the vadose zone wells the key findings of this study are that drywell sitting can be viewed as a multidimensional problem that requires not only consideration of subsurface variables but also surface and management parameters to improve infiltration performance recharged water and groundwater quality this type of problem is well suited to mcda methods since they enable the intervention of multidisciplinary experts to obtain the best overall judgment for robust results a further advantage of the mcda model is that it is very flexible and does not limit the number of parameters that can be included thus in the future if more criteria influencing drywell site prioritization are identified the model can easily be adjusted without requiring significant resources and or time a drywell suitability map can be integrated easily into an existing groundwater sustainability framework to help decision makers to evaluate a significant area before constructing vzr wells drywells can replenish stressed shallow urban aquifers but they can also be considered effective flood mitigation measures owing to their potential in conveying surface runoff to the underground hence the efforts devoted to exploring drywell suitability for a focalized region assist in both ensuring groundwater sustainability and mitigating the compound impacts of flooding incidents credit authorship contribution statement rachid mohamed mouhoumed conceptualization

2004,artificial recharge in urban aquifers is of vital importance due to the increase in urbanization resulting in a reduction in natural recharge along with groundwater overdraft in many regions across the globe despite existing several managed aquifer recharge mar technologies land availability for installation and limited municipal budget restrict their usage especially in urbanized areas hence drywells were introduced as a vadose zone recharge vzr facilitating the recharge of stressed aquifers with low land impact and financial resources also identifying suitable sites for drywell implementation is complex due to the number of driving factors involved in this paper the integrated fuzzy analytical hierarchy process fahp and technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis approach was proposed to delineate a site suitability map for artificial groundwater recharge using drywells in the city of kayseri turkey nine decision criteria were selected and the weights of each sub criterion were determined through the fahp the results indicated that hydraulic conductivity depth to groundwater soil texture and land use land cover were the most determining criteria with 33 9 17 8 11 2 and 10 1 of weights respectively also the stability and robustness of the criteria weights attained were validated through sensitivity analysis within the fahp framework finally the study area was divided into 54 sub regions based on the road network and the topsis was applied to prioritize the sub regions to help identify promising areas for the vadose zone wells construction here a similar approach can be adopted by municipalities lacking guidelines and standards for sitting drywells keywords managed aquifer recharge vadose zone well fuzzy ahp topsis multi criteria decision making urban aquifer data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater is among the vital natural resources for the vast majority of the world s population and can be regarded as the only fresh water source for many societies likewise groundwater resources provide nearly 30 and 40 of the worldwide water needs of households and irrigation respectively zheng et al 2021 still groundwater resources have been encountering severe challenges over the last decades such as chemical contamination depletion anthropogenic activities and seawater intrusion lall et al 2020 in turkey 70 of the entire water demand is supplied by groundwater which makes subsurface resources of paramount importance and essential to be sustained and secured against qualitative and quantitative degradations değirmenci et al 2011a yazıcı et al 2015 it is also worth mentioning that the study region focalized on within the scope of the current research i e kayseri province exclusively relies on subsurface resources due to the inherent variations in the climatic conditions especially stemming from climate change different groundwater management strategies were proposed to mitigate the threads faced by subsurface resources ranging from pumping rates optimization water use efficiency measures and groundwater governance frameworks frija et al 2014 lall et al 2020 however mar formerly named artificial recharge bouwer 2002 is one of the rewarding alternative technologies that can not only deal with the threats jeopardizing the amount of available groundwater resources but also enhance groundwater recharge therefore mar has been applied as a mechanism to replenish stressed aquifers limit seawater intrusions scale down land subsidence and store excess water during the wet season bachtouli and comte 2019 papadopoulos et al 2022 shi et al 2016 wendt et al 2021 as well as being a sustainable urban water management technology page et al 2018 iah commission on mar 2019 defined mar as the purposeful recharge of water to aquifers for subsequent recovery or environmental benefit according to dillon et al 2019 mar implementations cover many technologies popularly applied to recover overtaxed groundwater systems bouwer 2002 also provided the simplest classification of artificial recharge systems by dividing them into three main groups i e surface infiltration vadose zone recharge vzr and direct injection where water is directly introduced to the aquifer through deep wells surface infiltration refers to methods based on the infiltration process where water is spread out in wide areas using basins dams and channels to recharge an aquifer vzr structures also named vertical infiltration systems consist of trenches and drywells i e vadose zone wells open to the atmosphere and placed in the unsaturated zone to refill an unconfined aquifer using water of impaired quality e g municipal wastewater urban stormwater runoff for recharge etc bouwer 2002 science et al 1994 the primary objective of the mar projects is to inject as much reclaimed water into the system as possible however in addition to the physical parameters the appropriate mar technology for a particular project should be determined by considering the potential benefits and drawbacks for instance one of the challenges encountered in surface infiltration techniques is that they may lead to a loss of reclaimed water through evaporation due to their storage mechanisms edwards et al 2016 also they require permeable surfaces and consequent land availability making them less suited to urbanized environments despite these drawbacks surface infiltration technologies offer the greatest capacity for attenuating contaminants as opposed to deep injection systems which cause limited attenuation of pollutants implying water treatment before recharging and thereby inevitable additional costs the vzr structures can be regarded as useful tools for urbanized areas since the vzrs can be implemented with limited land impact and in impermeable areas while providing a certain level of contaminant attenuation in the vadose zone moreover händel et al 2014 conducted numerical simulations using the hydrus 2d 3d software šejna et al 2011 and compared the recharge performances of drywells and infiltration basins when the two systems operate under conditions commonly faced in field settings as a result of their research it has been found that two small vadose zone wells have a much higher recharge rate than a basin ten meters by six meters in size händel et al 2016 further combined field recharge experiments and numerical modeling to prove the viability of drywells in styria austria recently sasidharan et al 2021 also compared the performance of drywells and infiltration basins under various subsurface heterogeneity and steady state conditions it was found that a set of five drywells has a higher infiltration rate than a circular basin of 70 m in diameter and thereby further enhancing the reputation of vzr wells despite evidence suggested by research society regarding the potential of drywells to be used in recharging shallow unconsolidated aquifers for years few municipalities have adopted this mar technology associatively the vast majority of the municipalities still remain skeptical due to the challenges regarding the contamination potential of drywells hence it is not conceivable that they remain underrated with the advantages they have to replenish overtaxed urban aquifers over other mar methods it is also worth mentioning that some of the existing literature addressed that drywells are potentially causing contamination in the groundwater while some others reported that this challenge can be tackled through proper siting and continuously improved maintenance edwards et al 2016 likewise in arizona usa scottsdale municipality has successfully recharged water of impaired quality into its aquifer using drywells for nearly 20 years in addition brian 2018 stated that there has been no report of groundwater quality issues in scottsdale related to the artificial recharge on the one hand there are several benefits regarding the implementation of the mar techniques to deal with the over extracting of groundwater resources as addressed above on the other hand one of the major challenges during the design stage of a mar project is to locate suitable sites due to the large number of factors affecting the site suitability of the mar the existing literature recognized that several tools i e geophysical methods christy and lakshmanan 2017 geographical information systems gis brown et al 2005 and the integrated remote sensing gis chowdhury et al 2010 singh et al 2013 have been developed to overcome the corresponding complexities in addition given that the multi criteria decision analysis mcda methods warrant rewarding approaches in solving multi tiered decision making processes ekmekcioğlu et al 2021a koc et al 2021 these techniques have become one of the widely applied tools to identify the sites suitable for the mar applications sallwey et al 2019a tsangaratos et al 2017 in a similar vein gis based mcda frameworks offer comprehensive solution schemes for the analysis of mar projects with the less computational burden rahman et al 2012 although the pertinent literature covers extensive efforts that were devoted to the mcda methodologies for exploring some variants of the mar techniques such as surface infiltration ahmadi et al 2017 bonilla valverde et al 2016 tsangaratos et al 2017 and direct injection ahani amineh et al 2017 owusu et al 2017 little attention has paid concerning the vzr systems notably drywells in addition despite the analytical and numerical approaches presented to deal with drywells chahar et al 2012 edwards et al 2022 glass et al 2020 justino et al 2021 liang et al 2018 sasidharan et al 2019 the scholars mainly focalized on the infiltration performances clogging and groundwater quality that of these approaches are not able to delineate suitable sites for mar implementations the major novelties and corresponding contributions to the body of knowledge are as follows this research represents the initial attempt in investigating the site suitability of drywells through an integrated gis mcda technique most influencing factors for sitting drywells were spotted based on diligent investigation of peer reviewed studies guidelines and standards referring to the mar technology this study further explored the role of stormwater drainage network density and buffer distance from public wells which are overlooked in the pertinent literature on the site suitability assessments of drywells a focus group discussion involving experts from divergent backgrounds was conducted to standardize thematic layers for the first time and fahp was applied to determine the significance level of each decision criterion the profiles and the level of consistency of those experts were made accessible such that relevant literature lacks detail background of the experts which highly influences the robustness of the mar suitability mapping studies the validity of the attained criteria weights was evaluated based on comparing them with the weights those of previously found in other mar suitability mapping attempts that exist in the pertinent literature in addition a sensitivity analysis was performed with respect to different fuzziness degrees in order to highlight the stability and robustness of the findings the topsis was applied to determine the suitability index of alternatives i e sub regions and to generate the final drywells suitability map within the scope of the current research the city of kayseri turkey was selected as a case study to reveal the applicability of the proposed gis based hybrid mcda framework it is believed that the major outcomes of this research can effectively be used by scholars water resources authorities and governmental bodies to investigate the site suitability of drywells 2 review of recent gis mcda based mar opportunities mapping to meet the groundwater resources induced challenges several mar tools have been developed by the research society stefan and ansems 2018 established a mar inventory portal http marportal un igrac org by compiling and interpreting a total of 1200 mar case studies from 63 countries in this vein one can access the relevant information including site name location the operation year mar type influent water source used for recharge and the reference of each project through the corresponding portal the inowas research group also developed a different database https inowas com tools t04 database for gis mcda regarding the gis based mar suitability mapping studies where details on mar type water source criteria and decision rule method considered in each study can be retrieved sallwey et al 2019b yet these databases are not constantly updated and contain limited knowledge regarding the most recent gis mcda based mar suitability mapping studies thus the current research introduces a review of the recent attempts regarding the utilization of state of the art technologies in mar opportunities mapping table 1 here water table decline and water scarcity are the principal reason for artificial recharge requirement in the vast majority of the existing studies fuentes and vervoort 2020 hussaini et al 2021 kamangar et al 2019 kharazi et al 2019 papadopoulos et al 2022 tahvili et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 for instance aju et al 2021 conducted an integrated gis mcda approach and investigated the sites suitable to implement mar structures for recharging the groundwater in the vamanapuram river basin vrb south india that fall in the semi critical category in terms of water scarcity and water table decline along with these efforts mar based mapping studies further addressed other problems and or reasons such as salinization kazakis 2018 fluoride contamination arshad et al 2022 groundwater sustainability phankamolsil et al 2022 and emergency scenario soliman et al 2022 during the site screening process infeasible areas are excluded from the focalized regions and hence criteria such as slope land use land cover geology and distance from residential area are among the widely adopted constraints in identifying suitable sites for the mar implementation furthermore the criteria selected and decision rules applied for the suitability mapping phase show a significant diversity even though the considered mar type is the same in line russo et al 2015 highlighted that there is a lack of standard criteria set in mar suitability mapping for instance tahvili et al 2021 and chowdhury paul 2021 both investigated sites favorable for rainwater harvesting on the one hand tahvili et al 2021 found water quality groundwater drops percentage of vegetation average of annual rainfall soil depth soil permeability soil texture and electrical conductivity of soil were among the most effective criteria for rainwater harvesting site delineation on the other hand runoff soil slope lineament density drainage density land use landcover distance from road and distance from river were the most driving factors in mar suitability assessments concerning the study conducted by chowdhury paul 2021 yet data availability and accessibility as well as the definition of the problem play a determinant role in the identification of the criteria set used in mar studies bonilla valverde 2018 rahman et al 2012 in another respect sallwey et al 2019a reviewed the gis based mar studies available in the inowas database and revealed that weighted linear combination wlc ahp fuzzy logic fl decision tree and promethee are the commonly applied techniques to locate the sites favorable for the mar projects however in recent years other mcda tools such as fahp anp topsis edas and saw were also employed in the mar opportunities mapping as shown in table 1 for instance kamangar et al 2019 used anp and ahp for criteria weight assignment and topsis method to overlay thematic layers while kharazi et al 2019 applied different mcda methods such as ahp topsis and edas for prioritizing the sites suitable for underground dams in the semnan plain iran furthermore hussaini et al 2021 generated different mar suitability maps based on three techniques i e fl ahp and anp they found that the anp based map was more accurate and reliable compared to the maps generated through its counterparts this result can inherently be associated with the fact that the ahp method disregards the interrelationship among criteria while the anp method takes the interrelationships into account during the construction of hierarchical representations ekmekcioğlu et al 2022 in addition further attempts incorporated the fuzzy set theory introduced by zadeh zadeh 1965 to minimize the uncertainties that exist in the complex decision making mechanisms such that chowdhury and paul 2021 delineated suitable sites for rainwater harvesting structures i e ponds and pans percolation tank check dam and nala bunds by the fahp technique for criteria weight assessments and fuzzy gamma operator for combining the involved parameters similarly papadopoulos et al 2022 applied the fahp and fis for the assignment of the weights considered and the delineation of the sites auspicious for infiltration basins respectively some countries have notable histories in artificial groundwater recharge investigations based on the number of studies published and the availability of national guidelines on mar applications for instance nearly half of the existing studies regarding the mar application were conducted in india and iran sallwey et al 2019a hence once can argue that the mar implementation still represents a novice topic in some other parts of the world apaydin 2022 e g turkey which is the focalized region in the current research accordingly the only attempt at mar assessment in turkey was performed by sayit and yazicigil 2012 for the kucuk menderes river basin located in the western part of the country they performed numerical analysis under different scenarios to examine the effect of artificial recharge on the water table and groundwater storage in the present study suitable sites for vzr systems were investigated using gis mcda techniques for the first time for a pilot region located in turkey here the city of kayseri was selected as a case study due to the current situation of the shallow aquifers that need to be assessed in terms of the applicability of the artificial recharge technique 3 study area kayseri is among the most populated cities in turkey with more than one million residents and is located in central anatolia the study zone covers 218 53 km2 in total within the boundaries of kayseri province including the districts of melikgazi in large part and kocasinan small part in the north fig 1 the climate of the city reflects the cold semi arid climatic characteristics with nearly a hundred rainy days over a year and an average snow day of 36 turkish state meteorology service 2022 in addition the highest temperature reaches 38 c on hot days especially during july and august while the lowest temperatures are observed between 6 c and 2 c in winter değirmenci et al 2008 the lithology of the study area is predominated by alluvium deposits and pyroclastic rocks however units such as basalt andesite sandstone and agglomerate also exist the kayseri plain contains two aquifer systems that are separated by an impermeable or semi permeable layer mainly andesite and basalt as snowfall falls on the higher elevations of erciyes mountain 3917 m located in the vicinity of the focused region it recharges the lower pressurized volcanic aquifer which is the main aquifer whereas rainfall in the plain contributes negligibly it is estimated that groundwater flows from the south and southeast to the north and northwest of the region with a velocity of 15 20 cm day değirmenci et al 2011a moreover on top of it there is a shallow alluvial aquifer with a much lower yield due to its thickness and extension which constitutes a secondary aquifer yazıcı et al 2015 direct infiltration from precipitation in the plain mainly recharges this unconfined aquifer overall the hydraulic conductivity values measured in the alluvial aquifer in the study area vary between 1 1 10 5 and 6 4 10 4 m s the water demand of the city is majorly contingent upon the groundwater sources the records attained in 2010 illustrated that the municipality supply nearly 60 billion m3 of water for domestic purposes annually değirmenci et al 2011b and recent evidence addresses the unavertable increase in water consumption over the last decade the huge amount of the water demand is satisfied by the pressurized lower aquifer that has a consequent yield with water of high quality nuray ates et al 2021 and from a spring with a discharge of 300 l s değirmenci et al 2011a urbanization on the plain considerably downscales the natural recharge of the upper aquifer and rough usage of groundwater resources for irrigation purposes currently causing a decline in the water table therefore current conditions point out that more water is expected to be abstracted from the lower aquifer to meet irrigation demand if the shallow aquifer is depleted in the future a scenario that could lead to irreversible outcomes 4 materials and methods the present research contains a step wise approach to delineate and prioritize the sub regions in kayseri including 1 retrieving essential criteria that affect mar site suitability 2 assessment of the importance of the refined criteria list based on the fahp approach and 3 the identification of the suitable areas in accordance with the topsis technique fig 2 in the first step the relevant criteria were identified by means of the literature survey encompassing both the research articles and the reports accordingly 9 relevant criteria were selected to pin down sites favorable for vzr drywells this step also includes generating raster layers to be used in the suitability analysis all the gis applications were performed with open source qgis software qgis development team 2022 after gis based processing thematic layers were standardized and the ranking of the layers was attained as a result of the focus group discussion fgd session involving experts from divergent backgrounds the second phase of the process consists of conducting the ahp surveys a 9 by 9 questionnaire was performed with each expert and the consistencies of the experts were checked it is important to note that the experts failing to meet the consistency threshold i e less than 10 were repeated two rounds at maximum until ensuring an acceptable consistency ratio cr the third step covers determining the clusters and criteria weights using chang s extend analysis within the fahp method by replacing the crisp scales given by experts in the ahp survey with their equivalent triangular fuzzy numbers tfn along with the topsis implementation for prioritizing the alternative sites suitable for drywells in the kayseri plain 4 1 data source and derived spatial layers 4 1 1 data source the selection of relevant criteria for the drywell site suitability analysis was performed based on peer reviewed studies edwards et al 2016 and national guidelines geosyntec consultants 2020 portland gov 2016 us environmental protection agency 1999 that dealt with the mar technology table 2 presents a brief summary of the thematic layers utilized for the mapping purpose including the sources corresponding datasets format of the data and their references as can be seen from the table that the data regarding the slope criterion was obtained from the copernicus global digital surface model copernicus dsm glo by using opentopography dem downloader plugin in qgis european space agency 2021 among a variety of dems in raster format the copernicus dsm glo with 30 m 30 m resolution was selected in addition corine land cover clc dataset büttner et al 2017 was retrieved with a resolution of 100 m 100 m from the copernicus land monitoring service website geology data of kayseri province were provided by kaski in vector format along with other raw data such as public wells coordinates and the corresponding ground water levels lithology was obtained from the kaski in terms of the geology vector layer and converted into the raster format meanwhile the groundwater level vectors were subjected to the inverse distance weighted idw method for deriving the depth to ground water raster layer the information regarding the public wells coordinates was used to generate the buffer distances from public wells map similarly a buffer distance from main roads bdmr thematic layer was derived from openstreetmap osm by means of both the osm downloader and multi ring buffer plugins exist in qgis for the extraction of the roads and buffer generation respectively in addition kaski provided the drainage network of the city in cad drawing format based on this data nearly 90 of the drainage system of the city consists of a combined stormwater wastewater system while only 10 serves exclusively for draining surface runoff in addition değirmenci et al 2011a used a drastic model to delineate the groundwater protection zones and they further focused on the groundwater contamination assessment of the kayseri basin here the drastic model requires seven hydrogeological layers as input namely depth to groundwater table d net recharge r aquifer media a soil media s topography t impact of vadose zone i and hydraulic conductivity c shirazi et al 2012 hence this study acquired the soil texture and hydraulic conductivity maps from the report prepared by değirmenci et al 2011a and digitized them using the qgis software 4 1 2 descriptions of the utilized layers the current research included three different factors impacting the assessment of site suitability of drywells in each of three main clusters i e surface economy protection and aquifer thus slope land use land cover and soil texture criteria were considered within the surface cluster fig 4 also stormwater drainage network density buffer distance from public wells and buffer distance from main roads were taken into account within the economy protection cluster while depth to groundwater lithology and hydraulic conductivity were used in assessing the aquifer cluster below brief descriptions of each criterion as well as their relations with the mar site suitability are provided a slope is one of the most widely used decision criteria in gis mcda based mar studies the reason for the common adoption of the slope criterion is not only related to the availability and free access of a large number of dem data with lower resolution in recent years but also it controls the convergence and divergence of water which is affiliated with the infiltration capacity ahmadi et al 2017 ekmekcioğlu and koc 2022 in this regard mild slopes have higher infiltration rates compared to steep slopes chowdhury et al 2010 in addition well clogging due to the suspended sediments existing in the stormwater is one of the major concerns in drywells projects and is encountered by soil erosions that occur in regions having higher slopes b land use land cover contributes to the accurate prediction of the contaminant types in urban zones surrounding drywells sites and their effects on the aquifers edwards et al 2016 there are a number of studies illustrating the impact of land use on stormwater runoff in terms of pollutant discharges arbswrp 2018 us environmental protection agency 1999 different types of pollutants can be found in different land use classes for instance commercial and industrial areas are known to contain pollutants such as heavy metals bacteria oil and grease semi volatile organic compounds svocs volatile organic compounds vocs and total dissolved solids tds the major contaminants detected in stormwater samples collected from residential areas are bacteria heavy metals oil and grease and tds arbswrp 2018 this study categorized the lulc criterion into five classes i e 1 forest and seminatural areas 2 arable lands permanent crops pastures and heterogenous agricultural areas 3 urban fabric green urban areas sports and leisure facilities 4 industrial commercial and transport units 5 mine dump and construction sites fig 3 b c soil texture is another widely included factor in mar suitability assessments and is closely related to the ability of the soil to infiltrate large volumes of surface water into the sub surface arshad et al 2022 tahvili et al 2021 sites having coarse grained e g sand materials have high infiltration capacity with a relatively lower potential to attenuate contaminants in contrast soils containing higher clay yield promising performance in contaminant filtering whereas they have poor infiltration performance therefore great attention needs to be paid to account for the soil texture factor and providing a balance between infiltration performance and contaminants filtration ability of the vadose zone is essential for sitting drywells the soil texture map of the study area is available in fig 3c d stormwater drainage network density could have a significant impact on the site selection since the stormwater is generally regarded as the main water source in drywell projects hence the closer the installation of the drywells to the existing infrastructure the lower the need for financial resources in recharging the systems from the stormwater drainage networks some scholars indeed considered similar parameters by including in their model the distance between water supply sources and mar site but they generally refer to the distance to waste treatment plants ahmadi et al 2017 brown et al 2005 gdoura et al 2015 kallali et al 2007 tsangaratos et al 2017 in this context a density map of the stormwater drainage network of the city was generated and reclassified into five classes in the present work fig 3d e buffer distance from public wells was included in the proposed framework as the theories on the origin of the drywells highlight that vadose zone wells need to be away from pubic wells at a certain distance in order to provide a sufficient time of travel geosyntec consultants 2020 to exemplify there is a mandatory separation distance between drywells and public supply wells in the united states where the applications of drywells are widely embraced however it is especially worth mentioning that the corresponding threshold distance may vary according to the states mandates lock et al 2017 such that satisfying a horizontal distance of 60 m away from drinking wells at minimum in illinois while providing at least 150 m is essential in oregon the generated map regarding buffer distance from public wells criterion is provided in fig 3e f buffer distance from main roads is among the significant drivers of the mar implementations especially considering the stormwater runoff contamination due to the applied sodium chloride i e salt on roads and highways as a de icing agent existing body knowledge recognized that the corresponding practice results in considerable harm to the surrounding environment notably to surface and subsurface resources by contaminating the aquifer and surface water resources snodgrass et al 2017 in addition to the salt application von gunten et al 2020 reported that heavy metals penetrating from asphalt concrete that was found near roads and highways could have a detrimental impact on groundwater and nearby soil therefore a multi buffer distance from main roads spatial layer was generated for the focalized region fig 3f g depth to groundwater is regarded as another crucial factor in drywells applications as suggested by many state guidelines and standards in the u s typically drywells are designed to be 1 2 m diameter wells ending before reaching the water table hence similar to the horizontal distances mentioned in the earlier factors a vertical separation distance between the bottom of the drywell and the seasonal high water table is essential in constituting effective mar techniques the need for the corresponding vertical distance comes from the fact that the system benefits from the vadose zone as a contaminant attenuation mechanism in reducing the risk of pollution here the geologic conditions of the regions drive the required vertical distance and hence likewise the buffer distance from the public wells different threshold values were determined by divergent states of the u s lock et al 2017 the minimum vertical distance that is required to be satisfied across the u s is determined to be between 3 and 8 m based on the american river basin stormwater resource plan 2018 however for instance in some regions e g riverside county los angeles county arizona etc the mandatory vertical distance between the drywell bottom and the water table is specified as 3 m adeq 2018 cities and county of riverside 2012 county of los angeles 2009 the map produced for depth to groundwater criterion in the studied region is provided in fig 3g h lithology describes the physical characteristics of the rock that composes the geological formation as well as it is mineral content grain size and packing freeze and cherry 1979 the movement and occurrence of groundwater are closely related to the rock type of the region selvam et al 2016 selvarani et al 2017 thus having detailed information on the geological formations of the region is of utmost importance for attaining maximum benefit from artificial recharge the lithology map of the study area was obtained from the geology dataset of kayseri province here the plain is mostly dominated by alluvium deposits and pyroclastic rocks covering 54 and 20 of the study region respectively in addition north and north west cover the sandstone formation while volcanic rocks such as ignimbrite andesite and basalt accounting for 21 of the total formation are also available in the focalized region fig 3h i hydraulic conductivity is among the most important physical parameters of the aquifers and vital components in assessing mar projects the reason for it can be explained by the fact that some physical properties such as the transmissivity hydraulic conductivity and storage coefficient can be used to assess the volume of water that could be injected into the groundwater system ahani amineh et al 2017 addressed that aquifer characteristics are relevant indicators to estimate the capacity of the system to not only store but also recover the water therefore in the current research the hydraulic conductivity of the shallow aquifer obtained from değirmenci et al 2011 was incorporated into the criteria set and reclassified into five classes fig 3i 4 2 standardization this study assessed a total of 9 factors having different natures of data such as categorical i e land use land cover soil texture and lithology and numerical i e slope stormwater drainage network density buffer distance from public wells buffer distance from main roads depth to groundwater and hydraulic conductivity in the literature there are different methods including fuzzy membership ahp method linear and step functions that have been applied to adjust the decision criteria classes in a similar scale fuentes and vervoort 2020 kamangar et al 2019 papadopoulos et al 2022 rahman et al 2012 however this study adopted the standardization method in order to reduce the complexity of the analysis rather focus group discussions fgd involving all respondents having divergent expertise were performed which is the initial attempt in the mar related literature also cells having a higher potential for drywells success were assigned a scale of 5 while unsuitable ones received a ranking factor of 1 it is especially noteworthy to mention that the fgd methodology is one of the widely adopted qualitative assessment techniques grounded on the extracting of an expert group s decision that reflects the overall understanding of the participants rather than statistically selected representative samples pertaining to a broader population in the fgd respondents are purposively determined and encouraged to communicate with each other for concluding a decision that combines the specific knowledge of the experts resulting in collective views on the topic of interest in the present study the refined list of the sub criteria and their corresponding sub classes as well as their rating factors were determined based on the collective decisions of the fgd participants table 6 4 3 fuzzy analytic hierarchy process fahp the analytical hierarchy process ahp is a traditional multi criteria decision making method that was initially developed by saaty 1977 the ahp mainly provides the hierarchical representation of the challenging tasks based on the judgments of the experts the method further enables users to perform quantitative and qualitative assessments of the specified problems including criteria weighting and alternative prioritization besides the advantages of the ahp method some literature addressed that their limited capacity to reflect the inherent ambiguity of a human s decision making process is the soft spot of the ahp method therefore several techniques have been developed and incorporated into the traditional ahp to overcome this issue by taking the fuzzification of the experts decisions into account thus chang s 1996 extent analysis was pioneered based on the fuzzy set theory of zadeh 1965 in order for coping with the complex nature of the environment the fuzzy ahp framework implemented in the current research covers a set of steps as follows step 1 data collection linguistic variables based on a typical 1 9 likert scale were used to perform a pairwise comparison among decision criteria within the data collection step a questionnaire was introduced to experts and they were asked to evaluate the criteria covering three main clusters i e surface economy protection and aquifer each having three criteria following the acquirment of necessary information from the expert group table 3 triangular fuzzy ahp rationale was applied to the decisions of the respondents fig 4 although some other techniques e g interval fahp trapezoidal fahp etc have been introduced in the pertinent literature for fuzzifying the decision variables this study adopted triangular fahp due to its commonly applied feature and practicality in addition triangular fahp ensures the most likely smallest possible and largest possible variants of the respondents judgments accordingly reciprocals of linguistic variables related to the degree of importance of each criterion were incorporated into the participants judgments table 4 here l ij m ij and u ij denote the lower mean and upper width of the pairwise judgments of the participants attended the fahp survey for criterion i compared to the criterion j respectively step 2 consistency check the ahp analysis not only enables the evaluation of the respondents decisions but also provides the assessment of the consistency of the respondents by means of the consistency ratio cr cr value calculated for each decision matrix indicates the reliability of the decision making mechanism of the experts here 0 1 is the threshold value for cr and correspondingly attained values higher than the threshold indicate that the experts judgments are inconsistent to accomplish the computation of the cr consistency index ci and random index ri are used eq 1 and eq 2 refer to the process for identifying ci and cr respectively 1 ci λ max n n 1 2 cr ci ri in eq 1 which λ max is the maximum eigenvalue of a matrix and n is the number of criteria in the corresponding matrix to specify the ri value table 5 which was introduced by saaty saaty 2004 is used step 3 attaining the preference of group decisions the fuzzy equivalents of each linguistic variable are determined in this step thus eq 3 represents the way to compute the lower l ijk mean m ijk and upper u ijk width of the fuzzy equivalents based on the triangular membership function 3 l ij k 1 k l ijk 1 k m ij k 1 k m ijk 1 k u ij k 1 k u ijk 1 k where k denotes each expert while k refers to the total number of experts step 4 chang s extent analysis chang s extent analysis suggests considering each object to employ extent analysis for specific goals hence fuzzy quantities are attained via crisp mathematical notations in chang s extent analysis x x 1 x 2 x 3 x n is a set of objects and u u 1 u 2 u 3 u m is a set of goals the value of the fuzzy synthetic extent based on the object i is computed through eq 4 4 s i j 1 m m gi j j 1 n j 1 m m gi j 1 where m gi j denotes the triangular fuzzy numbers in addition the possibility degree is computed with the fuzzy synthetic extent value where m 1 l 1 m 1 u 1 and m 2 l 2 m 2 u 2 are two triangular fuzzy numbers the possibility degree of m 2 l 2 m 2 u 2 m 1 l 1 m 1 u 1 is defined by eq 5 5 v m 2 m 1 h t g m 1 m 2 1 if m 2 m 1 0 if l 1 u 2 l 1 u 2 m 2 u 2 m 1 l 1 otherwise following the calculation of the possibility degree for convex fuzzy numbers the weight vector is computed and the normalized weight vectors w indicating the finalized decisions of the respondents are identified 6 w d a 1 d a 2 d a n t step 5 sensitivity analysis this step is regarded as essential to empower the decisions regarding the importance degrees of the criteria considered ekmekcioğlu et al 2021b hence a sensitivity analysis was performed with respect to the different degree of fuzziness values to inspect the variations in criteria importance the initial value of the degree of fuzziness in the adopted fahp method was 1 as the distance between l m and u values table 4 whereas five additional fuzziness degrees i e 1 2 1 4 1 6 1 8 and 2 0 were also explored in the current research thus one can conclude that if the importance order does not change significantly the outcome of the decision analysis framework is reliable and insensitive to the changes in fuzziness degrees ishizaka and labib 2011 4 4 technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis hwang and yoon hwang and yoon 1981 initially proposed the topsis algorithm to deal with mcdm related problems grounded on alternative prioritization within the topsis method the best alternative is determined according to the distance to positive and negative ideal solutions where the shortest geometric distance to the positive ideal solution pis and longest geometric distance to the negative ideal solution nis make an alternative appropriate compared to its counterparts as the scenario covering the shortest distance to pis and longest distance to nis maximizes and minimizes the benefit and cost criteria respectively in a typical topsis application a number of six steps are embraced in the first step the evaluation matrix a ij mn is formed based on a set of alternatives m and criteria n as expressed in eq 7 7 a ij a 11 a 12 a 1 n a 21 a 22 a 2 n a m 1 a m 2 a mn where a ij is the importance of alternative i with respect to criteria j in the second step the normalization of the evaluation matrix is performed for each criterion individually by eq 8 8 r ij a ij k 1 m a kj 2 in the third step the weighted normalized matrix v is computed by integrating the normalized criteria weights of the sub criteria and their corresponding values 9 v v ij m n w j r ij m n in which w j is the weight of criterion j in the fourth step pis and nis also can be reformulated as a and a respectively are determined through eqs 10 and 11 10 a max i v ij j j min i v ij j j v 1 v 2 v n 11 a min i v ij j j max i v ij j j v 1 v 2 v n in the fifth step each alternative s distance to pis d i and nis d i are computed 12 d i j 1 n v ij v j 2 13 d i j 1 n v ij v j 2 in the sixth step the closeness coefficients cc i ensuring the final prioritization of alternatives are calculated 14 cc i d i d i d i it is worth mentioning that cc i values vary between 0 and 1 in which the higher the cc i value the more appropriate the alternative 5 results the primary purpose of the current study is to identify suitable zones for drywell implementations in the city of kayseri to accomplish the overarching aim of this research thematic layers of 9 parameters influencing the vadose zone wells were derived then the corresponding layers were standardized as a result of the fgd sessions and the significance of each decision criterion was determined via the fahp method based on the pairwise comparison questionnaire involving ten respondents lastly topsis was applied for computing the overall suitability index of each alternative and a total of 54 sub regions were prioritized according to the closeness coefficient values 5 1 decision criteria weighting analysis in gis mcda models one of the most challenging tasks is to refine the list of influential criteria and to determine the importance of each decision variable as these techniques highly depend on experts judgments thus the consistency of each respondent for each pairwise matrix was determined via the cr values at first table 6 in order to ensure the stability and legitimacy of the attained outcomes table 6 highlights that all the experts involved in the ahp questionnaire were consistent as the cr values are under the threshold value of 10 in addition table 7 is presented to illustrate the results of the fahp analysis containing the significance level of each criteria for the site suitability mapping task the findings indicate that the aquifer was assigned as the most determining cluster with a weight of 0 578 followed by the surface and economy protection clusters having weights of 0 289 and 0 133 respectively among the aquifer cluster hydraulic conductivity had the highest importance 0 586 in terms of local weight which also outperformed all other criteria with a global weight of 0 339 table 7 in addition table 7 quite reveals that the depth to groundwater was the second most important criterion among both the aquifer cluster and all criteria set with local and global weights of 0 309 and 0 178 respectively the acquired outcomes further highlighted the role of soil texture 0 112 and lulc 0 101 criteria that were placed in the 3rd and 4th order of importance within the overall assessments what is striking about the results is that despite the weight of the aquifer cluster being considerably higher than the other two clusters the lithology criterion has one of the lowest weights 0 061 according to the overall comparison scheme this result underlines the limited contribution of lithological variations in the site suitability analysis of the mar implementations accordingly buffer distance from main roads and stormwater drainage network density were the least two effective criteria receiving the lowest global weights of 0 018 and 0 037 respectively for drywell sitting table 7 this study further examined the sensitivities of the employed criteria to the fuzzy degrees in order for underpinning the stability and robustness of the fahp decision framework and its corresponding outcomes for this reason different fuzziness degrees namely 1 2 1 4 1 6 1 8 and 2 0 were taken into account and the alterations in the criteria weights were deduced the same fahp procedures were performed by considering the additional fuzziness degrees in which fig 5 exhibits the change in criteria weights based on the employed degree of fuzziness values fig 5 quite reveals that the proposed fahp scheme yielded stable results as no change was observed in the rankings of decision criteria 5 2 identification of zones auspicious for drywells the site suitability assessments were performed through partitioning the study area into smaller areas accounting for a total of 54 sub regions based on the main roads network of the city to accomplish this aim the topsis algorithm was used and the alternative distances from positive and negative ideal solutions were calculated for surface economy protection aquifer and overall clusters separately the closeness coefficient values and the corresponding ranks of regions regarding site suitability were also determined table 8 based on the jenks natural break method closeness coefficients were classified into five classes i e very high high moderate low and very low the results were then mapped for the different criteria group fig 6 as well as the overall suitability fig 7 the hybrid fahp topsis analysis suggests that regions suitable for drywells implementation vary according to different clusters for instance depending on surface criteria regions located in the southern southwestern sub regions 27 32 33 and 53 and northeastern sub regions 6 20 51 and 54 part of the study area fig 6a have high and very high suitability for artificial recharge through drywells this could not only be explained by the presence of sand and silt loam soil texture classes but also by the availability of nearly flat terrain and the absence of the least ranked lulc classes such as industrial commercial and transport units in the corresponding regions however the northern and northeastern sub regions 2 4 6 18 20 51 and 54 areas of the city have moderate suitability with regard to criteria pertaining to the economy protection cluster i e sdnd bdpw and bdmr fig 6b and this could be linked to the inexistence or presence of low stormwater drainage network in those sub regions additionally regions in the center sub regions 10 12 27 28 29 30 31 36 37 44 and 49 received low closeness coefficient values and were deemed less suitable related to the existence of the dense road networks that could lead to groundwater pollution and the limited runoff drainage networks it is also especially noteworthy to mention that drainage networks are currently available in those regions since they are mostly located in the city center however these regions have combined wastewater stormwater drainage systems which makes suitability assessments challenging hence evidence suggests that treatment would be required if water drained from such systems is used for recharge and draining water from combined sewers lead to a significant amount of costs causing prejudice to the economically friendly reputation of drywells portland gov 2016 contrary to the abovementioned clusters the most favorable regions are concentrated in the city center sub regions 3 10 11 12 23 24 28 29 44 and 49 in terms of the aquifer criteria group fig 6c the relatively higher closeness coefficient values can be explained by the existence of high hydraulic conductivity porous media and deep water table level in the corresponding zones in addition to the cluster specific analysis fig 7 is provided to illustrate the overall suitability containing the integrated assessment of the overall criteria according to the final results sub regions 6 21 47 3 and 49 were found as the five most suitable zones that were classified as very high suitability to the artificial recharge through the drywells strong evidence can further be seen regarding the moderately suitable sub regions that are mostly located in the northwestern and central parts of the study area on the other hand the least ranked and consequently very low suitability regions for drywell construction are located in the southwestern sub regions 27 33 and 32 and southeastern sub regions 41 and 39 of the area studied the reason behind their low rank based on the overall assessment is that the corresponding sub regions reflect considerably low values in the aquifer cluster that was found as the most influential cluster according to the fahp analysis to exemplify sub region 33 ranked at 6th 15th 49th and 49th according to the surface economy protection aquifer and overall criteria group respectively nevertheless this conclusion does not imply that the two other clusters are trivial compared to the aquifer cluster such that sub regions 6 and 20 had relatively high rankings with regard to the overall evaluations despite they had considerably low rankings in terms of the aquifer cluster 6 discussions 6 1 assessment of the criteria weights the importance level of criteria in suitability mapping with regard to mar implementations is closely related to the mar technology considered and the type of the aquifer i e confined or unconfined sallwey et al 2019a therefore on the one hand where deep injection dis structures i e aquifer storage and recovery are considered for mar to recharge a confined aquifer subsurface criteria or aquifer related parameters are favored in weight assessments on the other hand in studies dealing with surface infiltration sis techniques e g surface spreading in channel modification etc surface criteria acquire much importance compared to their counterparts in this regard we compared the weights obtained from the fahp method with the weights applied in the sis fig 8 a and dis fig 8b literature groups even though some of the criteria adopted in this paper show rareness in the existing literature they were compared to the weights assigned to similar parameters in order to ensure a fair and comprehensive datum line for instance although the stormwater drainage network density was reported in none of the mar suitability mapping studies it reflects similarity to some other criteria such as distance to wastewater treatment plant distance from hydrographic network and source water availability anane et al 2008 lahaye et al 2021 papadopoulos et al 2022 rahman et al 2013 tsangaratos et al 2017 hence they were re grouped under the umbrella of proximity to water sources for comparison purposes fig 8 and the same approach was embraced for other criteria such as the buffer distance from main road chezgi et al 2016 kazakis 2018 and hydraulic conductivity gibson and campana 2018 nasiri et al 2013 rahimi et al 2014 singh et al 2013 being under road network density and transmissivity hydraulic conductivity umbrellas respectively concerning the sis literature group the slope is one of the most utilized criteria in the existing studies and has weights with an interquartile range of iqr of 11 6 and a median of 12 8 fig 8a in addition a considerable amount of studies in the sis group also used land use land cover and soil texture here the weights assigned to those two criteria in our study significantly coincide with the median of the respective sets what is further important regarding the comparisons that the road network density criterion has the lowest iqr representing the being least considered criteria based on the existing literature and accordingly it had the lowest weight according to our results however a significant difference can be observed regarding the hydraulic conductivity criterion as the weight computed for this factor in our assessments is the largest even compared to the study that gave the highest importance to hydraulic conductivity this can be explained by the fact that some authors have assigned significantly greater values to the weights of other criteria mahmoud et al 2014 for instance assigned an influence of 42 6 to the soil texture criterion while the median in that set is 13 1 likewise bonilla valverde et al 2016 allocated an importance level of 43 0 to the geology factor and thus gets the title of the study having the highest weighted criterion in the considered literature based on the studies regarding the dis literature group the slope is used in two third of the reported literature in that group however it dropped to the second place surpassing the proximity to water sources criterion depth to groundwater was among the least used criterion for sis studies with only 3 applications over 17 studies but in the dis five of the reported nine studies took the corresponding criterion into account fig 8b similar to the sis group the weight assigned to the hydraulic conductivity in our study represents the highest value for the dis set nevertheless tsangaratos et al 2017 assigned much larger weights than the hydraulic conductivity to the depth to groundwater and lithology criteria by giving them an equal weight of 39 8 furthermore the weights obtained for land use land cover soil texture and depth to groundwater criteria based on our study match with the median of the respective set which illustrates that most of the outcomes of the current research accord with the earlier observations performed in the literature overall the major outcomes of the present research strongly corroborate the findings introduced in the pertinent literature although some distinctions can be observed one should take the variability of the working principles of the adopted methodologies and the considered criteria into account in site suitability assessments it is also worth noting that the characteristics of the focalized regions the objectives of the study and the fact that the mcdm methods heavily rely on the subjective judgments of the experts may lead to variations in the importance levels of the criteria within the relevant literature 6 2 assessment of the proposed framework and implications for future attempts in the past decade a considerable number of studies successfully applied a combined gis mcda approach to delineate sites suitable for mar structures anane et al 2008 chezgi et al 2016 kazakis 2018 nasiri et al 2013 rajasekhar et al 2021 sargaonkar et al 2011 however the mar technologies mostly assessed in those studies could have limited application in highly urbanized environments since they require consequent land availability e g surface spreading for implementations or are not economically friendly to municipal budgets e g deep injections in terms of initial operation and maintenance costs arbswrp 2018 händel et al 2016 sasidharan et al 2018 in this paper we therefore proposed a hybrid mcda framework to delineate sites suitable to construct drywells which are recently considered one of the most reliable mar technologies to address shallow urban aquifers but underrated by the non existence of guidelines and standards to identify proper sites for their installation in most countries existing research recognizes the fact that there is a burden in identifying relevant criteria especially when dealing with mcda problems the corresponding concern is also a challenge in mar suitability assessments where the parameters selected are heavily influenced by the technology being used by conducting a thorough literature review the most dominant criteria for sitting drywells were identified in this study for the first time and each was described another major concern also lies in selecting the right experts to participate in the pairwise comparison survey since the subjective decisions of the respondent attended to surveys have a significant impact on the robustness of the proposed mcda framework nevertheless the pertinent literature provides limited information regarding the description of the experts who are targeted to evaluate the importance level of criteria in mar suitability mapping yet the present study described the background of the participants who performed the pairwise comparisons in detail including their professional positions affiliations and their experience in the field furthermore the consistency of each survey conducted by each expert was reported in order to enhance the transparency of the analysis representing an initial attempt in the literature due to its very systematic procedure and popularity in many decision making problems the standard ahp has long been one of the most used mcda methods for the criteria weight assessment in mar site suitability analysis sallwey et al 2019a however many criticisms have been raised regarding the ahp s ability to take the uncertainty of human judgments into account claiming that the subjective expert judgments obtained with crisp values may be less reliable therefore the fuzzified version of the ahp is an effective method for studies that rely on expert judgments since it incorporates the inherent fuzziness of the human decision making mechanism into the judgments of the participants hence the current study not only employed the fahp analysis but also adopted the sensitivity analysis which can be regarded as an essential step for the generation of suitability maps extracted through stable and robust implementations sallwey et al 2019a from a conceptual facet this study also has some similarities and distinctions compared to the existing body of knowledge for instance stormwater contaminants and the fact that drywells have moderate pollutants attenuation capacities are some of the reasons for the research society being skeptical about the drywells through land use and buffer distances from main roads criteria this study indirectly assessed stormwater contaminants potential by assigning lower suitability to risky areas also despite that newly industrialized drywells come equipped with pretreatment chambers capable of handling some pollutants a thorough investigation of pollutant concentrations must be conducted before implementation in any location where drywell construction is being considered stormwater quality monitoring should be conducted over an appropriate period to capture seasonal trends edwards et al 2016 similarly to take maximum advantage of the recharged water for future use it is important to assess the quality of the groundwater before injecting water into the system the proposed model can further be extended in the future by including parameters such as electrical conductivity and chloride concentrations in the aquifer finally model validation represents another challenging issue in mar suitability mapping due to the rareness of locating reported successful artificial recharge projects in most countries however validation of the drywells suitability maps by using runoff hydro chemical data could be fertile for future research directions in the neighborhood where drywells are identified as favorable based on the suitability mapping having information on the stormwater pollutants concentration in the corresponding area would give further the green light to construct whether recorded pollutants in the runoff are below the threshold level likewise there is still room for improvement concerning the mcda methods adopted for the weight assessment process but also for the calculation of the suitability index to exemplify the anp taking the potential interrelationship among criteria into account can be used to determine the criteria weights in the follow up attempts even though prior studies have used anp in the focalized topic it is worth noting that they applied the method to the whole criteria set even when they had parameters with no relationship between them hussaini et al 2021 kamangar et al 2019 here exploring the utilization of both ahp and anp for criteria posing non interdependence and those having interrelationships among each other respectively in the same mcda framework could be a valuable research direction for future studies in addition topsis offers a more sophisticated mathematical background for computing the suitability index than the often used gis overlay techniques employed in the pertinent literature yet it needs to be proven that this method has a higher accuracy in prioritizing and ranking the potential mar sites than the weighted and sum overlays hence adapting other mcda methodologies such as vikor and their fuzzified variants i e fuzzy topsis and fuzzy vikor handling some of the limitations of topsis could also serve as a guideline for future research it is evident that drywell suitability maps would be helpful for the decision makers since they allow them to narrow down the investigation area and concentrate their assessment on the limit zones nonetheless these maps should not be used as an end product but rather as part of the pre planning phase of a project jamali et al 2014 essentially such limitations are due to the fact that they do not account for the subsurface heterogeneity that affects not only drywell infiltration performance but also contaminants fate and transport according to händel et al 2014 the horizontal component of the hydraulic conductivity influences the recharge rate of drywells more than the vertical component in a similar vein sasidharan et al 2019 focalized on the role of subsurface heterogeneity in drywells infiltration performances through numerical and stochastic modeling the authors concluded that a much more thorough investigation of the subsurface is not required if only the recharge rate in drywell projects is a concern but if water quality is assessed including the fate and transport of pathogenic microbial contaminants besides infiltration performances a much more detailed estimation of the subsurface is expected therefore the follow up attempts containing the combination of drywells suitability maps and numerical modeling can not only enhance the robustness of the analysis but also help assess the infiltration performances and the contaminant attenuation potential of the vadose zone 7 conclusion drywells have proven their effectiveness and benefits compared to most mar technologies in recharging shallow urban aquifers throughout the years yet they are handicapped by the nonexistence of proper guidelines and standards regarding their implementation in most countries accordingly the fundamental goal of the current research is to identify the most determining factors regarding the implementation of drywells and hence a case study conducted in the urban city of kayseri to explore the areas suitable for artificial recharge through drywells by means of the integrated gis based mcda approach nine decision criteria were selected in relation to their influence on drywell sitting and recharge mechanism success and standardized through the fgd sessions in this vein the importance level of each criterion was determined using the fahp method while the application of the topsis model was performed to calculate the closeness coefficients of the alternatives i e sub regions with not only respect to the different criteria group but also the overall suitability the major outcomes of this study indicate that hydraulic conductivity depth to groundwater and soil texture play determinant roles in site suitability assessments while buffer distance from main roads is the least significant decision criterion the obtained weights were later compared to those adopted in the existing literature thus it was revealed that assigned weights are strongly consistent with the median of each pre defined set i e surface infiltration technologies and deep injection technologies for most criterion except hydraulic conductivity which display a much larger importance level in this study in contrast to other mar sites suitability mapping studies according to the site suitability maps generated for different criteria groups the findings pointed out the variations in regions closeness coefficient values and ranking for individual clusters however based on the overall suitability the city center shows very high to medium suitability for constructing the vadose zone wells the key findings of this study are that drywell sitting can be viewed as a multidimensional problem that requires not only consideration of subsurface variables but also surface and management parameters to improve infiltration performance recharged water and groundwater quality this type of problem is well suited to mcda methods since they enable the intervention of multidisciplinary experts to obtain the best overall judgment for robust results a further advantage of the mcda model is that it is very flexible and does not limit the number of parameters that can be included thus in the future if more criteria influencing drywell site prioritization are identified the model can easily be adjusted without requiring significant resources and or time a drywell suitability map can be integrated easily into an existing groundwater sustainability framework to help decision makers to evaluate a significant area before constructing vzr wells drywells can replenish stressed shallow urban aquifers but they can also be considered effective flood mitigation measures owing to their potential in conveying surface runoff to the underground hence the efforts devoted to exploring drywell suitability for a focalized region assist in both ensuring groundwater sustainability and mitigating the compound impacts of flooding incidents credit authorship contribution statement rachid mohamed mouhoumed conceptualization
