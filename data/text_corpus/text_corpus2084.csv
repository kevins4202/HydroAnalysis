10420,the concept of virtual water was first proposed by the geographer tony allan in 1993 referring to the amount of water needed to produce products and services research on virtual water has gradually increased in recent years this paper explored the current research status of virtual water from the aspects of virtual water accounting methods impact assessment and research limitations and gaps in terms of research methods in addition to continuing to use traditional virtual water accounting methods recent research also focuses on the use of input output model to calculate virtual water content the scenario analysis methods to predict future virtual water flow trends and the gravitational model to analyze driving factors the research content has also gradually diversified from quantifying the virtual water content of commodities and analyzing virtual water flow paths it has gradually evolved into temporal and spatial evolution of virtual water trade research combined with water footprint virtual water and economic development virtual water impact assessment analysis of virtual water flow driving force and other research content the prediction and driving factors analysis of virtual water need further research the availability and accuracy of data must be ensured so virtual water research still needs to be improved and perfected virtual water research is an interdisciplinary discipline involving hydrology socio economy and the ecological environment so future research should be conducted in conjunction with relevant knowledge in other disciplines and researching the impacts of virtual water trade on the formulation of regional trade policies and the regional ecological environment will provide a powerful reference for policy makers on the adjustment of regional trade patterns and management of water resources this paper can provide reference for virtual water researchers keywords virtual water research status quantification impact assessment limitations 1 introduction 1 1 overview of research progress with economic development and an increase in population the demand for water resources has been continuously increasing coupled with the irrational exploitation and utilization of water resources by humans many countries and regions have experienced varying degrees of water shortages this has become one of the major challenges facing the world in the 21st century global freshwater resources account for only 2 5 of the world s total water and this figure is also being reduced due to human activities climate change and other factors distefano and kelly 2017 many studies show that water shortages and water pollution problems will continue to intensify in the coming decades therefore triggering a series of issues such as restricted economic development lack of environmental sustainability and food insecurity alcamo et al 2007 bates and kundzewicz 2008 ercin and hoekstra 2012 pachauri and meyer 2014 due to the limited and uneven distribution of freshwater resources it is important to quantify where how and how much water resources are consumed such as industrial and agricultural production water eco environment construction water domestic water and virtual water included in commodity trade yang et al 2013 in 1993 geographer tony allan 1993 proposed the concept of virtual water meaning the quantity of water needed to produce products and services that is the amount of virtual water embedded in products and services tony allan s intention was to awaken people s attention to the phenomenon that economic trade has relieved the shortage of water resources in the middle east and north africa since then virtual water has been widely used as a quantitative evaluation index in the production chain of water resources input commodity trade economic output and played an important role in exploring the flow mechanism of water resources in the context of economic trade antonelli and sartori 2015 akoto danso et al 2019 with the expansion of production and consumption and the acceleration of globalization virtual water plays an increasingly important role in the research on water resource input and output on the local national and global scales and there are more and more studies on virtual water chen and chen 2011 2013 yu et al 2010 duarte et al 2016 fig 1 first of all virtual water is a new field of water resources and water safety research it breaks the traditional cognition of seeking ways to solve problems within the problem area and provides new ideas for solving internal problems in the region zhao et al 2009 2010 some water scarce countries such as israel and jordan have formulated planning policies to reduce the export of high moisture products virtual water strategy especially the export of crops to ensure the safety of local water resources shtull trauring and bernstein 2018 in addition in terms of water resource management it is different from the current mainstream management of water resources from both ends of supply opening new water sources water transfer and demand engineering construction improve terminal utilization efficiency virtual water comprehensively considers socio economic factors from a system perspective prompting mankind to improve water policies to increase the efficiency of water resource utilization and perfect the management of water resources lamastra et al 2017 ali et al 2018 wu et al 2019 at the beginning of the virtual water proposition many scholars studied the status of virtual water trade among regions by accounting for virtual water content in products from 1965 to 2010 the volume of virtual water traded in agricultural products and livestock products rose from 403 km3 to 1415 km3 with an average annual growth rate of 2 7 duarte et al 2016 the fastest growth rate was from 1990 to 2000 with an average annual growth rate of 3 8 clark et al 2015 agricultural products are the main carriers of virtual water trade hoekstra and hung 2005 calculated the virtual water trade volume of crops globally from 1995 to 1999 and found that 13 of the water used for crop production was not consumed domestically but exported as virtual water dalin et al 2012 focused on the virtual water trade network associated with international food trade built with annual trade data and found that the number of trade connections and the volume of water associated with global food trade more than doubled from 1986 to 2007 asia increased its virtual water imports by more than 170 and a dramatic rise in china s virtual water imports was associated with its increased soy imports after a domestic policy shift in 2000 this is mainly because china abolished the soybean quota restriction in 1999 implemented the single tariff policy of 3 and continued to use the tariff rate of 3 after joining the wto which was far lower than the average tariff rate of agricultural products before joining the wto liu and wu 2003 the low tariff policy greatly stimulated the soybean import of processing enterprises in addition china imposed a 13 percent value added tax on soybean imports which in effect completely liberalized china s soybean market and led to a sharp increase in soybean imports in addition to calculating the virtual water content of crops fader et al 2010 pointed out that the factors affecting the virtual water content of crops include rising temperatures rising atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration and carbon dioxide fertilization and predicted that potential changes in the virtual water content of crops would pose challenges to future water management and global trade policies the research on virtual water can be divided into global scale regional scale national scale and local scale virtual water trade research at the global scale consider all countries that import or export virtual water hoekstra and hung 2005 hanasaki et al 2010 siebert and d√∂ll 2010 chen and chen 2013 in addition to quantifying virtual water trade volume and analyzing global virtual water trade patterns duarte et al 2016 the drivers of trade pattern formation tamea et al 2014 tuninetti et al 2017 and the evaluation of virtual water flow clark et al 2015 han et al 2018 have also been studied regional scale studies include the exploration of virtual water flows among multiple countries in a region such as the effect of virtual water flows among eu countries on regional water resources agriculture and trade policies antonelli et al 2017 or the status of virtual water trade among countries in a basin vanham 2013 zeitoun et al 2010 masud et al 2019 assessed and analyzed historical 1985 2009 and future 2040 2064 yield and virtual water content of three cereal crops i e wheat barley and canola in alberta canada using the soil and water assessment tool swat and they found the trade export import of wheat grain from alberta to more than a hundred countries around the globe led to the annual saving of 5 billion m3 of virtual water during 1996 2005 their projections revealed an annual average export potential of 138 billion m3 of virtual water through the flow of these cereal crops in the form of both grain and other processed foods examples of water saving through trade are also found in the middle east and north africa mena region the mena region saved significant amounts of national water and land based on the import of four major crops namely barley maize rice and wheat within the period from 2000 to 2012 even if the food self sufficiency is still at a low level lee et al 2019 the research at the national level includes the status of virtual water flows between a country and its trading partners zhang et al 2016 distefano and kelly 2017 virtual water trade patterns under the influences of environmental and socio economic factors chouchane et al 2018 the evolution of virtual water trade in a country over time duarte et al 2014 judging whether a country can achieve self sufficiency in the supply of agricultural products by calculating virtual water content and analyzing the import and export of commodities da silva et al 2016d 1 2 main contents of existing virtual water research vos viewer software was used to do a similarity analysis of high frequency terms in the titles and abstracts of the articles and to generate a keyword tagging map fig 2 the analysis shows that virtual water research is mainly divided into three themes 1 in the context of international commodity trade virtual water flow and import and export between countries are studied the key words in the study mainly include trade virtual water trade commodity agricultural products import and export 2 case studies on regional water resource consumption mainly in china mainly analyzing virtual water flow between industrial sectors in china or among provinces and also including studies on energy related water use and regional water resource stress impact assessment 3 taking crops as the main research object many scholars analyzed the current status of virtual water flow of agricultural products mainly including wheat and rice including the calculation of virtual water content of agricultural products the impact evaluation of crop production water consumption on regional water resources and other associated effects of virtual water flow such as food security assessment environmental impact assessment etc in addition this part also involves the study of virtual water flow under regional social economy and climate change recent research on virtual water focuses more on the application of methods the input output model is more widely used it makes it possible to analyze virtual water flows among different industries and different sectors mubako et al 2013 zhang and anadon 2014 ali et al 2018 chen et al 2018 as for the analysis of the drivers of virtual water trade patterns many studies have applied the gravity law model decomposition analysis da multivariate regression analyses commonality analysis and other methods duarte et al 2014 tamea et al 2014 tuninetti et al 2017 gravity law model is a method commonly used in spatial econometrics to assess the factors that affect the trade flux between two regions bergstrand 1985 it mainly selects the factors affecting bilateral trade from the three aspects of supply demand and trade resistance and the model is usually estimated by multiple regression analysis methods decomposition analysis methods generally include structural decomposition analysis sda and index decomposition analysis ida supported by input output data and based on consumption coefficient matrix sda conducts detailed analysis of numerous influencing factors such as final demand and international trade which is an important tool for quantitative analysis of various influencing factors that lead to changes in economic structure in a certain period at present the widely used ida is the lmdi decomposition method this method is not only suitable for the decomposition of total indicators but also for the decomposition of strength indicators ang 2015 it differentiates variables according to different periods which not only solves the residual problem but also solves the problem of negative and zero values in the decomposition in the research on virtual water flow trend prediction methods such as ipcc rcp operations and oecd shared socio economic pathways ssps have mainly been used distefano and kelly 2017 zhuo et al 2016a clark et al 2015 used the temporal version of the self organizing map som and self organizing time map sotm which revealed a trend toward an increasing dependence on foreign water resources in various countries around the world from 1965 to 2010 since the introduction of the concept of virtual water a large number of studies have been carried out in various fields and disciplines a review article on virtual water research has important reference value for understanding the current status of virtual water research and conducting follow up research this paper reviewed the research on virtual water from the perspectives of virtual water research status virtual water accounting methods impact assessment based on virtual water trade research virtual water in agricultural water utilization debates about the evaluation indicator of virtual water and limitations in current virtual water research it is expected to provide ideas and references for the further development of virtual water and efficient and sustainable use of water resources 2 virtual water accounting methods overview the traditional view holds that the development utilization and management of water resources are mostly based on national or regional perspectives the countries formulate a reasonable water allocation plan according to the supply and demand of domestic water resources antonelli and sartori 2015 however with the development of international trade water resource became a transnational trade resource in a tangible or intangible state in order to solve the water shortage and realize sustainable development it is imperative to establish a research method with a wider range of applications and larger scale at present the most widely used method of virtual water accounting is virtual water accounting based on water footprint theory and virtual water accounting based on input output analysis ioa the former is more applied to the calculation of the virtual water content of agricultural products by calculating the water footprint of agricultural products the virtual water content of agricultural products can be obtained and the virtual water flow of agricultural products can be further obtained by combining the trade data of agricultural products fu et al 2018 akoto danso et al 2019 soligno et al 2019 input output analysis ioa is usually adopted in order to calculate water footprints across the whole supply chain including local production for final consumption and total direct and indirect water uses associated with imports for local use cai et al 2017 tian et al 2018 2 1 virtual water accounting based on water footprint theory the current research on virtual water and water footprint mostly studies the virtual water trade for agricultural products and the water footprint accounting of crops in general the virtual water content of an agricultural product is equal in quantity to its production water footprint yang et al 2013 therefore the water footprint of a product should be accounted for before the virtual water trade volume calculation the agricultural products water footprint consists of the blue water footprint green water footprint and gray water footprint blue water represents the consumption of surface water and groundwater in the production process green water refers to the amount of water used by crops that originates from precipitation but does not form runoff or does not replenish groundwater and grey water is the volume of fresh water required to dilute certain contaminants hoekstra 2003 based on the production process of agricultural products its water footprint is mainly the sum of blue water and green water which means the production of agricultural products mainly depends on rainfall surface water and groundwater so the water footprint of agricultural products is also the process water footprint of crop growth the method of calculating the water footprint of the crop growth process mainly includes the crop water requirement method allen et al 1998 the models frequently used in the calculation process include the cropwat model and the h08 global hydrological model hanasaki et al 2008a b sun et al 2012 cropwat8 0 fao database was designed by fao based on penman monteith model allen et al 1998 and the crop water requirement is computed by estimating the accumulated crop evapotranspiration etc mm day which is obtained by multiplying the reference crop evapotranspiration et0 by the crop coefficient kc as follows 1 e t c k c e t 0 crop water requirement method is mainly used to calculate the amount of green water and blue water wfgreen and wfblue consumed during the growth of crops the calculation process of the grey water footprint of crops is as follow 2 w f g r e y Œ± a r c max c n a t y where ar is the amount of fertilizer used per hectare kg ha Œ± is the leaching rate the proportion of pollution entering water body to the total amount of chemicals used cmax is the maximum allowable concentration kg m3 cnat the natural concentration for the pollutant considered kg m3 y is the crop yield ton ha the virtual water content of an agricultural product is equal to the water footprint of producing a certain amount of an agricultural product wf m3 kg 3 w f w f g r e e n w f b l u e w f g r e y 4 v w t w f t v where vwt is the virtual water trade volume of an agricultural product m3 tv is the trade volume of an agricultural product kg when using the h08 model to estimate virtual water flow in the simulation the virtual water source was specified using two categories green water and blue water consistent with global hydrological cycle blue water was further divided into three subcategories streamflow medium size reservoirs and nonrenewable and nonlocal blue water by combining the model outputs and statistics on crops livestock products and international trade both a global total estimate and a breakdown of virtual water exports by nation and region for major crops and livestock products will be obtained 2 2 virtual water accounting based on input output model early research on virtual water focused on quantifying the amount of water used per unit of product or in a certain production chain while the focus of research in recent years has gradually shifted to quantifying virtual water in watersheds regions or economic sectors and the most widely used research method in these studies is the input output model the input output model is an economic and mathematical model based on input output theory that uses the preparation of input output tables and the linear algebra tools to establish mathematical models it then reveals the internal links among various sectors of the national economy and various production stages for economic analysis forecasting and budget plans accordingly in addition it also helps to distinguish between direct virtual water usage and indirect virtual water usage freshwater resources are consumed in two ways one part is directly consumed that is directly consumed in the production of products and services the other part is consumed indirectly by other products and services in intermediate inputs hassan and rashid 2003 the input output analysis method not only considers the intermediate input of the product but also considers the indirect consumption of water resources thereby avoiding double counting and the input output analysis method can intuitively reflect the interdependence between industries because the data reflected by the input output model has a certain stability the various coefficients calculated based on the input output table are effective and stable for a long period guan and hubacek 2007 therefore the results of the water footprint based on the input output table can not only represent the characteristics of the water footprint of each department in the study area in the study year but also have certain representativeness for the water resource consumption in the subsequent period this shows that input output analysis has certain applicability to water footprint accounting and virtual water trade research according to the number of regions involved input output models can be divided into single region and multi region models peters and hertwich 2009 the input output model can not only calculate the volume of virtual water trade among different regions industries and sectors chen et al 2017 but also track the virtual water flow path in product trade according to the general relationship between industries fig 3 basic steps for quantifying virtual water using input output models include the water resource consumption expressed in physical units is added into the traditional input output table to form an n n matrix so as to obtain a mixed input output table of economic and water resource consumption then according to leontief input output model leontief 1986 we can obtain a similar input output model of water resources 5 d x l q where dx is the intermediate consumption matrix of industrial activities on water resources l is the amount of water resources consumed by the final demand sectors q is the total water consumption of each sector according to the water resource input output table a water consumption intensity coefficient is defined first 6 d j w j d x j where dj element of matrix d is the direct water consumption intensity coefficient w j d is the direct water consumption of sector j x j is the total input of sector j water consumption multiplier can be calculated by the direct water consumption intensity coefficient and the complete water consumption intensity coefficient 7 m j d t j d j 8 m j i n d t j d j 1 where m j d and m j i n d are the direct water consumption multiplier and the indirect water consumption multiplier respectively t j is complete water consumption coefficient the difference between the complete water consumption intensity coefficient matrix and the direct water consumption intensity coefficient matrix is defined as the inter departmental water utilization relation matrix w 9 w d i a 1 i where d is the diagonal matrix form of direct water consumption intensity coefficient i a 1 is leontief inverse matrix i is the identity matrix finally through the input output model of water resources the calculation method of indirect water consumption can be obtained which provides the possibility to calculate the flow of virtual water 10 d w f d i a 1 y ÀÜ 11 e w f d i a 1 e ÀÜ 12 m w f d i a 1 m ÀÜ 13 t w f d w f e w f m w f where dwf is the virtual water consumed by the local final demand y ÀÜ is the diagonal matrix form of the final demand ewf is virtual water consumed in the form of export e ÀÜ is the diagonal matrix form of the export mwf is the virtual water input in the form of import m ÀÜ is the diagonal matrix form of the import twf is the total virtual water 2 3 auxiliary evaluation indicators in virtual water trade research 14 water scarcity index wsi virtual water dependency index vwdi and water self sufficiency index wssi the wsi is determined based on the proportion of total water use by water availability smakhtin et al 2005 14 w s i w u w a where wsi is the national water scarcity index wu is total water use in the country m3 yr and wa is national water availability m3 yr the water scarcity index is divided into 4 levels when w s i 0 1 it means that the water resources in the evaluation area are abundant and the water scarcity is not serious when 0 1 w s i 0 2 it means that the degree of water shortage in the evaluation area is moderate when 0 2 w s i 0 4 it means that the degree of water shortage in the evaluation area is relatively high when 0 4 w s i it indicates that there is a serious shortage of water resources in the evaluation area and the water scarcity level is high the vwdi is used to illustrate the virtual water trade connections of an importing country or region with their major trading partners and to understand to what degree a nation relies on others to satisfy domestic water requirement chen and chen 2013 15 v w d i n v w i w u n v w i 100 if n w v i 0 0 if n v w i 0 where nvwi is the net virtual water imports to the country m3 yr a vwdi with a zero value shows that the gross virtual water imports and exports are well balanced or that there is net virtual water export on the other hand if the vwdi of a country gets closer to a hundred percent the country in question is said to be almost completely dependent on virtual water imports 16 w s s i 100 v w d i self sufficiency achieves 100 if all the water needed is available within the country s own territory the wssi is zero or close to zero when the country depends entirely on virtual water import da sliva et al 2016 hoekstra and hung 2005 15 theil index the theil index t is used to analyze spatial difference it can be decomposed into two sections the difference between the region tbr and the difference within the regional twr t tbr twr sun et al 2010 take the water footprint between regions in china as an example 17 t t b r t w r i 1 n v i log v i d i i 1 n v i j 1 m v i j log v i j d i j where n and m are respectively the number of regions and the number of provinces in the region vi and vij respectively represent the share of the water footprint of region i and the water footprint of province j belonging to region i in the total water footprint of china di and dij respectively represent the share of the gdp of region i and the gdp of province j belonging to region i in the total gdp of china the higher theil value the greater the difference of water footprint between different regions 16 falkenmark index the falkenmark index is used to measure the condition of water scarcity in a region falkenmark 1989 it is built by dividing the total actual renewable water resources of each country km3 yr as given by the food and agricultural organization of the united nations fao aquastat 2014 for the latest available years by the average population of the country over the 1993 2011 period the indicator identifies the countries affected by water stress as those having 1700 m3 yr per capita 17 water quantity scarcity index wqsi water quality scarcity index wqasi wqsi refers to the water scarcity arising from water consumption from local water resources it can be expressed as the ratio of the blue water footprint to the blue water available the wqasi refers to the water scarcity arising from the discharge of pollutants it was defined as the ratio of gray water footprint to the amount of local water resource availability cai et al 2017 if the wqasi 1 it means that the local available water resources are not enough for the assimilation of discharged pollutants and a given region faces quality induced water scarcity problems zeng et al 2013 fig 4 3 overview of impact assessment based on virtual water trade with the further development of virtual water research in addition to studying the virtual water content in products and the transfer of virtual water zhang and anadon 2014 ma and ma 2017 shtull trauring and bernstein 2018 research on the impact assessment of virtual water flow is also gradually deepening at present the main content about the impact assessment of virtual water flow includes the quantification of the impact of virtual water flow on regional water resources the influence of virtual water flow on regional social economy assessment on whether a region is suitable for implementing virtual water trade conducting regional virtual water flow impact assessments can determine whether virtual water flows are sustainable and provide a reference for decision makers in this section we will review the impact assessment of virtual water trade from the perspective of impact assessment methods impact of virtual water trade on regional water resource allocation and impacts of interregional trade on regional environment 3 1 two kinds of impact assessment methods for water resources use along with the decreasing and uneven distribution of available water resources in the world and a series of influences on water resource utilization many scholars have studied evaluation methods for water resources utilization of course this also includes the impact assessment of virtual water flow unep 2012 postle et al 2011 pfister et al 2017 currently the widely used evaluation methods include water footprint network wfn hoekstra et al 2011 and life cycle evaluation lca iso 14046 2014 jefferies et al 2012 fig 5 the concept of water footprint has emerged relatively recently introduced under the term of virtual water and coined as water footprint by hoekstra and hung 2002 it was adopted and further developed in a methodology guide by a non governmental organization called wfn in terms of evaluation purposes the wfn aims to account for water productivity of global fresh water as a limited resource to support better water management including its use and allocation gleeson et al 2012 hastings and pegram 2012 the wfn method assessing the use of freshwater resources in four steps including setting goals and scope water footprint accounting sustainability assessment and response formulation the accounting phase of wfn includes the quantification and mapping of freshwater use with three distinct types of water use the blue gray and green water footprints hoekstra and chapagain 2008 lca is a technique and method defined by the international organization for standardization iso for evaluating the potential impact of products on the environment throughout their life cycle i e from the acquisition of raw materials and production of products to the disposal of those products rebitzer et al 2004 lca aims to quantify the potential impact of a product or service on the environment boulay et al 2013 the evaluation steps of lca life cycle impact assessment methodologies generally include goal and scope inventory accounting impact assessment and interpretation gradually the lca developed comprehensive methodologies to include environmental impacts related to water in lca studies specifically reflected in the second and third steps the inventory analysis phase related to water of lca should include the inputs and outputs of each unit process in the study system specifically including water consumption water resource type water quality parameters water utilization mode affected geographic location time factor of water use substances discharged into the air water and soil in the phase of impact assessment according to the goal and scope of the analysis the potential environmental impact caused by changes in the volume water availability footprint or quality water degradation footprint of water should be considered and the water degradation footprint includes water eutrophication water acidification and water ecotoxicity etc iso 14046 2014 in terms of evaluation indicators both wfn and lca use quantitative indicators but in different phases of the assessment wfn particularly relies on water use indicators in the accounting phase while lca focuses on impact indicators in the impact assessment phase boulay et al 2013 pfister et al 2017 there is a certain difference when evaluating the same product using both wfn and lca ridoutt and pfister 2009 2010 evaluated the water consumption of two products dolmio pasta sauce 575 g and peanut m m s 250 g using the above two methods respectively the volumetric water footprint lca related includes unweighted green blue and grey water while the stress weighted water footprint wfn related a revised approach to water footprinting presents the same values but weighted by the water stress factor of 0 1 5 in the location of water use their results show that although peanut m m s volumetric water footprint 1152 l is much higher than dolmio pasta sauce 194 l its potential environmental impact stress weighted water footprint 12 2 l is smaller than dolmio pasta sauce 137 8 l this is mainly because peanut m m s main raw material cocoa is a rain fed crop that consumes a lot of water but since it is planted in a humid area with less water scarcity the potential environmental impact is small for dolmio pasta sauce its main ingredient tomato products contributed more than 95 of the stress weighted water footprint which is mainly due to the serious water shortage of the tomato purchase location in contrast sugar ranks second in the volumetric water footprint but it has almost no contribution to the stress weighted water footprint because the water shortage in its producing area is not serious the results of the bioenergy water footprint case study were compared in the same way for example when pressure weighted water footprint is applied maize is more favourable than sugar beet gerbens leenes et al 2009 again this illustrates the different conclusions drawn from different evaluation methods and the need for synchronization the areas covered by the water footprint network wfa and life cycle assessment lca are similar from an accounting perspective they are built on the same basic hydrological balance calculations however they come from different methodological backgrounds and origins and serve different purposes lca focuses more on analyzing material resource considerations and their impact especially water pollution while in recent years lca also has covered the quantitative aspects of water use koehler 2008 wfn adopts the volumetric method as a consumption based indicator and aims to provide information about a single product or at the company level in terms of sustainable equitable and efficient water management and allocation hoekstra 2003 it can be used at different levels river basin global product or enterprise due to differences in tradition and purpose these two methods produce slightly different solutions for assessing the impact of water resource utilization at present scholars are working hard to merge the two methods and try to determine the definition procedure or method that can be widely accepted these two evaluation methods have their advantages and can complement each other therefore scholars should pay more attention to how to apply these two methods more effectively or coordinate their applications to achieve the common goal of better protecting water resources rather than arguing about the pros and cons of each approach 3 2 impact of virtual water trade on regional water resource allocation the optimal allocation of water resources is the basis for the rational development and utilization of water resources and the fundamental guarantee for the sustainable utilization of water resources however due to the spatial and temporal distribution of regional water resources they do not fit with the layout of productivity and there is a great deal of water competition among regions and water use departments finally some improper ways of water resource exploitation and utilization lead to many ecological and environmental problems therefore it is more urgent to implement a rational allocation of water resources traditional allocation of water resources allocates physical water in the region to each water user according to the relationship between supply and demand or through the construction of the water diversion project to relieve water stress in water scarce areas if the allocation of regional water resources is combined with virtual water the results will change significantly fig 6 is the water resource demand distribution map of beijing china with and without virtual water trade taken into consideration ye et al 2018 there is a significant change in the water demand of each water sector after considering virtual water the demand for surface water groundwater and reclaimed water in agriculture is reduced while virtual water accounts for the majority of agricultural water use this is mainly because the blue water footprint used for agricultural production is greatly reduced and the proportion of surface water in urban and environmental water consumption increases in addition the industrial sector is more dependent on recycled water therefore from the point of view of virtual water the water resources saved from agricultural production can be distributed to other water use departments which can not only increase the utilization efficiency of water resources but also create greater economic output value for the region the original purpose of the virtual water trade was to ease the pressure on the water resources in the importing areas allan 1993 however in some virtual water flows such as china the virtual water flow trend in china is roughly from north to south it is exactly the opposite of the distribution of water resources in china the south has much and the north has less so the virtual water trade has the opposite effect superficially virtual water trade reduces the blue water footprint used to produce products in importing areas but it further increases the pressure of water resources in the exporting areas and may threaten local food security when the virtual water trade is driven by the regional economic level and related policies rather than the regional water resource endowments it will not relieve regional water scarcity but worsen the situation of water shortages zhuo et al 2016b one of the reasons for this unsustainable pattern of water use is that the role of water resources is underestimated in china that is relative to some factors such as economic and political water resource does not play an important role in production and consumption decision making zhang and anadon 2014 as the shortage of water resources is becoming an increasingly prominent bottleneck for sustainable development in china the status of water resources in the future should be improved some measures such as establishing a water price system diversifying water price management forms and legally granting water rights may be considered 3 3 impacts of commodity trade on regional environment 3 3 1 impacts of virtual water trade on regional water resources according to the types of water resources used the amount of water resources used and the location of water withdrawal the use of water resources will have different degrees of impact on the regional environment which mainly includes the impact on the quantity green water blue water and quality gray water of water resources virtual water trade will have different effects on the environment of the import and export regions respectively the distribution of water resources in china is extremely incompatible with the distribution of cultivated land resources water resources are mainly concentrated in the southern regions and the water volume reaches 80 of the total water resources in china wang et al 2014 while the cultivated land resources are mainly concentrated in the northern regions due to the influence of social economy climatic conditions and water infrastructure china has a trade pattern of north grain south transportation sun et al 2013 this allows a large amount of virtual water embedded in grain to be transported from the water deficient northern regions to the water abundant southern regions on the one hand this kind of trade pattern further aggravates the pressure on water resources and further worsens the water environment in the northern regions of china on the other hand for the southern regions transporting grain from the north has saved local water resources for industrial production to promote regional economic development finally at the national level when virtual water flows from an area with high water use efficiency to an area with low water use efficiency water conservation benefits can be achieved sun et al 2016 and the amount of water saved can be used for the construction of the regional ecological environment and the development of other industries the gray water footprint represents water pollution and refers to the amount of fresh water resources needed to dilute water pollution mekonnen and hoekstra 2010a which can be used to react to regional differences in production technology levels different products have different gray water footprints different regions producing the same product also have different gray water footprints zhang et al 2017 currently due to material and data limitations only a few studies have quantified the pollutants such as chemical oxygen demand and nitrogen zeng et al 2013 zhi et al 2015 mekonnen and hoekstra 2015 by investigating the water use and consumption patterns of shanghai china s largest city zhao et al 2016 found that shanghai has relied on trade with other provinces in china to outsource local water quantity and quality burden thereby alleviating its own environmental pressure therefore it is necessary to quantify the gray water footprint of different sectors and products as well as include gray water footprint as an important part of virtual water trade research then develop some relevant indicators that can better reflect the impact of virtual water flows on the regional environment 3 3 2 virtual water in agricultural water resources utilization agriculture is the main water user and the production consumption link of agricultural products contains the conversion of physical water to virtual water and the process of virtual water flow driven by the factors of nature economy and society the physical water and virtual water feedback and interact with each other in the process of agricultural production and consumption carrying out research on agricultural virtual water identifying the mechanism of morphological transformation of water resources the driving force of the flow process and the main control factors of flow flux deconstructing the coupling process and law of agricultural physical virtual water from different spatial and temporal scales and analyzing the multiple impacts of coupled flows of agricultural physical virtual water on the economy society ecology and environment is of great significance for regulating the production side physical water and demand side virtual water and achieving efficient and sustainable use of agricultural water resources this is also the main reason why this article summarizes the research progress of agricultural virtual water in detail previous studies on agricultural water use have focused more on physical water such as crop water consumption irrigation and drainage saline alkali management rainwater collection and groundwater utilization and the interaction between agricultural water management and the environment flood soil erosion non point source pollution the impact of climate change on agricultural water at present the concept of virtual water has gradually appeared in the research related to agricultural water with the adjustment of regional industrial structure and the frequent trade between regions the utilization and management of water resources is no longer a problem that can be solved independently by a region or an industry but the water use situation of each industry in each region should be considered as a whole chouchane et al 2018 therefore the utilization and management of agricultural water resources cannot only rely on traditional technologies and methods the emergence of virtual water provides new theories and ideas for agricultural water management and it is a new method that should be paid attention to and developed at present the research on virtual water in agricultural water can be roughly divided into 1 the accounting of virtual water content of agricultural products and the virtual water flowing law between regions 2 influence of virtual water flow of agricultural products on regional water resources water quantity water quality water resource management policies etc 3 the influence of climate change crop planting mode technology and other factors on the virtual water content of agricultural products 4 analysis of driving factors of virtual water flow related to agricultural products wang et al 2017 analyzed the relationship between agricultural water rights trading and virtual water export compensation and established a bi level programming model with multiple objectives and they found compensation for crop virtual water export can increase the benefits of agricultural water use the premise of evaluating virtual water flow is to calculate the virtual water content in the product and the water footprint method is a common method zhuo et al 2016b started from the growth consumption and trade of crops in china and then selected climate technology population diet and other factors to set scenarios to predict and analyze the water footprint of crops and they concluded that china could achieve a high degree of food self sufficiency and agricultural water consumption would be reduced in the future in the context of free trade in products optimizing irrigation systems appropriately adjusting water prices and optimizing product trade patterns are all measures that should be considered for agricultural water resources management jinwon and sandy 2018 4 discussion 4 1 the bridge in socio hydrology virtual water trade sivapalan et al 2012 proposed the concept of socio hydrology in the context of human activities becoming an intrinsic factor in the water cycle process and sustainable use of water resources covering many factors such as nature society and humanities it is mainly used to explore the bidirectional feedback mode and the dynamic mechanism of co evolution of the coupled human water systems and to solve the problems of sustainable use of water resources faced by human beings today since the 1970s the market economy has been on the right track and economic development has been increasing faster and faster there has been more and more economic trade among different countries and regions and exchanges of commodities and services among regions have become more frequent virtual water is thus gradually becoming a bridge and medium for human activities to affect the hydrological system fig 7 in the production process of products and services water resources mostly participate in the form of physical water with regard to the processing sale and consumption of commodities water resources mostly participate in the form of virtual water wang et al 2009 zhang 2016 economic production is based on the withdrawal of freshwater resources physical water from nature and freshwater resources are converted into virtual water through production and processing then embedded in products from various economic sectors virtual water in part directly forms the final output of various economic sectors along with the trade of products which flows to local domestic water or becomes the local fixed asset at this time virtual water is a bridge for water transfer between water departments within the region the other part of virtual water the middle use part flows back to economic production again and becomes a raw material for other economic sectors commodities produced in the region are exported to other regions through trade and virtual water is a bridge for water exchange between regions on the one hand tracking the virtual water flow path can be used to determine whether the regional economic structure and the virtual water flow framework is sustainable and to analyze the relationship between the economic sector s production potential and water use conversely it can also be used to weigh the relationship between the utilization of water resources and the maximization of economic efficiency thus providing a method for effectively alleviating regional water shortages wang et al 2014 4 2 debates about the evaluation indicator of virtual water the concept of virtual water and water footprint has attracted the attention of scholars engaged in water resources some authors believe that the virtual water concept provides new ideas and new methods for global water management by calculating the water footprint of commodities consumers and services they indicated that countries or regions with water shortages should import water intensive products from water rich countries or regions water rich countries should focus on producing and exporting water intensive commodities yang and zehnder 2002 hoekstra and hung 2005 vel√°zquez 2007 chapagain and hoekstra 2008 winter et al 2014 many scholars have suggested that virtual water should be considered when formulating national trade strategies and agricultural and water development strategies based on the virtual water theory water conservation and water pollution prevention can be achieved by adjusting international trade patterns and consumer preference rudenko et al 2013 duarte et al 2014 shi et al 2014 zhang and anadon 2014 zoumides et al 2014 zhao et al 2016 in a sense a lot of researches show that the concept of virtual water and water footprint has indeed opened up new fields in water resources research but at the same time it has also been questioned and denied the discussion about what the concept of vwt and wf in narrow sense and the field in broader sense offer and what not is getting more and more intense first the concept of virtual water and water footprints has been questioned they are compelling notions but notably flawed wichelns 2011 then water resources are global resources that the virtual water theory believes is controversial wichelns 2015a claims that water shortages and water pollution are local problems and not global consumers in one country should not be held responsible for water shortages and water pollution in another country and they cannot alleviate water shortages and water pollution in another country because water shortages are caused by local over exploitation water pollution is caused by local improper human activities which are all local reasons in terms of the factors affecting international trade patterns de fraiture et al 2004 argued that political and economic strategies may have a greater impact on international trade than water shortages wichelns 2010a b examined the estimates of virtual water imports and exports prepared for 77 countries by chapagain and hoekstra 2004 and he found that land resource endowment was a more appropriate indicator than water endowment when describing agricultural products trade some economists pointed out that the virtual water trade research only quantified the virtual water content of trade products without considering the technical level and opportunity cost of the trading countries and did not consider the comparative advantage of each country japan germany south korea and other countries import a large amount of virtual water may not be attributed to water shortage or food production shortage but because the development of industry services and other industries in the country will bring greater benefits than agriculture gawel and bernsen 2013 wichelns 2015b as a whole the evaluation index of virtual water has both praise and criticism which indicates that this index has its merits but also has its disadvantages therefore some authors should analyze the problems dialectically when studying virtual water so as to apply this index rationally 4 3 limitations in current virtual water research although virtual water research has achieved many results there are still some limitations fig 8 taking into account the data from the virtual water trade study the main issues are the data gap and the availability of data including the quality and accuracy of the data and a series of assumptions when applying the model in the calculation of agricultural product water footprints some studies applied the value of water research report series no 47 mekonnen and hoekstra 2010a and no 48 mekonnen and hoekstra 2010b there are many uncertainties in these two reports and due to the lack of data a series of assumptions have been made for example some specific irrigation maps can only be applied to certain crops other crops are obtained by referring to the mirca 2000 database with some simple assumptions for irrigated agriculture it is assumed that all irrigation can fully meet the irrigation requirements the situation of fertilizer application in crops is also based on assumptions because there is no available data and the gray water footprint is also estimated roughly based on a simple calculation method in terms of crop models it is first assumed that the growth period planting date growth period of the crop is fixed and the effect of temperature change during the crop growth period is ignored the initial moisture content of the soil is then assumed to be fixed and the impacts of water stress biological stress and diseases and insect pests on crop growth are ignored zhang et al 2016 2018 zhuo et al 2016b in report 48 regarding the footprint of animal products the report ignored the indirect water footprint of raw materials used for feed production and animal feeding and also failed to quantify the gray water footprint from animals some other related issues in the production of animal products such as micro or macro production costs livelihoods of small farmers public health and other environmental issues have not been fully considered zhang et al 2016 lack of up to date high quality data often impedes the conduct of virtual water and water footprint research one of the most difficult challenges in using input output analysis in practice is to aggregate the detailed basic data needed to build an input output table miller and blair 2009 reliable statistics on water resources utilization are very important for the formulation of input output relations between economic sectors while the formulation of input output tables usually takes a lot of time mainly due to the heavy task of data collection and processing and data processing is usually not public which makes it difficult to obtain detailed data mubako et al 2013 used an input output model to analyze virtual water transfer profiles in california and illinois in the usa since the data came from a secondary source such as the usgs the data generated estimation errors in the process of transmission the economic data of the two states also have varying degrees of deficiencies in addition the article did not quantify the impact of sewage due to the restriction on data collection some studies based on input output analysis used the single area input output model to analyze the virtual water flow of the economy and due to a lack of available data these studies ignore imported virtual water in the economy zhao et al 2016 or equate imported virtual water with local production water guo et al 2016 renault 2003 zhao et al 2009 these limitations from data may eventually cause deviations in the results of the studies shao et al 2017 in addition since the concept of virtual water was put forward there have been more and more research articles on virtual water flows virtual water trade and the accounting of virtual water and water footprint but the object of study in these articles is mostly agricultural products or agricultural sectors bae and dall erba 2018 lamastra et al 2017 sun et al 2016 trottier and perrier 2017 zhang et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 2018 there are relatively few studies on virtual water content accounting and flow analysis for industrial products aquatic products service industries or food processing from the world average although the agricultural sector accounts for 69 of the total withdrawals the virtual water content of agricultural products accounts for only 35 of the total global demand for virtual water as a major component of the regional water footprint the global virtual water trade amounts to 30 of the direct water withdrawal of which 43 of the virtual water trade volume is related to food and 57 is contained in non food trade chen and chen 2013 therefore in order to further explore mechanisms of virtual water flow and improve the efficiency of water resource utilization virtual water accounting and flow analysis of non agricultural products is more important and corresponding research should be conducted 4 4 hot issues of current research when it comes to the flow of virtual water we naturally think of what caused the virtual water flow and what the consequences will the virtual water flow produce if the impact assessment is the consequence of virtual water flow then the virtual water flow mechanism is to explore what triggered the flow of virtual water above we have already seen the impact of virtual water flow on the region meanwhile some scholars have studied the virtual water flow mechanism the conceptual framework of gravity laws which are often used to explain network fluxes in fields such as trade transportation and migration anderson 1979 bergstrand 1985 the flow of virtual water can be seen as economic trade so some scholars use the trade gravity model to analyze the driving factors of virtual water flow moreover this method can simultaneously consider the factors affecting the virtual water flow such as the socio economic and resource endowments of the bilateral virtual water transfers tamea et al 2014 cai et al 2019 in related research gdp population water resources cultivated land resources geographical distance and other dummy variables between trading partners are usually selected as factors affecting the flow of virtual water fracasso 2014 duarte et al 2019 used the well known trade gravity model to explain exchanges of bilateral virtual water transfers among 70 countries on the basis of economic geographical institutional and environmental factors and they indicated that the traditional economic institutional and geographic factors played a key role as drivers of virtual water bilateral trade flows between 1965 and 2010 in addition to trade gravity model logarithmic mean divisia index lmdi method is also adopted for uncovering the driving factors of virtual water flow for example qian et al 2019 used lmdi and they found that trade structure was an obvious positive effect while the effects of water intensity product structure and trade scale shifted in favor of virtual water outflows from bri the belt and road initiative countries to china in 2008 it can be found from the virtual water articles published that the city is actually the main body of a country s virtual water import so the urban virtual water has gradually become a research hotspot rushforth and ruddell 2016 in addition ruddell et al 2014 proposed the concepts and methods of coupled natural human systems cnh and embedded resource accounting era they used this method to calculate the virtual water flow in the electric power sector in the western united states and revealed the interaction between the water resource system and the electric power system and provided suggestions for decision makers and managers the relationship between virtual water trade and regional economy is also a research field that scholars pay more attention to rushforth and ruddell 2015 mayer et al 2016 rushforth and ruddell 2018 as afkhami et al 2018 studied capital endowment is a more important factor driving virtual water flow than water endowment 5 conclusion this article reviewed the research status of virtual water from the aspects of virtual water accounting method virtual water trade impact assessment regional water allocation regional economy and regional environment the limitations and gaps the controversy of virtual water and the hot issue of current research based on the perspective of society environment and resources with regard to the flow of virtual water in production trade and consumer systems on international national basin and regional scales and the influence of virtual water flow on regional water resources the current researches have made great progress while there are relatively few studies about the driving factors of virtual water flow the evaluation and prediction of virtual water flow mode and the influence of virtual water flow on regional environment in terms of research methods in addition to continuing to use traditional virtual water accounting methods the recent research also focuses on the use of input output models to account for virtual water using scenario analysis methods to predict future virtual water flow trends and uses gravitational models to analyze driving factors the application of these methods has promoted the further development of virtual water research the research content has also gradually diversified from quantifying the virtual water content of commodities and analyzing virtual water flow paths it has gradually evolved into a temporal and spatial evolution of virtual water trade research combined with water footprint virtual water and economic development virtual water impact assessment virtual water and bilateral contradictions and other research content making the research content of virtual water more complete virtual water research still needs to be improved and perfected the prediction and driving factors analysis of virtual water need further research the availability and accuracy of data must be ensured virtual water research is an interdisciplinary discipline involving hydrology socio economy and ecological environment so future research and should be conducted in conjunction with relevant knowledge in other disciplines although most studies have confirmed that virtual water can alleviate regional water shortage some scholars hold a negative view so its applicability should be prudently considered when applying virtual water indicators declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

10420,the concept of virtual water was first proposed by the geographer tony allan in 1993 referring to the amount of water needed to produce products and services research on virtual water has gradually increased in recent years this paper explored the current research status of virtual water from the aspects of virtual water accounting methods impact assessment and research limitations and gaps in terms of research methods in addition to continuing to use traditional virtual water accounting methods recent research also focuses on the use of input output model to calculate virtual water content the scenario analysis methods to predict future virtual water flow trends and the gravitational model to analyze driving factors the research content has also gradually diversified from quantifying the virtual water content of commodities and analyzing virtual water flow paths it has gradually evolved into temporal and spatial evolution of virtual water trade research combined with water footprint virtual water and economic development virtual water impact assessment analysis of virtual water flow driving force and other research content the prediction and driving factors analysis of virtual water need further research the availability and accuracy of data must be ensured so virtual water research still needs to be improved and perfected virtual water research is an interdisciplinary discipline involving hydrology socio economy and the ecological environment so future research should be conducted in conjunction with relevant knowledge in other disciplines and researching the impacts of virtual water trade on the formulation of regional trade policies and the regional ecological environment will provide a powerful reference for policy makers on the adjustment of regional trade patterns and management of water resources this paper can provide reference for virtual water researchers keywords virtual water research status quantification impact assessment limitations 1 introduction 1 1 overview of research progress with economic development and an increase in population the demand for water resources has been continuously increasing coupled with the irrational exploitation and utilization of water resources by humans many countries and regions have experienced varying degrees of water shortages this has become one of the major challenges facing the world in the 21st century global freshwater resources account for only 2 5 of the world s total water and this figure is also being reduced due to human activities climate change and other factors distefano and kelly 2017 many studies show that water shortages and water pollution problems will continue to intensify in the coming decades therefore triggering a series of issues such as restricted economic development lack of environmental sustainability and food insecurity alcamo et al 2007 bates and kundzewicz 2008 ercin and hoekstra 2012 pachauri and meyer 2014 due to the limited and uneven distribution of freshwater resources it is important to quantify where how and how much water resources are consumed such as industrial and agricultural production water eco environment construction water domestic water and virtual water included in commodity trade yang et al 2013 in 1993 geographer tony allan 1993 proposed the concept of virtual water meaning the quantity of water needed to produce products and services that is the amount of virtual water embedded in products and services tony allan s intention was to awaken people s attention to the phenomenon that economic trade has relieved the shortage of water resources in the middle east and north africa since then virtual water has been widely used as a quantitative evaluation index in the production chain of water resources input commodity trade economic output and played an important role in exploring the flow mechanism of water resources in the context of economic trade antonelli and sartori 2015 akoto danso et al 2019 with the expansion of production and consumption and the acceleration of globalization virtual water plays an increasingly important role in the research on water resource input and output on the local national and global scales and there are more and more studies on virtual water chen and chen 2011 2013 yu et al 2010 duarte et al 2016 fig 1 first of all virtual water is a new field of water resources and water safety research it breaks the traditional cognition of seeking ways to solve problems within the problem area and provides new ideas for solving internal problems in the region zhao et al 2009 2010 some water scarce countries such as israel and jordan have formulated planning policies to reduce the export of high moisture products virtual water strategy especially the export of crops to ensure the safety of local water resources shtull trauring and bernstein 2018 in addition in terms of water resource management it is different from the current mainstream management of water resources from both ends of supply opening new water sources water transfer and demand engineering construction improve terminal utilization efficiency virtual water comprehensively considers socio economic factors from a system perspective prompting mankind to improve water policies to increase the efficiency of water resource utilization and perfect the management of water resources lamastra et al 2017 ali et al 2018 wu et al 2019 at the beginning of the virtual water proposition many scholars studied the status of virtual water trade among regions by accounting for virtual water content in products from 1965 to 2010 the volume of virtual water traded in agricultural products and livestock products rose from 403 km3 to 1415 km3 with an average annual growth rate of 2 7 duarte et al 2016 the fastest growth rate was from 1990 to 2000 with an average annual growth rate of 3 8 clark et al 2015 agricultural products are the main carriers of virtual water trade hoekstra and hung 2005 calculated the virtual water trade volume of crops globally from 1995 to 1999 and found that 13 of the water used for crop production was not consumed domestically but exported as virtual water dalin et al 2012 focused on the virtual water trade network associated with international food trade built with annual trade data and found that the number of trade connections and the volume of water associated with global food trade more than doubled from 1986 to 2007 asia increased its virtual water imports by more than 170 and a dramatic rise in china s virtual water imports was associated with its increased soy imports after a domestic policy shift in 2000 this is mainly because china abolished the soybean quota restriction in 1999 implemented the single tariff policy of 3 and continued to use the tariff rate of 3 after joining the wto which was far lower than the average tariff rate of agricultural products before joining the wto liu and wu 2003 the low tariff policy greatly stimulated the soybean import of processing enterprises in addition china imposed a 13 percent value added tax on soybean imports which in effect completely liberalized china s soybean market and led to a sharp increase in soybean imports in addition to calculating the virtual water content of crops fader et al 2010 pointed out that the factors affecting the virtual water content of crops include rising temperatures rising atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration and carbon dioxide fertilization and predicted that potential changes in the virtual water content of crops would pose challenges to future water management and global trade policies the research on virtual water can be divided into global scale regional scale national scale and local scale virtual water trade research at the global scale consider all countries that import or export virtual water hoekstra and hung 2005 hanasaki et al 2010 siebert and d√∂ll 2010 chen and chen 2013 in addition to quantifying virtual water trade volume and analyzing global virtual water trade patterns duarte et al 2016 the drivers of trade pattern formation tamea et al 2014 tuninetti et al 2017 and the evaluation of virtual water flow clark et al 2015 han et al 2018 have also been studied regional scale studies include the exploration of virtual water flows among multiple countries in a region such as the effect of virtual water flows among eu countries on regional water resources agriculture and trade policies antonelli et al 2017 or the status of virtual water trade among countries in a basin vanham 2013 zeitoun et al 2010 masud et al 2019 assessed and analyzed historical 1985 2009 and future 2040 2064 yield and virtual water content of three cereal crops i e wheat barley and canola in alberta canada using the soil and water assessment tool swat and they found the trade export import of wheat grain from alberta to more than a hundred countries around the globe led to the annual saving of 5 billion m3 of virtual water during 1996 2005 their projections revealed an annual average export potential of 138 billion m3 of virtual water through the flow of these cereal crops in the form of both grain and other processed foods examples of water saving through trade are also found in the middle east and north africa mena region the mena region saved significant amounts of national water and land based on the import of four major crops namely barley maize rice and wheat within the period from 2000 to 2012 even if the food self sufficiency is still at a low level lee et al 2019 the research at the national level includes the status of virtual water flows between a country and its trading partners zhang et al 2016 distefano and kelly 2017 virtual water trade patterns under the influences of environmental and socio economic factors chouchane et al 2018 the evolution of virtual water trade in a country over time duarte et al 2014 judging whether a country can achieve self sufficiency in the supply of agricultural products by calculating virtual water content and analyzing the import and export of commodities da silva et al 2016d 1 2 main contents of existing virtual water research vos viewer software was used to do a similarity analysis of high frequency terms in the titles and abstracts of the articles and to generate a keyword tagging map fig 2 the analysis shows that virtual water research is mainly divided into three themes 1 in the context of international commodity trade virtual water flow and import and export between countries are studied the key words in the study mainly include trade virtual water trade commodity agricultural products import and export 2 case studies on regional water resource consumption mainly in china mainly analyzing virtual water flow between industrial sectors in china or among provinces and also including studies on energy related water use and regional water resource stress impact assessment 3 taking crops as the main research object many scholars analyzed the current status of virtual water flow of agricultural products mainly including wheat and rice including the calculation of virtual water content of agricultural products the impact evaluation of crop production water consumption on regional water resources and other associated effects of virtual water flow such as food security assessment environmental impact assessment etc in addition this part also involves the study of virtual water flow under regional social economy and climate change recent research on virtual water focuses more on the application of methods the input output model is more widely used it makes it possible to analyze virtual water flows among different industries and different sectors mubako et al 2013 zhang and anadon 2014 ali et al 2018 chen et al 2018 as for the analysis of the drivers of virtual water trade patterns many studies have applied the gravity law model decomposition analysis da multivariate regression analyses commonality analysis and other methods duarte et al 2014 tamea et al 2014 tuninetti et al 2017 gravity law model is a method commonly used in spatial econometrics to assess the factors that affect the trade flux between two regions bergstrand 1985 it mainly selects the factors affecting bilateral trade from the three aspects of supply demand and trade resistance and the model is usually estimated by multiple regression analysis methods decomposition analysis methods generally include structural decomposition analysis sda and index decomposition analysis ida supported by input output data and based on consumption coefficient matrix sda conducts detailed analysis of numerous influencing factors such as final demand and international trade which is an important tool for quantitative analysis of various influencing factors that lead to changes in economic structure in a certain period at present the widely used ida is the lmdi decomposition method this method is not only suitable for the decomposition of total indicators but also for the decomposition of strength indicators ang 2015 it differentiates variables according to different periods which not only solves the residual problem but also solves the problem of negative and zero values in the decomposition in the research on virtual water flow trend prediction methods such as ipcc rcp operations and oecd shared socio economic pathways ssps have mainly been used distefano and kelly 2017 zhuo et al 2016a clark et al 2015 used the temporal version of the self organizing map som and self organizing time map sotm which revealed a trend toward an increasing dependence on foreign water resources in various countries around the world from 1965 to 2010 since the introduction of the concept of virtual water a large number of studies have been carried out in various fields and disciplines a review article on virtual water research has important reference value for understanding the current status of virtual water research and conducting follow up research this paper reviewed the research on virtual water from the perspectives of virtual water research status virtual water accounting methods impact assessment based on virtual water trade research virtual water in agricultural water utilization debates about the evaluation indicator of virtual water and limitations in current virtual water research it is expected to provide ideas and references for the further development of virtual water and efficient and sustainable use of water resources 2 virtual water accounting methods overview the traditional view holds that the development utilization and management of water resources are mostly based on national or regional perspectives the countries formulate a reasonable water allocation plan according to the supply and demand of domestic water resources antonelli and sartori 2015 however with the development of international trade water resource became a transnational trade resource in a tangible or intangible state in order to solve the water shortage and realize sustainable development it is imperative to establish a research method with a wider range of applications and larger scale at present the most widely used method of virtual water accounting is virtual water accounting based on water footprint theory and virtual water accounting based on input output analysis ioa the former is more applied to the calculation of the virtual water content of agricultural products by calculating the water footprint of agricultural products the virtual water content of agricultural products can be obtained and the virtual water flow of agricultural products can be further obtained by combining the trade data of agricultural products fu et al 2018 akoto danso et al 2019 soligno et al 2019 input output analysis ioa is usually adopted in order to calculate water footprints across the whole supply chain including local production for final consumption and total direct and indirect water uses associated with imports for local use cai et al 2017 tian et al 2018 2 1 virtual water accounting based on water footprint theory the current research on virtual water and water footprint mostly studies the virtual water trade for agricultural products and the water footprint accounting of crops in general the virtual water content of an agricultural product is equal in quantity to its production water footprint yang et al 2013 therefore the water footprint of a product should be accounted for before the virtual water trade volume calculation the agricultural products water footprint consists of the blue water footprint green water footprint and gray water footprint blue water represents the consumption of surface water and groundwater in the production process green water refers to the amount of water used by crops that originates from precipitation but does not form runoff or does not replenish groundwater and grey water is the volume of fresh water required to dilute certain contaminants hoekstra 2003 based on the production process of agricultural products its water footprint is mainly the sum of blue water and green water which means the production of agricultural products mainly depends on rainfall surface water and groundwater so the water footprint of agricultural products is also the process water footprint of crop growth the method of calculating the water footprint of the crop growth process mainly includes the crop water requirement method allen et al 1998 the models frequently used in the calculation process include the cropwat model and the h08 global hydrological model hanasaki et al 2008a b sun et al 2012 cropwat8 0 fao database was designed by fao based on penman monteith model allen et al 1998 and the crop water requirement is computed by estimating the accumulated crop evapotranspiration etc mm day which is obtained by multiplying the reference crop evapotranspiration et0 by the crop coefficient kc as follows 1 e t c k c e t 0 crop water requirement method is mainly used to calculate the amount of green water and blue water wfgreen and wfblue consumed during the growth of crops the calculation process of the grey water footprint of crops is as follow 2 w f g r e y Œ± a r c max c n a t y where ar is the amount of fertilizer used per hectare kg ha Œ± is the leaching rate the proportion of pollution entering water body to the total amount of chemicals used cmax is the maximum allowable concentration kg m3 cnat the natural concentration for the pollutant considered kg m3 y is the crop yield ton ha the virtual water content of an agricultural product is equal to the water footprint of producing a certain amount of an agricultural product wf m3 kg 3 w f w f g r e e n w f b l u e w f g r e y 4 v w t w f t v where vwt is the virtual water trade volume of an agricultural product m3 tv is the trade volume of an agricultural product kg when using the h08 model to estimate virtual water flow in the simulation the virtual water source was specified using two categories green water and blue water consistent with global hydrological cycle blue water was further divided into three subcategories streamflow medium size reservoirs and nonrenewable and nonlocal blue water by combining the model outputs and statistics on crops livestock products and international trade both a global total estimate and a breakdown of virtual water exports by nation and region for major crops and livestock products will be obtained 2 2 virtual water accounting based on input output model early research on virtual water focused on quantifying the amount of water used per unit of product or in a certain production chain while the focus of research in recent years has gradually shifted to quantifying virtual water in watersheds regions or economic sectors and the most widely used research method in these studies is the input output model the input output model is an economic and mathematical model based on input output theory that uses the preparation of input output tables and the linear algebra tools to establish mathematical models it then reveals the internal links among various sectors of the national economy and various production stages for economic analysis forecasting and budget plans accordingly in addition it also helps to distinguish between direct virtual water usage and indirect virtual water usage freshwater resources are consumed in two ways one part is directly consumed that is directly consumed in the production of products and services the other part is consumed indirectly by other products and services in intermediate inputs hassan and rashid 2003 the input output analysis method not only considers the intermediate input of the product but also considers the indirect consumption of water resources thereby avoiding double counting and the input output analysis method can intuitively reflect the interdependence between industries because the data reflected by the input output model has a certain stability the various coefficients calculated based on the input output table are effective and stable for a long period guan and hubacek 2007 therefore the results of the water footprint based on the input output table can not only represent the characteristics of the water footprint of each department in the study area in the study year but also have certain representativeness for the water resource consumption in the subsequent period this shows that input output analysis has certain applicability to water footprint accounting and virtual water trade research according to the number of regions involved input output models can be divided into single region and multi region models peters and hertwich 2009 the input output model can not only calculate the volume of virtual water trade among different regions industries and sectors chen et al 2017 but also track the virtual water flow path in product trade according to the general relationship between industries fig 3 basic steps for quantifying virtual water using input output models include the water resource consumption expressed in physical units is added into the traditional input output table to form an n n matrix so as to obtain a mixed input output table of economic and water resource consumption then according to leontief input output model leontief 1986 we can obtain a similar input output model of water resources 5 d x l q where dx is the intermediate consumption matrix of industrial activities on water resources l is the amount of water resources consumed by the final demand sectors q is the total water consumption of each sector according to the water resource input output table a water consumption intensity coefficient is defined first 6 d j w j d x j where dj element of matrix d is the direct water consumption intensity coefficient w j d is the direct water consumption of sector j x j is the total input of sector j water consumption multiplier can be calculated by the direct water consumption intensity coefficient and the complete water consumption intensity coefficient 7 m j d t j d j 8 m j i n d t j d j 1 where m j d and m j i n d are the direct water consumption multiplier and the indirect water consumption multiplier respectively t j is complete water consumption coefficient the difference between the complete water consumption intensity coefficient matrix and the direct water consumption intensity coefficient matrix is defined as the inter departmental water utilization relation matrix w 9 w d i a 1 i where d is the diagonal matrix form of direct water consumption intensity coefficient i a 1 is leontief inverse matrix i is the identity matrix finally through the input output model of water resources the calculation method of indirect water consumption can be obtained which provides the possibility to calculate the flow of virtual water 10 d w f d i a 1 y ÀÜ 11 e w f d i a 1 e ÀÜ 12 m w f d i a 1 m ÀÜ 13 t w f d w f e w f m w f where dwf is the virtual water consumed by the local final demand y ÀÜ is the diagonal matrix form of the final demand ewf is virtual water consumed in the form of export e ÀÜ is the diagonal matrix form of the export mwf is the virtual water input in the form of import m ÀÜ is the diagonal matrix form of the import twf is the total virtual water 2 3 auxiliary evaluation indicators in virtual water trade research 14 water scarcity index wsi virtual water dependency index vwdi and water self sufficiency index wssi the wsi is determined based on the proportion of total water use by water availability smakhtin et al 2005 14 w s i w u w a where wsi is the national water scarcity index wu is total water use in the country m3 yr and wa is national water availability m3 yr the water scarcity index is divided into 4 levels when w s i 0 1 it means that the water resources in the evaluation area are abundant and the water scarcity is not serious when 0 1 w s i 0 2 it means that the degree of water shortage in the evaluation area is moderate when 0 2 w s i 0 4 it means that the degree of water shortage in the evaluation area is relatively high when 0 4 w s i it indicates that there is a serious shortage of water resources in the evaluation area and the water scarcity level is high the vwdi is used to illustrate the virtual water trade connections of an importing country or region with their major trading partners and to understand to what degree a nation relies on others to satisfy domestic water requirement chen and chen 2013 15 v w d i n v w i w u n v w i 100 if n w v i 0 0 if n v w i 0 where nvwi is the net virtual water imports to the country m3 yr a vwdi with a zero value shows that the gross virtual water imports and exports are well balanced or that there is net virtual water export on the other hand if the vwdi of a country gets closer to a hundred percent the country in question is said to be almost completely dependent on virtual water imports 16 w s s i 100 v w d i self sufficiency achieves 100 if all the water needed is available within the country s own territory the wssi is zero or close to zero when the country depends entirely on virtual water import da sliva et al 2016 hoekstra and hung 2005 15 theil index the theil index t is used to analyze spatial difference it can be decomposed into two sections the difference between the region tbr and the difference within the regional twr t tbr twr sun et al 2010 take the water footprint between regions in china as an example 17 t t b r t w r i 1 n v i log v i d i i 1 n v i j 1 m v i j log v i j d i j where n and m are respectively the number of regions and the number of provinces in the region vi and vij respectively represent the share of the water footprint of region i and the water footprint of province j belonging to region i in the total water footprint of china di and dij respectively represent the share of the gdp of region i and the gdp of province j belonging to region i in the total gdp of china the higher theil value the greater the difference of water footprint between different regions 16 falkenmark index the falkenmark index is used to measure the condition of water scarcity in a region falkenmark 1989 it is built by dividing the total actual renewable water resources of each country km3 yr as given by the food and agricultural organization of the united nations fao aquastat 2014 for the latest available years by the average population of the country over the 1993 2011 period the indicator identifies the countries affected by water stress as those having 1700 m3 yr per capita 17 water quantity scarcity index wqsi water quality scarcity index wqasi wqsi refers to the water scarcity arising from water consumption from local water resources it can be expressed as the ratio of the blue water footprint to the blue water available the wqasi refers to the water scarcity arising from the discharge of pollutants it was defined as the ratio of gray water footprint to the amount of local water resource availability cai et al 2017 if the wqasi 1 it means that the local available water resources are not enough for the assimilation of discharged pollutants and a given region faces quality induced water scarcity problems zeng et al 2013 fig 4 3 overview of impact assessment based on virtual water trade with the further development of virtual water research in addition to studying the virtual water content in products and the transfer of virtual water zhang and anadon 2014 ma and ma 2017 shtull trauring and bernstein 2018 research on the impact assessment of virtual water flow is also gradually deepening at present the main content about the impact assessment of virtual water flow includes the quantification of the impact of virtual water flow on regional water resources the influence of virtual water flow on regional social economy assessment on whether a region is suitable for implementing virtual water trade conducting regional virtual water flow impact assessments can determine whether virtual water flows are sustainable and provide a reference for decision makers in this section we will review the impact assessment of virtual water trade from the perspective of impact assessment methods impact of virtual water trade on regional water resource allocation and impacts of interregional trade on regional environment 3 1 two kinds of impact assessment methods for water resources use along with the decreasing and uneven distribution of available water resources in the world and a series of influences on water resource utilization many scholars have studied evaluation methods for water resources utilization of course this also includes the impact assessment of virtual water flow unep 2012 postle et al 2011 pfister et al 2017 currently the widely used evaluation methods include water footprint network wfn hoekstra et al 2011 and life cycle evaluation lca iso 14046 2014 jefferies et al 2012 fig 5 the concept of water footprint has emerged relatively recently introduced under the term of virtual water and coined as water footprint by hoekstra and hung 2002 it was adopted and further developed in a methodology guide by a non governmental organization called wfn in terms of evaluation purposes the wfn aims to account for water productivity of global fresh water as a limited resource to support better water management including its use and allocation gleeson et al 2012 hastings and pegram 2012 the wfn method assessing the use of freshwater resources in four steps including setting goals and scope water footprint accounting sustainability assessment and response formulation the accounting phase of wfn includes the quantification and mapping of freshwater use with three distinct types of water use the blue gray and green water footprints hoekstra and chapagain 2008 lca is a technique and method defined by the international organization for standardization iso for evaluating the potential impact of products on the environment throughout their life cycle i e from the acquisition of raw materials and production of products to the disposal of those products rebitzer et al 2004 lca aims to quantify the potential impact of a product or service on the environment boulay et al 2013 the evaluation steps of lca life cycle impact assessment methodologies generally include goal and scope inventory accounting impact assessment and interpretation gradually the lca developed comprehensive methodologies to include environmental impacts related to water in lca studies specifically reflected in the second and third steps the inventory analysis phase related to water of lca should include the inputs and outputs of each unit process in the study system specifically including water consumption water resource type water quality parameters water utilization mode affected geographic location time factor of water use substances discharged into the air water and soil in the phase of impact assessment according to the goal and scope of the analysis the potential environmental impact caused by changes in the volume water availability footprint or quality water degradation footprint of water should be considered and the water degradation footprint includes water eutrophication water acidification and water ecotoxicity etc iso 14046 2014 in terms of evaluation indicators both wfn and lca use quantitative indicators but in different phases of the assessment wfn particularly relies on water use indicators in the accounting phase while lca focuses on impact indicators in the impact assessment phase boulay et al 2013 pfister et al 2017 there is a certain difference when evaluating the same product using both wfn and lca ridoutt and pfister 2009 2010 evaluated the water consumption of two products dolmio pasta sauce 575 g and peanut m m s 250 g using the above two methods respectively the volumetric water footprint lca related includes unweighted green blue and grey water while the stress weighted water footprint wfn related a revised approach to water footprinting presents the same values but weighted by the water stress factor of 0 1 5 in the location of water use their results show that although peanut m m s volumetric water footprint 1152 l is much higher than dolmio pasta sauce 194 l its potential environmental impact stress weighted water footprint 12 2 l is smaller than dolmio pasta sauce 137 8 l this is mainly because peanut m m s main raw material cocoa is a rain fed crop that consumes a lot of water but since it is planted in a humid area with less water scarcity the potential environmental impact is small for dolmio pasta sauce its main ingredient tomato products contributed more than 95 of the stress weighted water footprint which is mainly due to the serious water shortage of the tomato purchase location in contrast sugar ranks second in the volumetric water footprint but it has almost no contribution to the stress weighted water footprint because the water shortage in its producing area is not serious the results of the bioenergy water footprint case study were compared in the same way for example when pressure weighted water footprint is applied maize is more favourable than sugar beet gerbens leenes et al 2009 again this illustrates the different conclusions drawn from different evaluation methods and the need for synchronization the areas covered by the water footprint network wfa and life cycle assessment lca are similar from an accounting perspective they are built on the same basic hydrological balance calculations however they come from different methodological backgrounds and origins and serve different purposes lca focuses more on analyzing material resource considerations and their impact especially water pollution while in recent years lca also has covered the quantitative aspects of water use koehler 2008 wfn adopts the volumetric method as a consumption based indicator and aims to provide information about a single product or at the company level in terms of sustainable equitable and efficient water management and allocation hoekstra 2003 it can be used at different levels river basin global product or enterprise due to differences in tradition and purpose these two methods produce slightly different solutions for assessing the impact of water resource utilization at present scholars are working hard to merge the two methods and try to determine the definition procedure or method that can be widely accepted these two evaluation methods have their advantages and can complement each other therefore scholars should pay more attention to how to apply these two methods more effectively or coordinate their applications to achieve the common goal of better protecting water resources rather than arguing about the pros and cons of each approach 3 2 impact of virtual water trade on regional water resource allocation the optimal allocation of water resources is the basis for the rational development and utilization of water resources and the fundamental guarantee for the sustainable utilization of water resources however due to the spatial and temporal distribution of regional water resources they do not fit with the layout of productivity and there is a great deal of water competition among regions and water use departments finally some improper ways of water resource exploitation and utilization lead to many ecological and environmental problems therefore it is more urgent to implement a rational allocation of water resources traditional allocation of water resources allocates physical water in the region to each water user according to the relationship between supply and demand or through the construction of the water diversion project to relieve water stress in water scarce areas if the allocation of regional water resources is combined with virtual water the results will change significantly fig 6 is the water resource demand distribution map of beijing china with and without virtual water trade taken into consideration ye et al 2018 there is a significant change in the water demand of each water sector after considering virtual water the demand for surface water groundwater and reclaimed water in agriculture is reduced while virtual water accounts for the majority of agricultural water use this is mainly because the blue water footprint used for agricultural production is greatly reduced and the proportion of surface water in urban and environmental water consumption increases in addition the industrial sector is more dependent on recycled water therefore from the point of view of virtual water the water resources saved from agricultural production can be distributed to other water use departments which can not only increase the utilization efficiency of water resources but also create greater economic output value for the region the original purpose of the virtual water trade was to ease the pressure on the water resources in the importing areas allan 1993 however in some virtual water flows such as china the virtual water flow trend in china is roughly from north to south it is exactly the opposite of the distribution of water resources in china the south has much and the north has less so the virtual water trade has the opposite effect superficially virtual water trade reduces the blue water footprint used to produce products in importing areas but it further increases the pressure of water resources in the exporting areas and may threaten local food security when the virtual water trade is driven by the regional economic level and related policies rather than the regional water resource endowments it will not relieve regional water scarcity but worsen the situation of water shortages zhuo et al 2016b one of the reasons for this unsustainable pattern of water use is that the role of water resources is underestimated in china that is relative to some factors such as economic and political water resource does not play an important role in production and consumption decision making zhang and anadon 2014 as the shortage of water resources is becoming an increasingly prominent bottleneck for sustainable development in china the status of water resources in the future should be improved some measures such as establishing a water price system diversifying water price management forms and legally granting water rights may be considered 3 3 impacts of commodity trade on regional environment 3 3 1 impacts of virtual water trade on regional water resources according to the types of water resources used the amount of water resources used and the location of water withdrawal the use of water resources will have different degrees of impact on the regional environment which mainly includes the impact on the quantity green water blue water and quality gray water of water resources virtual water trade will have different effects on the environment of the import and export regions respectively the distribution of water resources in china is extremely incompatible with the distribution of cultivated land resources water resources are mainly concentrated in the southern regions and the water volume reaches 80 of the total water resources in china wang et al 2014 while the cultivated land resources are mainly concentrated in the northern regions due to the influence of social economy climatic conditions and water infrastructure china has a trade pattern of north grain south transportation sun et al 2013 this allows a large amount of virtual water embedded in grain to be transported from the water deficient northern regions to the water abundant southern regions on the one hand this kind of trade pattern further aggravates the pressure on water resources and further worsens the water environment in the northern regions of china on the other hand for the southern regions transporting grain from the north has saved local water resources for industrial production to promote regional economic development finally at the national level when virtual water flows from an area with high water use efficiency to an area with low water use efficiency water conservation benefits can be achieved sun et al 2016 and the amount of water saved can be used for the construction of the regional ecological environment and the development of other industries the gray water footprint represents water pollution and refers to the amount of fresh water resources needed to dilute water pollution mekonnen and hoekstra 2010a which can be used to react to regional differences in production technology levels different products have different gray water footprints different regions producing the same product also have different gray water footprints zhang et al 2017 currently due to material and data limitations only a few studies have quantified the pollutants such as chemical oxygen demand and nitrogen zeng et al 2013 zhi et al 2015 mekonnen and hoekstra 2015 by investigating the water use and consumption patterns of shanghai china s largest city zhao et al 2016 found that shanghai has relied on trade with other provinces in china to outsource local water quantity and quality burden thereby alleviating its own environmental pressure therefore it is necessary to quantify the gray water footprint of different sectors and products as well as include gray water footprint as an important part of virtual water trade research then develop some relevant indicators that can better reflect the impact of virtual water flows on the regional environment 3 3 2 virtual water in agricultural water resources utilization agriculture is the main water user and the production consumption link of agricultural products contains the conversion of physical water to virtual water and the process of virtual water flow driven by the factors of nature economy and society the physical water and virtual water feedback and interact with each other in the process of agricultural production and consumption carrying out research on agricultural virtual water identifying the mechanism of morphological transformation of water resources the driving force of the flow process and the main control factors of flow flux deconstructing the coupling process and law of agricultural physical virtual water from different spatial and temporal scales and analyzing the multiple impacts of coupled flows of agricultural physical virtual water on the economy society ecology and environment is of great significance for regulating the production side physical water and demand side virtual water and achieving efficient and sustainable use of agricultural water resources this is also the main reason why this article summarizes the research progress of agricultural virtual water in detail previous studies on agricultural water use have focused more on physical water such as crop water consumption irrigation and drainage saline alkali management rainwater collection and groundwater utilization and the interaction between agricultural water management and the environment flood soil erosion non point source pollution the impact of climate change on agricultural water at present the concept of virtual water has gradually appeared in the research related to agricultural water with the adjustment of regional industrial structure and the frequent trade between regions the utilization and management of water resources is no longer a problem that can be solved independently by a region or an industry but the water use situation of each industry in each region should be considered as a whole chouchane et al 2018 therefore the utilization and management of agricultural water resources cannot only rely on traditional technologies and methods the emergence of virtual water provides new theories and ideas for agricultural water management and it is a new method that should be paid attention to and developed at present the research on virtual water in agricultural water can be roughly divided into 1 the accounting of virtual water content of agricultural products and the virtual water flowing law between regions 2 influence of virtual water flow of agricultural products on regional water resources water quantity water quality water resource management policies etc 3 the influence of climate change crop planting mode technology and other factors on the virtual water content of agricultural products 4 analysis of driving factors of virtual water flow related to agricultural products wang et al 2017 analyzed the relationship between agricultural water rights trading and virtual water export compensation and established a bi level programming model with multiple objectives and they found compensation for crop virtual water export can increase the benefits of agricultural water use the premise of evaluating virtual water flow is to calculate the virtual water content in the product and the water footprint method is a common method zhuo et al 2016b started from the growth consumption and trade of crops in china and then selected climate technology population diet and other factors to set scenarios to predict and analyze the water footprint of crops and they concluded that china could achieve a high degree of food self sufficiency and agricultural water consumption would be reduced in the future in the context of free trade in products optimizing irrigation systems appropriately adjusting water prices and optimizing product trade patterns are all measures that should be considered for agricultural water resources management jinwon and sandy 2018 4 discussion 4 1 the bridge in socio hydrology virtual water trade sivapalan et al 2012 proposed the concept of socio hydrology in the context of human activities becoming an intrinsic factor in the water cycle process and sustainable use of water resources covering many factors such as nature society and humanities it is mainly used to explore the bidirectional feedback mode and the dynamic mechanism of co evolution of the coupled human water systems and to solve the problems of sustainable use of water resources faced by human beings today since the 1970s the market economy has been on the right track and economic development has been increasing faster and faster there has been more and more economic trade among different countries and regions and exchanges of commodities and services among regions have become more frequent virtual water is thus gradually becoming a bridge and medium for human activities to affect the hydrological system fig 7 in the production process of products and services water resources mostly participate in the form of physical water with regard to the processing sale and consumption of commodities water resources mostly participate in the form of virtual water wang et al 2009 zhang 2016 economic production is based on the withdrawal of freshwater resources physical water from nature and freshwater resources are converted into virtual water through production and processing then embedded in products from various economic sectors virtual water in part directly forms the final output of various economic sectors along with the trade of products which flows to local domestic water or becomes the local fixed asset at this time virtual water is a bridge for water transfer between water departments within the region the other part of virtual water the middle use part flows back to economic production again and becomes a raw material for other economic sectors commodities produced in the region are exported to other regions through trade and virtual water is a bridge for water exchange between regions on the one hand tracking the virtual water flow path can be used to determine whether the regional economic structure and the virtual water flow framework is sustainable and to analyze the relationship between the economic sector s production potential and water use conversely it can also be used to weigh the relationship between the utilization of water resources and the maximization of economic efficiency thus providing a method for effectively alleviating regional water shortages wang et al 2014 4 2 debates about the evaluation indicator of virtual water the concept of virtual water and water footprint has attracted the attention of scholars engaged in water resources some authors believe that the virtual water concept provides new ideas and new methods for global water management by calculating the water footprint of commodities consumers and services they indicated that countries or regions with water shortages should import water intensive products from water rich countries or regions water rich countries should focus on producing and exporting water intensive commodities yang and zehnder 2002 hoekstra and hung 2005 vel√°zquez 2007 chapagain and hoekstra 2008 winter et al 2014 many scholars have suggested that virtual water should be considered when formulating national trade strategies and agricultural and water development strategies based on the virtual water theory water conservation and water pollution prevention can be achieved by adjusting international trade patterns and consumer preference rudenko et al 2013 duarte et al 2014 shi et al 2014 zhang and anadon 2014 zoumides et al 2014 zhao et al 2016 in a sense a lot of researches show that the concept of virtual water and water footprint has indeed opened up new fields in water resources research but at the same time it has also been questioned and denied the discussion about what the concept of vwt and wf in narrow sense and the field in broader sense offer and what not is getting more and more intense first the concept of virtual water and water footprints has been questioned they are compelling notions but notably flawed wichelns 2011 then water resources are global resources that the virtual water theory believes is controversial wichelns 2015a claims that water shortages and water pollution are local problems and not global consumers in one country should not be held responsible for water shortages and water pollution in another country and they cannot alleviate water shortages and water pollution in another country because water shortages are caused by local over exploitation water pollution is caused by local improper human activities which are all local reasons in terms of the factors affecting international trade patterns de fraiture et al 2004 argued that political and economic strategies may have a greater impact on international trade than water shortages wichelns 2010a b examined the estimates of virtual water imports and exports prepared for 77 countries by chapagain and hoekstra 2004 and he found that land resource endowment was a more appropriate indicator than water endowment when describing agricultural products trade some economists pointed out that the virtual water trade research only quantified the virtual water content of trade products without considering the technical level and opportunity cost of the trading countries and did not consider the comparative advantage of each country japan germany south korea and other countries import a large amount of virtual water may not be attributed to water shortage or food production shortage but because the development of industry services and other industries in the country will bring greater benefits than agriculture gawel and bernsen 2013 wichelns 2015b as a whole the evaluation index of virtual water has both praise and criticism which indicates that this index has its merits but also has its disadvantages therefore some authors should analyze the problems dialectically when studying virtual water so as to apply this index rationally 4 3 limitations in current virtual water research although virtual water research has achieved many results there are still some limitations fig 8 taking into account the data from the virtual water trade study the main issues are the data gap and the availability of data including the quality and accuracy of the data and a series of assumptions when applying the model in the calculation of agricultural product water footprints some studies applied the value of water research report series no 47 mekonnen and hoekstra 2010a and no 48 mekonnen and hoekstra 2010b there are many uncertainties in these two reports and due to the lack of data a series of assumptions have been made for example some specific irrigation maps can only be applied to certain crops other crops are obtained by referring to the mirca 2000 database with some simple assumptions for irrigated agriculture it is assumed that all irrigation can fully meet the irrigation requirements the situation of fertilizer application in crops is also based on assumptions because there is no available data and the gray water footprint is also estimated roughly based on a simple calculation method in terms of crop models it is first assumed that the growth period planting date growth period of the crop is fixed and the effect of temperature change during the crop growth period is ignored the initial moisture content of the soil is then assumed to be fixed and the impacts of water stress biological stress and diseases and insect pests on crop growth are ignored zhang et al 2016 2018 zhuo et al 2016b in report 48 regarding the footprint of animal products the report ignored the indirect water footprint of raw materials used for feed production and animal feeding and also failed to quantify the gray water footprint from animals some other related issues in the production of animal products such as micro or macro production costs livelihoods of small farmers public health and other environmental issues have not been fully considered zhang et al 2016 lack of up to date high quality data often impedes the conduct of virtual water and water footprint research one of the most difficult challenges in using input output analysis in practice is to aggregate the detailed basic data needed to build an input output table miller and blair 2009 reliable statistics on water resources utilization are very important for the formulation of input output relations between economic sectors while the formulation of input output tables usually takes a lot of time mainly due to the heavy task of data collection and processing and data processing is usually not public which makes it difficult to obtain detailed data mubako et al 2013 used an input output model to analyze virtual water transfer profiles in california and illinois in the usa since the data came from a secondary source such as the usgs the data generated estimation errors in the process of transmission the economic data of the two states also have varying degrees of deficiencies in addition the article did not quantify the impact of sewage due to the restriction on data collection some studies based on input output analysis used the single area input output model to analyze the virtual water flow of the economy and due to a lack of available data these studies ignore imported virtual water in the economy zhao et al 2016 or equate imported virtual water with local production water guo et al 2016 renault 2003 zhao et al 2009 these limitations from data may eventually cause deviations in the results of the studies shao et al 2017 in addition since the concept of virtual water was put forward there have been more and more research articles on virtual water flows virtual water trade and the accounting of virtual water and water footprint but the object of study in these articles is mostly agricultural products or agricultural sectors bae and dall erba 2018 lamastra et al 2017 sun et al 2016 trottier and perrier 2017 zhang et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 2018 there are relatively few studies on virtual water content accounting and flow analysis for industrial products aquatic products service industries or food processing from the world average although the agricultural sector accounts for 69 of the total withdrawals the virtual water content of agricultural products accounts for only 35 of the total global demand for virtual water as a major component of the regional water footprint the global virtual water trade amounts to 30 of the direct water withdrawal of which 43 of the virtual water trade volume is related to food and 57 is contained in non food trade chen and chen 2013 therefore in order to further explore mechanisms of virtual water flow and improve the efficiency of water resource utilization virtual water accounting and flow analysis of non agricultural products is more important and corresponding research should be conducted 4 4 hot issues of current research when it comes to the flow of virtual water we naturally think of what caused the virtual water flow and what the consequences will the virtual water flow produce if the impact assessment is the consequence of virtual water flow then the virtual water flow mechanism is to explore what triggered the flow of virtual water above we have already seen the impact of virtual water flow on the region meanwhile some scholars have studied the virtual water flow mechanism the conceptual framework of gravity laws which are often used to explain network fluxes in fields such as trade transportation and migration anderson 1979 bergstrand 1985 the flow of virtual water can be seen as economic trade so some scholars use the trade gravity model to analyze the driving factors of virtual water flow moreover this method can simultaneously consider the factors affecting the virtual water flow such as the socio economic and resource endowments of the bilateral virtual water transfers tamea et al 2014 cai et al 2019 in related research gdp population water resources cultivated land resources geographical distance and other dummy variables between trading partners are usually selected as factors affecting the flow of virtual water fracasso 2014 duarte et al 2019 used the well known trade gravity model to explain exchanges of bilateral virtual water transfers among 70 countries on the basis of economic geographical institutional and environmental factors and they indicated that the traditional economic institutional and geographic factors played a key role as drivers of virtual water bilateral trade flows between 1965 and 2010 in addition to trade gravity model logarithmic mean divisia index lmdi method is also adopted for uncovering the driving factors of virtual water flow for example qian et al 2019 used lmdi and they found that trade structure was an obvious positive effect while the effects of water intensity product structure and trade scale shifted in favor of virtual water outflows from bri the belt and road initiative countries to china in 2008 it can be found from the virtual water articles published that the city is actually the main body of a country s virtual water import so the urban virtual water has gradually become a research hotspot rushforth and ruddell 2016 in addition ruddell et al 2014 proposed the concepts and methods of coupled natural human systems cnh and embedded resource accounting era they used this method to calculate the virtual water flow in the electric power sector in the western united states and revealed the interaction between the water resource system and the electric power system and provided suggestions for decision makers and managers the relationship between virtual water trade and regional economy is also a research field that scholars pay more attention to rushforth and ruddell 2015 mayer et al 2016 rushforth and ruddell 2018 as afkhami et al 2018 studied capital endowment is

virtual water trade impact assessment regional water allocation regional economy and regional environment the limitations and gaps the controversy of virtual water and the hot issue of current research based on the perspective of society environment and resources with regard to the flow of virtual water in production trade and consumer systems on international national basin and regional scales and the influence of virtual water flow on regional water resources the current researches have made great progress while there are relatively few studies about the driving factors of virtual water flow the evaluation and prediction of virtual water flow mode and the influence of virtual water flow on regional environment in terms of research methods in addition to continuing to use traditional virtual water accounting methods the recent research also focuses on the use of input output models to account for virtual water using scenario analysis methods to predict future virtual water flow trends and uses gravitational models to analyze driving factors the application of these methods has promoted the further development of virtual water research the research content has also gradually diversified from quantifying the virtual water content of commodities and analyzing virtual water flow paths it has gradually evolved into a temporal and spatial evolution of virtual water

10421,climate change directly affects crop evapotranspiration and irrigation demand the temporal and spatial variation of crop evapotranspiration is crucial to irrigation schedule planning and water resource management using 52 years of climate data from 43 stations in the north china plain this study examined trends and spatial distributions of the cotton evapotranspiration etc and irrigation requirement iwr and revealed the impact of climate variation on cotton etc change we found that annual etc of cotton in the growing season showed a significant declining trend which decreased from 606 mm yr 1 in 1965 1975 to 551 mm yr 1 in 2006 2016 annual effective rainfall re and iwr of cotton s growing season did not show consistency over the 52 year period which averaged at 451 mm 441 466 mm and 122 mm 105 145 mm respectively the 75 of cotton etc was supplied by rainfall and 25 by irrigation water this is much better than for winter wheat where 60 must be supplied by irrigation the location of the spatial maximum cotton etc shifted during the past five decades from 1965 to 1975 maximum etc values were found in the southern part and then shifted to the northeastern part from 1976 to 1985 during the period of 1986 to 2005 maximum etc occurred in the middle area and shifted to the western part in 2006 2016 during the past five decades solar radiation sunshine hours and wind

change and population growth threatening global food security and environmental sustainability huang et al 2012 since agriculture is by far the largest water consumer of the economy hamdy et al 2003 it must be considered an important part of the solution according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc the global average air temperature has increased by approximately 0 74 c over the last 100 years ipcc et al 2007 agriculture is dependent on weather conditions and future climate change can be detrimental lobell et al 2011 in the north china plain ncp water scarcity is especially severe alternative cash crops with high rainfall use efficiency instead of winter wheat with its high groundwater pumpage are getting more attention cotton a cash field crop has the biggest planting area accounting for about 7 of this area during the last 40 years with high economic output value national bureau of statistics of china 2017 a better understanding of the sources and magnitudes of cotton water requirements can greatly help in making reasonable irrigation schemes for better agricultural water management the ncp is one of the most important grain and cotton production regions in china qiu et al 2018 it contains 136 000 km2 of arable land that produces more than 50 of wheat yields 40 of maize yields and 35 of cotton yields of the whole country yang et al 2015a mo et al 2016 the predominant cropping system is winter wheat summer maize double rotation xiao et al 2013 the annual average precipitation is 450 600 mm with a range of 300 1000 mm and more than 70 of precipitation is concentrated in the summer season from july to september cao et al 2014 water consumption of the winter wheat summer maize rotation amounts to 800 1000 mm liu et al 2002 sun et al 2011 gao et al 2015 yang et al 2015b van oort et al 2016 yang et al 2017 sun et al 2019 the annual water deficit of the rotation is between 200 and 400 mm this deficit resulting from winter wheat cropping outside of the wet season is supplemented by groundwater pumpage for irrigation in pursuit of high yield zhang et al 2017 extensive irrigation has resulted in a rapid groundwater table decline of approximately 1 m yr 1 during the past 20 years accompanied by severe land subsidence in some areas salt intrusion near the coast ecosystem degradation and groundwater quality deterioration pei et al 2017 xiao et al 2017 rashid et al 2019 yang et al 2019 water shortage is the greatest limitation to sustainable agricultural development in the ncp cotton with its good match between growing season and regional rainy season is in transition to supplant traditional crops having high water consumption therefore it is urgent and important to clarify the crop evapotranspiration etc and irrigation water requirement iwr of cotton including their temporal and spatial variation and to determine how the variation of meteorological factors affected etc and iwr this assessment will supply indispensable information for irrigation strategy and sustainable water management adapted to climate change in this area etc constitutes a major component of regional and global hydrological cycles and therefore has important implications in the use of agricultural irrigation water as well as in evaluating crop water stress in agricultural ecosystems allen et al 2005 etc as the most important factor is commonly estimated by multiplying standard reference evapotranspiration et0 by a crop coefficient kc that expresses the seasonality of crop development in water uptake terms all of etc et0 and kc vary day by day the classic penman monteith equation to evaluate et0 is recommended by the un food and agriculture organization fao allen et al 1998 researchers have estimated etc in wheat grapes corn and barley using spectral satellite imaging data and the penman monteith equation heilman et al 1982 farahani et al 2008 glenn et al 2011 er raki et al 2013 jin et al 2017 the penman monteith equation relies on daily meteorological data such as temperature wind speed and relative humidity allen et al 1998 kang et al 2003 trends and fluctuations in meteorological values lead to the variations in et0 and consequently in etc an accurate computation of the seasonal total etc is important for water resource planning and the assessment of the related iwr crop water demand not satisfied by rainfall is central to developing crop management strategies which are economically rational in terms of water usage crop yield and profits this study applied the simetaw simulation of evapotranspiration of applied water model to evaluate etc of cotton in the growing season snyder et al 2004 2012 orang et al 2013 ebrahimpour et al 2014 swelam et al 2014 mancosu et al 2016 simetaw based on penman monteith equation proceeds to translate a time series of et0 into a time series of etc after calculating daily etc the input and derived data are used to determine re and to generate hypothetical irrigation schedules which materialize a time series of iwr the iwr is the net amount of irrigation water needed in addition to effective rainfall to produce a crop whose yield is not limited by water previous studies about the etc in ncp focused on staple grain crop winter wheat and summer maize little research about cotton s etc and iwr in this area has been done liu et al 2005 reported that etc of winter wheat and summer maize showed a decreasing trend at respective rates of 0 9 19 2 mm per year and 8 3 24 3 mm per year decrease during 1950 2000 over the ncp relying on penman monteith equation for et0 sunshine hour and wind speed declines were the most impact drivers of etc decrease song 2009 applied the simetaw model to calculate the etc of oat 252 mm summer maize 351 mm winter wheat 486 mm and spring sweet potato 459 mm in beijing area from 2006 to 2008 yang et al 2011 2012 2013 estimated the etc of winter wheat with an average value of 452 mm spring maize of 457 mm and summer maize of 322 mm in the ncp from 1960 2009 using the simetaw model the trend of solar radiation decrease from declining atmospheric transparency contributed most to the significantly downward trend of etc of the above crops shi et al 2009 calibrated and validated the simetaw model in the northwestern farming region of china deriving etc of maize 514 mm soybean 450 mm and millet 389 mm more recently jiang et al 2015 and hu et al 2017 estimated the etc of spring wheat to have an average value of 359 mm and soybean to have 398 mm in the northeast during 1965 2010 the significantly decreasing trend of etc was attributed to the decline of solar radiation jia et al 2019 reported etc and iwr of oat were at average values of 340 mm and 178 mm respectively they also noted the decreasing trends over the past five decades in northeast china were due to the decreasing solar radiation wind speed and sunshine duration far fewer studies have tried to evaluate the spatial and temporal variation of crop evapotranspiration and irrigation water requirement of a staple cash crop cotton is one of the most important economic crops in the ncp its planting area accounting for 44 of the whole country during the past 40 years national bureau of statistics of china 2017 therefore the objectives of this study were to investigate the historical and current water use of cotton particularly we will 1 quantify the temporal and spatial variation of cotton etc during the period of 1965 2016 over the ncp 2 clarify how well rainfall in cotton s critical growth season matches crop requirement 3 determine the spatio temporal variation of each meteorological factor and 4 further reveal the impact of climate change on etc and irrigation water requirement of cotton the study provides a meaningful reference for better understanding crop water requirement information of cotton for sustainable water resource management in the ncp 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the common cotton planting zone in north china plain was shown in fig 1 yu 2015 named as national cotton zone 2 there are 43 standard meteorological stations selected evenly distributed over the cotton planting area in north china plain fig 1 according to the environmental conditions including temperature precipitation and frost free period yu 2015 dong et al 2017 we subdivided it into seven sub zones fig 1 there are 9 stations in sub zone 2 1 4 stations in sub zone 2 2 7 stations in sub zone 2 3 8 stations in sub zone 2 4 5 stations in sub zone 2 6 and 6 stations in sub zone 2 7 detailed information about each sub zone including location frost free period and selected weather stations are shown in the supplementary material the cotton planting zone 2 as a whole has a warm temperature zone semi humid and monsoon climate solar radiation resources in this area are rich ranging over 5023 6032 mj m 2 year 1 the average annual temperature is 12 8 c the average annual rainfall over the last 52 years was 591 mm with large variation from year to year on average two thirds of the precipitation occur from july to september the seasonal pattern is evident from the monthly mean values 1965 2016 of precipitation maximum temperature and minimum temperature plotted in fig 2 the frost free period occurs in 200 240 days from april to october cotton is sown in late april and harvested in mid to late october and the harvest lasts 20 to 30 days most rainfall coincides with the growing season of cotton however it does not meet the full water requirement of cotton 2 2 climate data the daily meteorological data from the period of 1965 through 2016 52 years for the 43 standard meteorological stations were obtained from the china meteorological data sharing service system http www nmic cn soil parameters were from national soil survey database which included soil types soil texture wilting coefficient soil bulk density saturated moisture content and so on main crop characteristic parameters including sowing date harvesting date planting area and sowing density were acquired from literature field experiment data survey results and project reports changes in crop variety during the last 52 years were not taken into consideration the cotton growing calendar including the sowing date and harvest date is provided in detail in table s1 in the supplementary material 2 3 calculations of crop water interface 2 3 1 calculations of etc re and iwr etc was the water requirement of cotton in the growing season which was calculated using the simetaw model this model has been widely used in calculating water requirements of maize wheat cotton and soybean in the north china plain kong et al 2009 yang et al 2009 2011 2013 huang et al 2012 hu et al 2017 jia et al 2019 the model calculates the reference crop evapotranspiration eto using the penman monteith equation then multiplies the daily eto time series using kc values specific for cotton to obtain the desired daily etc time series snyder et al 2004 2012 yang et al 2013 therefore etc was calculated as follows 1 e t c e t 0 k c where etc is crop evapotranspiration mm kc is the crop coefficient stored in the simetaw model it was taken from the fao 56 recommendation allen et al 1998 kc values of cotton in this study were detailed in supplementary table s2 3 et0 is the reference crop

long enough to meet the requirement for crop evapotranspiration it omits rain that leaves quickly as runoff and deep percolation it was calculated as follows allen et al 1998 pang et al 2015 3 r r j Œ± j p i where rrj was the effective rainfall at the j th time mm pj was total rainfall amount at the j th time mm Œ±j was an effective rainfall utilization coefficient when pj 5 mm Œ±j 1 for 5 mm pj 50 mm Œ±j 0 9 and for pj 50 mm Œ±j 0 75 4 r r i j 1 n r r j i where rri was the total effective rainfall in an i th growth stage mm r rj i was the effective rainfall at an j th time in the i th phase mm j was the rainfall times from 1 to n the irrigation water requirement iwr is the amount of irrigation water needed beyond re to obtain yield of cotton that is not limited by water availability iwr can be obtained from each stage as 5 i w r e t c r e when short term iwr is positive it means etc is more than re the effective rainfall cannot meet the crop growth requirement and the irrigation water must make up the difference when iwr is negative it means re is more than etc the effective rainfall can meet the crop growth requirement and no need extra irrigation water during that growth stage thus iwr is set to zero effective rainfall is retained in the soil i e still effective until needed by the crop thus a surplus of re over etc in an earlier growth stage represented by a temporarily negative irrigation requirement iwr 0 can be used in a later growth stage if needed 2 3 2 calculations of rainfall crop compatibility index we defined rainfall crop compatibility index Œª to be the water availability ratio between crop water requirement and rainfall during a certain growing stage or whole growing season with values ranging from 0 to 1 growth stage values were 6 Œª i 1 r e i e t c i r e i e t c i r i e t c i where Œªi is the index value in the i th growth stage rei is the total effective rainfall in an i th stage mm and etci is the water requirement for crop growth in the i th stage mm the index value for the entire growing season is the ratio between the total effective rainfall and etc over the entire growing season 2 4 spatial analysis tools inverse distance weighted idw interpolation within arcgis 10 2 esri 2008 was used to interpolate the spatial distribution of etc and iwr during the past 52 years the control points are the 43 weather stations and we interpolated to create a grid so that the grid point values could be re aggregated into the seven sub zones or mapped more continuously using arcgis spatial analyst function 2 5 statistical methods statistical analyses were performed using the statistical analysis system 9 3 sas 9 3 sas institute inc cary nc usa 2011 and statistical significance of differences between mean values was determined using analysis of variance anova followed by post hoc comparisons using least significant difference lsd testing at a 5 probability level correlation analysis was conducted to show the relationship between etc and each meteorological factor in each sub zone in the north china plain the regression analysis was used to test the trend of each climate factor etc and iwr over the years at the 0 05 probability level 3 results 3 1 temporal variation of water requirements of cotton in the north china plain during the past 52 years yearly etc crop evapotranspiration of cotton in the north china plain showed a significant decrease during 1965 2016 fig 3 the average etc of cotton in 1965 1975 was about 603 mm then significantly decreased to 569 mm in 1976 1985 and was only 549 mm in 2006 2016 table 1 re effective rainfall for cotton in its growing season declined slightly during 1965 2016 with an average value of 451 mm fig 3 with a variably declining rate per decade table 1 the period of 1976 1995 exhibited a much faster declining rate of 2 43 mm per year while the declining trend flattened afterwards re in the cotton growing season decreased from 466 mm in 1976 1985 to 442 mm in 1986 1995 and then remained constant since then table 1 iwr irrigation water requirement of cotton in north china plain decreased during the period of 1965 2016 but the trend was not significant fig 3 the average iwr in cotton s growing season was 122 mm during 1965 2016 table 1 regarding the seven sub zones etc in the cotton growing season decreased notably in all sub zones table 2 etc of cotton in sub zones 2 1 2 2 and 2 5 showed decline rates ranging over 5 6 9 4 mm decade in the remaining four sub zones etc showed a much higher rate of decline at 11 1 18 2 mm decade the decline of etc in cotton s growing season may alleviate the pressure on the water resources to a certain degree in the north china plain among all seven sub zones trends of iwr of cotton did not show consistency table 2 in sub zones 2 2 and 2 3 iwr showed an initially decreasing trend from an average 192 mm in 1965 1975 to 147 mm in 1986 1995 followed by an increase to 210 mm in 1996 2005 then a decrease to 136 mm in 2006 2016 this pattern is similar in sub zone 2 1 the values of iwr in sub zone 2 1 during the selected five decades are overall lower than those in sub zones 2 2 and 2 3 in sub zone 2 1 iwr of 83 mm in 1965 1975 decreased to 35 mm in1986 1995 then increased to 134 mm in 1996 2005 and declined to 84 mm in 2006 2016 in sub zones 2 5 and 2 6 the iwr of cotton also showed an initially decreasing trend from 179 mm in 1965 1975 to 113 mm in 1976 1985 later increased to 191 mm in 1986 1995 and finally decreased to 146 mm in 2006 2016 in sub zone 2 4 iwr of cotton with 74 mm in 1965 1975 increased to 105 mm in 1976 1985 and then decreased to 58 mm in 2006 2016 in sub zone 2 7 there is little need to irrigate when re is more than etc in cotton s growing season such as the periods of 1986 1985 and 1996 2005 table 2 the maximum iwr in cotton s growing season for sub zones 2 1 2 2 and 2 5 occurred in 1996 2005 with decadal average values ranging from 134 to 242 mm for sub zones 2 3 and 2 4 the greatest iwr manifested in 1976 1985 with average values ranging from 105 to 197 mm for the remaining sub zones 2 6 and 2 7 the highest iwr manifested in 1965 1975 with average values ranging from 117 167 mm this trend coincides with the countertrend of re in all sub zones etc does not change too much from year to year but re changes quite a bit thus requiring an opposite trend of iwr to keep the sum of fluctuating re and iwr for the steadier etc the re in cotton s growing season for sub zones 2 1 2 2 and 2 5 showed the lowest value of 346 408 mm in 1965 1975 for sub zones 2 3 and 2 4 the minimum re over 392 463 mm appeared in 1976 1985 for sub zones 2 6 and 2 7 the smallest re presented in 1986 1995 with average values of 406 478 mm table 2 3 2 spatial variation of water requirements of cotton during 1965 2016 in the north china plain the averages of etc re and iwr values of cotton in its growing season during the past 52 years in each sub zone are compared in table 3 the average etc of cotton of the past 52 years had apparent differences among seven sub zones the highest etc occurred in sub zone 2 6 with a value of 593 mm and a lowest value of 545 mm in sub zone 2 1 fig 4 shows the inverse distance weighted idw interpolated maps of decadal average etc in the north china plain the evolution of spatial patterns can be seen by comparing across decades in fig 4 as a whole the highest etc of cotton moved from the south to the northeast and finally to the west region within the north china plain over the interval 1965 2016 during the period of 1965 1975 etc showed a strong gradient of higher values in the southern area to lower values in the north the highest etc occurred in sub zone 2 6 the west of 2 4 and the east of 2 5 with a bigger area of the value of 613 629 mm by 1976 1985 a notable change of etc pattern arose with higher value areas shifting northeastward to the east of 2 3 and the middle of 2 4 sub zones meanwhile the highest etc area narrowed falling to 575 585 mm by 1986 1995 the highest location shifted eastward to the middle of 2 3 and the west of 2 5 sub zones these higher etc areas narrowed in space having a range of 581 604 mm in 1996 2005 and changed little from the previous interval the highest etc was about 578 592 mm in this period by 2006 2016 the highest etc zone shifted to the west of 2 5 and 2 6 sub zones with the values range of 555 564 mm in general the spatial pattern of etc of cotton showed notable shifts during the past 52 years higher etc values shifted from the southern area in 1965 1975 to the northeast area in 1976 1985 and then moved to the west part of the north china plain in 2006 2016 in addition the area of higher etc values became smaller from 1965 1975 to 2006 2016 and the values exhibited an obvious decreasing trend from 613 629 mm in 1965 1975 to 555 564 mm in 2006 2016 fig 4 the average re of cotton of the past 52 years also showed differences across sub zones re of cotton was higher in the southeast area and lower in the northeast area the highest and lowest re were 529 mm in sub zone 2 7 and 386 mm in sub zone 2 5 respectively table 3 the average iwr of cotton of the past 52 years showed the usual complementary spatial variation countering re with the higher values in the middle and west areas and lower values in the east and south area of the north china plain the highest iwr appeared in sub zone 2 5 with the value of 177 mm the lowest value occurred in subzone 2 7 with the value of 42 mm due to the higher rainfall in this area table 3 the idw interpolated maps of decadal average iwr of cotton are detailed in fig 5 3 3 rainfall crop compatibility index between effective rainfall and water requirement of cotton the average etc of cotton during the last 52 years was 573 mm table 1 which was affected by the physiological characteristics of the crop and the regional ecological environment the rainfall crop compatibility index in the growing season of cotton during the period of 1965 2016 was 0 75 table 4 this is higher than winter wheat s 0 4 yang et al 2012 and similar to summer maize s 0 78 and spring maize s 0 72 yang et al 2011 cotton s good match is because its growing season from end of the april to the middle of october in the north china plain corresponds to the wettest rainfall season in this area 60 70 of annual rain falls in the summer season from june to september fig 2 breaking out each cotton growth stage in this region the rainfall crop compatibility index of cotton was smaller at sowing stage and seedling stage than in the later stages at values of 0 47 and 0 53 respectively this is because rainfall is less in the early stage of the cotton growing season the end of april to the beginning of june the rainfall compatibility rate in this early growing stage is only about 50 the rainfall crop compatibility index of cotton was greatest at its blossoming and boll forming stage with the value of 0 8 because this period is from the middle of july to the end of august when rainfall peaks fig 2 the rainfall crop compatibility index in the bud stage the middle of june to the middle of july and the boll opening stage the end of august to the middle of october were 0 65 and 0 62 respectively table 4 regarding each sub zone the rainfall crop compatibility index in cotton s growing season were higher in southeast area with sub zone values of 0 80 0 85 and lower in the middle and west area with the values of 0 68 0 73 for every sub zone the compatibility index was highest in the blossoming and boll forming stage 0 69 0 89 and lowest in the early stages of sowing and seedling 0 40 0 69 as a whole the lowest compatibility index was 0 40 at sowing stage in 2 2 sub zone and the highest value was 0 89 at blossoming and boll forming stage in sub zone 2 1 table 4 this analysis helps in water allocation and reallocation during the same growing season based on crops higher or lower compatibility index 3 4 temporal and spatial variation of daily mean meteorological factors during 1965 2016 etc of cotton in its growing season is driven by interacting effects of different climate indicators therefore a detailed analysis of changes in each meteorological factor was conducted the average daily climate data is presented in fig 6 for the north china plain during the period of 1965 2016 the

lower in the northwest area daily average temperatures ranged over 13 12 14 78 c in warmer sub zones 2 3 2 4 2 6 and 2 7 and over 10 46 12 66 c in cooler sub zones 2 1 2 2 and 2 5 daily relative humidity was 63 8 70 3 in the wetter sub zones 2 3 2 4 2 6 and 2 7 and 58 6 61 9 in the drier sub zones 2 1 2 2 and 2 5 daily dew point temperature ranged over 7 55 10 37 c in the sub zones 2 3 2 4 2 6 and 2 7 and 3 75 6 37 c in the sub zones 2 1 2 2 and 2 5 daily average sunshine hours and wind speed appeared higher in the northeast area and lower in the southwest area in sub zones 2 1 2 2 2 3 and 2 4 daily average sunshine hours was 6 58 7 03 and wind speed was 2 4 2 5 m s 1 in sub zones 2 5 2 6 and 2 7 daily average sunshine was 5 55 6 50 hours and daily average wind speed was 1 96 2 34 m s 1 daily average precipitation materialized higher in the north and southeast areas at 1 59 2 05 mm in sub zones 2 1 2 4 2 6 and 2 7 and lower in the central and west areas with the values over 1 35 1 43 m s 1 in sub zones 2 2 2 3 and 2 5 table 6 3 5 correlation analysis of etc and individual meteorological factors crop evapotranspiration as represented here by etc is strongly influenced by several climatic parameters such as relative humidity temperature wind and solar radiation etc the computation of etc via the intermediate et0 is sensitive to climatic factors that evolve during regional climate change and that vary over space the computation is somewhat complex thus a correlation analysis of the contributions of individual climate factor variation to cotton etc variation is merited table 7 provides simple linear correlations between annual etc of cotton and individual meteorological factors disaggregated by sub zone in the north china plain results showed that solar radiation or its close equivalent sunshine hours wind speed and precipitation have strongest linear correlations with the cotton etc in the range of 0 410 to 0 789 0 361 o 0 676 and 0 215 to 0 410 respectively significance p 0 01 table 7 relative humidity dew point temperature and daily average temperature had much weaker correlations with etc the declining trend of etc of cotton is consistent with the decreases of solar radiation sunshine hours and wind speed beyond climate crop water requirement is also related to the crop physiology agronomic measures landform and altitude of different areas 4 discussion agricultural irrigation in the north china plain made it possible to increase the production of food and fiber but at the same time it caused drawdown of groundwater levels efficient irrigation water management will save water and maximize the productivity tilman et al 2002 hamdy et al 2003 climate change shifts components of the hydrological cycle such as water consumption water stress and water distribution between areas lobell et al 2011 ebrahimpour et al 2014 it is important to explore the effect of climate variation on cotton water requirement in the north china plain based on a long time series 4 1 evapotranspiration and irrigation water requirement of cotton understanding the temporal and spatial variation of etc of cotton is highly conducive to better irrigation scheduling and managing agricultural water resources which are increasingly stressed by climate change and anthropogenic activities unless otherwise specified all values in this section are in millimeters of water per annual cotton growing season summarized across several years the annual average of etc of cotton from 1965 2016 is 573 mm within a range from 567 to 606 mm in this study this is similar to previous findings kong et al 2009 reported that the average annual etc of cotton in beijing area is 457 mm based on the simetaw model applied to 1951 2006 similarly huang et al 2012 found cotton etc at 595 mm in beijing area north china plain from 1991 to 2011 again calculated by simetaw from field experiment reports liu et al 2017 reported that 1 actual evapotranspiration eta of cotton ranged from 406 to 463 mm under border irrigation supporting a seed cotton yield of 2 5 3 1 t ha 1 and 2 from 370 to 430 mm eta under drip irrigation yielding seed cotton of 2 8 3 4 t ha 1 both in henan province north china plain tan et al 2017 reported that the actual evapotranspiration of cotton ranged from 561 to 618 mm under film mulched drip irrigation in xijiang china this study found an effective rainfall re of cotton s growing season averaging 451 mm and ranging from 441 to 466 mm and irrigation needs rainfall deficits iwr of cotton averaging 122 mm and ranging from 105 to 145 mm during the past 52 years spanning 43 meteorological stations evenly distributed in the north china plain this is lower than the value reported by huang et al 2012 who found cotton re at 326 mm and iwr of 269 mm respectively from 1991 2011 in beijing however our result is similar to liu et al 2017 s field experiment in which the average irrigation regime was 126 mm from 2011 to 2013 with a water use efficiency of 0 74 kg m 3 seed yield per unit of actual evapotranspiration these variations came from the different weather stations and different time coverage which makes it difficult to compare these results without narrowing to a consistent space time subset the result of this study supplies the information for water requirement and irrigation need of cotton in the north china plain based on a long term period the most critical water requirement of cotton was in june at its blossoming and boll forming stage with the average rainfall coupling degree of 0 75 this means that only 25 of water requirement of cotton must come from irrigation which is significantly lower than winter wheat s 70 of water having to be provided from pumped groundwater yang et al 2019 the etc time series derived in this study via simetaw is at its highest in the middle stage and relatively lower etc values are computed for the early and later stages this is similar to the result of farahani et al 2008 in the mediterranean and liu et al 2017 in henan province within ncp the option of appropriate irrigation and rainfed cotton cultivation in this area is worth exploring in the future 4 2 cotton evapotranspiration and meteorological factors the etc of cotton showed a significantly decreasing trend from 1965 2019 in the north china plain in this study a declining etc trend also appeared in the previous studies covering different crops these include winter wheat and summer maize in ncp liu et al 2005 winter wheat and maize in hebei province li et al 2009 winter wheat summer maize and spring maize in ncp yang et al 2011 2012 2013 cotton in beijing kong et al 2009 spring wheat jiang et al 2015 soybean hu et al 2017 in northeast china oat in the northeast and north china jia et al 2019 within the 52 year time series covered by this study a significant decrease in daily solar radiation declining at 0 035 mj m 2 yr 1 sunshine hours declining at 0 030 h yr 1 wind speed declining at 0 017 m s 1 yr 1 and relative humidity declining at 0 044 yr 1 were observed a significant increase in daily temperature at 0 033 c yr 1 and in dew point temperature at 0 015 c yr 1 and a slight decline in precipitation were witnessed solar radiation sunshine hour and wind speed declines correlated most with the cotton etc decline with average correlation coefficients of 0 566 0 523 and 0 444 respectively this is similar to previous meteorological studies of comparable periods a decline in global solar radiation is correlated with decreased pan evaporation in the northern hemisphere that has been observed over 50 years period ending around 2000 stanhill and cohen 2001 roderick and farquhar 2002 jia et al 2019 reported that the mean annual etc and iwr of oat showed decreasing tendencies from 1960 to 2015 in the northeast and north china jia et al 2019 also found that solar radiation mean wind speed sunshine duration and mean relative humidity had dominant impacts on the etc of oat with significant correlation coefficients of 0 229 0 674 0 181 0 697 0 304 0 716 and 0 186 0 700 respectively liu et al 2005 reported that the water requirements of winter wheat and summer maize also showed decreasing trends which mainly resulted from the reduction of sunshine hours and wind speed in the north china plain from 1950 to 2000 while precipitation and relative humidity trends had a negative effect the reduction of sunshine hours caused a decrease in energy reaching leaves sunshine hours supply radiation and light energy which are converted to heat energy and the energy source of plant evapotranspiration light energy is converted to the chemical energy of plants by photosynthesis and translated into organic matter biomass production and dry matter accumulation light can promote stomatal opening for plant transpiration jalota et al 2006 ebrahimpour et al 2014 hu et al 2019 in addition the reduction of wind speed weakens the surface atmosphere energy exchange intensity although temperature is clearly increasing in recent years etc indeed shows a decreasing trend because of other meteorological factors working in the opposite direction to temperature however it is well known that climate change is a complex dynamic process the effect of meteorological climatic factors on crop water requirement varied among the seven sub zones etc is also affected by the plant itself such as plant canopy structure and plant physiology plant canopy roughness affects turbulent air flow plant physiology factors including light capture leaf age and surface humidity also affect etc mancosu et al 2016 in addition follow up studies should consider the impact of soil types soil tillage and crop cultivation management elevation and other factors on crop water requirements beyond the climate factor and subregional differences considered in this study in sum this study provides insights into the correlational relationship between the changes of etc and changes in individual meteorological climatic factors which should help adjust the cropping structure to adapt to future climate change the irrigation water requirement indicator gives information for better managing water resource at the regional to sub regional level 5 conclusion realistic computation of the temporal and spatial variation of cotton etc is essential for water resource management in the context of climate change the assessment of iwr is as well important for developing better irrigation regimes and crop management strategies that are viable for sustainable water use crop yield and profits to enable adaptation to climate change the annual average of cotton etc in the growing season was about 573 mm during the past five decades in the north china plain a significantly decreasing trend was observed in cotton etc at the rate of 1 1 mm per year the average annual re and iwr of cotton were 451 mm and 122 mm within the yearly variations and the trend of climate change the rainfall crop compatibility index for cotton s whole growing season reached 0 75 a significantly better match to regional rainfall seasonality than that of winter wheat although etc of cotton has declined and only 25 of cotton s water requirement comes from irrigation on average irrigation efficiency and cultivation management measures still need to be improved and optimized to reduce the groundwater pumped and maintain or increase yield the spatial distribution of cotton etc showed an obvious sub regional heterogeneity and exhibited some spatial shift over five decades highest etc values shifted from the southern area in 1965 1975 to the northeast area in 1976 1985 and then moved to the western part of the north china plain in 2006 2016 different detailed irrigation policies and schedules are needed in different sub regions during the period of 1965 2016 daily solar radiation sunshine hours and wind speed all showed significantly declining trends cotton etc s decline is correlated most with these three factors having correlation coefficients of 0 566 0 523 and 0 444 respectively significant increases in daily temperature and dew point temperature and slight declines in precipitation and relative humidity were observed these four metrics were negatively correlated with cotton etc water shortage as the factor most limiting to sustainable agricultural development in the north china plain requires the development of strategies that reduce unproductive evapotranspiration improve irrigation systems and schedules and adjust crop configuration toward less irrigation intensive crops like cotton this study highlights the contributions of evapotranspiration modeling and climate data in planning for crop selection and

10421,climate change directly affects crop evapotranspiration and irrigation demand the temporal and spatial variation of crop evapotranspiration is crucial to irrigation schedule planning and water resource management using 52 years of climate data from 43 stations in the north china plain this study examined trends and spatial distributions of the cotton evapotranspiration etc and irrigation requirement iwr and revealed the impact of climate variation on cotton etc change we found that annual etc of cotton in the growing season showed a significant declining trend which decreased from 606 mm yr 1 in 1965 1975 to 551 mm yr 1 in 2006 2016 annual effective rainfall re and iwr of cotton s growing season did not show consistency over the 52 year period which averaged at 451 mm 441 466 mm and 122 mm 105 145 mm respectively the 75 of cotton etc was supplied by rainfall and 25 by irrigation water this is much better than for winter wheat where 60 must be supplied by irrigation the location of the spatial maximum cotton etc shifted during the past five decades from 1965 to 1975 maximum etc values were found in the southern part and then shifted to the northeastern part from 1976 to 1985 during the period of 1986 to 2005 maximum etc occurred in the middle area and shifted to the western part in 2006 2016 during the past five decades solar radiation sunshine hours and wind

change and population growth threatening global food security and environmental sustainability huang et al 2012 since agriculture is by far the largest water consumer of the economy hamdy et al 2003 it must be considered an important part of the solution according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc the global average air temperature has increased by approximately 0 74 c over the last 100 years ipcc et al 2007 agriculture is dependent on weather conditions and future climate change can be detrimental lobell et al 2011 in the north china plain ncp water scarcity is especially severe alternative cash crops with high rainfall use efficiency instead of winter wheat with its high groundwater pumpage are getting more attention cotton a cash field crop has the biggest planting area accounting for about 7 of this area during the last 40 years with high economic output value national bureau of statistics of china 2017 a better understanding of the sources and magnitudes of cotton water requirements can greatly help in making reasonable irrigation schemes for better agricultural water management the ncp is one of the most important grain and cotton production regions in china qiu et al 2018 it contains 136 000 km2 of arable land that produces more than 50 of wheat yields 40 of maize yields and 35 of cotton yields of the whole country yang et al 2015a mo et al 2016 the predominant cropping system is winter wheat summer maize double rotation xiao et al 2013 the annual average precipitation is 450 600 mm with a range of 300 1000 mm and more than 70 of precipitation is concentrated in the summer season from july to september cao et al 2014 water consumption of the winter wheat summer maize rotation amounts to 800 1000 mm liu et al 2002 sun et al 2011 gao et al 2015 yang et al 2015b van oort et al 2016 yang et al 2017 sun et al 2019 the annual water deficit of the rotation is between 200 and 400 mm this deficit resulting from winter wheat cropping outside of the wet season is supplemented by groundwater pumpage for irrigation in pursuit of high yield zhang et al 2017 extensive irrigation has resulted in a rapid groundwater table decline of approximately 1 m yr 1 during the past 20 years accompanied by severe land subsidence in some areas salt intrusion near the coast ecosystem degradation and groundwater quality deterioration pei et al 2017 xiao et al 2017 rashid et al 2019 yang et al 2019 water shortage is the greatest limitation to sustainable agricultural development in the ncp cotton with its good match between growing season and regional rainy season is in transition to supplant traditional crops having high water consumption therefore it is urgent and important to clarify the crop evapotranspiration etc and irrigation water requirement iwr of cotton including their temporal and spatial variation and to determine how the variation of meteorological factors affected etc and iwr this assessment will supply indispensable information for irrigation strategy and sustainable water management adapted to climate change in this area etc constitutes a major component of regional and global hydrological cycles and therefore has important implications in the use of agricultural irrigation water as well as in evaluating crop water stress in agricultural ecosystems allen et al 2005 etc as the most important factor is commonly estimated by multiplying standard reference evapotranspiration et0 by a crop coefficient kc that expresses the seasonality of crop development in water uptake terms all of etc et0 and kc vary day by day the classic penman monteith equation to evaluate et0 is recommended by the un food and agriculture organization fao allen et al 1998 researchers have estimated etc in wheat grapes corn and barley using spectral satellite imaging data and the penman monteith equation heilman et al 1982 farahani et al 2008 glenn et al 2011 er raki et al 2013 jin et al 2017 the penman monteith equation relies on daily meteorological data such as temperature wind speed and relative humidity allen et al 1998 kang et al 2003 trends and fluctuations in meteorological values lead to the variations in et0 and consequently in etc an accurate computation of the seasonal total etc is important for water resource planning and the assessment of the related iwr crop water demand not satisfied by rainfall is central to developing crop management strategies which are economically rational in terms of water usage crop yield and profits this study applied the simetaw simulation of evapotranspiration of applied water model to evaluate etc of cotton in the growing season snyder et al 2004 2012 orang et al 2013 ebrahimpour et al 2014 swelam et al 2014 mancosu et al 2016 simetaw based on penman monteith equation proceeds to translate a time series of et0 into a time series of etc after calculating daily etc the input and derived data are used to determine re and to generate hypothetical irrigation schedules which materialize a time series of iwr the iwr is the net amount of irrigation water needed in addition to effective rainfall to produce a crop whose yield is not limited by water previous studies about the etc in ncp focused on staple grain crop winter wheat and summer maize little research about cotton s etc and iwr in this area has been done liu et al 2005 reported that etc of winter wheat and summer maize showed a decreasing trend at respective rates of 0 9 19 2 mm per year and 8 3 24 3 mm per year decrease during 1950 2000 over the ncp relying on penman monteith equation for et0 sunshine hour and wind speed declines were the most impact drivers of etc decrease song 2009 applied the simetaw model to calculate the etc of oat 252 mm summer maize 351 mm winter wheat 486 mm and spring sweet potato 459 mm in beijing area from 2006 to 2008 yang et al 2011 2012 2013 estimated the etc of winter wheat with an average value of 452 mm spring maize of 457 mm and summer maize of 322 mm in the ncp from 1960 2009 using the simetaw model the trend of solar radiation decrease from declining atmospheric transparency contributed most to the significantly downward trend of etc of the above crops shi et al 2009 calibrated and validated the simetaw model in the northwestern farming region of china deriving etc of maize 514 mm soybean 450 mm and millet 389 mm more recently jiang et al 2015 and hu et al 2017 estimated the etc of spring wheat to have an average value of 359 mm and soybean to have 398 mm in the northeast during 1965 2010 the significantly decreasing trend of etc was attributed to the decline of solar radiation jia et al 2019 reported etc and iwr of oat were at average values of 340 mm and 178 mm respectively they also noted the decreasing trends over the past five decades in northeast china were due to the decreasing solar radiation wind speed and sunshine duration far fewer studies have tried to evaluate the spatial and temporal variation of crop evapotranspiration and irrigation water requirement of a staple cash crop cotton is one of the most important economic crops in the ncp its planting area accounting for 44 of the whole country during the past 40 years national bureau of statistics of china 2017 therefore the objectives of this study were to investigate the historical and current water use of cotton particularly we will 1 quantify the temporal and spatial variation of cotton etc during the period of 1965 2016 over the ncp 2 clarify how well rainfall in cotton s critical growth season matches crop requirement 3 determine the spatio temporal variation of each meteorological factor and 4 further reveal the impact of climate change on etc and irrigation water requirement of cotton the study provides a meaningful reference for better understanding crop water requirement information of cotton for sustainable water resource management in the ncp 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the common cotton planting zone in north china plain was shown in fig 1 yu 2015 named as national cotton zone 2 there are 43 standard meteorological stations selected evenly distributed over the cotton planting area in north china plain fig 1 according to the environmental conditions including temperature precipitation and frost free period yu 2015 dong et al 2017 we subdivided it into seven sub zones fig 1 there are 9 stations in sub zone 2 1 4 stations in sub zone 2 2 7 stations in sub zone 2 3 8 stations in sub zone 2 4 5 stations in sub zone 2 6 and 6 stations in sub zone 2 7 detailed information about each sub zone including location frost free period and selected weather stations are shown in the supplementary material the cotton planting zone 2 as a whole has a warm temperature zone semi humid and monsoon climate solar radiation resources in this area are rich ranging over 5023 6032 mj m 2 year 1 the average annual temperature is 12 8 c the average annual rainfall over the last 52 years was 591 mm with large variation from year to year on average two thirds of the precipitation occur from july to september the seasonal pattern is evident from the monthly mean values 1965 2016 of precipitation maximum temperature and minimum temperature plotted in fig 2 the frost free period occurs in 200 240 days from april to october cotton is sown in late april and harvested in mid to late october and the harvest lasts 20 to 30 days most rainfall coincides with the growing season of cotton however it does not meet the full water requirement of cotton 2 2 climate data the daily meteorological data from the period of 1965 through 2016 52 years for the 43 standard meteorological stations were obtained from the china meteorological data sharing service system http www nmic cn soil parameters were from national soil survey database which included soil types soil texture wilting coefficient soil bulk density saturated moisture content and so on main crop characteristic parameters including sowing date harvesting date planting area and sowing density were acquired from literature field experiment data survey results and project reports changes in crop variety during the last 52 years were not taken into consideration the cotton growing calendar including the sowing date and harvest date is provided in detail in table s1 in the supplementary material 2 3 calculations of crop water interface 2 3 1 calculations of etc re and iwr etc was the water requirement of cotton in the growing season which was calculated using the simetaw model this

long enough to meet the requirement for crop evapotranspiration it omits rain that leaves quickly as runoff and deep percolation it was calculated as follows allen et al 1998 pang et al 2015 3 r r j Œ± j p i where rrj was the effective rainfall at the j th time mm pj was total rainfall amount at the j th time mm Œ±j was an effective rainfall utilization coefficient when pj 5 mm Œ±j 1 for 5 mm pj

mm j was the rainfall times from 1 to n the irrigation water requirement iwr is the amount of irrigation water needed beyond re to obtain yield of cotton that is not limited by water availability iwr can be obtained from each stage as 5 i w r e t c r e when short term iwr is positive it means etc is more than re the effective rainfall cannot meet the crop growth requirement and the irrigation water must make up the difference when iwr is negative it means re is more than etc the effective rainfall can meet the crop growth requirement and no need extra irrigation water during that growth stage thus iwr is set to zero effective rainfall is retained in the soil i e still effective until needed by the crop thus a surplus of re over etc in an earlier growth stage represented by a temporarily negative irrigation requirement iwr 0 can be used in a later growth stage if needed 2 3 2 calculations of rainfall crop compatibility index we defined rainfall crop compatibility index Œª to be the water availability ratio between crop water requirement and rainfall during a certain growing stage or whole growing season with values ranging from 0 to 1 growth stage values were 6 Œª i 1 r e i e t c i r e i e t c i r i e t c i where Œªi is the index value in the i th growth stage rei is the total effective rainfall in an i th stage mm and etci is the water requirement for crop growth in the i th stage mm the index value for the entire growing season is the ratio between the total effective rainfall and etc over the entire growing season 2 4 spatial analysis tools inverse distance weighted idw interpolation within arcgis 10 2 esri 2008 was used to interpolate the spatial distribution of etc and iwr during the past 52 years the control points are the 43 weather stations and we interpolated to create a grid so that the grid point values could be re aggregated into the seven sub zones or mapped more continuously using arcgis spatial analyst function 2 5 statistical methods statistical analyses were performed using the statistical analysis system 9 3 sas 9 3 sas institute inc cary nc usa 2011 and statistical significance of differences between mean values was determined using analysis of variance anova followed by post hoc comparisons using least significant difference lsd testing at a 5 probability level correlation analysis was conducted to show the relationship between etc and each meteorological factor in each sub zone in the north china plain the regression analysis was used to test the trend of each climate factor etc and iwr over the years at the 0 05 probability level 3 results 3 1 temporal variation of water requirements of cotton in the north china plain during the past 52 years yearly etc crop evapotranspiration of cotton in the north china plain showed a significant decrease during 1965 2016 fig 3 the average etc of cotton in 1965 1975 was about 603 mm then significantly decreased to 569 mm in 1976 1985 and was only 549 mm in 2006 2016 table 1 re effective rainfall for cotton in its growing season declined slightly during 1965 2016 with an average value of 451 mm fig 3 with a variably declining rate per decade table 1 the period of 1976 1995 exhibited a much faster declining rate of 2 43 mm per year while the declining trend flattened afterwards re in the cotton growing season decreased from 466 mm in 1976 1985 to 442 mm in 1986 1995 and then remained constant since then table 1 iwr irrigation water requirement of cotton in north china plain decreased during the period of 1965 2016 but the trend was not significant fig 3 the average iwr in cotton s growing season was 122 mm during 1965 2016 table 1 regarding the seven sub zones etc in the cotton growing season decreased notably in all sub zones table 2 etc of cotton in sub zones 2 1 2 2 and 2 5 showed decline rates ranging over 5 6 9 4 mm decade in the remaining four sub zones etc showed a much higher rate of decline at 11 1 18 2 mm decade the decline of etc in cotton s growing season may alleviate the pressure on the water resources to a certain degree in the north china plain among all seven sub zones trends of iwr of cotton did not show consistency table 2 in sub zones 2 2 and 2 3 iwr showed an initially decreasing trend from an average 192 mm in 1965 1975 to 147 mm in 1986 1995 followed by an increase to 210 mm in 1996 2005 then a decrease to 136 mm in 2006 2016 this pattern is similar in sub zone 2 1 the values of iwr in sub zone 2 1 during the selected five decades are overall lower than those in sub zones 2 2 and 2 3 in sub zone 2 1 iwr of 83 mm in 1965 1975 decreased to 35 mm in1986 1995 then increased to 134 mm in 1996 2005 and declined to 84 mm in 2006 2016 in sub zones 2 5 and 2 6 the iwr of cotton also showed an initially decreasing trend from 179 mm in 1965 1975 to 113 mm in 1976 1985 later increased to 191 mm in 1986 1995 and finally decreased to 146 mm in 2006 2016 in sub zone 2 4 iwr of cotton with 74 mm in 1965 1975 increased to 105 mm in 1976 1985 and then decreased to 58 mm in 2006 2016 in sub zone 2 7 there is little need to irrigate when re is more than etc in cotton s growing season such as the periods of 1986 1985 and 1996 2005 table 2 the maximum iwr in cotton s growing season for sub zones 2 1 2 2 and 2 5 occurred in 1996 2005 with decadal average values ranging from 134 to 242 mm for sub zones 2 3 and 2 4 the greatest iwr manifested in 1976 1985 with average values ranging from 105 to 197 mm for the remaining sub zones 2 6 and 2 7 the highest iwr manifested in 1965 1975 with average values ranging from 117 167 mm this trend coincides with the countertrend of re in all sub zones etc does not change too much from year to year but re changes quite a bit thus requiring an opposite trend of iwr to keep the sum of fluctuating re and iwr for the steadier etc the re in cotton s growing season for sub zones 2 1 2 2 and 2 5 showed the lowest value of 346 408 mm in 1965 1975 for sub zones 2 3 and 2 4 the minimum re over 392 463 mm appeared in 1976 1985 for sub zones 2 6 and 2 7 the smallest re presented in 1986 1995 with average values of 406 478 mm table 2 3 2 spatial variation of water requirements of cotton during 1965 2016 in the north china plain the averages of etc re and iwr values of cotton in its growing season during the past 52 years in each sub zone are compared in table 3 the average etc of cotton of the past 52 years had apparent differences among seven sub zones the highest etc occurred in sub zone 2 6 with a value of 593 mm and a lowest value of 545 mm in sub zone 2 1 fig 4 shows the inverse distance weighted idw interpolated maps of decadal average etc in the north china plain the evolution of spatial patterns can be seen by comparing across decades in fig 4 as a whole the highest etc of cotton moved from the south to the northeast and finally to the west region within the north china plain over the interval 1965 2016 during the period of 1965 1975 etc showed a strong gradient of higher values in the southern area to lower values in the north the highest etc occurred in sub zone 2 6 the west of 2 4 and the east of 2 5 with a bigger area of the value of 613 629 mm by 1976 1985 a notable change of etc pattern arose with higher value areas shifting northeastward to the east of 2 3 and the middle of 2 4 sub zones meanwhile the highest etc area narrowed falling to 575 585 mm by 1986 1995 the highest location shifted eastward to the middle of 2 3 and the west of 2 5 sub zones these higher etc areas narrowed in space having a range of 581 604 mm in 1996 2005 and changed little from the previous interval the highest etc was about 578 592 mm in this period by 2006 2016 the highest etc zone shifted to the west of 2 5 and 2 6 sub zones with the values range of 555 564 mm in general the spatial pattern of etc of cotton showed notable shifts during the past 52 years higher etc values shifted from the southern area in 1965 1975 to the northeast area in 1976 1985 and then moved to the west part of the north china plain in 2006 2016 in addition the area of higher etc values became smaller from 1965 1975 to 2006 2016 and the values exhibited an obvious decreasing trend from 613 629 mm in 1965 1975 to 555 564 mm in 2006 2016 fig 4 the average re of cotton of the past 52 years also showed differences across sub zones re of cotton was higher in the southeast area and lower in the northeast area the highest and lowest re were 529 mm in sub zone 2 7 and 386 mm in sub zone 2 5 respectively table 3 the average iwr of cotton of the past 52 years showed the usual complementary spatial variation countering re with the higher values in the middle and west areas and lower values in the east and south area of the north china plain the highest iwr appeared in sub zone 2 5 with the value of 177 mm the lowest value occurred in subzone 2 7 with the value of 42 mm due to the higher rainfall in this area table 3 the idw interpolated maps of decadal average iwr of cotton are detailed in fig 5 3 3 rainfall crop compatibility index between effective rainfall and water requirement of cotton the average etc of cotton during the last 52 years was 573 mm table 1 which was affected by the physiological characteristics of the crop and the regional ecological environment the rainfall crop compatibility index in the growing season of cotton during the period of 1965 2016 was 0 75 table 4 this is higher than winter wheat s 0 4 yang et al 2012 and similar to summer maize s 0 78 and spring maize s 0 72 yang et al 2011 cotton s good match is because its growing season from end of the april to the middle of october in the north china plain corresponds to the wettest rainfall season in this area 60 70 of annual rain falls in the summer season from june to september fig 2 breaking out each cotton growth stage in this region the rainfall crop compatibility index of cotton was smaller at sowing stage and seedling stage than in the later stages at values of 0 47 and 0 53 respectively this is because rainfall is less in the early stage of the cotton growing season the end of april to the beginning of june the rainfall compatibility rate in this early growing stage is only about 50 the rainfall crop compatibility index of cotton was greatest at its blossoming and boll forming stage with the value of 0 8 because this period is from the middle of july to the end of august when rainfall peaks fig 2 the rainfall crop compatibility index in the bud stage the middle of june to the middle of july and the boll opening stage the end of august to the middle of october were 0 65 and 0 62 respectively table 4 regarding each sub zone the rainfall crop compatibility index in cotton s growing season were higher in southeast area with sub zone values of 0 80 0 85 and lower in the middle and west area with the values of 0 68 0 73 for every sub zone the compatibility index was highest in the blossoming and boll forming stage 0 69 0 89 and lowest in the early stages of sowing and seedling 0 40 0 69 as a whole the lowest compatibility index was 0 40 at sowing stage in 2 2 sub zone and the highest value was 0 89 at blossoming and boll forming stage in sub zone 2 1 table 4 this analysis helps in water allocation and reallocation during the same growing season based on crops higher or lower compatibility index 3 4 temporal and spatial variation of daily mean meteorological factors during 1965 2016 etc of cotton in its growing season is driven by interacting effects of different climate indicators therefore a detailed analysis of changes in each meteorological factor was conducted the average daily climate data is presented in fig 6 for the north china plain during the period of 1965 2016 the average daily values of solar radiation sunshine hours and wind speed showed significantly decreasing trends during the past 52 years p 0 01 fig 6a b c daily solar radiation starting at 15 79 mj m 2 in 1965 1975 significantly decreased to 15 16 mj m 2 in 1986 1995 and then continued to decrease to 14 32 mj m 2 in 2006 2016 similarly daily sunshine with the value of 7 07 hours in 1965 1974 significantly decreased to 6 55 hours in 1986 1995 and then continued to fall to 5 83 hours in 2006 2016 daily wind speed with the value of 2 74 m s 1 in 1965 1975 significantly decreased to 2 24 m s 1 in 1986 1995 and then continued to decrease to 2 01 m s 1 in 2006 2016 table 5 daily average air temperature had a significantly increasing trend at a rate of 0 023 c per year p 0 01 fig 6d average daily air temperature at 12 26 c in 1965 1974 significantly increased to12 64 c in 1986 1995 and then continued to increase to 13 35 c in 2006 2016 table 5 as part of the global warming phenomenon daily precipitation did not show an increase or decrease in decadal averages during the period of 1965 2006 fig 6e daily relative humidity showed a decreasing trend p 0 05 fig 6f daily relative humidity values ranged narrowly from 63 8 to 64 7 during the period of 1965 2005 and then decreased sharply to 61 7 in 2006 2016 daily dew point temperature showed an increasing trend during the period of 1965 2016 p 0 05 fig 6g dew point temperature s highest value of 7 36 c occurred in 1996 2005 and the lowest value of 6 54 c in 1965 1974 table 5 the spatial variation of each climate factor is shown in table 6 the 52 year average solar radiation per day was highest in the central area with values ranging over 15 21 15 50 mj m 2 in brighter sub zones 2 2 2 3 2 4 and 2 5 and lower in the dimmer south and north with the range of 14 37 14 94 mj m 2 in sub zones 2 1 2 6 and 2 7 daily average temperature relative humidity and dew point temperature were higher in the southeast area and lower in the northwest area daily average temperatures ranged over 13 12 14 78 c in warmer sub zones 2 3 2 4 2 6 and 2 7 and over 10 46 12 66 c in cooler sub zones 2 1 2 2 and 2 5 daily relative humidity was 63 8 70 3 in the wetter sub zones 2 3 2 4 2 6 and 2 7 and 58 6 61 9 in the drier sub zones 2 1 2 2 and 2 5 daily dew point temperature ranged over 7 55 10 37 c in the sub zones 2 3 2 4 2 6 and 2 7 and 3 75 6 37 c in the sub zones 2 1 2 2 and 2 5 daily average sunshine hours and wind speed appeared higher in the northeast area and lower in the southwest area in sub zones 2 1 2 2 2 3 and 2 4 daily average sunshine hours was 6 58 7 03 and wind speed was 2 4 2 5 m s 1 in sub zones 2 5 2 6 and 2 7 daily average sunshine was 5 55 6 50 hours and daily average wind speed was 1 96 2 34 m s 1 daily average precipitation materialized higher in the north and southeast areas at 1 59 2 05 mm in sub zones 2 1 2 4 2 6 and 2 7 and lower in the central and west areas with the values over 1 35 1 43 m s 1 in sub zones 2 2 2 3 and 2 5 table 6 3 5 correlation analysis of etc and individual meteorological factors crop evapotranspiration as represented here by etc is strongly influenced by several climatic parameters such as relative humidity temperature wind and solar radiation etc the computation of etc via the intermediate et0 is sensitive to climatic factors that evolve during regional climate change and that vary over space the computation is somewhat complex thus a correlation analysis of the contributions of individual climate factor variation to cotton etc variation is merited table 7 provides simple linear correlations between annual etc of cotton and individual meteorological factors disaggregated by sub zone in the north china plain results showed that solar radiation or its close equivalent sunshine hours wind speed and precipitation have strongest linear correlations with the cotton etc in the range of 0 410 to 0 789 0 361 o 0 676 and 0 215 to 0 410 respectively significance p 0 01 table 7 relative humidity dew point temperature and daily average temperature had much weaker correlations with etc the declining trend of etc of cotton is consistent with the decreases of solar radiation sunshine hours and wind speed beyond climate crop water requirement is also related to the crop physiology agronomic measures landform and altitude of different areas 4 discussion agricultural irrigation in the north china plain made it possible to increase the production of food and fiber but at the same time it caused drawdown of groundwater levels efficient irrigation water management will save water and maximize the productivity tilman et al 2002 hamdy et al 2003 climate change shifts components of the hydrological cycle such as water consumption water stress and water distribution between areas lobell et al 2011 ebrahimpour et al 2014 it is important to explore the effect of climate variation on cotton water requirement in the north china plain based on a long time series 4 1 evapotranspiration and irrigation water requirement of cotton understanding the temporal and spatial variation of etc of cotton is highly conducive to better irrigation scheduling and managing agricultural water resources which are increasingly stressed by climate change and anthropogenic activities unless otherwise specified all values in this section are in millimeters of water per annual cotton growing season summarized across several years the annual average of etc of cotton from 1965 2016 is 573 mm within a range from 567 to 606 mm in this study this is similar to previous findings kong et al 2009 reported that the average annual etc of cotton in beijing area is 457 mm based on the simetaw model applied to 1951 2006 similarly huang et al 2012 found cotton etc at 595 mm in beijing area north china plain from 1991 to 2011 again calculated by simetaw from field experiment reports liu et al 2017 reported that 1 actual evapotranspiration eta of cotton ranged from 406 to 463 mm under border irrigation supporting a seed cotton yield of 2 5 3 1 t ha 1 and 2 from 370 to 430 mm eta under drip irrigation yielding seed cotton of 2 8 3 4 t ha 1 both in henan province north china plain tan et al 2017 reported that the actual evapotranspiration of cotton ranged from 561 to 618 mm under film mulched drip irrigation in xijiang china this study found an effective rainfall re of cotton s growing season averaging 451 mm and ranging from 441 to 466 mm and irrigation needs rainfall deficits iwr of cotton averaging 122 mm and ranging from 105 to 145 mm during the past 52 years spanning 43 meteorological stations evenly distributed in the north china plain this is lower than the value reported by huang et al 2012 who found cotton re at 326 mm and iwr of 269 mm respectively from 1991 2011 in beijing however our result is similar to liu et al 2017 s field experiment in which the average irrigation regime was 126 mm from 2011 to 2013 with a water use efficiency of 0 74 kg m 3 seed yield per unit of actual evapotranspiration these variations came from the different weather stations and different time coverage which makes it difficult to compare these results without narrowing to a consistent space time subset the result of this study supplies the information for water requirement and irrigation need of cotton in the north china plain based on a long term period the most critical water requirement of cotton was in june at its blossoming and boll forming stage with the average rainfall coupling degree of 0 75 this means that only 25 of water requirement of cotton must come from irrigation which is significantly lower than winter wheat s 70 of water having to be provided from pumped groundwater yang et al 2019 the etc time series derived in this study via simetaw is at its highest in the middle stage and relatively lower etc values are computed for the early and later stages this is similar to the result of farahani et al 2008 in the mediterranean and liu et al 2017 in henan province within ncp the option of appropriate irrigation and rainfed cotton cultivation in this area is worth exploring in the future 4 2 cotton evapotranspiration and meteorological factors the etc of cotton showed a significantly decreasing trend from 1965 2019 in the north china plain in this study a declining etc trend also appeared in the previous studies covering different crops these include winter wheat and summer maize in ncp liu et al 2005 winter wheat and maize in hebei province li et al 2009 winter wheat summer maize and spring maize in ncp yang et al 2011 2012 2013 cotton in beijing kong et al 2009 spring wheat jiang et al 2015 soybean hu et al 2017 in northeast china oat in the northeast and north china jia et al 2019 within the 52 year time series covered by this study a significant decrease in daily solar radiation declining at 0 035 mj m 2 yr 1 sunshine hours declining at 0 030 h yr 1 wind speed declining at 0 017 m s 1 yr 1 and relative humidity declining at 0 044 yr 1 were observed a significant increase in daily temperature at 0 033 c yr 1 and in dew point temperature at 0 015 c yr 1 and a slight decline in precipitation were witnessed solar radiation sunshine hour and wind speed declines correlated most with the cotton etc decline with average correlation coefficients of 0 566 0 523 and 0 444 respectively this is similar to previous meteorological studies of comparable periods a decline in global solar radiation is correlated with decreased pan evaporation in the northern hemisphere that has been observed over 50 years period ending around 2000 stanhill and cohen 2001 roderick and farquhar 2002 jia et al 2019 reported that the mean annual etc and iwr of oat showed decreasing tendencies from 1960 to 2015 in the northeast and north china jia et al 2019 also found that solar radiation mean wind speed sunshine duration and mean relative humidity had dominant impacts on the etc of oat with significant correlation coefficients of 0 229 0 674 0 181 0 697 0 304 0 716 and 0 186 0 700 respectively liu et al 2005 reported that the water requirements of winter wheat and summer maize also showed decreasing trends which mainly resulted from the reduction of sunshine hours and wind speed in the north china plain from 1950 to 2000 while precipitation and relative humidity trends had a negative effect the reduction of sunshine hours caused a decrease in energy reaching leaves sunshine hours supply radiation and light energy which are converted to heat energy and the energy source of plant evapotranspiration light energy is converted to the chemical energy of plants by photosynthesis and translated into organic matter biomass production and dry matter accumulation light can promote stomatal opening for plant transpiration jalota et al 2006 ebrahimpour et al 2014 hu et al 2019 in addition the reduction of wind speed weakens the surface atmosphere energy exchange intensity although temperature is clearly increasing in recent years etc indeed shows a decreasing trend because of other meteorological factors working in the opposite direction to temperature however it is well known that climate change is a complex dynamic process the effect of meteorological climatic factors on crop water requirement varied among the seven sub zones etc is also affected by the plant itself such as plant canopy structure and plant physiology plant canopy roughness affects turbulent air flow plant physiology factors including light capture leaf age and surface humidity also affect etc mancosu et al 2016 in addition follow up studies should consider the impact of soil types soil tillage and crop cultivation management elevation and other factors on crop water requirements beyond the climate factor and subregional differences considered in this study in sum this study provides insights into the correlational relationship between the changes of etc and changes in individual meteorological climatic factors which should help adjust the cropping structure to adapt to future climate change the irrigation water requirement indicator gives information for better managing water resource at the regional to sub regional level 5 conclusion realistic computation of the temporal and spatial variation of cotton etc is essential for water resource management in the context of climate change the assessment of iwr is as well important for developing better irrigation regimes and crop management strategies that are viable for sustainable water use crop yield and profits to enable adaptation to climate change the annual average of cotton etc in the growing season was about 573 mm during the past five decades in the north china plain a significantly decreasing trend was observed in cotton etc at the rate of 1 1 mm per year the average annual re and iwr of cotton were 451 mm and 122 mm within the yearly variations and the trend of climate change the rainfall crop compatibility index for cotton s whole growing season reached 0 75 a significantly better match to regional rainfall seasonality than that of winter wheat although etc of cotton has declined and only 25 of cotton s water requirement comes from irrigation on average irrigation efficiency and cultivation management measures still need to be improved and optimized to reduce the groundwater pumped and maintain or increase yield the spatial distribution of cotton etc showed an obvious sub regional heterogeneity and exhibited some spatial shift over five decades highest etc values shifted from the southern area in 1965 1975 to the northeast area in 1976 1985 and then moved to the western part of the north china plain in 2006 2016 different detailed irrigation policies and schedules are needed in different sub regions during the period of 1965 2016 daily solar radiation sunshine hours and wind speed all showed significantly declining trends cotton etc s decline is correlated most with these three factors having correlation coefficients of 0 566 0 523 and 0 444 respectively significant increases in daily temperature and dew point temperature and slight declines in precipitation and relative humidity were observed these four metrics were negatively correlated with cotton etc water shortage as the factor most limiting to sustainable agricultural development in the north china plain requires the development of strategies that reduce unproductive evapotranspiration improve irrigation systems and schedules and adjust crop configuration toward less irrigation intensive crops like cotton this study highlights the contributions of evapotranspiration modeling and climate data in planning for crop selection and

10422,climate change poses great challenges for food security and water use this study aimed to investigate the response of winter wheat in northern china to climate change and propose corresponding strategies to maintain yield and crop water productivity wpc climate model projections from the fifth phase of the climate model intercomparison project cmip5 were used to drive the process based soil water atmosphere plant swap agro hydrological model the swap parameters were optimized by the parameter estimation program pest which extended the crop model to the regional scale swap was used to simulate responses of crop growth evapotranspiration et and yield to baseline 2006 2012 climate and two representative concentration pathway rcp scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 for future climate conditions the results indicated that pest had high optimization efficiency and calibrated swap performed well average relative error 20 87 and normalized root mean square error 25 83 compared with baseline the maximum and minimum temperatures increased significantly p 0 05 by 6 47 c and 8 59 c respectively the cumulative precipitation during the growing season increased by 303 22 316 12 mm warming significantly p 0 05 reduced the growth period of winter wheat by 25 3 34 7 days especially in the emergence heading stage path analysis revealed that significant p 0 05 change of precipitation was a determining factor in increasing et the adverse effect of temperature increase offset the promotion of yield due to radiation and ultimately led to a yield reduction of 35 57 41 14 the optimization scenario indicated that late maturing varieties and irrigation adjustment could improve yield up to 38 21 and wpc up to 44 30 under future climate conditions implementing irrigation at an early growing stage joining and heading was beneficial to increase yield and wpc we recommend combining late maturing varieties with irrigation adjustments to maintain yield and wpc under future climate conditions keywords climate change winter wheat swap pest irrigation 1 introduction climate change is an important environmental issue that is a concern for scientists and policymakers around the world zhang et al 2015 many studies have indicated that climate change will bring new challenges to food security and water use ding et al 2016 lei et al 2016 ummenhofer et al 2015 the main characteristics of climate change are increased greenhouse gas emissions rising temperatures and changes in precipitation hatfield and dold 2019 trenberth 2011 continued global warming would increase the global mean temperature by 1 8 4 0 c by the end of the century wheeler and von braun 2013 precipitation has been predicted to increase 1 3 for every 1 c global mean surface temperature rise hatfield and dold 2019 prediction of future climate change is also complicated by the potential for increased frequency of extreme disasters such as floods and droughts dai 2013 ummenhofer et al 2015 agroecosystems pasture and cropland cover nearly 40 of the earth s land surface and are increasingly vulnerable to variability and extremes of climate asner et al 2004 foley et al 2005 ramankutty and foley 1999 ummenhofer et al 2015 the physiological processes of crops are strongly influenced by environmental changes including soil mainly changes in soil water content and meteorological conditions hatfield and dold 2019 watson et al 2017 crop photosynthesis can be reduced thereby advancing the transformation of assimilates pre stored in vegetative tissues to grains chartzoulakis and psarras 2005 yang and zhang 2006 warming also increases the probability of crops being subjected to heat stress akter and rafiqul islam 2017 hatfield and dold 2019 high temperature also triggers an increase in crop evaporation demand leading to water stress hatfield and dold 2019 watson et al 2017 yano et al 2007 this will inevitably exacerbate the competition for water resources between agriculture and other sectors cammarano et al 2016 increases in co2 concentration and precipitation are likely to benefit crops especially c3 crops such as wheat rice and soybeans mo et al 2009 considering the overall impact of climate change on crops an increase in co2 concentration may offset the yield reduction caused by temperature and precipitation ummenhofer et al 2015 yano et al 2007 especially under water stress conditions van der kooi et al 2016 the impact of future climate on crop production has been extensively studied through climate change scenarios hatfield and dold 2019 rashid et al 2019 yano et al 2007 increased temperature may accelerate crop growth and shorten the growth period christy et al 2018 rashid et al 2019 climate change has led to considerable reductions in yields for several crops such as corn wheat and rice bu et al 2015 he et al 2015 peng et al 2004 in recent years some climate prediction models such as the regional climate model cammarano et al 2017 climate generator guo et al 2010 and global climate models tao et al 2018 wang et al 2018 have been broadly utilized to drive crop models to study the effects of climate change on crop growth processes christy et al 2018 used the cat wheat model to simulate wheat growth which indicated that an increase in co2 concentration can promote transpiration efficiency wheat crops were simulated for 60 representative sites across the australian wheat belt using the apsim wheat model demonstrating that crops would face severe water stress 40 2 43 9 under future climatic conditions watson et al 2017 the soil water atmosphere plant swap model kroes et al 2017 has been shown to perform well in simulating crop growth at both field and regional scales hassanli et al 2016 mart√≠nez ferri et al 2013 mokhtari et al 2018 and has also been used to study the effects of climate change on irrigation demand yano et al 2007 however there are still many inadequacies in the research on how climate change affects crop growth first use of agricultural numerical models to study the effects of climate change on crop growth has mostly been limited to point scales ding et al 2016 it is necessary to extend research to regional scales to assess the overall impact of climate change and adaptation strategies mo et al 2009 ummenhofer et al 2015 currently many crop model users adjust model parameters through trial and error this method requires the subjective adjustment of input parameters based on the accumulative knowledge of the researcher and their degree of understanding of the model this not only requires time and effort but the simulation accuracy of the model is often not satisfactory fang et al 2010 liang et al 2016 thus it requires more work to obtain reasonable parameters for multiple sites at the regional scale kim et al 2014 additionally many parameters are difficult to measure directly through field observations such as maintenance respiration and assimilate conversion into biomass many parameter automatic optimization tools have been developed in recent years to solve the above problems for example the parameter estimation program pest doherty 2019 has been used in many hydrological models because of its high optimization efficiency and precision elci et al 2010 fang et al 2010 kim et al 2014 however previous studies using pest have mostly focused on soil water movement at the site scale mart√≠nez ferri et al 2013 paying little attention to vegetative growth at the regional scale regional crop growth studies require that several crop genetic parameters that are closely related to crop growth be calibrated the optimal performance of pest on crop parameters in swap remains to be further explored secondly the extent and direction of the impact of climate change on crop production is complex and many details are uncertain dier et al 2018 dubey et al 2015 yano et al 2007 as a result of the complexity of the interaction between different climate variables temperature co2 and precipitation these variables may bring positive and negative results rashid et al 2019 path analysis wright 1921 is widely used to obtain deeper direct and indirect relationships between variables astereki et al 2017 de almeida rios et al 2018 seker and serin 2004 however this statistical method is rarely utilized to analyze the specific effects of climate change on crop growth the quantitative analysis of the impacts of meteorological and crop factors on evapotranspiration et and yield requires further investigation finally researchers have proposed many improvements to minimize the adverse effects of climate change these strategies include improvement of crop varieties liu et al 2009 agronomic adjustments akter and rafiqul islam 2017 liu et al 2013 and irrigation optimization rashid et al 2019 zhang et al 2015 however in practice the crop breeding process is detailed and complex modifying crop genetic parameters in crop models can save time to simulate how alternative species respond to climate change ding et al 2016 moreover each irrigation scheme is usually applicable to specific areas combining local water management practices to study the impact of climate change is a pressing need rashid et al 2019 therefore it is necessary to analyze the impacts of future climate conditions on winter wheat at the regional scale by appropriate methods and simulations based on quantifying these effects this study aimed to propose effective strategies for coping with the adverse effects of future climate change conditions the winter wheat autumn planting growing area in northern china was selected according to the chinese wheat planting regionalization reported by zhao 2010 this is because the wheat planting area and yield in the region account for 41 69 of china s totals and the region plays a pivotal role in ensuring national food security guo et al 2010 mo et al 2009 the objectives were as follows 1 to use pest to optimize the swap parameters to achieve localization of the model 2 to further analyze the spatial and temporal variation of the winter wheat growth period et and yield under future climate conditions 2030 2100 in northern china 3 quantify the contribution of climate change factors to crop growth through path analysis and 4 simulate the response of different varieties and irrigation patterns to climate change in multiple irrigation schemes and provide strategies to ensure regional food production the findings of this study will be valuable for ensuring regional food production and the efficient use of water resources under future climate conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is mainly located south of the great wall east of minshan mountain north of qinling mountain and the huaihe river supplementary material fig s1 this area belongs to the continental climate except for the coastal areas the annual average temperature is 9 15 c the precipitation during the growing season of wheat is 150 340 mm and has temporal and spatial disparities there is less precipitation in the northwest and more precipitation in the east most of the precipitation occurs during july and august the region often experiences drought in the spring based on historical climate data which is a major problem limiting wheat production zhao 2010 2 2 swap model swap is a process based agro hydrological model that simulates vegetation growth and the transport of water solutes and heat in the vadose zone kroes et al 2017 this model uses the one dimensional richards equation to describe water flow bonfante et al 2010 the penman monteith method is utilized to calculate potential et with values such as temperature net radiation and vapor pressure kroes et al 2017 as an important determinant of energy absorption by the canopy net radiation is also used to calculate photosynthetic products in this study we selected the detailed crop module available for swap to simulate the dynamic growth of winter wheat the phenology is quantified through the development stage ds in swap undergoing changes from the vegetative 0 ds 1 0 at seedling emergence and 1 at flowering to reproductive stage 1 ds 2 2 at maturity this model simulates the ds based on the temperature sum which is calculated using the effective temperature swap accounts for effects of temperature stress on leaf senescence and maintenance respiration through the leaf physiological aging factor and respiration rate increasing factor respectively kase and catsk√Ω 1984 ma et al 2013 penning de vries et al 1979 in the study area irrigation is usually carried out during the specific growth stage the jointing heading and grouting stages of winter wheat han et al 2017 ma et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 therefore the fixed irrigation regime is selected during baseline and future scenario simulations which involves a fixed irrigation depth at the three growth stages named above the irrigation depth of each stage is optimized by the pest the initial value and range for each irrigation regime are determined based on the results of previous researchers jiang et al 2013 li et al 2005 ma et al 2015 different amounts of irrigation were found to change the soil moisture status and swap used the feddes model to consider the effect of different soil water contents on root water uptake feddes et al 1978 actual transpiration which is the integral of root water uptake is also affected because actual transpiration is used to calculate the death rate of leaf and stem and the assimilation rate kroes et al 2017 the impact of irrigation is ultimately reflected in crop growth and yield the increasing co2 concentration is accounted for using the same method as that employed by supit et al 2012 which changes the stomatal conductance and co2 assimilation rate and further affects transpiration and photosynthesis groenendijk et al 2016 kroes et al 2017 swap contains three main input modules meteorology crop and soil the simulation results are output at 1 day intervals and stored in files this study mainly analyzes the results contained in the three output files soil profile water balance and crop growth the specific output variables are soil water content crop et development stage and cumulative dry weight of storage organ yield based on the above results we calculate the crop water productivity wpc following fern√°ndez et al 2020 1 w p c y e t c where y is the yield kg ha 1 and e t c is crop et m3 ha 1 2 2 1 input data 2 2 1 1 historical meteorological data and crop data the historical meteorological data and crop data for the study area were obtained from the national meteorological information center http data cma cn the meteorological data included in this study were net radiation maximum and minimum temperature relative humidity wind speed and precipitation supplementary material fig s2 multiple agro meteorological experimental stations are located in the area but there are large differences in data quality between sites after comprehensive comparison we selected 48 agro meteorological experimental stations with the highest data quality as regional representatives for this research fig 1 a observational data on winter wheat growth period and crop height were extracted at each site for the period 2006 2012 2 2 1 2 climate change scenarios and data the fifth phase of the climate model intercomparison project cmip5 provides a range of simulated climate futures that can be used as the basis for exploring climate change impacts and policy issues of considerable interest and relevance to society taylor et al 2012 although there are many future climate models included in cmip5 the type and time frequency of the meteorological variable output vary among models based on the requirements of the weather file in the swap model we set the corresponding conditions in the earth system grid federation esgf node at dkrz https esgf data dkrz de projects esgf dkrz to filter out the appropriate climate model and download future climate grid data the results showed that in the climate models provided by cmip5 only the mri cgcm3 model can provide complete future daily meteorological data 2030 2100 by which to drive the swap model we used the inverse distance weight interpolation method to obtain the future climate data of each station from the abovementioned grid data ding et al 2020 bai et al 2019 and constructed the weather file of the swap model three future time slices representing the 2030s near term 2030 2049 2050s mid term 2050 2069 and 2070s long term adaptation time frame 2070 2100 were chosen to reflect the changes of different time spans in future climate conditions rashid et al 2019 wang et al 2018 watson et al 2017 the present study considered two different representative concentration pathway rcp scenarios which are greenhouse gas concentration pathways indicating the expected radiative forcing in the year 2100 rashid et al 2019 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 represent the midrange mitigation and high emissions scenario which are considered the possible future emission scenarios taylor et al 2012 wang et al 2018 the co2 concentrations of rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 were projected as 538 and 936 ppm by 2100 respectively meinshausen et al 2011 the specific future co2 concentration change curve under different rcp scenarios can be found in van vuuren et al 2011 we chose 2006 2012 as a baseline which is consistent with the model calibration and verification period for easy comparison with future climate impacts 2 2 1 3 soil data experimental stations i e the aforementioned 48 agro meteorological stations usually do not measure soil hydraulic parameters therefore we downloaded the harmonized world soil database hwsd from the food and agriculture organization fao http www fao org soils portal soil survey soil maps and databases harmonized world soil database v12 en the database contains soil texture contents of sand silt and clay and bulk density data of topsoil 0 30 cm and subsoil 30 100 cm fao iiasa isric iss cas jrc 2012 fig 1b these soil properties were entered into the retc software to quantify the hydraulic functions of unsaturated soils van genuchten et al 1991 and initial soil hydraulic parameters were subsequently obtained 2 2 2 model calibration and verification method since there are many soil and crop parameters in the swap model it is difficult to calibrate and verify each parameter it is necessary to identify the sensitivity of these parameters and then use different parameter setting methods on the basis of results from ma et al 2013 and huang et al 2017 we classified the input parameters of the swap model according to sensitivity for parameters that are insensitive to simulation results we used swap default values or referred to the literature on winter wheat in the same region ma et al 2013 huang et al 2017 highly sensitive parameters in soil and crop modules were optimized through the pest program supplementary material table s1 the value of the soil hydraulic parameters ranged from the minimum value to the maximum value in the hwsd database of the study area the initial values and ranges of crop genetic parameters were determined by combining the research results of ma et al 2013 and huang et al 2017 we assumed that winter wheat varieties and field management in the next two years did not change huang et al 2017 we then utilized the first three growing seasons 2006 2007 2008 2009 and 2010 2011 for model calibration each corresponding next growing season 2007 2008 2009 2010 and 2011 2012 respectively was applied to verify the model parameters the soil water content at 10 20 and 50 cm soil depth growth period and yield data were all from the national meteorological information center and used for comparisons with the corresponding simulation values which we used to evaluate the simulation performance of swap specific statistical indices include the average relative error mre the root mean square error rmse the normalized root mean square error nrmse and the coefficient of variation cv these are written as follows 2 m r e i 1 n p i o i o i n 100 3 r m s e i 1 n p i o i 2 n 4 n r m s e r m s e o 100 5 c v s d p where n is the number of samples p i and o i is the i t h predicted value and observed value respectively p and o is the mean value of predicted value and observed value respectively and s d is the standard deviation of the predicted value based on the above indicators we selected the parameters of the growing season with the best simulation results for investigating the optimization management strategy of winter wheat under future climate change 2 3 pest program the pest program is a model independent parameter estimation and optimization software that communicates with a model using its own input and output files without any changes to the model fang et al 2010 it applies a robust gauss marquardt levenberg gml algorithm which combines the advantages of the inverse hessian method and the steep descent method and therefore provides faster and more efficient convergence towards the objective function minimum bahremand and de smedt 2007 doherty 2019 the core of the pest algorithm is to obtain the minimum solution of the objective function depending on the type of observations and the needs of the simulation the observations can be grouped with corresponding weights to achieve the best optimization liang et al 2016 this study contained two sets of objective functions soil water content and yield and the formula was as follows 6 œÜ œÜ s w c œÜ y i 1 n s w c w s w c i 2 o s w c i p s w c i 2 i 1 n y w y i 2 o y i p y i 2 where œÜ is the objective function subscripts s w c and y are soil water content and yield respectively n is the number of observations w is weight taken as 40 and 5 for soil water content and yield respectively liang et al 2016 o i is the i t h observed value and p i is the i t h predicted value 2 4 data processing and analysis 2 4 1 data processing the extraction of future grid weather data and the batch operation of swap model were realized by matlab r2016b mathworks natick ma usa soil texture and bulk density data were obtained from the hwsd through arcmap 10 6 esri redlands ca usa 2 4 2 path analysis we used spss 21 ibm armonk ny usa to perform path analysis in this study song et al 2016 by ranking the decision coefficient dc path analysis can be used to quantify the direction and extent of the influence of the independent variable on the dependent variable the dc were calculated with the following function 7 d c x 2 p x r x y p x 2 where d c x is the decision coefficient of the independent variable x p x is the direct path coefficient of the independent variable x and r x y is the correlation coefficient between the independent variable x and the dependent variable y a positive d c x indicates that the independent variable promotes the dependent variable and a negative d c x indicates the independent variable has an inhibitory effect on the dependent variable 2 4 3 statistical analysis analysis of variance anova and regression model construction were implemented by spss 21 mean comparisons were performed for significant effects with the least significant difference lsd test at Œ± 0 05 the differences between the regions were considered significant at p 0 05 it was used to reflect whether climate factors significantly changed under future conditions compared to the baseline as well as the degree of climate effects on crop growth et and yield 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration and verification 3 1 1 model performance evaluation compared with observed values the simulation errors of swap model were within acceptable limits mre 20 87 and nrmse 25 83 table 1 simulation results also revealed that pest had a good optimization effect on the model parameters at the regional scale from the average mre nrmse and cv of the three growing seasons the simulation of the growth period was superior to the soil water content and yield and had lower variability between different sites based on these optimized parameters swap could accurately simulate the field water status and crop growth process of winter wheat in summary the model had been well calibrated based on the study area and could be used in a predictive capacity the nrmse of yield and emergence heading days in the growing season of 2010 2011 were the smallest among all growing seasons the swap model also simulated soil water content and heading mature days well in 2010 2011 therefore the model parameters of the 2010 2011 growing season were selected for use in the future climate simulation from the regional distribution of simulation results supplementary material fig s3 swap also had a good performance at baseline 3 1 2 simulation of soil water content growth period and yield based on three statistical indicators mre rmse and nrmse of all growing seasons the simulated soil water content had a good agreement with the observed values during the verification period taking the juxian station 2011 2012 growing season as an example the average soil water content gradually increased with the depth of the soil layer supplementary material fig s4 three irrigations during jointing heading and filling had greatly increased soil water content however the effect of irrigation on the water content of the upper soil was greater than that of the deep soil the average change of soil water content in the 10 cm and 20 cm soil layers was 0 21 cm3 cm 3 and 0 15 cm3 cm 3 respectively this was because the topsoil had a closer contact with the atmosphere and soil water content was usually maintained at a low level because of soil evaporation therefore it was more susceptible to precipitation irrigation and atmospheric conditions than deep soil layers judging from the cv values for the three growing seasons the soil water content of different sites had a moderate variability which might be caused by the different meteorological conditions and irrigation the heading and maturity periods are the end dates of vegetative and reproductive growth of winter wheat respectively they are important growth stages of winter wheat and key indicators for evaluating the simulation accuracy of swap on crop growth processes the r 2 values of emergence heading days in the verification growing season were above 0 98 supplementary material fig s5 indicating that the simulated values were in good agreement with the observed values the simulation accuracy for maturity dates was slightly lower than the heading period because the error accumulation of the simulated heading date and the difference in thermal conditions between the sites huang et al 2017 despite this the simulated maturity date was still highly consistent with the observed values r 2 0 92 except for the 2009 2010 growing season the cv values of emergence heading days and heading mature days were less than 10 this indicated that the heading date and maturity date of winter wheat had a weak variability between different sites however this result was different from those of huang et al 2017 which was mainly because the research area selected by previous researchers was much larger than that in this study during the six simulated growing seasons only 14 sites 6 06 of the total number of sites had a relative error of more than 30 supplementary material fig s6 this indicates that the swap model can accurately simulate the yield of winter wheat in the study area after pest parameter optimization however in terms of the cv values the variability of yield between the sites was much greater than the soil water content and growth period this was because the factors affecting yield were more complicated than those affecting soil water content and growth period such as variety irrigation meteorology and soil 3 2 climate projections 3 2 1 net radiation change compared with the baseline the climate model showed a significant p 0 05 increase in the average daily net radiation in winter wheat growing area of northern china during the growing season fig 2 a overall the net radiation under the rcp4 5 scenario increased 47 94 in 2030 2100 the net radiation increased under the rcp8 5 scenario over the same period was slightly larger than that under rcp4 5 at 50 84 from the three future time slices the net radiation gradually decreased over time under rcp4 5 whereas it showed a trend of increasing first and then decreasing under rcp8 5 the net radiation exhibited periodic changes the net radiation was significantly p 0 05 different between sites in the study area the spatial variation of net radiation was similar under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios fig 3 a f the areas with a larger net radiation increase 50 were mainly located in the northeast and central regions of the study area whereas the areas with a lower net radiation increase 30 were mainly located in the southwestern regions for three future time slices the areas with a large increase in net radiation were gradually shrinking under the rcp4 5 scenario whereas the areas with a small increase expanded however from a regional perspective net radiation changed little with time under the rcp8 5 scenario in the three different periods the number of sites with a net radiation increase of 50 and 30 showed little change 3 2 2 cumulative precipitation change the average cumulative precipitation during the growing season under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios was 550 60 and 563 50 mm respectively for 2030 2100 compared with the baseline the precipitation significantly increased p 0 05 under the two rcp scenarios fig 2b the precipitation of the two rcp scenarios showed similar trends and first decreased and then increased with time slices unlike net radiation precipitation did not show periodic changes the spatial distribution of the precipitation changes varied substantially across the study area fig 3g l precipitation in the western region increased more than the eastern region this might be because of lower precipitation in the western region during the baseline than in the eastern region fig s2b the difference in precipitation distribution between the western and eastern regions was almost unchanged from 2030 to 2100 although precipitation increased at the regional scale at some sites precipitation decreased in individual years for example the precipitation at mengcheng station and suxian station decreased by 49 66 rcp8 5 in 2040 and 17 84 rcp4 5 in 2061 respectively 3 2 3 temperature change the maximum temperatures under the two scenarios were significantly p 0 05 higher than the baseline with temperatures increased by 6 13 c and 6 81 c under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively the maximum temperature changes fluctuated under both rcp scenarios fig 2c the temperature difference between the crests and the troughs was about 10 c from a temporal perspective the general trend of maximum temperature in both rcp scenarios was increasing the maximum temperature under the rcp8 5 scenario was slightly larger than under the rcp4 5 scenario because of the higher concentration of greenhouse gas emissions temperature changes at the site were different from the regional scale and did not always increase under the rcp4 5 scenario the maximum temperatures of linfen station lushi station and neixiang station were lower than the baseline in the 2030s 2050s and 2070s fig 4 a f except for the three stations mentioned above the maximum temperatures of other stations were higher than the baseline for rcp8 5 the maximum temperature of most stations was higher than baseline in the 2070s except for the lushi station decreased by 3 94 similar to the maximum temperature the change in minimum temperature also fluctuated over time with a 10 year cycle fig 2d however the minimum temperature increase was much larger than the maximum temperature which was consistent with the results of rashid et al 2019 the minimum temperature generally showed an increasing trend and the increase was faster under rcp8 5 than under rcp4 5 in terms of spatial variability the minimum temperature increase greater in the northern region was than in the southern region fig 4g l 3 3 climate impacts 3 3 1 growth period according to the prediction of mri cgcm3 climate model the growth days of winter wheat in the study area was significantly p 0 05 reduced under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios fig 5 a b this was consistent with the results reported by christy et al 2018 and guo et al 2010 the emergence mature period was shortened by 25 3 days rcp4 5 and 34 7 days rcp8 5 respectively this was similar to the results of yano et al 2007 which revealed that the winter wheat growth period was shortened by 24 days in future climatic conditions 2030 2100 similar to temperature the emergence heading days showed periodic changes in 2030 2100 the change cycle was generally consistent with the temperature this reveals that the increase in temperature is the main factor affecting the growth period ding et al 2016 rashid et al 2019 xiao et al 2016 correlation analysis revealed that the emergence heading period was shortened by 2 7 days for every 1 c increase in maximum temperature in the rcp scenario for the 2030s 2050s and 2070s the shortening of the emergence heading period under two rcp scenarios gradually increased which was inseparable from the increase in temperature tao et al 2014 wang et al 2013 under the rcp8 5 scenario the shortening of the emergence heading period in the future climate occurred more rapidly compared with rcp4 5 the emergence heading period under the rcp8 5 scenario became shorter by 1 44 7 96 with the continuation of time the difference of the emergence heading period between the two scenarios had further expanded fig 5a there were significant p 0 05 spatial differences in the emergence heading period duration between sites fig 6 a f under the rcp4 5 scenario the emergence heading period at baodi station was shortened by 61 days in 2062 whereas the period increased by 36 days at neixiang station in 2038 the area in which the emergence heading period shortened was gradually expanded and the expansion speed under rcp8 5 was faster than that under rcp4 5 by the 2070s under rcp8 5 except for the sanhe jiaozhou and liaocheng stations the emergence heading period was shortened by more than 15 the heading mature period was shortened by 0 8 days compared with the baseline under the rcp4 5 scenario whereas it was shortened by 0 5 days under the rcp8 5 scenario fig 5b although there were periodic changes in the duration of the heading mature period the cycle was inconsistent with that of the graphical temperature changes correlation analysis revealed that the relationship between the days of heading mature period and the temperature was weak r 2 0 10 future climate conditions had greater effects on the growth stage of crops before heading than after heading which was in accordance with the results reported by tao et al 2014 and wang et al 2013 the areas where the heading mature period was shortened greatly were mainly concentrated in the southwest and northeast regions the heading mature period increased in the central region of the study area fig 6g l in the 2050s the average heading mature period under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios increased by 3 87 and 3 83 respectively however the number of sites in which the heading mature period increased in duration decreased substantially in the 2070s future climate effects on the physiological and ecological processes of crops were extremely complicated asseng et al 2013 dhungana et al 2006 walker and schulze 2008 previous studies have shown that increases in temperature led to accelerated crop growth and prematurity christy et al 2018 ding et al 2016 guo et al 2010 when the temperature increased by 1 0 2 0 c the growth period was shortened by 15 28 days xiao et al 2016 the shortening of the growth period had both positive and negative effects xiao et al 2016 accelerated growth under high temperature reduced the seasonal water use tao and zhang 2013 and avoided winter wheat suffering from heat stress during the maturity period of may june rashid et al 2019 the adverse effects of shortening the growth period were mainly related to the reduced biomass accumulation and ultimately reduced yield akter and rafiqul islam 2017 ummenhofer et al 2015 yano et al 2007 3 3 2 et and yield compared with the baseline the average et of 2030 2100 under the rcp scenario had increased significantly p 0 05 this was consistent with the findings of liu et al 2013 and guo et al 2010 however the results of yano et al 2007 and rashid et al 2019 showed that et either decreased or there were negligible changes from the time series et showed a gradual decline under future climatic conditions fig 5c there were significant p 0 05 differences in et between sites in the study area fig 7 a f the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios had similar characteristics in the regional distribution of et and the increase of et gradually decreased from west to east overall the average yield under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios were reduced in the mri cgcm3 climate model compared with the baseline under the rcp8 5 scenario the yield decline was much higher the trend of winter wheat yield for the two rcp scenarios showed a gradual decrease for the period 2030 2100 fig 5d the change in yield over time had a certain periodicity and the cycle was roughly similar to net radiation simple correlation analysis also revealed the same conclusion in addition to net radiation other meteorological indicators were weakly correlated with yield r 2 0 10 moreover the yield significantly p 0 05 varied spatially sites with a lower yield decline 30 were concentrated in the western region fig 7g l severe yield reductions occurred in the central region however the effects of climate change on winter wheat yield has been controversial akter and rafiqul islam 2017 mo et al 2009 watson et al 2017 our results also reveal that the yield increased at some sites suggesting complex impacts of climatic factors on yield 3 3 3 path analysis of climate effects on et and yield the direct and indirect effects of climate factors on et are listed in table 2 except for the minimum temperature the direct effects of other factors on et were positive indicating promotion effects on et the maximum temperature and minimum temperature had the largest indirect effect on et and were both negative from the absolute value of the dc the top three factors affecting et were precipitation emergence heading period heading mature period the comprehensive effects of these three factors on et were promoted this result revealed the increase of et under future climate compared with the baseline the increase in precipitation was much greater than the decrease in emergence heading days and heading mature days the positive effect of radiation on yield was enhanced by the positive indirect effect of maximum temperature emergence heading period heading mature period and et table 3 this produced a simple correlation of net radiation to yield higher than that of the direct effect according to the absolute value of the dc the factors affecting the yield were ranked as follows radiation et minimum temperature this explained the reasons for the decline in yield under the rcp scenarios compared with the baseline the minimum temperature increase was much larger than the net radiation and et therefore although the increase net radiation promoted the yield this effect was offset by the minimum temperature increase these factors ultimately led to a yield reduction compared with the rcp4 5 scenario the minimum temperature increased greater than net radiation under the rcp8 5 scenario the average et under the rcp8 5 scenario was also less than that under the rcp4 5 scenario although net radiation had the greatest impact on yield the superposition effect of minimum temperature and et caused the yield of the rcp8 5 scenario to be lower than that of the rcp4 5 scenario the days of the emergence heading and heading mature periods had a positive correlation with yield and the effect of the heading mature period was greater this reveals that under the future climatic conditions selection of the winter wheat variety with higher demand for accumulated temperature can be used to prolong the growth stage of winter wheat and thus increase the yield 3 3 4 analysis of et and yield changes climate change is usually characterized by changes in temperature precipitation and co2 concentrations rashid et al 2019 watson et al 2017 zheng et al 2012 however these variables are typically uncertain and there are complex interactions between them wang et al 2018 yano et al 2007 showed that crop et was affected by meteorological factors and the crop itself and its changes were more complicated under climate change our research showed that a significant p 0 05 increase in precipitation led to an increased average et relative to the baseline these results support the findings of ding et al 2016 guo et al 2010 reported that the et of winter wheat increased by 19 which was mainly caused by the temperature rise under climate change our further analysis revealed that the promotion of et by precipitation and temperature was mainly due to the contribution of soil evaporation taking huimin station as an example the et increased by 46 07 compared with the baseline in 2038 plant transpiration increased by 8 00 whereas soil evaporation increased by 83 87 the increase in precipitation made the surface soil moister and more water was lost from the soil by evaporation when the temperature increased some studies have also shown that seasonal et decreased under future climate conditions rashid et al 2019 overall the main reasons for the decrease in et were related to changes in growth period co2 concentration and temperature the reduction in growth period shortens the duration of leaf area thus shortening the duration of crop water consumption hatfield and dold 2019 however it was possible to avoid the dry heat period of may june due to the advance of winter wheat maturity and reduced the total water consumption rashid et al 2019 the co2 concentration mainly changed et by affecting plant transpiration and this effect was often at the micro scale christy et al 2018 yano et al 2007 christy et al 2018 showed that elevated atmospheric co2 concentration caused a decrease in the stomatal conductance of the leaf and even caused stomatal closure this reduced plant transpiration eventually made et to decrease ainsworth and long 2005 hatfield and dold 2019 the study of yano et al 2007 showed that the et of winter wheat was reduced by 28 compared with the baseline with a doubling of co2 concentration guo et al 2010 reported that et of winter wheat decreased 3 0 3 8 while the concentration of co2 was increased by 287 ppm the effect of temperature on et remained controversial on the one hand rising temperatures directly increased the canopy temperature of the crop the canopy temperature drove vapor pressure and ultimately increased the transpiration hatfield and dold 2019 guo et al 2010 demonstrated that the et of wheat increased by 8 3 if temperatures increased by 3 5 c on the other hand the temperature rise shortened the growth period which in turn reduced the et overall mo et al 2009 showed that the effect of elevated co2 concentration and temperature on et were offset eventually making the change in et negligible rashid et al 2019 reported that the change of et was very small compared with the baseline our study showed that the temperature rise was the most important reason for the decline in winter wheat yield under the two rcp scenarios this may be because the temperature exceeded the optimum growth temperature of winter wheat ortiz et al 2008 porter and gawith 1999 when the temperature is beyond the threshold temperature stress accelerates leaf senescence which is one of the potential causes of yield decrease rawson et al 1983 zhao et al 2007 research by asseng et al 2011 and zhao et al 2007 indicates that leaf senescence reduces the leaf area index and kernel weight thereby reducing yield increased maintenance respiration is another consequence of high temperature stress kase and catsk√Ω 1984 which increases carbohydrate consumption and decreases yield kroes et al 2017 penning de vries et al 1979 in addition the short vegetative stage caused by the temperature increase also induces yield reduction asseng et al 2014 which may result from the reduced period for biomass accumulation during this stage bu et al 2015 however the effect of temperature increase on yield was not always negative especially for low temperature areas such as sweden eckersten et al 2001 and northern america izaurralde et al 2003 this may be because the increase in temperature eases the low temperature stress on winter wheat and keeps it at a temperature suitable for growth which in return had an overall positive effect on yield rashid et al 2019 previous studies have also shown that when the temperature is below the maximum threshold the effect on yield may be positive for example guo et al 2010 showed that increased yield due to warming offset the negative effects of shortened growth period the positive effects of increasing co2 concentrations on yield are generally known especially for c3 crops ainsworth and long 2005 mo et al 2009 ummenhofer et al 2015 the elevated atmospheric co2 concentration accelerated photosynthetic rate and carbon assimilation and ultimately increased yield alexandrov and hoogenboom 2000 christy et al 2018 guo et al 2010 reported that co2 enrichment increased winter wheat yield by 68 8 in the 2090s the contribution of co2 in increasing wheat yield could vary between 10 and 32 depending on the rcp scenario rashid et al 2019 the responses of yield to warming and co2 enriching were complex and interactive ummenhofer et al 2015 and guo et al 2010 reported that co2 enrichment could effectively alleviate the adverse effects of temperature increase on yield previous studies considered that under the combined action of co2 fertilization and temperature increase wheat grain yield increased by 16 36 yano et al 2007 other research has also suggested that the positive effects of elevated co2 may not be obvious especially when combined with other adverse factors such as drought heat stress and nutrient deficiency dier et al 2018 dubey et al 2015 manderscheid et al 2014 3 4 optimized scenarios for climate change based on the above analysis of the factors that affect yield optimization scenarios were set up in this section from the simulation results of these scenarios patterns that would maintain high yield and wpc in future climate conditions were screened out the results of the path analysis indicated that the extension of the growth stage and the increase of precipitation had positive effects on the yield therefore the optimization scenarios were set based on two aspects delaying the maturity date of winter wheat and adjusting irrigation by adjusting the accumulated temperature value in the crop module kroes et al 2017 we set up three late maturing varieties based on the original winter wheat varieties the maturity dates of late maturing varieties were delayed by 30 20 and 10 days compared with the original varieties before setting up the irrigation scheme typical years drought normal and rainy years were divided based on the precipitation frequency of the winter wheat growing season under each rcp scenario based on the cumulative precipitation frequency p during the winter wheat growing season three typical years were divided as follows drought years p 75 normal years p 50 and rainy years p 25 based on the irrigation data optimized by pest from the baseline the area was subdivided into well irrigation area irrigated using wells and total irrigation in the winter wheat growing season 210 mm and canal irrigation area irrigated using canals and irrigation 210 mm han et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 each irrigation depth in the well irrigation and canal irrigation areas applied 60 and 90 mm respectively li et al 2005 ma et al 2015 and was carried out during the jointing heading and filling stages according to the above settings we obtained 32 optimization scenarios expressed as in tables 4 6 the first two digits of the scenario code represent the number of days maturity was postponed the last three digits of the scenario code stand for the irrigation information of the three growth stages jointing heading and grouting where 1 represents irrigation during the corresponding stage and 0 represents no irrigation if the existing winter wheat varieties continued to be planted in the rainy years the yields were largest when there are three irrigations in the well irrigation area and the canal irrigation area under both rcp scenarios but the wpc was not high under the rcp4 5 scenario the largest wpc in the well irrigation area and canal irrigation area were 00 110 and 00 100 respectively the wpc of the 00 100 scenario was largest in both the well irrigation area and the canal irrigation area under the rcp8 5 scenario in drought years the largest wpc scenarios in well irrigation and canal irrigation area under both rcp scenarios were 00 100 therefore if the winter wheat variety remained unchanged under future climate conditions the number of irrigations could be appropriately reduced although the yield was slightly reduced it could effectively reduce irrigation water and increase wpc hatfield and dold 2019 also revealed that because of the shortened growth period the irrigation water demand of winter wheat under the future climates would decrease delaying the maturity date by the changing variety had positive effects on both yield and wpc generally increasing the number of irrigations under the optimized scenarios was beneficial for overall yield however the highest yield did not always appear in the scenario with three irrigations for example in rainy years the yield increase of the 30 101 scenario canal irrigation area was the largest under the rcp8 5 scenario in normal years the yield of the 30 001 scenario well irrigation area was greater than 30 111 under the rcp8 5 scenario wpc was also not the largest in scenarios with three irrigations under normal circumstances wpc was the largest when irrigation was implemented during the jointing stage in the rainy years the wpc increased most in the 30 000 scenario canal irrigation area because of the heavy precipitation overall yield and wpc increased for almost all postponed maturity scenarios during the rainy years during normal years yield and wpc increased in almost half of the scenarios for drought years yield and wpc increased in only a few scenarios this once again revealed the serious impact of extreme climates such as drought on agricultural production under future climate based on the impacts of maturity date and irrigation on yield and wpc we recommend planting winter wheat with a maturity date delayed by 30 days in the future climate for the rainy years and the normal years we suggested the implementation of one irrigation jointing stage and two irrigations jointing stage and heading stage respectively to ensure high yield and wpc for drought years increasing the frequency and amount of irrigation could be used to avoid yield reduction the yield of late maturing varieties increased under the optimized scenario which was consistent with previous research ding et al 2016 crop growth and yield are closely related to the duration of the phenological period horie 1994 the reason for the increased yield may be increased biomass accumulation during the extended growth period liu et al 2009 wang et al 1992 extending the growth period facilitates the crop to assimilate more co2 into photosynthesis production and thus increases crop yield hu et al 2015 our results revealed that irrigation at the jointing stage was essential to promote winter wheat yield and wpc under future climate conditions this result is consistent with measures used to increase yield under current practices for high yield wheat li et al 2000 li et al 2005 demonstrated that the jointing flowering stage was very important for grain formation and irrigation during this period improved wpc and yield to further clarify the impact of maturity date and irrigation on yield the relationship between the two was fitted using paraboloid gaussian and lorentzian regression results revealed that the yields in both rcp scenarios can be well characterized as the paraboloid function of the maturity date and irrigation r 2 0 69 and 0 77 for the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively fig 8 8 z a x b y c x 2 d y 2 e where z is the yield kg ha 1 x and y are the delayed days of maturity date d and irrigation mm and a b c d and e are empirical coefficients for rcp4 5 the coefficients were 39 3151 6 0524 0 4931 0 0073 and 2429 8670 respectively for rcp8 5 the coefficients were 45 9041 3 9579 0 5369 0 0067 and 2484 2467 respectively 4 conclusions this study combined the swap model with future climate models to analyze responses of regional crop growth water consumption and yield our research indicated that pest was very efficient in optimizing swap parameters pest provided a good solution for crop models to expand from field scale to regional scale the calibrated swap model had high precision for simulating winter wheat growth and assisted in the accurate analysis of the crop growth process combining the effects of future climate factors i e radiation temperature precipitation and co2 concentration on yield we found that co2 fertilization could not offset the yield reduction caused by warming based on the simulation results in the optimized scenario planting late maturing 30 days winter wheat clearly promoted grain yield in northern china a combination of variety improvement and irrigation adjustment could enhance wpc while increasing yield we recommend giving priority to irrigation at the early growing stage which could effectively increase the yield and wpc in response to more soil evaporation in the future it was necessary to adopt a series of management measures to transfer the water use of crops to transpiration and maintain high productivity like most studies on climate change effects on agriculture utilizing crop models this study suffered from several limitations for instance the model did not consider the effects of fertilizers and pests on crop growth cultural practices were also assumed to be unchanged in future research the role of fertilizers could be demonstrated by setting solutes in models insect pests might be reflected by a reduction factor however more detailed information on cultural practices requires clarification through literature and practical surveys climate change and adaptation is a complex issue these results provide a scientific basis for farmers

10422,climate change poses great challenges for food security and water use this study aimed to investigate the response of winter wheat in northern china to climate change and propose corresponding strategies to maintain yield and crop water productivity wpc climate model projections from the fifth phase of the climate model intercomparison project cmip5 were used to drive the process based soil water atmosphere plant swap agro hydrological model the swap parameters were optimized by the parameter estimation program pest which extended the crop model to the regional scale swap was used to simulate responses of crop growth evapotranspiration et and yield to baseline 2006 2012 climate and two representative concentration pathway rcp scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 for future climate conditions the results indicated that pest had high optimization efficiency and calibrated swap performed well average relative error 20 87 and normalized root mean square error 25 83 compared with baseline the maximum and minimum temperatures increased significantly p 0 05 by 6 47 c and 8 59 c respectively the cumulative precipitation during the growing season increased by 303 22 316 12 mm warming significantly p 0 05 reduced the growth period of winter wheat by 25 3 34 7 days especially in the emergence heading stage path analysis revealed that significant p 0 05 change of precipitation was a determining factor in increasing et the adverse effect of temperature increase offset the promotion of yield due to radiation and ultimately led to a yield reduction of 35 57 41 14 the optimization scenario indicated that late maturing varieties and irrigation adjustment could improve yield up to 38 21 and wpc up to 44 30 under future climate conditions implementing irrigation at an early growing stage joining and heading was beneficial to increase yield and wpc we recommend combining late maturing varieties with irrigation adjustments to maintain yield and wpc under future climate conditions keywords climate change winter wheat swap pest irrigation 1 introduction climate change is an important environmental issue that is a concern for scientists and policymakers around the world zhang et al 2015 many studies have indicated that climate change will bring new challenges to food security and water use ding et al 2016 lei et al 2016 ummenhofer et al 2015 the main characteristics of climate change are increased greenhouse gas emissions rising temperatures and changes in precipitation hatfield and dold 2019 trenberth 2011 continued global warming would increase the global mean temperature by 1 8 4 0 c by the end of the century wheeler and von braun 2013 precipitation has been predicted to increase 1 3 for every 1 c global mean surface temperature rise hatfield and dold 2019 prediction of future climate change is also complicated by the potential for increased frequency of extreme disasters such as floods and droughts dai 2013 ummenhofer et al 2015 agroecosystems pasture and cropland cover nearly 40 of the earth s land surface and are increasingly vulnerable to variability and extremes of climate asner et al 2004 foley et al 2005 ramankutty and foley 1999 ummenhofer et al 2015 the physiological processes of crops are strongly influenced by environmental changes including soil mainly changes in soil water content and meteorological conditions hatfield and dold 2019 watson et al 2017 crop photosynthesis can be reduced thereby advancing the transformation of assimilates pre stored in vegetative tissues to grains chartzoulakis and psarras 2005 yang and zhang 2006 warming also increases the probability of crops being subjected to heat stress akter and rafiqul islam 2017 hatfield and dold 2019 high temperature also triggers an increase in crop evaporation demand leading to water stress hatfield and dold 2019 watson et al 2017 yano et al 2007 this will inevitably exacerbate the competition for water resources between agriculture and other sectors cammarano et al 2016 increases in co2 concentration and precipitation are likely to benefit crops especially c3 crops such as wheat rice and soybeans mo et al 2009 considering the overall impact of climate change on crops an increase in co2 concentration may offset the yield reduction caused by temperature and precipitation ummenhofer et al 2015 yano et al 2007 especially under water stress conditions van der kooi et al 2016 the impact of future climate on crop production has been extensively studied through climate change scenarios hatfield and dold 2019 rashid et al 2019 yano et al 2007 increased temperature may accelerate crop growth and shorten the growth period christy et al 2018 rashid et al 2019 climate change has led to considerable reductions in yields for several crops such as corn wheat and rice bu et al 2015 he et al 2015 peng et al 2004 in recent years some climate prediction models such as the regional climate model cammarano et al 2017 climate generator guo et al 2010 and global climate models tao et al 2018 wang et al 2018 have been broadly utilized to drive crop models to study the effects of climate change on crop growth processes christy et al 2018 used the cat wheat model to simulate wheat growth which indicated that an increase in co2 concentration can promote transpiration efficiency wheat crops were simulated for 60 representative sites across the australian wheat belt using the apsim wheat model demonstrating that crops would face severe water stress 40 2 43 9 under future climatic conditions watson et al 2017 the soil water atmosphere plant swap model kroes et al 2017 has been shown to perform well in simulating crop growth at both field and regional scales hassanli et al 2016 mart√≠nez ferri et al 2013 mokhtari et al 2018 and has also been used to study the effects of climate change on irrigation demand yano et al 2007 however there are still many inadequacies in the research on how climate change affects crop growth first use of agricultural numerical models to study the effects of climate change on crop growth has mostly been limited to point scales ding et al 2016 it is necessary to extend research to regional scales to assess the overall impact of climate change and adaptation strategies mo et al 2009 ummenhofer et al 2015 currently many crop model users adjust model parameters through trial and error this method requires the subjective adjustment of input parameters based on the accumulative knowledge of the researcher and their degree of understanding of the model this not only requires time and effort but the simulation accuracy of the model is often not satisfactory fang et al 2010 liang et al 2016 thus it requires more work to obtain reasonable parameters for multiple sites at the regional scale kim et al 2014 additionally many parameters are difficult to measure directly through field observations such as maintenance respiration and assimilate conversion into biomass many parameter automatic optimization tools have been developed in recent years to solve the above problems for example the parameter estimation program pest doherty 2019 has been used in many hydrological models because of its high optimization efficiency and precision elci et al 2010 fang et al 2010 kim et al 2014 however previous studies using pest have mostly focused on soil water movement at the site scale mart√≠nez ferri et al 2013 paying little attention to vegetative growth at the regional scale regional crop growth studies require that several crop genetic parameters that are closely related to crop growth be calibrated the optimal performance of pest on crop parameters in swap remains to be further explored secondly the extent and direction of the impact of climate change on crop production is complex and many details are uncertain dier et al 2018 dubey et al 2015 yano et al 2007 as a result of the complexity of the interaction between different climate variables temperature co2 and precipitation these variables may bring positive and negative results rashid et al 2019 path analysis wright 1921 is widely used to obtain deeper direct and indirect relationships between variables astereki et al 2017 de almeida rios et al 2018 seker and serin 2004 however this statistical method is rarely utilized to analyze the specific effects of climate change on crop growth the quantitative analysis of the impacts of meteorological and crop factors on evapotranspiration et and yield requires further investigation finally researchers have proposed many improvements to minimize the adverse effects of climate change these strategies include improvement of crop varieties liu et al 2009 agronomic adjustments akter and rafiqul islam 2017 liu et al 2013 and irrigation optimization rashid et al 2019 zhang et al 2015 however in practice the crop breeding process is detailed and complex modifying crop genetic parameters in crop models can save time to simulate how alternative species respond to climate change ding et al 2016 moreover each irrigation scheme is usually applicable to specific areas combining local water management practices to study the impact of climate change is a pressing need rashid et al 2019 therefore it is necessary to analyze the impacts of future climate conditions on winter wheat at the regional scale by appropriate methods and simulations based on quantifying these effects this study aimed to propose effective strategies for coping with the adverse effects of future climate change conditions the winter wheat autumn planting growing area in northern china was selected according to the chinese wheat planting regionalization reported by zhao 2010 this is because the wheat planting area and yield in the region account for 41 69 of china s totals and the region plays a pivotal role in ensuring national food security guo et al 2010 mo et al 2009 the objectives were as follows 1 to use pest to optimize the swap parameters to achieve localization of the model 2 to further analyze the spatial and temporal variation of the winter wheat growth period et and yield under future climate conditions 2030 2100 in northern china 3 quantify the contribution of climate change factors to crop growth through path analysis and 4 simulate the response of different varieties and irrigation patterns to climate change in multiple irrigation schemes and provide strategies to ensure regional food production the findings of this study will be valuable for ensuring regional food production and the efficient use of water resources under future climate conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is mainly located south of the great wall east of minshan mountain north of qinling mountain and the huaihe river supplementary material fig s1 this area belongs to the continental climate except for the coastal areas the annual average temperature is 9 15 c the precipitation during the growing season of wheat is 150 340 mm and has temporal and spatial disparities there is less precipitation in the northwest and more precipitation in the east most of the precipitation occurs during july and august the region often experiences drought in the spring based on historical climate data which is a major problem limiting wheat production zhao 2010 2 2 swap model swap is a process based agro hydrological model that simulates vegetation growth and the transport of water solutes and heat in the vadose zone kroes et al 2017 this model uses the one dimensional richards equation to describe water flow bonfante et al 2010 the penman monteith method is utilized to calculate potential et with values such as temperature net radiation and vapor pressure kroes et al 2017 as an important determinant of energy absorption by the canopy net radiation is also used to calculate photosynthetic products in this study we selected the detailed crop module available for swap to simulate the dynamic growth of winter wheat the phenology is quantified through the development stage ds in swap undergoing changes from the vegetative 0 ds 1 0 at seedling emergence and 1 at flowering to reproductive stage 1 ds 2 2 at maturity this model simulates the ds based on the temperature sum which is calculated using the effective temperature swap accounts for effects of temperature stress on leaf senescence and maintenance respiration through the leaf physiological aging factor and respiration rate increasing factor respectively kase and catsk√Ω 1984 ma et al 2013 penning de vries et al 1979 in the study area irrigation is usually carried out during the specific growth stage the jointing heading and grouting stages of winter wheat han et al 2017 ma et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 therefore the fixed irrigation regime is selected during baseline and future scenario simulations which involves a fixed irrigation depth at the three growth stages named above the irrigation depth of each stage is optimized by the pest the initial value and range for each irrigation regime are determined based on the results of previous researchers jiang et al 2013 li et al 2005 ma et al 2015 different amounts of irrigation were found to change the soil moisture status and swap used the feddes model to consider the effect of different soil water contents on root water uptake feddes et al 1978 actual transpiration which is the integral of root water uptake is also affected because actual transpiration is used to calculate the death rate of leaf and stem and the assimilation rate kroes et al 2017 the impact of irrigation is ultimately reflected in crop growth and yield the increasing co2 concentration is accounted for using the same method as that employed by supit et al 2012 which changes the stomatal conductance and co2 assimilation rate and further affects transpiration and photosynthesis groenendijk et al 2016 kroes et al 2017 swap contains three main input modules meteorology crop and soil the simulation results are output at 1 day intervals and stored in files this study mainly analyzes the results contained in the three output files soil profile water balance and crop growth the specific output variables are soil water content crop et development stage and cumulative dry weight of storage organ yield based on the above results we calculate the crop water productivity wpc following fern√°ndez et al 2020 1 w p c y e t c where y is the yield kg ha 1 and e t c is crop et m3 ha 1 2 2 1 input data 2 2 1 1 historical meteorological data and crop data the historical meteorological data and crop data for the study area were obtained from the national meteorological information center http data cma cn the meteorological data included in this study were net radiation maximum and minimum temperature relative humidity wind speed and precipitation supplementary material fig s2 multiple agro meteorological experimental stations are located in the area but there are large differences in data quality between sites after comprehensive comparison we selected 48 agro meteorological experimental stations with the highest data quality as regional representatives for this research fig 1 a observational data on winter wheat growth period and crop height were extracted at each site for the period 2006 2012 2 2 1 2 climate change scenarios and data the fifth phase of the climate model intercomparison project cmip5 provides a range of simulated climate futures that can be used as the basis for exploring climate change impacts and policy issues of considerable interest and relevance to society taylor et al 2012 although there are many future climate models included in cmip5 the type and time frequency of the meteorological variable output vary among models based on the requirements of the weather file in the swap model we set the corresponding conditions in the earth system grid federation esgf node at dkrz https esgf data dkrz de projects esgf dkrz to filter out the appropriate climate model and download future climate grid data the results showed that in the climate models provided by cmip5 only the mri cgcm3 model can provide complete future daily meteorological data 2030 2100 by which to drive the swap model we used the inverse distance weight interpolation method to obtain the future climate data of each station from the abovementioned grid data ding et al 2020 bai et al 2019 and constructed the weather file of the swap model three future time slices representing the 2030s near term 2030 2049 2050s mid term 2050 2069 and 2070s long term adaptation time frame 2070 2100 were chosen to reflect the changes of different time spans in future climate conditions rashid et al 2019 wang et al 2018 watson et al 2017 the present study considered two different representative concentration pathway rcp scenarios which are greenhouse gas concentration pathways indicating the expected radiative forcing in the year 2100 rashid et al 2019 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 represent the midrange mitigation and high emissions scenario which are considered the possible future emission scenarios taylor et al 2012 wang et al 2018 the co2 concentrations of rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 were projected as 538 and 936 ppm by 2100 respectively meinshausen et al 2011 the specific future co2 concentration change curve under different rcp scenarios can be found in van vuuren et al 2011 we chose 2006 2012 as a baseline which is consistent with the model calibration and verification period for easy comparison with future climate impacts 2 2 1 3 soil data experimental stations i e the aforementioned 48 agro meteorological stations usually do not measure soil hydraulic parameters therefore we downloaded the harmonized world soil database hwsd from the food and agriculture organization fao http www fao org soils portal soil survey soil maps and databases harmonized world soil database v12 en the database contains soil texture contents of sand silt and clay and bulk density data of topsoil 0 30 cm and subsoil 30 100 cm fao iiasa isric iss cas jrc 2012 fig 1b these soil properties were entered into the retc software to quantify the hydraulic functions of unsaturated soils van genuchten et al 1991 and initial soil hydraulic parameters were subsequently obtained 2 2 2 model calibration and verification method since there are many soil and crop parameters in the swap model it is difficult to calibrate and verify each parameter it is necessary to identify the sensitivity of these parameters and then use different parameter setting methods on the basis of results from ma et al 2013 and huang et al 2017 we classified the input parameters of the swap model according to sensitivity for parameters that are insensitive to simulation results we used swap default values or referred to the literature on winter wheat in the same region ma et al 2013 huang et al 2017 highly sensitive parameters in soil and crop modules were optimized through the pest program supplementary material table s1 the value of the soil hydraulic parameters ranged from the minimum value to the maximum value in the hwsd database of the study area the initial values and ranges of crop genetic parameters were determined by combining the research results of ma et al 2013 and huang et al 2017 we assumed that winter wheat varieties and field management in the next two years did not change huang et al 2017 we then utilized the first three growing seasons 2006 2007 2008 2009 and 2010 2011 for model calibration each corresponding next growing season 2007 2008 2009 2010 and 2011 2012 respectively was applied to verify the model parameters the soil water content at 10 20 and 50 cm soil depth growth period and yield data were all from the national meteorological information center and used for comparisons with the corresponding simulation values which we used to evaluate the simulation performance of swap specific statistical indices include the average relative error mre the root mean square error rmse the normalized root mean square error nrmse and the coefficient of variation cv these are written as follows 2 m r e i 1 n p i o i o i n 100 3 r m s e i 1 n p i o i 2 n 4 n r m s e r m s e o 100 5 c v s d p where n is the number of samples p i and o i is the i t h predicted value and observed value respectively p and o is the mean value of predicted value and observed value respectively and s d is the standard deviation of the predicted value based on the above indicators we selected the parameters of the growing season with the best simulation results for investigating the optimization management strategy of winter wheat under future climate change 2 3 pest program the pest program is a model independent parameter estimation and optimization software that communicates with a model using its own input and output files without any changes to the model fang et al 2010 it applies a robust gauss marquardt levenberg gml algorithm which combines the advantages of the inverse hessian method and the steep descent method and therefore provides faster and more efficient convergence towards the objective function minimum bahremand and de smedt 2007 doherty 2019 the core of the pest algorithm is to obtain the minimum solution of the objective function depending on the type of observations and the needs of the simulation the observations can be grouped with corresponding weights to achieve the best optimization liang et al 2016 this study contained two sets of objective functions soil water content and yield and the formula was as follows 6 œÜ œÜ s w c œÜ y i 1 n s w c w s w c i 2 o s w c i p s w c i 2 i 1 n y w y i 2 o y i p y i 2 where œÜ is the objective function subscripts s w c and y are soil water content and yield respectively n is the number of observations w is weight taken as 40 and 5 for soil water content and yield respectively liang et al 2016 o i is the i t h observed value and p i is the i t h predicted value 2 4 data processing and analysis 2 4 1 data processing the extraction of future grid weather data and the batch operation of swap model were realized by matlab r2016b mathworks natick ma usa soil texture and bulk density data were obtained from the hwsd through arcmap 10 6 esri redlands ca usa 2 4 2 path analysis we used spss 21 ibm armonk ny usa to perform path analysis in this study song et al 2016 by ranking the decision coefficient dc path analysis can be used to quantify the direction and extent of the influence of the independent variable on the dependent variable the dc were calculated with the following function 7 d c x 2 p x r x y p x 2 where d c x is the decision coefficient of the independent variable x p x is the direct path coefficient of the independent variable x and r x y is the correlation coefficient between the independent variable x and the dependent variable y a positive d c x indicates that the independent variable promotes the dependent variable and a negative d c x indicates the independent variable has an inhibitory effect on the dependent variable 2 4 3 statistical analysis analysis of variance anova and regression model construction were implemented by spss 21 mean comparisons were performed for significant effects with the least significant difference lsd test at Œ± 0 05 the differences between the regions were considered significant at p 0 05 it was used to reflect whether climate factors significantly changed under future conditions compared to the baseline as well as the degree of climate effects on crop growth et and yield 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration and verification 3 1 1 model performance evaluation compared with observed values the simulation errors of swap model were within acceptable limits mre 20 87 and nrmse 25 83 table 1 simulation results also revealed that pest had a good optimization effect on the model parameters at the regional scale from the average mre nrmse and cv of the three growing seasons the simulation of the growth period was superior to the soil water content and yield and had lower variability between different sites based on these optimized parameters swap could accurately simulate the field water status and crop growth process of winter wheat in summary the model had been well calibrated based on the study area and could be used in a predictive capacity the nrmse of yield and emergence heading days in the growing season of 2010 2011 were the smallest among all growing seasons the swap model also simulated soil water content and heading mature days well in 2010 2011 therefore the model parameters of the 2010 2011 growing season were selected for use in the future climate simulation from the regional distribution of simulation results supplementary material fig s3 swap also had a good performance at baseline 3 1 2 simulation of soil water content growth period and yield based on three statistical indicators mre rmse and nrmse of all growing seasons the simulated soil water content had a good agreement with the observed values during the verification period taking the juxian station 2011 2012 growing season as an example the average soil water content gradually increased with the depth of the soil layer supplementary material fig s4 three irrigations during jointing heading and filling had greatly increased soil water content however the effect of irrigation on the water content of the upper soil was greater than that of the deep soil the average change of soil water content in the 10 cm and 20 cm soil layers was 0 21 cm3 cm 3 and 0 15 cm3 cm 3 respectively this was because the topsoil had a closer contact with the atmosphere and soil water content was usually maintained at a low level because of soil evaporation therefore it was more susceptible to precipitation irrigation and atmospheric conditions than deep soil layers judging from the cv values for the three growing seasons the soil water content of different sites had a moderate variability which might be caused by the different meteorological conditions and irrigation the heading and maturity periods are the end dates of vegetative and reproductive growth of winter wheat respectively they are important growth stages of winter wheat and key indicators for evaluating the simulation accuracy of swap on crop growth processes the r 2 values of emergence heading days in the verification growing season were above 0 98 supplementary material fig s5 indicating that the simulated values were in good agreement with the observed values the simulation accuracy for maturity dates was slightly lower than the heading period because the error accumulation of the simulated heading date and the difference in thermal conditions between the sites huang et al 2017 despite this the simulated maturity date was still highly consistent with the observed values r 2 0 92 except for the 2009 2010 growing season the cv values of emergence heading days and heading mature days were less than 10 this indicated that the heading date and maturity date of winter wheat had a weak variability between different sites however this result was different from those of huang et al 2017 which was mainly because the research area selected by previous researchers was much larger than that in this study during the six simulated growing seasons only 14 sites 6 06 of the total number of sites had a relative error of more than 30 supplementary material fig s6 this indicates that the swap model can accurately simulate the yield of winter wheat in the study area after pest parameter optimization however in terms of the cv values the variability of yield between the sites was much greater than the soil water content and growth period this was because the factors affecting yield were more complicated than those affecting soil water content and growth period such as variety irrigation meteorology and soil 3 2 climate projections 3 2 1 net radiation change compared with the baseline the climate model showed a significant p 0 05 increase in the average daily net radiation in winter wheat growing area of northern china during the growing season fig 2 a overall the net radiation under the rcp4 5 scenario increased 47 94 in 2030 2100 the net radiation increased under the rcp8 5 scenario over the same period was slightly larger than that under rcp4 5 at 50 84 from the three future time slices the net radiation gradually decreased over time under rcp4 5 whereas it showed a trend of increasing first and then decreasing under rcp8 5 the net radiation exhibited periodic changes the net radiation was significantly p 0 05 different between sites in the study area the spatial variation of net radiation was similar under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios fig 3 a f the areas with a larger net radiation increase 50 were mainly located in the northeast and central regions of the study area whereas the areas with a lower net radiation increase 30 were mainly located in the southwestern regions for three future time slices the areas with a large increase in net radiation were gradually shrinking under the rcp4 5 scenario whereas the areas with a small increase expanded however from a regional perspective net radiation changed little with time under the rcp8 5 scenario in the three different periods the number of sites with a net radiation increase of 50 and 30 showed little change 3 2 2 cumulative precipitation change the average cumulative precipitation during the growing season under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios was 550 60 and 563 50 mm respectively for 2030 2100 compared with the baseline the precipitation significantly increased p 0 05 under the two rcp scenarios fig 2b the precipitation of the two rcp scenarios showed similar trends and first decreased and then increased with time slices unlike net radiation precipitation did not show periodic changes the spatial distribution of the precipitation changes varied substantially across the study area fig 3g l precipitation in the western region increased more than the eastern region this might be because of lower precipitation in the western region during the baseline than in the eastern region fig s2b the difference in precipitation distribution between the western and eastern regions was almost unchanged from 2030 to 2100 although precipitation increased at the regional scale at some sites precipitation decreased in individual years for example the precipitation at mengcheng station and suxian station decreased by 49 66 rcp8 5 in 2040 and 17 84 rcp4 5 in 2061 respectively 3 2 3 temperature change the maximum temperatures under the two scenarios were significantly p 0 05 higher than the baseline with temperatures increased by 6 13 c and 6 81 c under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively the maximum temperature changes fluctuated under both rcp scenarios fig 2c the temperature difference between the crests and the troughs was about 10 c from a temporal perspective the general trend of maximum temperature in both rcp scenarios was increasing the maximum temperature under the rcp8 5 scenario was slightly larger than under the rcp4 5 scenario because of the higher concentration of greenhouse gas emissions temperature changes at the site were different from the regional scale and did not always increase under the rcp4 5 scenario the maximum temperatures of linfen station lushi station and neixiang station were lower than the baseline in the 2030s 2050s and 2070s fig 4 a f except for the three stations mentioned above the maximum temperatures of other stations were higher than the baseline for rcp8 5 the maximum temperature of most stations was higher than baseline in the 2070s except for the lushi station decreased by 3 94 similar to the maximum temperature the change in minimum temperature also fluctuated over time with a 10 year cycle fig 2d however the minimum temperature increase was much larger than the maximum temperature which was consistent with the results of rashid et al 2019 the minimum temperature generally showed an increasing trend and the increase was faster under rcp8 5 than under rcp4 5 in terms of spatial variability the minimum temperature increase greater in the northern region was than in the southern region fig 4g l 3 3 climate impacts 3 3 1 growth period according to the prediction of mri cgcm3 climate model the growth days of winter wheat in the study area was significantly p 0 05 reduced under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios fig 5 a b this was consistent with the results reported by christy et al 2018 and guo et al 2010 the emergence mature period was shortened by 25 3 days rcp4 5 and 34 7 days rcp8 5 respectively this was similar to the results of yano et al 2007 which revealed that the winter wheat growth period was shortened by 24 days in future climatic conditions 2030 2100 similar to temperature the emergence heading days showed periodic changes in 2030 2100 the change cycle was generally consistent with the temperature this reveals that the increase in temperature is the main factor affecting the growth period ding et al 2016 rashid et al 2019 xiao et al 2016 correlation analysis revealed that the emergence heading period was shortened by 2 7 days for every 1 c increase in maximum temperature in the rcp scenario for the 2030s 2050s and 2070s the shortening of the emergence heading period under two rcp scenarios gradually increased which was inseparable from the increase in temperature tao et al 2014 wang et al 2013 under the rcp8 5 scenario the shortening of the emergence heading period in the future climate occurred more rapidly compared with rcp4 5 the emergence heading period under the rcp8 5 scenario became shorter by 1 44 7 96 with the continuation of time the difference of the emergence heading period between the two scenarios had further expanded fig 5a there were significant p 0 05 spatial differences in the emergence heading period duration between sites fig 6 a f under the rcp4 5 scenario the emergence heading period at baodi station was shortened by 61 days in 2062 whereas the period increased by 36 days at neixiang station in 2038 the area in which the emergence heading period shortened was gradually expanded and the expansion speed under rcp8 5 was faster than that under rcp4 5 by the 2070s under rcp8 5 except for the sanhe jiaozhou and liaocheng stations the emergence heading period was shortened by more than 15 the heading mature period was shortened by 0 8 days compared with the baseline under the rcp4 5 scenario whereas it was shortened by 0 5 days under the rcp8 5 scenario fig 5b although there were periodic changes in the duration of the heading mature period the cycle was inconsistent with that of the graphical temperature changes correlation analysis revealed that the relationship between the days of heading mature period and the temperature was weak r 2 0 10 future climate conditions had greater effects on the growth stage of crops before heading than after heading which was in accordance with the results reported by tao et al 2014 and wang et al 2013 the areas where the heading mature period was shortened greatly were mainly concentrated in the southwest and northeast regions the heading mature period increased in the central region of the study area fig 6g l in the 2050s the average heading mature period under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios increased by 3 87 and 3 83 respectively however the number of sites in which the heading mature period increased in duration decreased substantially in the 2070s future climate effects on the physiological and ecological processes of crops were extremely complicated asseng et al 2013 dhungana et al 2006 walker and schulze 2008 previous studies have shown that increases in temperature led to accelerated crop growth and prematurity christy et al 2018 ding et al 2016 guo et al 2010 when the temperature increased by 1 0 2 0 c the growth period was shortened by 15 28 days xiao et al 2016 the shortening of the growth period had both positive and negative effects xiao et al 2016 accelerated growth under high temperature reduced the seasonal water use tao and zhang 2013 and avoided winter wheat suffering from heat stress during the maturity period of may june rashid et al 2019 the adverse effects of shortening the growth period were mainly related to the reduced biomass accumulation and ultimately reduced yield akter and rafiqul islam 2017 ummenhofer et al 2015 yano et al 2007 3 3 2 et and yield compared with the baseline the average et of 2030 2100 under the rcp scenario had increased significantly p 0 05 this was consistent with the findings of liu et al 2013 and guo et al 2010 however the results of yano et al 2007 and rashid et al 2019 showed that et either decreased or there were negligible changes from the time series et showed a gradual decline under future climatic conditions fig 5c there were significant p 0 05 differences in et between sites in the study area fig 7 a f the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios had similar characteristics in the regional distribution of et and the increase of et gradually decreased from west to east overall the average yield under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios were reduced in the mri cgcm3 climate model compared with the baseline under the rcp8 5 scenario the yield decline was much higher the trend of winter wheat yield for the two rcp scenarios showed a gradual decrease for the period 2030 2100 fig 5d the change in yield over time had a certain periodicity and the cycle was roughly similar to net radiation simple correlation analysis also revealed the same conclusion in addition to net radiation other meteorological indicators were weakly correlated with yield r 2 0 10 moreover the yield significantly p 0 05 varied spatially sites with a lower yield decline 30 were concentrated in the western region fig 7g l severe yield reductions occurred in the central region however the effects of climate change on winter wheat yield has been controversial akter and rafiqul islam 2017 mo et al 2009 watson et al 2017 our results also reveal that the yield increased at some sites suggesting complex impacts of climatic factors on yield 3 3 3 path analysis of climate effects on et and yield the direct and indirect effects of climate factors on et are listed in table 2 except for the minimum temperature the direct effects of other factors on et were positive indicating promotion effects on et the maximum temperature and minimum temperature had the largest indirect effect on et and were both negative from the absolute value of the dc the top three factors affecting et were precipitation emergence heading period heading mature period the comprehensive effects of these three factors on et were promoted this result revealed the increase of et under future climate compared with the baseline the increase in precipitation was much greater than the decrease in emergence heading days and heading mature days the positive effect of radiation on yield was enhanced by the positive indirect effect of maximum temperature emergence heading period heading mature period and et table 3 this produced a simple correlation of net radiation to yield higher than that of the direct effect according to the absolute value of the dc the factors affecting the yield were ranked as follows radiation et minimum temperature this explained the reasons for the decline in yield under the rcp scenarios compared with the baseline the minimum temperature increase was much larger than the net radiation and et therefore although the increase net radiation promoted the yield this effect was offset by the minimum temperature increase these factors ultimately led to a yield reduction compared with the rcp4 5 scenario the minimum temperature increased greater than net radiation under the rcp8 5 scenario the average et under the rcp8 5 scenario was also less than that under the rcp4 5 scenario although net radiation had the greatest impact on yield the superposition effect of minimum temperature and et caused the yield of the rcp8 5 scenario to be lower than that of the rcp4 5 scenario the days of the emergence heading and heading mature periods had a positive correlation with yield and the effect of the heading mature period was greater this reveals that under the future climatic conditions selection of the winter wheat variety with higher demand for accumulated temperature can be used to prolong the growth stage of winter wheat and thus increase the yield 3 3 4 analysis of et and yield changes climate change is usually characterized by changes in temperature precipitation and co2 concentrations rashid et al 2019 watson et al 2017 zheng et al 2012 however these variables are typically uncertain and there are complex interactions between them wang et al 2018 yano et al 2007 showed that crop et was affected by meteorological factors and the crop itself and its changes were more complicated under climate change our research showed that a significant p 0 05 increase in precipitation led to an increased average et relative to the baseline these results support the findings of ding et al 2016 guo et al 2010 reported that the et of winter wheat increased by 19 which was mainly caused by the temperature rise under climate change our further analysis revealed that the promotion of et by precipitation and temperature was mainly due to the contribution of soil evaporation taking huimin station as an example the et increased by 46 07 compared with the baseline in 2038 plant transpiration increased by 8 00 whereas soil evaporation increased by 83 87 the increase in precipitation made the surface soil moister and more water was lost from the soil by evaporation when the temperature increased some studies have also shown that seasonal et decreased under future climate conditions rashid et al 2019 overall the main reasons for the decrease in et were related to changes in growth period co2 concentration and temperature the reduction in growth period shortens the duration of leaf area thus shortening the duration of crop water consumption hatfield and dold 2019 however it was possible to avoid the dry heat period of may june due to the advance of winter wheat maturity and reduced the total water consumption rashid et al 2019 the co2 concentration mainly changed et by affecting plant transpiration and this effect was often at the micro scale christy et al 2018 yano et al 2007 christy et al 2018 showed that elevated atmospheric co2 concentration caused a decrease in the stomatal conductance of the leaf and even caused stomatal closure this reduced plant transpiration eventually made et to decrease ainsworth and long 2005 hatfield and dold 2019 the study of yano et al 2007 showed that the et of winter wheat was reduced by 28 compared with the baseline with a doubling of co2 concentration guo et al 2010 reported that et of winter wheat decreased 3 0 3 8 while the concentration of co2 was increased by 287 ppm the effect of temperature on et remained controversial on the one hand rising temperatures directly increased the canopy temperature of the crop the canopy temperature drove vapor pressure and ultimately increased the transpiration hatfield and dold 2019 guo et al 2010 demonstrated that the et of wheat increased by 8 3 if temperatures increased by 3 5 c on the other hand the temperature rise shortened the growth period which in turn reduced the et overall mo et al 2009 showed that the effect of elevated co2 concentration and temperature on et were offset eventually making the change in et negligible rashid et al 2019 reported that the change of et was very small compared with the baseline our study showed that the temperature rise was the most important reason for the decline in winter wheat yield under the two rcp scenarios this may be because the temperature exceeded the optimum growth temperature of winter wheat ortiz et al 2008 porter and gawith 1999 when the temperature is beyond the threshold temperature stress accelerates leaf senescence which is one of the potential causes of yield decrease rawson et al 1983 zhao et al 2007 research by asseng et al 2011 and zhao et al 2007 indicates that leaf senescence reduces the leaf area index and kernel weight thereby reducing yield increased maintenance respiration is another consequence of high temperature stress kase and catsk√Ω 1984 which increases carbohydrate consumption and decreases yield kroes et al 2017 penning de vries et al 1979 in addition the short vegetative stage caused by the temperature increase also induces yield reduction asseng et al 2014 which may result from the reduced period for biomass accumulation during this stage bu et al 2015 however the effect of temperature increase on yield was not always negative especially for low temperature areas such as sweden eckersten et al 2001 and northern america izaurralde et al 2003 this may be because the increase in temperature eases the low temperature stress on winter wheat and keeps it at a temperature suitable for growth which in return had an overall positive effect on yield rashid et al 2019 previous studies have also shown that when the temperature is below the maximum threshold the effect on yield may be positive for example guo et al 2010 showed that increased yield due to warming offset the negative effects of shortened growth period the positive effects of increasing co2 concentrations on yield are generally known especially for c3 crops ainsworth and long 2005 mo et al 2009 ummenhofer et al 2015 the elevated atmospheric co2 concentration accelerated photosynthetic rate and carbon assimilation and ultimately increased yield alexandrov and hoogenboom 2000 christy et al 2018 guo et al 2010 reported that co2 enrichment increased winter wheat yield by 68 8 in the 2090s the contribution of co2 in increasing wheat yield could vary between 10 and 32 depending on the rcp scenario rashid et al 2019 the responses of yield to warming and co2 enriching were complex and interactive ummenhofer et al 2015 and guo et al 2010 reported that co2 enrichment could effectively alleviate the adverse effects of temperature increase on yield previous studies considered that under the combined action of co2 fertilization and temperature increase wheat grain yield increased by 16 36 yano et al 2007 other research has also suggested that the positive effects of elevated co2 may not be obvious especially when combined with other adverse factors such as drought heat stress and nutrient deficiency dier et al 2018 dubey et al 2015 manderscheid et al 2014 3 4 optimized scenarios for climate change based on the above analysis of the factors that affect yield optimization scenarios were set up in this section from the simulation results of these scenarios patterns that would maintain high yield and wpc in future climate conditions were screened out the results of the path analysis indicated that the extension of the growth stage and the increase of precipitation had positive effects on the yield therefore the optimization scenarios were set based on two aspects delaying the maturity date of winter wheat and adjusting irrigation by adjusting the accumulated temperature value in the crop module kroes et al 2017 we set up three late maturing varieties based on the original winter wheat varieties the maturity dates of late maturing varieties were delayed by 30 20 and 10 days compared with the original varieties before setting up the irrigation scheme typical years drought normal and rainy years were divided based on the precipitation frequency of the winter wheat growing season under each rcp scenario based on the cumulative precipitation frequency p during the winter wheat growing season three typical years were divided as follows drought years p 75 normal years p 50 and rainy years p 25 based on the irrigation data optimized by pest from the baseline the area was subdivided into well irrigation area irrigated using wells and total irrigation in the winter wheat growing season 210 mm and canal irrigation area irrigated using canals and irrigation 210 mm han et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 each irrigation depth in the well irrigation and canal irrigation areas applied 60 and 90 mm respectively li et al 2005 ma et al 2015 and was carried out during the jointing heading and filling stages according to the above settings we obtained 32 optimization scenarios expressed as in tables 4 6 the first two digits of the scenario code represent the number of days maturity was postponed the last three digits of the scenario code stand for the irrigation information of the three growth stages jointing heading and grouting where 1 represents irrigation during the corresponding stage and 0 represents no irrigation if the existing winter wheat varieties continued to be planted in the rainy years the yields were largest when there are three irrigations in the well irrigation area and the canal irrigation area under both rcp scenarios but the wpc was not high under the rcp4 5 scenario the largest wpc in the well irrigation area and canal irrigation area were 00 110 and 00 100 respectively the wpc of the 00 100 scenario was largest in both the well irrigation area and the canal irrigation area under the rcp8 5 scenario in drought years the largest wpc scenarios in well irrigation and canal irrigation area under both rcp scenarios were 00 100 therefore if the winter wheat variety remained unchanged under future climate conditions the number of irrigations could be appropriately reduced although the yield was slightly reduced it could effectively reduce irrigation water and increase wpc hatfield and dold 2019 also revealed that because of the shortened growth period the irrigation water demand of winter wheat under the future climates would decrease delaying the maturity date by the changing variety had positive effects on both yield and wpc generally increasing the number of irrigations under the optimized scenarios was beneficial for overall yield however the highest yield did not always appear in the scenario with three irrigations for example in rainy years the yield increase of the 30 101 scenario canal irrigation area was the largest under the rcp8 5 scenario in normal years the yield of the 30 001 scenario well irrigation area was greater than 30 111 under the rcp8 5 scenario wpc was also not the largest in scenarios with three irrigations under normal circumstances wpc was the largest when irrigation was implemented during the jointing stage in the rainy years the wpc increased most in the 30 000 scenario canal irrigation area because of the heavy precipitation overall yield and wpc increased for almost all postponed maturity scenarios during the rainy years during normal years yield and wpc increased in almost half of the scenarios for drought years yield and wpc increased in only a few scenarios this once again revealed the serious impact of extreme climates such as drought on agricultural production under future climate based on the impacts of maturity date and irrigation on yield and wpc we recommend planting winter wheat with a maturity date delayed by 30 days in the future climate for the rainy years and the normal years we suggested the implementation of one irrigation jointing stage and two irrigations jointing stage and heading stage respectively to ensure high yield and wpc for drought years increasing the frequency and amount of irrigation could be used to avoid yield reduction the yield of late maturing varieties increased under the optimized scenario which was consistent with previous research ding et al 2016 crop growth and yield are closely related to the duration of the phenological period horie 1994 the reason for the increased yield may be increased biomass accumulation during the extended growth period liu et al 2009 wang et al 1992 extending the growth period facilitates the crop to assimilate more co2 into photosynthesis production and thus increases crop yield hu et al 2015 our results revealed that irrigation at the jointing stage was essential to promote winter wheat yield and wpc under future climate conditions this result is consistent with measures used to increase yield under current practices for high yield wheat li et al 2000 li et al 2005 demonstrated that the jointing flowering stage was very important for grain formation and irrigation during this period improved wpc and yield to further clarify the impact of maturity date and irrigation on yield the relationship between the two was fitted using paraboloid gaussian and lorentzian regression results revealed that the yields in both rcp scenarios can be well characterized as the paraboloid function of the maturity date and irrigation r 2 0 69 and 0 77 for the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively fig 8 8 z a x b y c x 2 d y 2 e where z is the yield kg ha 1 x and y are the delayed days of maturity date d and irrigation mm and a b c d and e are empirical coefficients for rcp4 5 the coefficients were 39 3151 6 0524 0 4931 0 0073 and 2429 8670 respectively for rcp8 5 the coefficients were 45 9041 3 9579 0 5369 0 0067 and 2484 2467 respectively 4 conclusions this study combined the swap model with future climate models to analyze responses of regional crop growth water consumption and yield our research indicated that pest was very efficient in optimizing swap parameters pest provided a good solution for crop models to expand from field scale to regional scale the calibrated swap model had high precision for simulating winter wheat growth and assisted in the accurate analysis of the crop growth process combining the effects of future climate factors i e radiation temperature precipitation and co2 concentration on yield we found that co2 fertilization could not offset the yield reduction caused by warming based on the simulation results in the optimized scenario planting late maturing 30 days winter wheat clearly promoted grain yield in northern china a combination of variety improvement and irrigation adjustment could enhance wpc while increasing yield we recommend giving priority to irrigation at the early growing stage which could effectively increase the yield and wpc in response to more soil evaporation in the future it was necessary to adopt a series of management measures to transfer the water use of crops to transpiration and maintain high productivity like most studies on climate change effects on agriculture utilizing crop models this study suffered from several limitations for instance the model did not consider the effects of fertilizers and pests on crop growth cultural practices were also assumed to be unchanged in future research the role of fertilizers could be demonstrated by setting solutes in models insect pests might be reflected by a reduction factor however more detailed information on cultural practices requires clarification through literature and practical surveys climate change and adaptation is a complex issue these results provide a scientific basis for farmers

10423,agriculture accounts for a significant portion of the state of minas gerais gdp which is one of the most productive brazilian states in the agricultural sector given this scenario it is essential to know the elements that affect agricultural productivity the data manipulated in this work were obtained from the network of automatic meteorological stations ema s from the national institute of meteorology inmet located in 51 cities from the state of minas gerais there is a lack of studies to determine the most appropriate model to estimate evapotranspiration with less error in the state of minas gerais such studies are necessary because the state in question has different climatic and hydrological conditions the objective of this paper was to evaluate whether the estimation of global solar radiation can influence the daily reference evapotranspiration by the penman monteith fao 56 method for the state of minas gerais brazil the estimated radiation data were applied to the penman monteith fao equation for reference evapotranspiration estimation and these results were compared to the reference evapotranspiration data obtained by the penman monteith fao equation with radiation data measured at the stations the performance indexes used were mean relative error mre root mean square error rmse and willmott s d index the solar radiation values used when calibrated for the study site tended to overestimate the evapotranspiration values presented dispersion of 0 76 mm d 1 on average and the degree of precision of the calibrated models had an average of 0 65 mm d 1 the best solar radiation estimation model for the cities studied was the thorton and running model keywords performance simplified equations eto penman monteith method solar radiation 1 introduction the importance of the rational use of water and the consequences of its scarcity has gained prominence in the national and international sphere in the last 10 years santos et al 2019 ag√™ncia nacional das √°guas ana 2018 the efficient use of water given its vital importance has been widely studied and widespread due to the prediction of water crisis and collapse scenarios in different regions of the world since it does not only concern the availability but also the quality of available water siqueira 2019 pereira et al 2002 the increase in demand for food the decrease in the rate of return from extreme events and the irrational use of water resources have boosted studies related to the theme in order to increase food production by making rational use of water without waste lima et al 2020 tanaka et al 2016 evapotranspiration is one of the main components of the hydrological cycle which concerns two processes evaporation and transpiration allen et al 1998 and is being widely studied in several areas such as agronomy climatology hydrology ecology environmental engineering among others etc liu et al 2019 peng et al 2019 tasumi et al 2019 concepts such as reference evapotranspiration eto potential evapotranspiration etp and culture evapotranspiration etc are different however there has been a misuse and misapplication of those terms mainly referring to the first two eto and etp due to the need to clarification regarding their meanings xiang et al 2020 thornthwaite 1948 first suggested the concept of potential evapotranspiration which refers to the maximum value of water transferred from the soil surface and water and plant transpiration inverse precipitation process back to the atmosphere under ideal conditions a few years later after many studies the food and agriculture organization of the united nations defined the term evapotranspiration as the evapotranspiration of a surface covered by a uniform reference culture grass or alfalfa 8 15 cm high in active growth completely covering the soil and without suffering water deficit doorenbos and pruitt 1977 crop evapotranspiration etc is a particularly important concept in agriculture as it refers to the amount of water required by the crop at different stages of development and for the correct management of irrigation parajuli et al 2019 it can be estimated from eto and the crop coefficient kc which varies according to the crop and its phenological stage moura et al 2013 estimation models are gaining ground today due to the determination and prediction of meteorological variables that aim to better understand the climatic effects on agriculture and on the planet there are many eto estimation models each of which in turn seeks what best suits each region to obtain more accurate results mccoll 2020 drought is among the most studied natural phenomena characterized by a low water supply causing economic and social impacts hao et al 2017 it is classified according to its aspects which are meteorological hydrological agricultural ecological and socioeconomic characteristics crausbay et al 2017 a large number of drought indicators have been developed to describe its onset persistence and end based on variables such as evapotranspiration anderson et al 2013 many studies on indexes and estimation models are being carried out around the world in order to validate them for study sites with more accurate data zhang et al 2018 zhang et al 2019a zhang et al 2019b however climate change increased water demand and unregulated consumption opens the way for improvement and development of new models and indexes in view of the above the objective of this article was to assess whether the estimated global solar radiation can influence the obtaining of daily reference evapotranspiration using the penman monteith fao 56 method pm fao 56 for the state of minas gerais 2 material and methods all data manipulated in this work were obtained from the network of automatic meteorological stations ema s from the national meteorological institute inmet located in 51 cities from the state of minas gerais as shown in table 1 this network is composed of 68 ema s in throughout the state

performance of the model the rmse value is observed the lower the rmse the better the performance however it cannot be said whether the model underestimates or overestimates the values jacovides kontoyiannis 1995 tanaka 2013 for this purpose the mre was used in which positive values overestimate and negative values underestimate the estimated values the agreement index d by willmott et al 1985 was used to verify the accuracy of the method and to indicate the degree of distance between the estimated and measured solar radiation values mj m 2 d 1 e r m n i p i o i n 1 r m s e i 1 n p i o

method for the estimation of global radiation in order to obtain the vp value scores from 1 to n were assigned to each statistical indicator with n being the number of models tested that is n 15 in which case note 1 was assigned to the best model and the n score to the worst later to find the best model the sum of the scores was performed and the best would be the one with the lowest sum of the assigned scores that is the lowest accumulated vp value 3 results and discussion the mean relative error mre refers to the underestimates and overestimates of the reference evapotranspiration it can be seen in fig 1 that for eto estimation the solar radiation values employed when calibrated for the study site tended to overestimate the evapotranspiration values by 0 0001 mm d 1 the thorton and running model underestimated the evapotranspiration values by on average 0 00339 mm d 1 it is possible to see that thorton and running had the lowest performance as well as the almorox and abraha and savage models which had similar behavior with the highest mre these models also underestimated evapotranspiration the reference evapotranspiration values estimated by the penman monteith model using solar radiation values showed a dispersion of 0 76 mm d 1 on average as it can be seen in fig 2 those values are slightly above those found by alencar et al 2015 for 20 cities in the state of minas gerais with an average of 0 59 on the other hand sentelhas et al 2010 found root mean square error rmse values of 0 8 mm d 1 for locations in southern ontario canada martinez and thepadia 2009 reported values with an average of 0 695 mm d 1 for stations in florida the lower the values obtained for rmse the better the performance of the models the willmott d index is dimensionless and indicates the degree of precision between the values estimated by the solar radiation estimation models in the reference evapotranspiration and the values estimated by penman monteith fig 3 shows the values of d and it is observed that the degree of precision of the calibrated models had an average of 0 65 mm d 1 values below those found by tanaka 2013 for cities in the state of mato grosso had an average of 0 85 mm d 1 alencar et al 2015 obtained values around 0 86 and 0 94 fig 4 shows the correlations between the reference evapotranspiration values estimated by penman monteith using the radiation estimated by the models already mentioned and the values estimated by penman monteith using data measured at the weather station located in the city of varginha minas gerais the models tended to overestimate evapotranspiration as one can observe the best models that can be used to estimate the global solar radiation for estimating reference evapotranspiration are the bristow and campbell brc models followed by de jong and stewarte djs and hunt et al hu1 table 3 shows the ordering values of the solar radiation estimation models in the reference evapotranspiration estimate according to the statistical performance indexes it is observed that the best model for estimating solar radiation for 53 of the cities studied was the thorton and running model thr followed by the almorox model alm which presented the best performance in 45 of the cities studied for tanaka 2013 in the state of mato grosso the models of goodin bristow and campbell and almorox stood out consequently the alm and thr models were the best models for the watershed regions in the state of minas gerais due to the lack of automatic meteorological stations installed in the regions of rio mucuri rio para√≠ba do sul rio pardo only two cities were studied and in the s√£o mateus river basin it was studied only one city it can be seen in fig 4 and table 3 that the best models from both analyses did not coincide this is due to the combination of the analysis of the three parameters in the ranking table mre rmse and d whereas in fig 4 it was taken into consideration only r¬≤ the model proposed by de jong and stewart is not recommended for calculating global solar radiation and subsequent estimation of evapotranspiration using the penman monteith fao method for the state of minas gerais since it was the worst model in 58 of the studied cities sentelhas et al 2010 report that the method recommended by allen et al 1998a 1998b is not recommended for locations in southern ontario canada to obtain radiation these three indexes seek to evaluate the performance of the model the wilmott agreement index d has no dimension 0 d 1 and the higher its value the better the model s performance on the other hand the mean relative error mre and root mean square error rmse indices unlike indicator d have a unit dimension equal to the dimension of the observed and predicted values legates mccabe 1999 mre considers errors overestimate and underestimate while rmse resembles a measure of the average deviation between observed and predicted however the terms raised to the square guarantee an index consisting of accumulated errors table 3 guarantees a comparison between the 15 models considered considering these 3 indexes the procedure for its construction and interpretation is as follows once the first index wilmott s d has been calculated the 15 models are compared assigning the value 1 to the best model and 15 to the worst model the procedure is analogous to the other errors mre and rmse at the end of this procedure each model will be assigned 3 values between 1 to 15 the sum of these values is shown in taela 3 thus in this present work the model most appropriate to the best goodness of fit phenomenon each hydrographic basin is made up of several cities after determining the best model for each city the model with the highest incidence in the classification of goodness of fit is verified and thus this model is chosen as the best for that hydrographic basin it is noteworthy that the values 17 and 18 were obtained for the thr and alm models being thus considered the best models goodness of fit for all cities studied 4 conclusion studies on the evapotranspiration determination are of paramount importance to assist the producer in making decisions in view of the problems experienced by the hydrological and climatic differences in the state of minas gerais brazil the study may be of assistance to the decision making process of agricultural producers thus based on the classic penman monteith model it enabled the development of several simplified models which were compared to determine the ideal model for each region the best estimates of the reference evapotranspiration according to the order of the statistical indexes were presented when the global solar radiation values applied in the penman monteith fao equation were estimated by the thorton and running and almorox models the model proposed by de jong and stewart is not recommended for calculating global solar radiation and subsequent estimation of evapotranspiration using the

essential to know the elements that affect agricultural productivity the data manipulated in this work were obtained from the network of automatic meteorological stations ema s from the national institute of meteorology inmet located in 51 cities from the state of minas gerais there is a lack of studies to determine the most appropriate model to estimate evapotranspiration with less error in the state of minas gerais such studies are necessary because the state in question has different climatic and hydrological conditions the objective of this paper was to evaluate whether the estimation of global solar radiation can influence the daily reference evapotranspiration by the penman monteith fao 56 method for the state of minas gerais brazil the estimated radiation data were applied to the penman monteith fao equation for reference evapotranspiration estimation and these results were compared to the reference evapotranspiration data obtained by the penman monteith fao equation with radiation data measured at the stations the performance indexes used were mean relative error mre root mean square error rmse and willmott s d index the solar radiation values used when calibrated for the study site tended to overestimate the evapotranspiration values presented dispersion of 0 76 mm d 1 on average and the degree of precision of the calibrated models had an average of 0 65 mm d 1

the importance of the rational use of water and the consequences of its scarcity has gained prominence in the national and international sphere in the last 10 years santos et al 2019 ag√™ncia nacional das √°guas ana 2018 the efficient use of water given its vital importance has been widely studied and widespread due to the prediction of water crisis and collapse scenarios in different regions of the world since it does not only concern the availability but also the quality of available water siqueira 2019 pereira et al 2002 the increase in demand for food the decrease in the rate of return from extreme events and the irrational use of water resources have boosted studies related to the theme in order to increase food production by making rational use of water without waste lima et al 2020 tanaka et al 2016 evapotranspiration is one of the main components of the hydrological cycle which concerns two processes evaporation and transpiration allen et al 1998 and is being widely studied in several areas such as agronomy climatology hydrology ecology environmental engineering among others etc liu et al 2019 peng et al 2019 tasumi et al 2019 concepts such as reference evapotranspiration eto potential evapotranspiration etp and culture evapotranspiration etc are different however there has been a misuse and misapplication of those terms mainly referring to the first two eto and etp due to the need to clarification regarding their meanings xiang et al 2020 thornthwaite 1948 first suggested the concept of potential evapotranspiration which refers to the maximum value of water transferred from the soil surface and water and plant transpiration inverse precipitation process back to the atmosphere under ideal conditions a few years later after many studies the food and agriculture organization of the united nations defined the term evapotranspiration as the evapotranspiration of a surface covered by a uniform reference culture grass or alfalfa 8 15 cm high in active growth completely covering the soil and without suffering water deficit doorenbos and pruitt 1977 crop evapotranspiration etc is a particularly important concept in agriculture as it refers to the amount of water required by the crop at different stages of development and for the correct management of irrigation parajuli et al 2019 it can be estimated from eto and the crop coefficient kc which varies according to the crop and its phenological stage moura et al 2013 estimation models are gaining ground today due to the determination and prediction of meteorological variables that aim to better understand the climatic effects on agriculture and on the planet there are many eto estimation models each of which in turn seeks what best suits each region to obtain more accurate results mccoll 2020 drought is among the most studied natural phenomena characterized by a low water supply causing economic and social impacts hao et al 2017 it is classified according to its aspects which are meteorological hydrological agricultural ecological and socioeconomic characteristics crausbay et al 2017 a large number of drought indicators have been developed to describe its onset persistence and end based on variables such as evapotranspiration anderson et al 2013 many studies on indexes and estimation models are being carried out around the world in order to validate them for study sites with more accurate data zhang et al 2018 zhang et al 2019a zhang et al 2019b however climate change increased water demand and unregulated consumption opens the way for improvement and development of new models and indexes in view of the above the objective of this article was to assess whether the estimated global solar radiation can influence the obtaining of daily reference evapotranspiration

canada to obtain radiation these three indexes seek to evaluate the performance of the model the wilmott agreement index d has no dimension 0 d 1 and the higher its value the better the model s performance on the other hand the mean relative error mre and root mean square error rmse indices unlike indicator d have a unit dimension equal to the dimension of the observed and predicted values legates mccabe 1999 mre considers errors overestimate and underestimate while rmse resembles a measure of the average deviation between observed and predicted however the terms raised to the square guarantee an index consisting of accumulated errors table 3 guarantees a comparison between the 15 models considered considering these 3 indexes the procedure for its construction and interpretation is as follows once the first index wilmott s d has been calculated the 15 models are compared assigning the value 1 to the best model and 15 to the worst model the procedure is analogous to the other errors mre and rmse at the end of this procedure each model will be assigned 3 values between 1 to 15 the sum of these values is shown in taela 3 thus in this present work the model most appropriate to the best goodness of fit phenomenon each hydrographic basin is made up of several cities after determining the best model for each city the model with the highest incidence in the classification of goodness of fit is verified and thus this model is chosen as the best for that hydrographic basin it is noteworthy that the values 17 and 18 were obtained for the thr and alm models being thus considered the best models goodness of fit for all cities studied 4 conclusion studies on the evapotranspiration determination are of paramount importance to assist the producer in making decisions in view of the problems experienced by the hydrological and climatic differences in the state of minas gerais brazil the study may be of assistance to the decision making process of agricultural producers thus based on the classic penman monteith model it enabled the development of several simplified models which were compared to determine the ideal model for each region the best estimates of the reference evapotranspiration according to the order of the statistical indexes were presented when the global solar radiation values applied in the penman monteith fao equation were estimated by the thorton and running and almorox models the model proposed by de jong and stewart is not recommended for calculating global solar radiation and subsequent estimation of evapotranspiration using the penman monteith fao method for the state of minas gerais since it was the worst model in most cities studied declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest

higher yield and water use efficiency it is recommended that water deficiency should be avoided at least at the tillering stage however this study concluded that 50 water deficit at the grain maturity stage can be an effective irrigation strategy to improve the wue with very less yield reduction and can be implemented under semi arid climatic conditions of sindh and elsewhere keywords deficit irrigation grain yield yield components critical growth stages semi arid water use efficiency 1 introduction the inadequacy of water resources is one of the leading challenges in the world predominantly for the primary freshwater consumer i e agriculture pakistan exists in the arid to the semi arid climatic zone shah et al 2011 where water is the most limiting constraint and has prime importance for food supply memon et al 2019 the main aspects like changing climate scenarios rapid population growth rate illegal and unjustified usage of available water resources lead to distressing the condition of our country and overall the world hussain et al 2016 sadaf et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 the agricultural industrial and livelihood sectorial demand is 95 2 and 3 respectively however the demand for water supply in each sector is increasing day to day due to changing climate conditions and the rapid growth rate in the country hussain and mumtaz 2014 the arid and semi arid zones of pakistan are suffering from a high evaporation rate and consequently crops need more water to persist in water scarcity situations the agriculture is currently consuming 72 of available freshwater and this available water is progressively diminishing the per capita water has also declined dramatically to less than 1000 m3 capita water scarcity limit and might be decreased to 584 m3 capita by the year 2025 el rahman 2009 in pakistan the water scarcity limit is decreasing steadily and climate change may further deteriorate the situation e survey of pakistan 2019 wheat triticum aestivum l mostly adopted as a food crop throughout the world and also the prime staple crop of pakistan ranking the 8th position in the world agriculture contributes about 19 5 to pakistan s gross domestic product gdp an average of about 9 mh million hectares area cultivated annually which produces about 25 30 mt year million tons per year of wheat however punjab and sindh are the principal wheat growing provinces where wheat mostly cultivated during rabi season pakistan bureau of statistics 2014 wheat being the winter season crop october to april needs 325 to 450 mm water throughout the growing period because of the high temperature prevailing in sindh five to six irrigations at different growth stages improves the wheat grain yield badaruddin et al 2010 kataki et al 2001 generally six irrigations are required with an application depth of 75 mm after every twenty five to thirty days after sowing the tillering flowering and grain filling period are crop growth stages which are sensitive to water shortage water deficiency and uncertain water delivery schedules are the most fundamental difficulties at present facing by wheat cultivators especially at these stages khuhro et al 2018 therefore to handle these situations researchers and planners have focused their attention on deficit irrigation di which extensively recognized as an optimized efficacious approach for dry regions in which irrigation is applied during the sensitive growth stages of the crop wajid et al 2002 the water saved through deficit irrigation can be utilized for irrigating the additional land or may be for many other purposes the yield and water use efficiency can be improved simultaneously with deficit irrigation but the most significant factor effecting is irrigation level yu et al 2019a generally those regions having loamy and sandy soil with average precipitation less than 200 mm throughout the crop growing period are well suitable for the application of deficit irrigation approach yu et al 2019b furthermore deficit irrigation application requires less water than the maximum crop water requirement attia et al 2015 and effectively increased water use efficiency without reducing the yield in many crops ali et al 2007 bashir et al 2016 eissa et al 2018 fahad et al 2019 geerts and raes 2009 hussain et al 2016 meena et al 2019 pradhan et al 2018 tari 2016 zhang et al 2019 however to implement this approach information concerning the effect of water deficit at several growth stages of the crop under field conditions is required various studies have shown that if deficits irrigation applied in stem elongation and heading stages of wheat it would significantly reduce the yield tari 2016 when irrigation applied at crown root initiation maximum tillering booting and milking stages of the wheat crop higher grain yield produced followed by the proportionate increase in dry matter siddiqui and jakhar 2017 the most sensitive growth stage of the wheat is the crown root initiation stage therefore in case of a water scarcity situation at least one irrigation at this stage must be applied to avoid the risk of yield reduction sarkar et al 2013 moreover with the application of a 40 70 level of deficit irrigation wheat yield reduction was attained 13 only pereira et al 2002 it means that the deficit irrigation has a significant impact on grain yield yield components biomass production and water use efficiency of the wheat crop akram 2011 islam et al 2018 liwani et al 2019 meena et al 2019 however the consequences of these studies may fluctuate under various climatic conditions for different growth stages of crop in irrigated agriculture there exist three types of delivery systems viz demand based supply based and partially demand based and partially supply based system in pakistan the irrigation system is supply based and the rotation system are practiced shaikh et al 2012 the rotation system mostly called warabandi is a flexible practice where farmers can modify the time schedules by their mutual agreement in order to feed all the canal the perception of warabandi presumed that each canal must be provided with the flow not less than 75 of full flow supply however when the flow drops below 70 of full supply some canals receive insufficient or no water at all creating unequal water distribution among watercourses this causes an interruption in warabandi scheduling bandaragcda and badruddin 1992 despite the fact previous data indicates fluctuation and reduction in the irrigation water supply up to 50 of the designed flow shaikh et al 2015 therefore at the time of reduced flow the water distribution among the competitive crops of a particular region is a challenge for the irrigation department especially for wheat growing areas thus it is indispensable to recognize wheat critical growing stages to adjust the irrigation schedule accordingly therefore considering the above aspects of a maximum reduction level of 50 a two years field study was conducted to assess the effect of 50 deficit irrigation on grain yield yield growth components biomass and water use efficiency of the wheat crop at various critical growth stages moreover the most critical growth stage was also identified at which limited water supply can improve the water use efficiency with a minimum yield penalty this research may help to develop the cost effective and efficient utilization of the water in this region and also other areas of depleting water resources under local climate conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site field trials were conducted during the wheat growing season for two consecutive years from 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 at the research farm of the faculty of agricultural engineering sindh agriculture university tandojam sindh pakistan the farm is located at 25 25 25 n 68 32 28 e and 26 m above sea level the main source of irrigation in the study area is groundwater the area has a semi arid climate with an average annual precipitation of 180 mm the maximum and minimum mean air temperature ranges from 24 50 c and 17 25 c respectively the rainfall data during wheat growing periods november to march were acquired from the regional agro meteorological center ramc tandojam and are presented in table 1 this data was used to adjust the irrigation amount applied to the experimental units 2 2 experimental design the experiment was conducted in randomized complete block design rcbd with seven treatments and three replication the recommended and existing practice of irrigating 75 mm of water per irrigation badaruddin et al 2010 kataki et al 2001 was used as a control ick100 treatment and applied at all critical growth stages crown root initiation tillering booting heading milking and grain maturity of wheat crop the remaining treatments were comprising deficit irrigations applied at each critical growth stage by reducing 50 37 5 mm of control treatment these treatments were scheduled as t1 100 full irrigation at all the six growth stages ick100 t2 50 deficit irrigation at the initiation stage of the crown root icrs50 t3 50 deficit irrigation at tillering stage its50 t4 50 deficit irrigation at booting stage ibs50 t5 50 deficit irrigation at the heading stage ihs50 t6 50 deficit irrigation at milky stage ims50 t7 50 deficit irrigation at grain maturity stage igms50 were applied at 21 42 63 84 105 and 126 days after sowing das of wheat crop respectively the description of the treatments irrigation levels and quantity of water applied at each growth stage presented in table 2 2 3 experimental data collection after the preparation of suitable seedbed the experimental field of 550 m2 was divided into 21 equal subplots each measuring size 5m 3m moreover to minimize the mutual effects of contiguous plots each plot was separated from one another by providing a 1 m buffer zone the soil samples were collected up to 90 cm depth with a constant increment of 30 cm depth and were analyzed for physicochemical properties in the experimental field the soil was sandy loam 10 4 silt 70 4 sand and 19 2 clay that was estimated by bouyoucos hydrometer method bouyoucos 1962 the soil dry bulk density œÅb was obtained 1 48 g cm3 using the core method the electrical conductivity of soil was measured through ec meter in 1 5 soil water extract and was obtained as 2 1 ds m 1 the ph of soil suspension was 7 5 which was determined by a ph meter a uniform soaking dose of 100 mm kahlown et al 2003 tagar et al 2016 was applied to all plots for providing sufficient moisture for seed germination and subsequent six irrigations were applied after every 21 days the calibrated cut throat flume 3 1 5 was used to measure and apply the exact amount of water according to the different irrigation treatments shaikh and lee 2016 the required volume of water was converted in terms of water depth and then applied separately in each consecutive plot the equation given below was used to determine the time for a specific depth of water 1 t ad q where t time for a scheduled amount of water s a area of the plot to be irrigated m2 d water depth to be applied m and q discharge of cut throat flume m3 sec the wheat crop variety td 1 was broadcasted at a seed rate of 125 kg ha 1 fahad et al 2019 nizamani 2014 on 11 november 2018 and 2019 the recommended amount 120 60 60 npk kg ha 1 in the form of urea n di ammonium phosphate dap and sulphate of potash respectively were applied at planting the second half of urea was applied in three split doses of equal proportional at first 21 das second 42 das and third 63 das irrigations laghari et al 2011 the agronomic data regarding the plant height spike length grain spike 1 and weight of grains spike 1 were obtained at maturity by picking ten 10 plants randomly from each sub plot the plant height and spike length were measured through measuring tape the grains number per spike were counted and weighed separately by digital balance the crop was harvested manually during 23rd and 25th march for the years 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 respectively the bundles were tied separately and sundried for five days the biological yield above ground biomass from each sub plot was determined by weighing the harvested crop consequently sun dried wheat bundles of each sub plot were threshed manually the average grain yield was recorded in kg plot 1 and was converted into kg ha 1 the water use efficiency of wheat in kg m3 is the productivity of water was determined as the ratio between grain yield and quantity of irrigated water used by the crop 2 4 statistical analysis the obtained data in two seasons of various parameters were verified statistically using statistix 8 1 software analysis of variance anova technique was employed to observe the effect of treatments the mean comparisons among the irrigation treatments were estimated using fisher s least significant difference test lsd at 5 level of probability pearson s correlation coefficient r was computed for understanding the association between the data of two years 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of deficit irrigation treatments on different parameters of wheat for the proper growth and yield development sufficient irrigation is the fundamental requirement of plants whereas deficit irrigation produces water stress that can distress the development of plants this study investigated the response of wheat yield components biomass accumulation wheat yield and water use efficiency under deficit irrigation treatments imposed on critical growth stages of winter wheat from 2017 to 2019 the recorded data were analyzed and interpreted to recognize the most sensitive growth stages to water deficit a significant deviation was found due to the effect of irrigation treatments at different growth stages during the study the average values of plant height ph spike length sl number and weight of grain spike 1 ngps above ground biomass agbm grain yield gy and water use efficiency wue of the wheat crop during 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 are summarized in table 3 the results of pearson s correlation coefficient during both the study years are presented in table 4 the data t for both the experimental years indicates a strong association r 0 99 between all the parameters of wheat crop therefore it is perceived that management practices and conditions adopted for the experiment remained the same throughout the growing period therefore the results are discussed reliably to infer the sensitive growth stages to water deficit the comparative results of both the years are summarized in the subsequent paragraphs 3 2 plant height ph plant height is an essential parameter of the crop that generally depends on nutrients and moisture the two experimental years 2017 2019 data fig 1 showed that mean plant height was significantly p 0 05 affected under deficit irrigation treatments among the irrigation treatments the plant height was observed 1 5 higher with 92 47 cm at grain maturity stage igms50 in comparison to control irrigation treatments ick100 whereas the lowest plant height 32 9 was observed at the tillering stage its50 with 61 2 cm followed by crown root initiation stage icr50 treatment with 21 5 in both the wheat growing seasons the plant height in treatments ick100 and igms50 were almost similar whereas the treatments ibs50 ihs50 and ims50 were statistically the same the healthy growth and development of crops need an adequate amount of moisture these conclusions are in line with those of maqbool et al 2015 who indicated that when water deficiency imposed at the tillering growth stage decreased the number of fertile tillers which ultimately reduced the wheat crop height the results also revealed the strong positive association between the plant height data of both the wheat growing seasons that indicates the similar management condition for the field trial were adopted during bth the wheat growing period 3 3 spike length the average length of wheat spike indicates a significant p 0 05 reduction at all deficit irrigation treatments as presented in fig 2 the data about the length of spike for both the growing seasons showed a strong positive correlation the spike length varied between 11 0 to7 66 and 11 22 and 7 82 cm in 2017 18 and 2018 19 respectively the average maximum spike length 11 11 cm was recorded when full irrigation ick100 applied at all growth phases among the deficit irrigation treatments maximum spike length 97 was achieved at igms50 followed by ibs50 92 which is at par of control treatment the maximum reduction 33 in spike length was observed at the tillering stage its50 treatment followed by 24 2 in icrs50 and 14 5 in ihs50 treatment in both the years the irrigation treatments ibs50 ims50 and igms50 gave the same results the results revealed that the deficits applied during the tillering stage and crown root initiation stages significantly reduced the spike length the reason may be that some wheat species are sensitive to water stress mostly at the tillering stage hence eventually their flowering and grain filling stages may lead to shortening the length of the spike sokoto and singh 2013 3 4 grain number spike 1 gnps the average number of grain spike 1 for two years 2017 19 was significantly influenced by deficit irrigation as summarized in fig 3 the maximum 55 96 grain number spike 1 was observed at controlled treatment ick100 and a minimum 32 53 at the tillering stage its50 the possible reason for this may be tillering allows the plant to expand and to produce more spikes moreover application of deficit irrigation e reduces the number of grain spike 1 subsequently maximum reduction 40 8 in grain number spike 1 was attained at the tillering stage followed by 19 5 crown root initiation 5 4 booting 15 3 heading and 2 9 milking and 1 8 at grain maturity stages of wheat crop the data for both the years depicted that the deficit irrigation applied at the grain maturity treatment igms50 attained almost similar gnps 53 97 and the reduction was 1 8 only when compared to control ick100 t whereas treatments ibs50 and ims50 were statistically the same the number of grain per spike are extra vulnerable to water deficit therefore wheat crop cannot tolerate the water deficiency from emergence to maturity growth stages grewal 2010 reported that the water deficiency at the anthesis phase of the crop disturbs the plant growth and eventually effects the quantity of wheat grains 3 5 grain weight spike 1 gwps the grain weight spike 1 of wheat was significantly p 0 05 affected under deficit irrigation treatments and presented in fig 4 the average gwps in both the study year 2017 2019 was decreased by 3 8 39 85 under all 50 water deficit imposed treatments the post hoc analyses also indicate that grain weight spike 1 reduced under deficit irrigation when compared with treatments ibs50 and ims50 the grain weight spike 1 in treatments icrs50 and its50 was very low less in both the years 2018 2019 the maximum 3 1 g grain weight spike 1 was recorded at control ick100 treatment followed by 96 with 2 97 g at grain maturity stages ihs50 of wheat crop it means that grain maturity stage igms50 treatment contributed almost similar 2 98 g grain weight spike 1 and the reduction was only 3 8 compared to control ick100 treatment however treatments ibs50 his50 and ims50 were statistically same the lowest grain weight spike 1 with 1 85 g was achieved at the tillering growth stage its50 as compared to other treatments however its50 and icrs50 treatments recorded 40 and 38 5 maximum loss of gwps respectively as compared to full irrigation treatment ick100 the reason may the limited water supply along with a reduced amount of nutrients from the soil solution consequently plants may produce lighter grains sarwar et al 2010 3 6 above ground biomass agbm the above ground biomass which is one of the most crucial indicator walter et al 2018 for estimating the grain yield and water use efficiency was significantly p 0 05 affected under all deficit irrigation treatment and is presented in fig 5 the mean agbm of both the wheat growing years 2017 2019 was compared the highest mean 11 397 kg ha 1 was obtained during 2018 2019 followed by 2017 2018 11 170 kg ha 1 at control treatment the increased yield of agbm under ick100 treatment can be the result of taller plant height more tillers and better seed growth khan et al 2011 research conducted by thapa et al 2019 indicates that maintaining higher biomass production is essential for higher yield in a semi arid environment because wheat biomass at maturity significantly reduced from high to low water regimes the findings of our study match with those of zhan jiang et al 2010 who reported that application with less water decreases the biomass production but the well watered situations enhanced the yield the treatments igms50 and ick100 gave almost the same results whereas the treatments ibs50 ihs50 and ims50 were statistically the same however the lowest biomass yields were obtained from its50 treatment which accumulated 15 5 less agbm 9533 kg ha 1 than control treatment followed by 11 7 crown root initiation 4 7 booting 9 9 heading 2 9 milking and 1 55 at grain maturity stages of wheat crop this indicates that the tillering was the most affected stage with regards to biomass production when deficit irrigation was applied similar research was performed by liwani et al 2019 who resolved that the agbm was significantly affected p 0 05 by reduced irrigation level when imposed at the tillering growth stage of wheat crop 3 7 grain yield gy the results obtained from two year research showed that grain yield was significantly p 0 05 affected bywater deficits allowed in some of the treatments of the study as presented in fig 6 the wheat production was varied between 4467 7 3727 and 4558 3 3764 6 kg ha 1 in the first and second years of the research respectively the average maximum yield 4513 25 kg ha 1was achieved at the control ick100 and lowest with 3745 8 kg ha 1 at the tillering stage its50 treatments the treatment igms50 achieved 4442 9 kg ha 1 grain yield that is 98 5 of control treatment the mean comparison shows statistically no difference between ibs50 and ims50 treatments also a minimum of 1 5 and a maximum 17 grain yield loss were recorded at grain maturity and tillering stages of the wheat crop respectively however overall grain yield was 2 higher in 2018 2019 due to favorable climatic conditions application of deficit irrigation during different growth stages may decrease tiller number that effect the number and weight of grains per spike ultimately produce low yields the decline in yield at initial growth stages of root initiation and tillering may be attributed to less moisture available in the upper effective root zone these results are in agreement with that of previous studies ali et al 2007 wajid et al 2002 who concluded that the highest wheat yield was attained with no or very less deficit irrigation treatments some earlier studies also showed that reducing irrigation at the critical growth stages produced a significant decline in wheat grain yield fahad et al 2019 hao et al 2014 hussain and mumtaz 2014 maqbool et al 2015 sarkar et al 2013 tari 2016 3 8 water use efficiency wue the ratio of grain yield to the water used by crop throughout its growth period is known as water use efficiency wue the statistical analysis illustrates that wue was significantly p 0 05 effected under all deficit irrigation treatments as presented in fig 7 the results indicate that the mean values over the two growing seasons 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 fluctuate in the range of 0 91 to 1 08 kg m 3 however the water use efficiency was almost similar in treatments ick100 and igms50 whereas the treatments ibs50 ihs50 and ims50 were statistically same the irrigation treatments its50 and icrs50 recorded 15 7 and 13 less water use efficiency respectively and were significantly different from ick100 and igms50 a strong positive correlation was found between the water use efficiency data of both the growing seasons the deficit irrigation treatments igms50 represent the higher values of wue with compare to the other deficit irrigation treatments these results are in agreement with those of singh and malik 1983 thamer et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 who reported a significant increase in wue by applying less amount of water to winter wheat consecutively the average maximum 1 098 kg m 3 wue values were observed in the grain maturity stage which is a little bit higher compared to control ick100 followed by 1 043 and 1 035 kg m 3 at the booting stage and milky stage respectively meena et al 2019 also concluded that irrigated water reduction up to fifty percent level applied at all the sensitive growth stages of wheat recorded maximum water use efficiency 4 conclusion the deficit irrigation is an advanced approach and optimized tool for irrigation management in which water is applied during the crucial growth stages of a crop it requires more control over the amount and timing of water application than full irrigation practice the deficit irrigation with water reduction of 50 of full irrigation was applied at various sensitive growth stages of wheat revealed the significant reduction in grain yield above ground biomass and yield components as compared with full irrigation practice the results affirmed that the water deficit at the grain maturity stage 105 126 days after sowing enhanced the irrigation water use efficiency with the least yield penalty therefore it can be implemented as a more efficient water saving strategy in this region and also other areas of depleting water resources furthermore the tillering growth stage 22 42 days after sowing is recognized as the most vulnerable sensitive and critical phase of the wheat crop to water stress for attaining higher production and water use efficiency in the light of the results of this research it is recommended that water deficiency should be avoided at least at this tillering growth stage of wheat crop under the semi arid climatic conditions in sindh and the reagions facing water shortage declaration of competing

of the high temperature prevailing in sindh five to six irrigations at different growth stages improves the wheat grain yield badaruddin et al 2010 kataki et al 2001 generally six irrigations are required with an application depth of 75 mm after every twenty five to thirty days after sowing the tillering flowering and grain filling period are crop growth stages which are sensitive to water shortage water deficiency and uncertain water delivery schedules are the most fundamental difficulties at present facing by wheat cultivators especially at these stages khuhro et al 2018 therefore to handle these situations researchers and planners have focused their attention on deficit irrigation di which extensively recognized as an optimized efficacious approach for dry regions in which irrigation is applied during the sensitive growth stages of the crop wajid et al 2002 the water saved through deficit irrigation can be utilized for irrigating the additional land or may be for many other purposes the yield and water use efficiency can be improved simultaneously with deficit irrigation but the most significant factor effecting is irrigation level yu et al 2019a generally those regions having loamy and sandy soil with average precipitation less than 200 mm throughout the crop growing period are well suitable for the application of deficit irrigation approach yu et al 2019b furthermore deficit irrigation application requires less water than the maximum crop water requirement attia et al 2015 and effectively increased water use efficiency without reducing the yield in many crops ali et al 2007 bashir et al 2016 eissa et al 2018 fahad et al 2019 geerts and raes 2009 hussain et al 2016 meena et al 2019 pradhan et al 2018 tari 2016 zhang et al 2019 however to implement this approach information concerning the effect of water deficit at several growth stages of the crop under field conditions is required various studies have shown that if deficits irrigation applied in stem elongation and heading stages of wheat it would significantly reduce the yield tari 2016 when irrigation applied at crown root initiation maximum tillering booting and milking stages of the wheat crop higher grain yield produced followed by the proportionate increase in dry matter siddiqui and jakhar 2017 the most sensitive growth stage of the wheat is the crown root initiation stage therefore in case of a water scarcity situation at least one irrigation at this stage must be applied to avoid the risk of yield reduction sarkar et al 2013 moreover with the application of a 40 70 level of deficit irrigation wheat yield reduction was attained 13 only pereira et al 2002 it means that the deficit irrigation has a significant impact on grain yield yield components biomass production and water use efficiency of the wheat crop akram 2011 islam et al 2018 liwani et al 2019 meena et al 2019 however the consequences of these studies may fluctuate under various climatic conditions for different growth stages of crop in irrigated agriculture there exist three types of delivery systems viz demand based supply based and partially demand based and partially supply based system in pakistan the irrigation system is supply based and the rotation system are practiced shaikh et al 2012 the rotation system mostly called warabandi is a flexible practice where farmers can modify the time schedules by their mutual agreement in order to feed all the canal the perception of warabandi presumed that each canal must be provided with the flow not less than 75 of full flow supply however when the flow drops below 70 of full supply some canals receive insufficient or no water at all creating unequal water distribution among watercourses this causes an interruption in warabandi scheduling bandaragcda and badruddin 1992 despite the fact previous data indicates fluctuation and reduction in the irrigation water supply up to 50 of the designed flow shaikh et al 2015 therefore at the time of reduced flow the water distribution among the competitive crops of a particular region is a challenge for the irrigation department especially for wheat growing areas thus it is indispensable to recognize wheat critical growing stages to adjust the irrigation schedule accordingly therefore considering the above aspects of a maximum reduction level of 50 a two years field study was conducted to assess the effect of 50 deficit irrigation on grain yield yield growth components biomass and water use efficiency of the wheat crop at various critical growth stages moreover the most critical growth stage was also identified at which limited water supply can improve the water use efficiency with a minimum yield penalty this research may help to develop the cost effective and efficient utilization of the water in this region and also other areas of depleting water resources under local climate conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site field trials were conducted during the wheat growing season for two consecutive years from 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 at the research farm of the faculty of agricultural engineering sindh agriculture university tandojam sindh pakistan the farm is located at 25 25 25 n 68 32 28 e and 26 m above sea level the main source of irrigation in the study area is groundwater the area has a semi arid climate with an average annual precipitation of 180 mm the maximum and minimum mean air temperature ranges from 24 50 c and 17 25 c respectively the rainfall data during wheat growing periods november to march were acquired from the regional agro meteorological center ramc tandojam and are presented in table 1 this data was used to adjust the irrigation amount applied to the experimental units 2 2 experimental design the experiment was conducted in randomized complete block design rcbd with seven treatments and three replication the recommended and existing practice of irrigating 75 mm of water per irrigation badaruddin et al 2010 kataki et al 2001 was used as a control ick100 treatment and applied at all critical growth stages crown root initiation tillering booting heading milking and grain maturity of wheat crop the remaining treatments were comprising deficit irrigations applied at each critical growth stage by reducing 50 37 5 mm of control treatment these treatments were scheduled as t1 100 full irrigation at all the six growth stages ick100 t2 50 deficit irrigation at the initiation stage of the crown root icrs50 t3 50 deficit irrigation at tillering stage its50 t4 50 deficit irrigation at booting stage ibs50 t5 50 deficit irrigation at the heading stage ihs50 t6 50 deficit irrigation at milky stage ims50 t7 50 deficit irrigation at grain maturity stage igms50 were applied at 21 42 63 84 105 and 126 days after sowing das of wheat crop respectively the description of the treatments irrigation levels and quantity of water applied at each growth stage presented in table 2 2 3 experimental data collection after the preparation of suitable seedbed the experimental field of 550 m2 was divided into 21 equal subplots each measuring size 5m 3m moreover to minimize the mutual effects of contiguous plots each plot was separated from one another by providing a 1 m buffer zone the soil samples were collected up to 90 cm depth with a constant increment of 30 cm depth and were analyzed for physicochemical properties in the experimental field the soil was sandy loam 10 4 silt 70 4 sand and 19 2 clay that was estimated by bouyoucos hydrometer method bouyoucos 1962 the soil dry bulk density œÅb was obtained 1 48 g cm3 using the core method the electrical conductivity of soil was measured through ec meter in 1 5 soil water extract and was obtained as 2 1 ds m 1 the ph of soil suspension was 7 5 which was determined by a ph meter a uniform soaking dose of 100 mm kahlown et al 2003 tagar et al 2016 was applied to all plots for providing sufficient moisture for seed germination and subsequent six irrigations were applied after every 21 days the calibrated cut throat flume 3 1 5 was used to measure and apply the exact amount of water according to the different irrigation treatments shaikh and lee 2016 the required volume of water was converted in terms of water depth and then applied separately in each consecutive plot the equation given below was used to determine the time for a specific depth of water 1 t ad q where t time for a scheduled amount of water s a area of the plot to be irrigated m2 d water depth to be applied m and q discharge of cut throat flume m3 sec the wheat crop variety td 1 was broadcasted at a seed rate of 125 kg ha 1 fahad et al 2019 nizamani 2014 on 11 november 2018 and 2019 the recommended amount 120 60 60 npk kg ha 1 in the form of urea n di ammonium phosphate dap and sulphate of potash respectively were applied at planting the second half of urea was applied in three split doses of equal proportional at first 21 das second 42 das and third 63 das irrigations laghari et al 2011 the agronomic data regarding the plant height spike length grain spike 1 and weight of grains spike 1 were obtained at maturity by picking ten 10 plants randomly from each sub plot the plant height and spike length were measured through measuring tape the grains number per spike were counted and weighed separately by digital balance the crop was harvested manually during 23rd and 25th march for the years 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 respectively the bundles were tied separately and sundried for five days the biological yield above ground biomass from each sub plot was determined by weighing the harvested crop consequently sun dried wheat bundles of each sub plot were threshed manually the average grain yield was recorded in kg plot 1 and was converted into kg ha 1 the water use efficiency of wheat in kg m3 is the productivity of water was determined as the ratio between grain yield and quantity of irrigated water used by the crop 2 4 statistical analysis the obtained data in two seasons of various parameters were verified statistically using statistix 8 1 software analysis of variance anova technique was employed to observe the effect of treatments the mean comparisons among the irrigation treatments were estimated using fisher s least significant difference test lsd at 5 level of probability pearson s correlation coefficient r was computed for understanding the association between the data of two years 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of deficit irrigation treatments on different parameters of wheat for the proper growth and yield development sufficient irrigation is the fundamental requirement of plants whereas deficit irrigation produces water stress that can distress the development of plants this study investigated the response of wheat yield components biomass accumulation wheat yield and water use efficiency under deficit irrigation treatments imposed on critical growth stages of winter wheat from 2017 to 2019 the recorded data were analyzed and interpreted to recognize the most sensitive growth stages to water deficit a significant deviation was found due to the effect of irrigation treatments at different growth stages during the study the average values of plant height ph spike length sl number and weight of grain spike 1 ngps above ground biomass agbm grain yield gy and water use efficiency wue of the wheat crop during 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 are summarized in table 3 the results of pearson s correlation coefficient during both the study years are presented in table 4 the data t for both the experimental years indicates a strong association r 0 99 between all the parameters of wheat crop therefore it is perceived that management practices and conditions adopted for the experiment remained the same throughout the growing period therefore the results are discussed reliably to infer the sensitive growth stages to water deficit the comparative results of both the years are summarized in the subsequent paragraphs 3 2 plant height ph plant height is an essential parameter of the crop that generally depends on nutrients and moisture the two experimental years 2017 2019 data fig 1 showed that mean plant height was significantly p 0 05 affected under deficit irrigation treatments among the irrigation treatments the plant height was observed 1 5 higher with 92 47 cm at grain maturity stage igms50 in comparison to control irrigation treatments ick100 whereas the lowest plant height 32 9 was observed at the tillering stage its50 with 61 2 cm followed by crown root initiation stage icr50 treatment with 21 5 in both the wheat growing seasons the plant height in treatments ick100 and igms50 were almost similar whereas the treatments ibs50 ihs50 and ims50 were statistically the same the healthy growth and development of crops need an adequate amount of moisture these conclusions are in line with those of maqbool et al 2015 who indicated that when water deficiency imposed at the tillering growth stage decreased the number of fertile tillers which ultimately reduced the wheat crop height the results also revealed the strong positive association between the plant height data of both the wheat growing seasons that indicates the similar management condition for the field trial were adopted during bth the wheat growing period 3 3 spike length the average length of wheat spike indicates a significant p 0 05 reduction at all deficit irrigation treatments as presented in fig 2 the data about the length of spike for both the growing seasons showed a strong positive correlation the spike length varied between 11 0 to7 66 and 11 22 and 7 82 cm in 2017 18 and 2018 19 respectively the average maximum spike length 11 11 cm was recorded when full irrigation ick100 applied at all growth phases among the deficit irrigation treatments maximum spike length 97 was achieved at igms50 followed by ibs50 92 which is at par of control treatment the maximum reduction 33 in spike length was observed at the tillering stage its50 treatment followed by 24 2 in icrs50 and 14 5 in ihs50 treatment in both the years the irrigation treatments ibs50 ims50 and igms50 gave the same results the results revealed that the deficits applied during the tillering stage and crown root initiation stages significantly reduced the spike length the reason may be that some wheat species are sensitive to water stress mostly at the tillering stage hence eventually their flowering and grain filling stages may lead to shortening the length of the spike sokoto and singh 2013 3 4 grain number spike 1 gnps the average number of grain spike 1 for two years 2017 19 was significantly influenced by deficit irrigation as summarized in fig 3 the maximum 55 96 grain number spike 1 was observed at controlled treatment ick100 and a minimum 32 53 at the tillering stage its50 the possible reason for this may be tillering allows the plant to expand and to produce more spikes moreover application of deficit irrigation e reduces the number of grain spike 1 subsequently maximum reduction 40 8 in grain number spike 1 was attained at the tillering stage followed by 19 5 crown root initiation 5 4 booting 15 3 heading and 2 9 milking and 1 8 at grain maturity stages of wheat crop the data for both the years depicted that the deficit irrigation applied at the grain maturity treatment igms50 attained almost similar gnps 53 97 and the reduction was 1 8 only when compared to control ick100 t whereas treatments ibs50 and ims50 were statistically the same the number of grain per spike are extra vulnerable to water deficit therefore wheat crop cannot tolerate the water deficiency from emergence to maturity growth stages grewal 2010 reported that the water deficiency at the anthesis phase of the crop disturbs the plant growth and eventually effects the quantity of wheat grains 3 5 grain weight spike 1 gwps the grain weight spike 1 of wheat was significantly p 0 05 affected under deficit irrigation treatments and presented in fig 4 the average gwps in both the study year 2017 2019 was decreased by 3 8 39 85 under all 50 water deficit imposed treatments the post hoc analyses also indicate that grain weight spike 1 reduced under deficit irrigation when compared with treatments ibs50 and ims50 the grain weight spike 1 in treatments icrs50 and its50 was very low less in both the years 2018 2019 the maximum 3 1 g grain weight spike 1 was recorded at control ick100 treatment followed by 96 with 2 97 g at grain maturity stages ihs50 of wheat crop it means that grain maturity stage igms50 treatment contributed almost similar 2 98 g grain weight spike 1 and the reduction was only 3 8 compared to control ick100 treatment however treatments ibs50 his50 and ims50 were statistically same the lowest grain weight spike 1 with 1 85 g was achieved at the tillering growth stage its50 as compared to other treatments however its50 and icrs50 treatments recorded 40 and 38 5 maximum loss of gwps respectively as compared to full irrigation treatment ick100 the reason may the limited water supply along with a reduced amount of nutrients from the soil solution consequently plants may produce lighter grains sarwar et al 2010 3 6 above ground biomass agbm the above ground biomass which is one of the most crucial indicator walter et al 2018 for estimating the grain yield and water use efficiency was significantly p 0 05 affected under all deficit irrigation treatment and is presented in fig 5 the mean agbm of both the wheat growing years 2017 2019 was compared the highest mean 11 397 kg ha 1 was obtained during 2018 2019 followed by 2017 2018 11 170 kg ha 1 at control treatment the increased yield of agbm under ick100 treatment can be the result of taller plant height more tillers and better seed growth khan et al 2011 research conducted by thapa et al 2019 indicates that maintaining higher biomass production is essential for higher yield in a semi arid environment because wheat biomass at maturity significantly reduced from high to low water regimes the findings of our study match with those of zhan jiang et al 2010 who reported that application with less water decreases the biomass production but the well watered situations enhanced the yield the treatments igms50 and ick100 gave almost the same results whereas the treatments ibs50 ihs50 and ims50 were statistically the same however the lowest biomass yields were obtained from its50 treatment which accumulated 15 5 less agbm 9533 kg ha 1 than control treatment followed by 11 7 crown root initiation 4 7 booting 9 9 heading 2 9 milking and 1 55 at grain maturity stages of wheat crop this indicates that the tillering was the most affected stage with regards to biomass production when deficit irrigation was applied similar research was performed by liwani et al 2019 who resolved that the agbm was significantly affected p 0 05 by reduced irrigation level when imposed at the tillering growth stage of wheat crop 3 7 grain yield gy the results obtained from two year research showed that grain yield was significantly p 0 05 affected bywater deficits allowed in some of the treatments of the study as presented in fig 6 the wheat production was varied between 4467 7 3727 and 4558 3 3764 6 kg ha 1 in the first and second years of the research respectively the average maximum yield 4513 25 kg ha 1was achieved at the control ick100 and lowest with 3745 8 kg ha 1 at the tillering stage its50 treatments the treatment igms50 achieved 4442 9 kg ha 1 grain yield that is 98 5 of control treatment the mean comparison shows statistically no difference between ibs50 and ims50 treatments also a minimum of 1 5 and a maximum 17 grain yield loss were recorded at grain maturity and tillering stages of the wheat crop respectively however overall grain yield was 2 higher in 2018 2019 due to favorable climatic conditions application of deficit irrigation during different growth stages may decrease tiller number that effect the number and weight of grains per spike ultimately produce low yields the decline in yield at initial growth stages of root initiation and tillering may be attributed to less moisture available in the upper effective root zone these results are in agreement with that of previous studies ali et al 2007 wajid et al 2002 who concluded that the highest wheat yield was attained with no or very less deficit irrigation treatments some earlier studies also showed that reducing irrigation at the critical growth stages produced a significant decline in wheat grain yield fahad et al 2019 hao et al 2014 hussain and mumtaz 2014 maqbool et al 2015 sarkar et al 2013 tari 2016 3 8 water use efficiency wue the ratio of grain yield to the water used by crop throughout its growth period is known as water use efficiency wue the statistical analysis illustrates that wue was significantly p 0 05 effected under all deficit irrigation treatments as presented in fig 7 the results indicate that the mean values over the two growing seasons 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 fluctuate in the range of 0 91 to 1 08 kg m 3 however the water use efficiency was almost similar in treatments ick100 and igms50 whereas the treatments ibs50 ihs50 and ims50 were statistically same the irrigation treatments its50 and icrs50 recorded 15 7 and 13 less water use efficiency respectively and were significantly different from ick100 and igms50 a strong positive correlation was found between the water use efficiency data of both the growing seasons the deficit irrigation treatments igms50 represent the higher values of wue with compare to the other deficit irrigation treatments these results are in agreement with those of singh and malik 1983 thamer et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 who reported a significant increase in wue by applying less amount of water to winter wheat consecutively the average maximum 1 098 kg m 3 wue values were observed in the grain maturity stage which is a little bit higher compared to control ick100 followed by 1 043 and 1 035 kg m 3 at the booting stage and milky stage respectively meena et al 2019 also concluded that irrigated water reduction up to fifty percent level applied at all the sensitive growth stages of wheat recorded maximum water use efficiency 4 conclusion the deficit irrigation is an advanced approach and optimized tool for irrigation management in which water is applied during the crucial growth stages of a crop it requires more control over the amount and timing of water application than full irrigation practice the deficit irrigation with water reduction of 50 of full irrigation was applied at various sensitive growth stages of wheat revealed the significant reduction in grain yield above ground biomass and yield components as compared with full irrigation practice the results affirmed that the water deficit at the grain maturity stage 105 126 days after sowing enhanced the irrigation water use efficiency with the least yield penalty therefore it can be implemented as a more efficient water saving strategy in this region and also other areas of depleting water resources furthermore the tillering growth stage 22 42 days after sowing is recognized as the most vulnerable sensitive and critical phase of the wheat crop to water stress for attaining higher production and water use efficiency in the light of the results of this research it is recommended that water deficiency should be avoided at least at this tillering growth stage of wheat crop under the semi arid climatic conditions in sindh and the reagions facing water shortage declaration of competing
