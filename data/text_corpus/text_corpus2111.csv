10555,since soil water depletion and salinity are major constraints for crop production rice straw mulch could be beneficial for increasing yield and water productivity due to its role in conserving soil water and decreasing soil salinity two field experiments were conducted on a saline silty clay soil to determine the effects of mulch and irrigation on the dynamics of soil water content and soil salinity and on the growth and yield of sunflower sown by strip planting in 2017 the mulching treatments were no mulch nm rice straw mulch rs and retaining 15 20 of the crop residue of the previous rice crop rr in 2018 three irrigation treatments one i1 two i2 and three irrigation events i3 and two mulching treatments nm and rs were tested in both years the average gravimetric soil water content swc was higher and topsoil salinity ec1 5 was lower under rs treatment at 0 7 and 7 15 cm depth than with the nm treatment the substantially higher solute potential of the soil solution in the surface soil with the rs treatment at 0 7 and 7 15 cm 644 and 588 kpa in 2017 and 649 and 558 kpa in 2018 than with nm treatment 925 and 728 kpa in 2017 and 801 and 641 kpa in 2018 was associated with increased grain yield 2 7 and 2 5 t ha 1 in 2017 and 2018 respectively in the second year the increasing number of irrigation events also increased yield but the effects were additive to those of mulch we conclude that the application of a rice straw mulch to the surface of saline clay soils under strip planting can increase the solute potential of the soil solution thereby improving the growth and yield of sunflower keywords soil salinity soil water content straw mulch water productivity 1 introduction soil water deficit and salinity stresses are the major limits to crop production in many parts of the world keesstra et al 2018 and hamper efforts to achieve united nations sustainable development goals particularly those related to global food security keesstra et al 2016 the ganges coastal zone consists of low lying lands in a tidal floodplain and river delta paul et al 2020 in this area the growth of dry season rabi crops is hampered by the depletion of residual soil water and increases in soil salinity both exacerbated by the late harvesting of the preceding traditional wet season rice in addition in the dry season river water is generally unsuitable for irrigation because of its high salinity ecw values of 4 20 ds m 1 however there are some canals and homestead ponds that contain non saline water which can be used as sources for irrigation mondal et al 2015b paul et al 2016 recently sunflower in the south west coastal region of bangladesh has been identified as a promising oilseed crop rashid et al 2014 it has moderate drought tolerance because of its deep branched root system rauf 2008 however delays in the sowing time and a lack of proper management of residual soil moisture and salinity has hampered sunflower production in this region appropriate agronomic management technology is therefore needed to overcome these problems and improve yields one of the strategies to overcome the above mentioned soil problems is to increase soil cover through mulching mulching has been used as an agronomic practice in many parts of the world to conserve soil moisture increase water use efficiency mitigate soil salinity and boost crop yields ji and unger 2001 zhao et al 2014 however the type of mulching materials used vary due to availability land suitability and the economic cost cerdà et al 2017 rice straw mulch is an organic biodegradable material that is suitable for use as a mulch in many climatic areas and benefits from its use have been reported kader et al 2017 in india rice straw mulch on clay loam soils reduced soil evaporation by 35 and 40 mm in high and low rainfall areas respectively and increased soil water storage in the 0 40 cm soil layer balwinder et al 2011 in terms of soil health rice straw mulch was more effective than plastic mulch as it was more easily decomposed reddy and yang 2006 straw mulch has been reported to improve soil aeration on compacted soils in the dry season increase soil organic matter increase infiltration improve soil structure atreya et al 2008 jordán et al 2010 decrease soil salinity kitou and yoshida 1994 and improve soil hydrological properties and crop yields ning and hu 1990 yang et al 2006 while the use of rice straw mulch for improving crop production has been reported elsewhere there are over 1 million hectares of clay textured saline soil in the ganges coastal zone where the effects of rice straw mulch for rabi season crop production have not been determined in previous experiments examining the effects of different tillage methods on sunflower yield paul et al 2020 found that solute potential was a better estimate of abiotic stress than either soil water content or soil salinity ec1 5 values alone it was shown that minimum tillage zero tillage and strip planting increased soil surface dryness and soil salinity thereby decreasing the solute potential of the soil solution and decreasing sunflower growth and yield in this paper we hypothesised that the application of a rice straw mulch 5 t ha 1 on the soil surface under strip planting would also maintain soil moisture and decrease soil salinity thereby increasing the solute potential of the soil solution and improving the growth and yield of sunflower 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study site field experiments were undertaken in 2017 and 2018 on a farmer s field in pankhali dacope khulna district of bangladesh 22 37 55 n and 89 30 10 e 2 3 m above sea level at this site a hot and humid summer occurs between march and june and a cooler dry winter occurs between november and february in this sub tropical monsoonal climate about 1800 mm of rain falls annually mondal et al 2015a mostly between july and october during the study the lowest daily temperatures occurred in january ranging between 8 10 c and 28 29 c and the highest daily temperatures occurred in april ranging between 19 21 c and 37 38 c total rainfall during the growing season was 173 and 66 mm in the first and second year respectively fig 1 mean pan evaporation during the season nov apr varied from 82 107 mm per month paul et al 2020 the soil texture of the site was silty clay 0 30 cm overlying clay 30 60 cm the initial soil physicochemical properties at 0 15 cm are presented in table 1 2 2 experimental design in 2017 the experiment consisted of strip planted plots with three mulching treatments no mulch nm rice straw mulch at 5 t ha 1 rs and retaining 15 20 of the residue from the previous rice crop which was less than 1 t ha 1 rr the same amount of irrigation water was applied at each time in all treatments fig 1 in 2018 the experiment had two mulching treatments nm and rs and three irrigation treatments one irrigation i1 at 28 days after sowing das two irrigations i2 at 28 and 50 das and three irrigations i3 at 28 50 and 67 das the total cumulative water supplied as rain and irrigation over each of the two growing seasons is presented in fig 1 in 2017 the experiment had a randomized complete block design with three replications and each plot was 11 4 m in size in 2018 the experiment had a split plot design with irrigation treatments in the main plots and mulch treatments in the sub plots there were three replications and each plot was 6 3 m in size sunflower seeds cv hysun 33 hybrid were sown on 8 january in both years with a plant to plant spacing of 40 cm and a row to row spacing of 60 cm the fertilizers applied were urea 200 kg ha 1 triple superphosphate 200 kg ha 1 muriate of potash 170 kg ha 1 gypsum 170 kg ha 1 zinc sulphate 10 kg ha 1 and boric acid 12 kg ha 1 in both seasons all fertilizers except 75 of the urea were applied at sowing the rest of the urea was top dressed in three splits with irrigation at 32 44 and 60 das in 2016 17 and at 28 50 and 67 das in 2017 18 rice straw mulch was applied at 5 t ha 1 at 4 das in 2017 and at 16 das in 2018 to control pests the insecticide nitro cypermethrin chlorpyriphos was sprayed three times throughout the season 2 3 sampling and measurements 2 3 1 measurement of soil water content ec1 5 and solute potential gravimetric soil water content swc was measured at 0 7 7 15 15 30 30 45 and 45 60 cm depth at 15 30 day intervals between sowing and harvest in both seasons dates indicated in fig 1 a hand held auger was used to collect soil samples from each depth and these were kept in sealed polyethene bags the wet weight of the samples was measured immediately and they were then oven dried to constant weight gravimetric soil water content swc was calculated from the difference between soil wet and dry weight the volumetric swc was calculated by multiplying the gravimetric swc by the bulk density for each respective soil layers typical swc at field capacity 0 03 mpa and permanent wilting point 1 5 mpa was determined using the pressure plate apparatus the gravimetric swc over the upper 60 cm of the soil profile ranged between 25 28 at wilting point and 35 37 at field capacity the electrical conductivities of 1 5 soil water extracts ec1 5 were measured in the same soil samples the ec1 5 was measured in 1 5 soil water suspension using a portable ec meter the solute potential sp of the soil solutions was calculated according to paul et al 2020 as 1 ψ s 22580 e c 1 5 w where ψs is the solute potential kpa ec1 5 is the electrical conductivity ds m 1 of the 1 5 soil water extract and w is the gravimetric swc 2 3 2 total water use and crop water productivity the irrigation schedule for sunflower followed bangladesh agricultural research institute guidelines mondal et al 2011 irrigation water ecw between 1 8 and 2 5 ds m 1 was applied through a plastic hose pipe from a nearby canal at initial maximum vegetative and flowering stages a usa class a pan evaporimeter was set up near the experimental plots the irrigation water requirement was calculated based on the following equation 2 e t c r o p e p k p k c where etcrop is the crop water requirement mm ep is the cumulative pan evaporation mm kp is the pan coefficient considered to be 0 7 michael 1978 and kc is the average crop factor for sunflower considered to be 0 6 allen et al 1998 total water use twu was measured by the following equation 3 t w u i p δ w r d where i is the irrigation p is the rainfall δw is the change in soil moisture between sowing and harvest r is the runoff and d is the drainage runoff was zero since plots were enclosed by a earthen bud and drainage were considered to be negligible as there was no evidence of increases in swc at 45 60 cm depth following irrigation events the water productivity wp was calculated as the grain yield divided by the total water used for the entire period and expressed as crop production per unit volume of water applied kg ha 1 mm 1 2 3 3 sunflower growth observation records were taken of sunflower seedling emergence and the times of flower bud initiation flowering and physiological maturity yield related parameters such as plant height head diameter the number of seeds per head and thousand seed weight were measured at harvest threshed seeds of sunflower were air dried and grain yield was calculated at 9 moisture content w w 2 4 statistical analysis statistical analyses were conducted using star software version 2 0 1 the effects of mulch and irrigation on grain yield and yield components were determined using one way and two way analysis of variance anova for 2017 and 2018 respectively the significance of effects of mulch and irrigation on swc ec1 5 and sp were determined using three way and four way factorial anova models that in addition to the effects of mulch in 2017 and of mulch and irrigation in 2018 also took account of soil depth and date after sowing time or soil depth and date after sowing time as repeated measures the comparison of means was tested using the least significant difference lsd at the 95 confidence level 3 results 3 1 sunflower growth and yield mulch had major effects on grain yield in both years table 2 in 2017 the rs treatment had a 0 5 0 7 t ha 1 higher yield p 0 01 than the nm and rr treatments table 2a also the 1000 seed weight and number of seeds per head were significantly higher in the rs treatment both p 0 04 than the rr and nm treatments table 2a in 2018 table 2b the rs treatment increased grain yield by 16 increased thousand seed weight by 6 and increased the number of seeds per head by 11 table 2b in 2018 there was also a strong effect of irrigation on grain yield averaged across mulch treatments the i3 treatment increased grain yields relative to the i1 treatment by 28 increased thousand seed weight by 16 and increased the number of seeds per head by 27 table 2b 3 2 impacts of swc ec1 5 and sp on yield at different times during the growing season the swc ec1 5 and sp were measured at five depths and 5 6 times during each growing season table 3 summarizes the significance of these measures as single factors in simple correlations with grain yield this table shows that sp the variable that integrated the effects of swc and ec1 5 had more significant effects on yield than swc or ec1 5 alone there were no significant effects of swc ec1 5 and sp on yield in the early growing season in either year but the significance of these impacts increased with time and were greater in the shallow than the deeper soil table 3a and 3b in 2017 the most significant impacts of swc ec1 5 and sp on yield were at 99 das at 0 30 cm depth table 3a in 2018 the most significant impacts were at 75 das at bud formation and flowering and the effects especially on swc and sp were evident at a greater range of depths table 3b fig 2 shows x y plots of the most significant relationships those between sp and yield at 99 and 75 das for 2017 and 2018 respectively the best linear regression between sunflower yield and sp accounted for 97 of the variation in 2017 and 82 of the variation in 2018 respectively fig 2a and c by contrast the best relationship between swc or ec1 5 and grain yield only accounted for 87 91 in 2017 and 65 89 of the variation in 2018 table 3a and b 3 3 variation in solute potential sp changes in sp with time and soil depth are summarized in fig 3 in 2017 sp was significantly affected by the interaction between mulch and time fig 3a and mulch and depth fig 3b compared to the sowing time sp was more negative at flowering under the nm 600 to 830 kpa than the rr 581 to 692 kpa and rs 590 to 777 kpa treatments from sowing to harvest the sp became more negative at 0 7 and 7 15 cm than at lower depths to 60 cm fig 3b in 2018 sp was significantly affected by the interaction between mulch and time fig 3c mulch and depth fig 3d irrigation and time fig 3e and irrigation and depth fig 3f during the growing season the rs treatment had a higher sp than the nm treatment fig 3c and the difference was highest at flowering 25 march when sp was 914 kpa and 1118 kpa for rs and nm treatments while mulch altered the sp at all depths until 60 cm fig 3d until 50 das irrigation treatments had little effect on sp fig 3e at flowering 25 mar the sp was lower with less irrigation i1 and i2 treatments 1167 and 990 kpa than with the i3 treatments 896 kpa fig 3e with all irrigation treatments the sp was lower at 0 7 cm depth than at greater depths fig 3f but increasing irrigation water i3 increased the sp at 0 7 cm depth relative to supplying less irrigation i1 and i2 3 4 variation in soil water content swc the effects of mulch and irrigation on swc and their interaction with time and soil depth are presented in fig 4 in 2017 during the early growing season 35 days after sowing there was little variation in swc between mulch treatments as light irrigation water was applied on 21 january 29 january and 7 february the swc thereafter significantly decreased until harvest except on 2 april at flowering when there was an increase in swc because of the 109 mm of rain that fell in march fig 4a from early vegetative growth 12 feb to maturity 14 apr the rs treatment had significantly p 0 05 higher swc than the nm and rr treatments fig 4a among the mulch treatments the greatest difference in swc was at 0 15 cm where the rs treatment had a 3 4 and 2 3 w w higher swc than the nm and rr treatments at 0 7 and 7 15 cm depth respectively fig 4b in 2018 throughout the growing season swc decreased gradually at all depths down to 60 cm but the surface soil at 0 7 cm and 7 15 cm dried faster than the soil at the lowest depth 45 60 cm fig 4c and d the average swc was about 4 w w and 2 5 higher with rs treatment at 0 7 and 7 15 cm respectively than with the nm treatment among the irrigation treatments the difference of swc was more pronounced after second and third irrigations at 50 and 67 das respectively fig 4e when swc was significantly higher with the i3 three irrigations treatment compared to the i1 and i2 treatments in all irrigation treatments the upper soil at 0 7 and 7 15 cm depth had a lower swc than at 45 60 cm fig 4f 3 5 variation in soil salinity ec1 5 the effects of mulch 2017 and mulch and irrigations 2018 on salinity and their interaction with time and soil depth are presented in fig 5 in 2017 between sowing and 35 days later 12 feb the ec1 5 decreased from 0 86 to 0 72 0 89 to 0 55 and 0 83 to 0 65 ds m 1 under the nm rs and rr treatments respectively as light irrigation water was applied on 21 january 29 january and 7 february fig 5a the ec1 5 increased slightly from mid february to the first week of march and declined afterwards because of the heavy rainfall in the second week of march fig 5a during that time ec1 5 was consistently lower with the rs treatment than with the nm and rr treatments throughout the season the most substantial changes in soil salinity were at 0 7 cm depth which was significantly higher than at depths to 60 cm fig 5b throughout the entire period in 2018 there was a significant reduction of soil salinity with the rs treatment fig 5c compared to the values at sowing time ec1 5 at flowering increased from 0 41 to 0 74 and 0 42 to 0 68 ds m 1 under nm and rs treatments after sowing the ec1 5 also gradually increased in all irrigation treatments with the progress of the dry season except at maturity when ec1 5 was slightly lower than at flowering at flowering 25 mar the i3 treatment had an ec1 5 0 68 ds m 1 that was slightly lower than with the i2 0 71 ds m 1 and i1 0 74 ds m 1 treatments fig 5e the average values of ec1 5 between sowing and harvest were consistently higher at 0 7 cm and at 45 60 cm than at 7 15 and 15 30 cm fig 5d and f 3 6 total water use and crop water productivity in 2017 the same amount of irrigation water and rain was applied to all mulch treatments and mulch treatments had no substantial difference in soil water between sowing and harvest down the soil profile to 60 cm table 4 a in 2018 the soil water depletion between sowing and harvest ranged from 51 to 61 mm at 0 60 cm depth table 4b there was no difference in soil water depletion among irrigation treatments however soil water depletion was significantly higher with the nm treatment than with the rs treatment although soil water depletion was lower in the rs treatment the total water use was higher in the nm than in the rs treatments both irrigation and mulching significantly affected the total water use during the season the total water use in the i2 and i3 treatments was significantly greater than the i1 treatment in 2017 mulch treatments had significant effects on the water productivity of grain and biomass fig 6 a and b the rs treatment had 26 32 higher grain and biomass productivity than the nm treatment in 2018 the rs treatment significantly increased grain and biomass productivity by about 16 relative to the nm treatment fig 6c and d the lowest irrigation treatment i1 had the highest water productivity for grain and biomass fig 6e and f but had a lower yield 4 discussion the calculation of sp from soil ec1 5 and water content data is a relatively simple means of integrating the variation in salinity and soil moisture in moderately salinised landscapes in a previous study planting with minimum soil disturbance on wet clay textured soils produced lower sunflower yield than planting with full tillage this result was attributed to lower sp in the upper roots zone of soils after minimum soil disturbance in this study we hypothesised correctly that in clay textured saline soil under strip planting the application of rice straw mulch at 5 t ha 1 would decrease soil surface dryness and salinity increase sp and hence improve sunflower growth and yield the improvement of sunflower growth and yield was more strongly related to higher sp than to either swc or soil ec1 5alone this discussion focuses on the impacts of mulch and irrigation as factors affecting crop yield sp swc and crop water use and productivity 4 1 mulch and irrigation effects on growth and yield in both years benefits of rs were more seeds per head greater seed weight and higher grain yield 2 7 and 2 5 t ha 1 in 2017 and 2018 than with nm treatment 2 0 and 2 1 t ha 1 in 2017 and 2018 in the second year an increasing number of irrigations to three events i3 also caused an increase in sunflower yield by 22 relative to less irrigation i1 but the effects were additive to mulching the higher yield in the rs and i3 treatments were related to higher sp from bud formation to maturity stages which positively influenced the number of seeds and seed size many studies have shown the benefits of different mulching materials on crops yield in saline environments summarized in table 5 with the rice straw mulch the average yield of sunflower in the present study was 6 12 higher than the benefit reported by bhattacharya et al 2019 and gajri et al 1997 in most of the studies higher grain yield under mulch was attributed to either increased soil moisture or reduced soil salinity however unlike in the present study none of these previous studies examined the effects of mulch on sp which is a function of both soil water and soil salinity in the present study sunflower yield was more strongly related to sp than to either soil water or ec 4 2 mulch and irrigation effects on solute potential the sp of the soil solution decreases the availability of water for uptake by plants munns 2002 rengasamy 2006 the sp is directly proportional to the salt concentration in the soil solution and inversely related to the soil water content liu and chi 2014 in our study lower soil salinity and higher soil water content under i3 and rs treatments increased sp of soil solution relative to that with nm and less irrigation i1 and i2 in 2017 the effects of sp were more prominent at vegetative and maturity stages at 0 15 cm depth r 2 0 83 and 0 72 and 0 97 and 0 92 at vegetative and maturity respectively table 3a in 2018 the low sp was more influential at flowering at depth 0 7 and 7 15 cm r 2 0 73 and 0 82 table 3b the higher sp with rs treatment in surface soil layers can be attributed to the action of rice straw mulch as a barrier for evaporative loss of water and upward movement of salts abd el mageed et al 2016 wang et al 2019 the sp of surface soils in an irrigated environment with intermittent rainfall can be expected to be highly variable as salt and water contents in the soil respond to evaporation and leaching events in the present work in the absence of rainfall for about 90 days before sowing in 2017 there was a higher ec1 5 at 0 15 cm than at 15 60 cm depth but after the establishment of the crop top soil salinity dropped below that lower in the soil profile from vegetative growth to maturity as a result of frequent irrigation at the beginning of the season and rainfall before flowering this suggests that soluble salts were leached out of the upper soil layer by contrast during sowing in 2018 soil salinity at 0 15 cm was lower than in soil at 15 60 cm depth and salinity then gradually increased in surface soil layer more than in deeper soil during the growing period the plausible reasons for this variation of the salt movement were the 59 mm rainfall that occurred before sowing and the effects of mulching and irrigation on average rs treatment reduced soil salinity 16 in the first year and 8 in the second year this confirms an earlier result for a sub temperate climate where straw mulch had a 16 lower salinity than under no mulch at 0 20 cm soil depth abd el mageed et al 2016 this lower salinity under rice straw mulch may be attributed to reduced soil water loss by evaporation from the upper layer of soil these findings are supported by others who indicated that mulching together with irrigation may achieve more efficient leaching of salt by improving infiltration increasing soil water availability and reducing salt accumulation in the surface soil bezborodov et al 2010 pang et al 2010 plaut et al 2013 4 3 effect of mulch and irrigation on swc sunflower yield is considered more sensitive to water stress at flowering than during seedling vegetative growth and bud formation unger and jones 1998 in our study the rs treatment increased the average swc by 3 17 at 0 60 cm soil depth throughout the crop duration the previous study has also shown that under dryland conditions straw mulch enhanced the swc by around 13 22 in the 0 20 cm soil layer compared with a no mulch control peng et al 2015 in 2017 the increase in swc was more prominent from bud formation to maturity at 0 7 cm depth when the swc with rs treatment 23 26 w w was associated with wilting point 25 28 w w but the swc with the nm and rr treatments 17 20 were actually lower than the wilting point in 2018 the swc at flowering was lower than wilting point at 0 15 cm in nm 12 13 and rs 14 16 treatments among the mulch treatments the higher soil water with rs treatment can be attributed to greater soil water storage after irrigation as straw mulch reduced soil water evaporation balwinder et al 2011 the survival of plants in which the surface soil had a swc below wilting point requires an explanation although swc of the surface soil was much lower than the wilting point for all treatments there were higher swcs at depths between 15 and 60 cm which indicates that sunflower could have extracted water from 15 60 cm depth to avoid severe water stress because of its deep rooting systems in another study plc paul unpublished data we excavated sunflower roots to 80 cm depth on the same soil at flowering supporting the notion that sunflower growth late in the season accessed available soil water below 15 cm depth cox and jolliff 1986 has also noted that sunflower have deep rooting systems which extracted soil water to 1 8 m depth which allowed the crops to avoid prolonged water stress during the reproductive stage 4 4 mulch implications for crop yield and water use in the salt affected ganges delta fresh irrigation water for dry season crops is very limited efficient water use is therefore critical to achieving satisfactory yield in our study rs mulch minimized the total water use and increased the wp which was attributed to reducing soil evaporation as well as the increase in crop yield c f abd el mageed et al 2016 zhang et al 1999 in 2018 the maximum yield in no mulch clay soil was 2 1 t ha 1 after three irrigation events total 132 mm but with mulch added two irrigations 79 mm produced the same yield 2 2 t ha 1 while saving 53 mm of irrigation water this result shows that in the water scarce coastal ganges delta the application of mulch can decrease irrigation water requirements while still producing a profitable yield of sunflower 5 conclusions in clay textured soil in the saline coastal zone of the ganges delta rice straw mulch at 5 t ha 1 significantly improved plant growth and yield the effect of rice straw mulch was due to an increased sp of soil solutions in the upper root zone caused by the combined effect of increased soil water content and reduced soil salinity at 0 15 cm depth seed yield was more strongly correlated with sp than either ec1 5 or swc reflecting the fact that sp captures variation in both these other parameters yield gains from three irrigation events compared to one irrigation event can also be attributed to higher sp the combined results over two years on clay textured soils suggest that soil management treatments are effective when they increase sp in the upper root zone this can be achieved with the application of rice straw mulch

swc was higher and topsoil salinity ec1 5 was lower under rs treatment at 0 7 and 7 15 cm depth than with the nm treatment the substantially higher solute potential of the soil solution in the surface

increased grain yield 2 7 and 2 5 t ha 1 in 2017 and 2018 respectively in the second year the increasing number of irrigation events also increased yield but the effects were additive to those of

organic matter increase infiltration improve soil structure atreya et al 2008 jordán et al 2010 decrease soil salinity kitou and yoshida 1994 and improve soil hydrological properties and crop yields ning and hu 1990 yang et al 2006 while the use of rice straw mulch for improving crop production has been reported elsewhere there are over 1 million hectares of clay textured saline soil in the ganges coastal zone where the effects of rice straw mulch for rabi season crop production have not been determined in previous experiments examining the effects of different tillage methods on sunflower yield paul et al 2020 found that solute potential was a better estimate of abiotic stress than either soil water content or soil salinity ec1 5 values alone it was shown that minimum tillage zero tillage and strip planting increased soil surface dryness and soil salinity thereby decreasing the solute potential of the soil solution and decreasing sunflower growth and yield in this paper we hypothesised that the application of a rice straw mulch 5 t ha 1 on the soil surface under strip planting would also maintain soil moisture and decrease soil salinity thereby increasing the solute potential of the soil solution and improving the growth and yield of sunflower 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study site field experiments were undertaken in 2017 and 2018 on a farmer s field in pankhali dacope khulna district of bangladesh 22 37 55 n and 89 30 10 e 2 3 m above sea level at this site a hot and humid summer occurs between march and june and a cooler dry winter occurs between november and february in this sub tropical monsoonal climate about 1800 mm of rain falls annually mondal et al 2015a mostly between july and october during the study the lowest daily temperatures occurred in january ranging between 8 10 c and 28 29 c and the highest daily temperatures occurred in april ranging between 19 21 c and 37 38 c total rainfall during the growing season was 173 and 66 mm in the first and second year respectively fig 1 mean pan evaporation during the season nov apr varied from 82 107 mm per month paul et al 2020 the soil texture of the site was silty clay 0 30 cm overlying clay 30 60 cm the initial soil physicochemical properties at 0 15 cm are presented in table 1 2 2 experimental design in 2017 the experiment consisted of strip planted plots with three mulching treatments no mulch nm rice straw mulch at 5 t ha 1 rs and retaining 15 20 of the residue from the previous rice crop which was less than 1 t ha 1 rr the same amount of irrigation water was applied at each time in all treatments fig 1 in 2018 the experiment had two mulching treatments nm and rs and three irrigation treatments one irrigation i1 at 28 days after sowing das two irrigations i2 at 28 and 50 das and three irrigations i3 at 28 50 and 67 das the total cumulative water supplied as rain and irrigation over each of the two growing seasons is presented in fig 1 in 2017 the experiment had a randomized complete block design with three replications and each plot was 11 4 m in size in 2018 the experiment had a split plot design with irrigation treatments in the main plots and mulch treatments in the sub plots there were three replications and each plot was 6 3 m in size sunflower seeds cv hysun 33 hybrid were sown on 8 january in both years with a plant to plant spacing of 40 cm and a row to row spacing of 60 cm the fertilizers applied were urea 200 kg ha 1 triple superphosphate 200 kg ha 1 muriate of potash 170 kg ha 1 gypsum 170 kg ha 1 zinc sulphate 10 kg ha 1 and boric acid 12 kg ha 1 in both seasons all fertilizers except 75 of the urea were applied at sowing the rest of the urea was top dressed in three splits with irrigation at 32 44 and 60 das in 2016 17 and at 28 50 and 67 das in 2017 18 rice straw mulch was applied at 5 t ha 1 at 4 das in 2017 and at 16 das in 2018 to control pests the insecticide nitro cypermethrin chlorpyriphos was sprayed three times throughout the season 2 3 sampling and measurements 2 3 1 measurement of soil water content ec1 5 and solute potential gravimetric soil water content swc was measured at 0 7 7 15 15 30 30 45 and 45 60 cm depth at 15 30 day intervals between sowing and harvest in both seasons dates indicated in fig 1 a hand held auger was used to collect soil samples from each depth and these were kept in sealed polyethene bags the wet weight of the samples was measured immediately and they were then oven dried to constant weight gravimetric soil water content swc was calculated from the difference between soil wet and dry weight the volumetric swc was calculated by multiplying the gravimetric swc by the bulk density for each respective soil layers typical swc at field capacity 0 03 mpa and permanent wilting point 1 5 mpa was determined using the pressure plate apparatus the gravimetric swc over the upper 60 cm of the soil profile ranged between 25 28 at wilting point and 35 37 at field capacity the electrical conductivities of 1 5 soil water extracts ec1 5 were measured in the same soil samples the ec1 5 was measured in 1 5 soil water suspension using a portable ec meter the solute potential sp of the soil solutions was calculated according to paul et al 2020 as 1 ψ s 22580 e c 1 5 w where ψs is the solute potential kpa ec1 5 is the electrical conductivity ds m 1 of the 1 5 soil water extract and w is the gravimetric swc 2 3 2 total water use and crop water productivity the irrigation schedule for sunflower followed bangladesh agricultural research institute guidelines mondal et al 2011 irrigation water ecw between 1 8 and 2 5 ds m 1 was applied through a plastic hose pipe from a nearby canal at initial maximum vegetative and flowering stages a usa class a pan evaporimeter was set up near the experimental plots the irrigation water requirement was calculated based on the following equation 2 e t c r o p e p k p k c where etcrop is the crop water requirement mm ep is the cumulative pan evaporation mm kp is the pan coefficient considered to be 0 7 michael 1978 and kc is the average crop factor for sunflower considered to be 0 6 allen et al 1998 total water use twu was measured by the following equation 3 t w u i p δ w r d where i is the irrigation p is the rainfall δw is the change in soil moisture between sowing and harvest r is the runoff and d is the drainage runoff was zero since plots were enclosed by a earthen bud and drainage were considered to be negligible as there was no evidence of increases in swc at 45 60 cm depth following irrigation events the water productivity wp was calculated as the grain yield divided by the total water used for the entire period and expressed as crop production per unit volume of water applied kg ha 1 mm 1 2 3 3 sunflower growth observation records were taken of sunflower seedling emergence and the times of flower bud initiation flowering and physiological maturity yield related parameters such as plant height head diameter the number of seeds per head and thousand seed weight were measured at harvest threshed seeds of sunflower were air dried and grain yield was calculated at 9 moisture content w w 2 4 statistical analysis statistical analyses were conducted using star software version 2 0 1 the effects of mulch and irrigation on grain yield and yield components were determined using one way and two way analysis of variance anova for 2017 and 2018 respectively the significance of effects of mulch and irrigation on swc ec1 5 and sp were determined using three way and four way factorial anova models that in addition to the effects of mulch in 2017 and of mulch and irrigation in 2018 also took account of soil depth and date after sowing time or soil depth and date after sowing time as repeated measures the comparison of means was tested using the least significant difference lsd at the 95 confidence level 3 results 3 1 sunflower growth and yield mulch had major effects on grain yield in both years table 2 in 2017 the rs treatment had a 0 5 0 7 t ha 1 higher yield p 0 01 than the nm and rr treatments table 2a also the 1000 seed weight and number of seeds per head were significantly higher in the rs treatment both p 0 04 than the rr and nm treatments table 2a in 2018 table 2b the rs treatment increased grain yield by 16 increased thousand seed weight by 6 and increased the number of seeds per head by 11 table 2b in 2018 there was also a strong effect of irrigation on grain yield averaged across mulch treatments the i3 treatment increased grain yields relative to the i1 treatment by 28 increased thousand seed weight by 16 and increased the number of seeds per head by 27 table 2b 3 2 impacts of swc ec1 5 and sp on yield at different times during the growing season the swc ec1 5 and sp were measured at five depths and 5 6 times during each growing season table 3 summarizes the significance of these measures as single factors in simple correlations with grain yield this table shows that sp the variable that integrated the effects of swc and ec1 5 had more significant effects on yield than swc or ec1 5 alone there were no significant effects of swc ec1 5 and sp on yield in the early growing season in either year but the significance of these impacts increased with time and were greater in the shallow than the deeper soil table 3a and 3b in 2017 the most significant impacts of swc ec1 5 and sp on yield were at 99 das at 0 30 cm depth table 3a in 2018 the most significant impacts were at 75 das at bud formation and flowering and the effects especially on swc and sp were evident at a greater range of depths table 3b fig 2 shows x y plots of the most significant relationships those between sp and yield at 99 and 75 das for 2017 and 2018 respectively the best linear regression between sunflower yield and sp accounted for 97 of the variation in 2017 and 82 of the variation in 2018 respectively fig 2a and c by contrast the best relationship between swc or ec1 5 and grain yield only accounted for 87 91 in 2017 and 65 89 of the variation in 2018 table 3a and b 3 3 variation in solute potential sp changes in sp with time and soil depth are summarized in fig 3 in 2017 sp was significantly affected by the interaction between mulch and time fig 3a and mulch and depth fig 3b compared to the sowing time sp was more negative at flowering under the nm 600 to 830 kpa than the rr 581 to 692 kpa and rs 590 to 777 kpa treatments from sowing to harvest the sp became more negative at 0 7 and 7 15 cm than at lower depths to 60 cm fig 3b in 2018 sp was significantly affected by the interaction between mulch and time fig 3c mulch and depth fig 3d irrigation and time fig 3e and irrigation and depth fig 3f during the growing season the rs treatment had a higher sp than the nm treatment fig 3c and the difference was highest at flowering 25 march when sp was 914 kpa and 1118 kpa for rs and nm treatments while mulch altered the sp at all depths until 60 cm fig 3d until 50 das irrigation treatments had little effect on sp fig 3e at flowering 25 mar the sp was lower with less irrigation i1 and i2 treatments 1167 and 990 kpa than with the i3 treatments 896 kpa fig 3e with all irrigation treatments the sp was lower at 0 7 cm depth than at greater depths fig 3f but increasing irrigation water i3 increased the sp at 0 7 cm depth relative to supplying less irrigation i1 and i2 3 4 variation in soil water content swc the effects of mulch and irrigation on swc and their interaction with time and soil depth are presented in fig 4 in 2017 during the early growing season 35 days after sowing there was little variation in swc between mulch treatments as light irrigation water was applied on 21 january 29 january and 7 february the swc thereafter significantly decreased until harvest except on 2 april at flowering when there was an increase in swc because of the 109 mm of rain that fell in march fig 4a from early vegetative growth 12 feb to maturity 14 apr the rs treatment had significantly p 0 05 higher swc than the nm and rr treatments fig 4a among the mulch treatments the greatest difference in swc was at 0 15 cm where the rs treatment had a 3 4 and 2 3 w w higher swc than the nm and rr treatments at 0 7 and 7 15 cm depth respectively fig 4b in 2018 throughout the growing season swc decreased gradually at all depths down to 60 cm but the surface soil at 0 7 cm and 7 15 cm dried faster than the soil at the lowest depth 45 60 cm fig 4c and d the average swc was about 4 w w and 2 5 higher with rs treatment at 0 7 and 7 15 cm respectively than with the nm treatment among the irrigation treatments the difference of swc was more pronounced after second and third irrigations at 50 and 67 das respectively fig 4e when swc was significantly higher with the i3 three irrigations treatment compared to the i1 and i2 treatments in all irrigation treatments the upper soil at 0 7 and 7 15 cm depth had a lower swc than at 45 60 cm fig 4f 3 5 variation in soil salinity ec1 5 the effects of mulch 2017 and mulch and irrigations 2018 on salinity and their interaction with time and soil depth are presented in fig 5 in 2017 between sowing and 35 days later 12 feb the ec1 5 decreased from 0 86 to 0 72 0 89 to 0 55 and 0 83 to 0 65 ds m 1 under the nm rs and rr treatments respectively as light irrigation water was applied on 21 january 29 january and 7 february fig 5a the ec1 5 increased slightly from mid february to the first week of march and declined afterwards because of the heavy rainfall in the second week of march fig 5a during that time ec1 5 was consistently lower with the rs treatment than with the nm and rr treatments throughout the season the most substantial changes in soil salinity were at 0 7 cm depth which was significantly higher than at depths to 60 cm fig 5b throughout the entire period in 2018 there was a significant reduction of soil salinity with the rs treatment fig 5c compared to the values at sowing time ec1 5 at flowering increased from 0 41 to 0 74 and 0 42 to 0 68 ds m 1 under nm and rs treatments after sowing the ec1 5 also gradually increased in all irrigation treatments with the progress of the dry season except at maturity when ec1 5 was slightly lower than at flowering at flowering 25 mar the i3 treatment had an ec1 5 0 68 ds m 1 that was slightly lower than with the i2 0 71 ds m 1 and i1 0 74 ds m 1 treatments fig 5e the average values of ec1 5 between sowing and harvest were consistently higher at 0 7 cm and at 45 60 cm than at 7 15 and 15 30 cm fig 5d and f 3 6 total water use and crop water productivity in 2017 the same amount of irrigation water and rain was applied to all mulch treatments and mulch treatments had no substantial difference in soil water between sowing and harvest down the soil profile to 60 cm table 4 a in 2018 the soil water depletion between sowing and harvest ranged from 51 to 61 mm at 0 60 cm depth table 4b there was no difference in soil water depletion among irrigation treatments however soil water depletion was significantly higher with the nm treatment than with the rs treatment although soil water depletion was lower in the rs treatment the total water use was higher in the nm than in the rs treatments both irrigation and mulching significantly affected the total water use during the season the total water use in the i2 and i3 treatments was significantly greater than the i1 treatment in 2017 mulch treatments had significant effects on the water productivity of grain and biomass fig 6 a and b the rs treatment had 26 32 higher grain and biomass productivity than the nm treatment in 2018 the rs treatment significantly increased grain and biomass productivity by about 16 relative to the nm treatment fig 6c and d the lowest irrigation treatment i1 had the highest water productivity for grain and biomass fig 6e and f but had a lower yield 4 discussion the calculation of sp from soil ec1 5 and water content data is a relatively simple means of integrating the variation in salinity and soil moisture in moderately salinised landscapes in a previous study planting with minimum soil disturbance on wet clay textured soils produced lower sunflower yield than planting with full tillage this result was attributed to lower sp in the upper roots zone of soils after minimum soil disturbance in this study we hypothesised correctly that in clay textured saline soil under strip planting the application of rice straw mulch at 5 t ha 1 would decrease soil surface dryness and salinity increase sp and hence improve sunflower growth and yield the improvement of sunflower growth and yield was more strongly related to higher sp than to either swc or soil ec1 5alone this discussion focuses on the impacts of mulch and irrigation as factors affecting crop yield sp swc and crop water use and productivity 4 1 mulch and irrigation effects on growth and yield in both years benefits of rs were more seeds per head greater seed weight and higher grain yield 2 7 and 2 5 t ha 1 in 2017 and 2018 than with nm treatment 2 0 and 2 1 t ha 1 in 2017 and 2018 in the second year an increasing number of irrigations to three events i3 also caused an increase in sunflower yield by 22 relative to less irrigation i1 but the effects were additive to mulching the higher yield in the rs and i3 treatments were related to higher sp from bud formation to maturity stages which positively influenced the number of seeds and seed size many studies have shown the benefits of different mulching materials on crops yield in saline environments summarized in table 5 with the rice straw mulch the average yield of sunflower in the present study was 6 12 higher than the benefit reported by bhattacharya et al 2019 and gajri et al 1997 in most of the studies higher grain yield under mulch was attributed to either increased soil moisture or reduced soil salinity however unlike in the present study none of these previous studies examined the effects of mulch on sp which is a function of both soil water and soil salinity in the present study sunflower yield was more strongly related to sp than to either soil water or ec 4 2 mulch and irrigation effects on solute potential the sp of the soil solution decreases the availability of water for uptake by plants munns 2002 rengasamy 2006 the sp is directly proportional to the salt concentration in the soil solution and inversely related to the soil water content liu and chi 2014 in our study lower soil salinity and higher soil water content under i3 and rs treatments increased sp of soil solution relative to that with nm and less irrigation i1 and i2 in 2017 the effects of sp were more prominent at vegetative and maturity stages at 0 15 cm depth r 2 0 83 and 0 72 and 0 97 and 0 92 at vegetative and maturity respectively table 3a in 2018 the low sp was more influential at flowering at depth 0 7 and 7 15 cm r 2 0 73 and 0 82 table 3b the higher sp with rs treatment in surface soil layers can be attributed to the action of rice straw mulch as a barrier for evaporative loss of water and upward movement of salts abd el mageed et al 2016 wang et al 2019 the sp of surface soils in an irrigated environment with intermittent rainfall can be expected to be highly variable as salt and water contents in the soil respond to evaporation and leaching events in the present work in the absence of rainfall for about 90 days before sowing in 2017 there was a higher ec1 5 at 0 15 cm than at 15 60 cm depth but after the establishment of the crop top soil salinity dropped below that lower in the soil profile from vegetative growth to maturity as a result of frequent irrigation at the beginning of the season and rainfall before flowering this suggests that soluble salts were leached out of the upper soil layer by contrast during sowing in 2018 soil salinity at 0 15 cm was lower than in soil at 15 60 cm depth and salinity then gradually increased in surface soil layer more than in deeper soil during the growing period the plausible reasons for this variation of the salt movement were the 59 mm rainfall that occurred before sowing and the effects of mulching and irrigation on average rs treatment reduced soil salinity 16 in the first year and 8 in the second year this confirms an earlier result for a sub temperate climate where straw mulch had a 16 lower salinity than under no mulch at 0 20 cm soil depth abd el mageed et al 2016 this lower salinity under rice straw mulch may be attributed to reduced soil water loss by evaporation from the upper layer of soil these findings are supported by others who indicated that mulching together with irrigation may achieve more efficient leaching of salt by improving infiltration increasing soil water availability and reducing salt accumulation in the surface soil bezborodov et al 2010 pang et al 2010 plaut et al 2013 4 3 effect of mulch and irrigation on swc sunflower yield is considered more sensitive to water stress at flowering than during seedling vegetative growth and bud formation unger and jones 1998 in our study the rs treatment increased the average swc by 3 17 at 0 60 cm soil depth throughout the crop duration the previous study has also shown that under dryland conditions straw mulch enhanced the swc by around 13 22 in the 0 20 cm soil layer compared with a no mulch control peng et al 2015 in 2017 the increase in swc was more prominent from bud formation to maturity at 0 7 cm depth when the swc with rs treatment 23 26 w w was associated with wilting point 25 28 w w but the swc with the nm and rr treatments 17 20 were actually lower than the wilting point in 2018 the swc at flowering was lower than wilting point at 0 15 cm in nm 12 13 and rs 14 16 treatments among the mulch treatments the higher soil water with rs treatment can be attributed to greater soil water storage after irrigation as straw mulch reduced soil water evaporation balwinder et al 2011 the survival of plants in which the surface soil had a swc below wilting point requires an explanation although swc of the surface soil was much lower than the wilting point for all treatments there were higher swcs at depths between 15 and 60 cm which indicates that sunflower could have extracted water from 15 60 cm depth to avoid severe water stress because of its deep rooting systems in another study plc paul unpublished data we excavated sunflower roots to 80 cm depth on the same soil at flowering supporting the notion that sunflower growth late in the season accessed available soil water below 15 cm depth cox and jolliff 1986 has also noted that sunflower have deep rooting systems which extracted soil water to 1 8 m depth which allowed the crops to avoid prolonged water stress during the reproductive stage 4 4 mulch implications for crop yield and water use in the salt affected ganges delta fresh irrigation water for dry season crops is very limited efficient water use is therefore critical to achieving satisfactory yield in our study rs mulch minimized the total water use and increased the wp which was attributed to reducing soil evaporation as well as the increase in crop yield c f abd el mageed et al 2016 zhang et al 1999 in 2018 the maximum yield in no mulch clay soil was 2 1 t ha 1 after three irrigation events total 132 mm but with mulch added two irrigations 79 mm produced the same yield 2 2 t ha 1 while saving 53 mm of irrigation water this result shows that in the water scarce coastal ganges delta the application of mulch can decrease irrigation water requirements while still producing a profitable yield of sunflower 5 conclusions in clay textured soil in the saline coastal zone of the ganges delta rice straw mulch at 5 t ha 1 significantly improved plant growth and yield the effect of rice straw mulch was due to an increased sp of soil solutions in the upper root zone caused by the combined effect of increased soil water content and reduced soil salinity at 0 15 cm depth seed yield was more strongly correlated with sp than either ec1 5 or swc reflecting the fact that sp captures variation in both these other parameters yield gains from three irrigation events compared to one irrigation event can also be attributed to higher sp the combined results over two years on clay textured soils suggest that soil management treatments are effective when they increase sp in the upper root zone this can be achieved with the application of rice straw mulch

10556,rice yield responses forecast yieldcast is a very useful decision support tool in climate adaptation in sahel where crops are purely rainfed climate stressors sensitive this study aims to construct upland rice yield responses forecasting algebraic formulation code referred as yieldcast by using gene expression programming gep based on observed rainfall and temperatures data 1979 2011 and forcing with global climate model gcm downscaled outputs under co2 emission scenarios sr a1b a2 and b1 2012 2100 over bobo dioulasso a sahelian region statistically gep is a capable tool to downscale climate variables in the region r 0 746 0 949 and construct reliable rice yieldcast tool r 0 930 mse 0 037 ton ha mae 0 155 ton ha rse 0 137 ton ha yields forecasted 2012 2100 showed a noticeable statistically significant difference between scenarios however fluctuating with no substantial increase average below 1 60 ton ha suggesting that the increase observed in temperatures and decrease in rains will either reduced or hindered yield to largely increase in sahel with no such yieldcast tool to support adaptation decision sahel will still be under the trap of the broad array of adaptation strategy which is a trial and error less specific and costly the model can help anticipate adaptation decision support on farm water management shift to suitable planting periods and use of improved drought resistant and short duration varieties adapted to a local weather pattern keywords yieldcast upland rice climate change adaptation decision support sahel gene expression programming 1 introduction crop yields models are often employed to assess the impacts of climate change on farm outputs or simulate the futuristic agricultural production trends subjected to co2 emission scenarios there are several outstanding studies that have simulated crops growths by generating synthetics data to analyze the projection effects of greenhouse gases emissions on crops outputs according to ipcc ar4 report in the past decades the sahel has experienced the most substantial and sustained decline in rainfall recorded anywhere in the world hulme and kelly 1997 the report stated that the linear regression of 1901 1990 rainfall data from 24 stations in the west african sahel yields a negative slope amounting to a decline of 1 9 standard deviations in the period 1950 1985 nicholson and palao 1993 rainfall decreased substantially across the sahel from the 1950s until at least the late 1980s dai et al 2004 since 1971 the average of all stations fell below the 89 year average and showed a persistent downward trend since 1951 the region is now experiencing severe extreme drought events and slow onset change in rain traore and owiyo 2013 and the situation is worsening as the rainfall in sahel is likely expected to decrease as reported in the ipcc ar4 even though little consensus exists between climate models the region depends largely on agriculture and climate change may alter the availability of water resources ipcc 2007a which will negatively impacted crops yields upland rice cultivation is supported by a large scale development program in burkina faso the country boosted its rice sector and produced 235 810 tons of rice during the 2008 2009 campaign in 2009 2010 about 100 000 ha were cultivated and approximately 300 000 tons of rice were produced zhang et al 2019a 2019b according to oort van and zwart 2018 considering the shorter growing periods due to temperature rise the upland rice yield will decrease by 32 in the rcp8 5 scenario in 2070 compared with the baseline year 2000 in this sahelian country agriculture is not only one of the significant drivers of climate change but is also directly affected by shifting climatic conditions aurbacher et al 2013 mi et al 2019 zhang et al 2019a 2019b as it solely relies upon climate condition particularly for a semiarid environment rainfed based livelihood system so crops production trends for the future are also expected to be negative especially for the sahel region where rainfall is among the lowest furthermore overcoming the climate change negative impacts has become increasingly important for sahel because all livelihood production systems are based on rainy phase seasonality which is now capricious and agriculture has already been severely hit moreover the rainfed rice yield potential which is one of the most important staple food crops in the region has already been severely undermined and limited by both rainwater shortage and its uneven distribution over the region tactically right adaptations decision taking that focus priority on key intervention areas is a great assistance for local people to adapt and cope timely with climate stressors negative impacts there is a risk that the adaptation measures for supporting rainfed crops fail in sahel if the root cause of the crop vulnerability that involves certain powerful weather variables in crop yield setting is not taking into account during field intervention adapting to climate change requires to take the right measure and timely also for economic reasons tapping into the right adaptation option will make the investment more effective avoiding the trial and error one of the major difficulties of climate adaptation in sahel is the extrapolation of measures all azimuth which can be avoided by disposing of a decision support tool that assess production futuristic trend or impacts in order to assist on the choice of the right decision and prioritize intervention measures accordingly in such process crop yield response forecasting tool that use climate information is much needed for sahel region to build such decision forecasting support tool it requires sufficient crop yield long term observed data and local meteorological information in order to support climate adaption decision making in sahel the intend in this study is to construct yield forecasting tool based on the historical observed data which are recorded from field crop yields and also observed from a local weather station meteorological data moreover the study is intended to use global circulation model downscaled outputs to project future crop yields in burkina faso in fact there are several reported studies using linear and nonlinear soft computing methodologies for simulating crops growth and yields for the crops yield modeling there are machine codes soft computing techniques which are nowadays considered as among the most powerful nonlinear tools in past most studies used other methodologies for example shin et al 2010 deployed a dynamic crop model system to assess crop yield simulations with various seasonal climate data prasad et al 2006 employed remote sensing to crop yield estimation semenov and porter 1995 used a stochastic weather generator computer program to model yield and cantelaube and terre 2005 used an ensemble multi model approach in yield modeling in a recent past heinzow and tol 2003 and dahikar and rode 2014 used artificial neural network in crop yield prediction most of these studies have explored connections between crop yields and several other production parameters including either crop growth information soil sensing and physical properties production inputs or weather information in a data scarce environment like sahel where it is very hard to have such enormous field data the application of some of these methods will somewhat be restricted it must be remembered that many interactions between crops and weather are non linear semenov and porter 1995 and sahel has not shown an exception as it is well known that climate stressors are the main drivers of the crop yields in the conceptual basis model proposed by doorenbos and kassam 1979 crop yields are function of weather information agrawal and jain 1982 applied composite model for forecasting rice yield and laxmi and kumar 2011 used weather based forecasting model for rice yield prediction wang et al 2014 applied a statistical downscaling method and oryza2000 to forecast rice yield in china agrawal and mehta 2007 have also conducted weather based forecasting for rice yields in india this attested the feasibility of rice yield forecast based on weather information unfortunately these studies were only reported in other parts of the world and most of these models do not mathematically express the programming code in order to ease the model further deployment in real field application for adaptation purpose it was also noted that most studies used crop growths models to generate or create synthetic data in their modeling process instead of using real field long term harvested historical yield data using a generated synthetic data may often increase uncertainties in yield modeling one of the most interesting areas of future research and refinement of the crop model is in using actual observed yields either obtained by experiment stations or by best farmers for the regions and countries droogers et al 2001 however despite all these advances crops growth models that use for the most part synthetics generated or simulated data a challenge still needs to be overcame in sahel this challenge relies on deploying a new computational algebraic expression code by using field observed long term data and climate downscaled variables it is therefore very relevant to dispose of a rainfed crop yield forecasting tool in sahel using high sophisticated soft computing techniques with observed field data gene expression programming gep is one of the most powerful machine coding sources for solving nonlinear problem basically gene expression programming has demonstrated outstanding results in the subject of climate change and agriculture engineering as reported in the work of guven et al 2007 tung et al 2009 kisi and guven 2010 guven and kisi 2011 traore and guven 2011 2012 and britaldo et al 2013 although the gep has recently received a great deal of attention note that sahel is still lagging behind in finding yield related codes to its typical weather condition and the deployment of a soft computing machine code programming methodology for such work is poorly reference in literature for the region the only intent was recently made in our previous investigation that has showed the highest capability of the gep to perform rice yield modeling in other areas therefore the main objective of this study is to construct yield forecasting tool yieldcast using observed and forcing with the gcm downscaled data for supporting climate adaption decision making in sahel the model is then compared to the conventional multiple linear regression modeling function wilby et al 2004 have proven the downscaling to be very useful techniques in climate impacts studies as the techniques can produce information from coarse resolution to local finer level in this study we applied the statistical downscaling technique to bring at finer scale the global climate model gcm coarse outputs over the study area forecasting the crops yield is a fundamental decision support tool as it can provide timely key information about futuristic yield trends that may help for prioritizing interventions and also for supporting the right adaptation decision in sahel adaptation is a consequential action that can be anticipated when knowing a futuristic yield trend to reduce impact on rice yield with climate change adaptation challenges rainfall and temperatures are expected to be the most critical weather variables for driving crops yields in sahel one of the most important aspects is to assist growers planners and decision makers by supporting them to analyze yield trends timely and take the right adaptation decision for building robust resilience 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the area under investigation the study area is bobo dioulasso located latitude 11 172291 n longitude 4 302551 w at the houet province within the haut bassin region in the western burkina faso fig 1 shows the location of the bobo dioulasso region within burkina faso indeed burkina faso is well known as a sahelian country and its agriculture systems are mainly rainfed based irrigation agriculture is still at its early ramping stage in most part of the country there is an increase of a number of extremes drought events and slow onset changes in rainfall several reports and studies have directly linked these events to climate changes according to michela biasutti 2019 rainfall is more intense and intermittent and wetting is concentrated in the late rainy season in bobo dioulasso the foremost climatic features are for the one hand the low rainfall that is unevenly distributed spatially and temporally and for the other hand the high temperatures the rainy season are very short between may and september and the rainfall is dependent on the west african monsoon which varies considerably on inter annual and inter decadal timescales the average annual rainfall has declined significantly in the past fifty years cereal crops are mainly rainfed and therefore exposed to the climatic risks and the continuous degradation of the soils and environment the extremes events known in the regions are mainly drought flooding high temperature strong winds and erratic storms the large variability in rains induced direct consequences on crop production the country is highly vulnerable to weather stressors and the local rural communities have a very low adaptive capacity to face climate change impacts the soil is characterized by a flat of long geomorphological evolution the latosols and alisos soils are found in the region and they are considered to respond well to fertilization and proper crop and water management practices the soils are generally low organic matter content farmers generally apply little fertilizer to rainfed rice water resources differs from north to south but are characterized by rivers tributaries natural pools and shallows the biodiversity is composed of flora and fauna diversity including aquatic flora with woody terrestrial flora consists of trees shrubs and vines and herbaceous plants and savanna 2 2 description of the datasets employed two datasets were used in the study i the observed data and ii the global climate model outputs the observed data were composed of upland rice yields data recorded in bobo dioulasso between 1979 and 2011 and the meteorological data collected from the local weather synoptic station located in bobo dioulasso for the same record period as the yields the meteorological data include monthly rainfall maximum and minimum air temperatures the meteorological data were quality controlled with no missing data and were provided by the general direction of the meteorology which is under the auspice of the ministry of transport of burkina faso meanwhile the upland rice yields were collected from the ministry of agriculture and the national research institute for environment and agriculture inera the observed yields data and meteorological variables were used to calibrate and generate the yieldcast code table 1 gives the descriptive statistics of the observed meteorological variables and the historical yields recorded in bobo dioulasso in the study area the mean values of the maximum and minimum temperatures rainfall and upland rice yields are 33 37 c 21 90 c 991 37 mm and 1 41 ton ha respectively the monthly averages values of the rains during the cropping season are 98 mm may 128 mm june 193 mm july 267 mm august and 174 mm september meanwhile the monthly temperatures values of the cropping season are ranged between 31 c and 35 c tmax and 21 24 c tmin for the global climate model gcm the monthly data were downloaded from the ar4 intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc as 20 year and 30 year covering the same geographical coordinates as the study zone the ipcc ar4 data is well organized and readily available for statistical downscaling studies brands et al 2011 the data were referenced as ar4 2007 cgcm3t47 mean sr a1b a2 and b1 the gps coordinates of study area were used to retrieve data from the cccsn http www cccsn ec gc ca for the ar4 sr a1b b1 and a2 mean ensemble emission scenarios of all twenty four available international modeling centers with the baseline years of 1971 2100 in the ipcc fourth assessment ar4 sr a1b b1 and a2 represent the medium low and high emission scenario respectively in all models the annual co2 concentration in the a1b is estimated to reach 717 ppm by 2100 from the average value of 331 ppm in the baseline period ipcc 2007 for the b1 scenario co2 production increases until it reaches 549 ppm in the year 2100 future co2 concentrations are highest in the a2 scenario reaching 856 ppm by 2100 the gcms data retrieved were the precipitation total mm day air temperature mean max 2 m c air temperature mean min 2 m c air temperature mean 2 m c surface down welling shortwave radiation w m2 and wind speed mean 10 m m s the national centers for environmental prediction ncep has interpolated the monthly gcms model outputs to a common grid resolution at 2 5 2 5 in this study we used the gene expression programming gep model to downscale the gcms coarse outputs to finer local information for the study area in bobo dioulasso burkina faso in this process the gcms coarse data and the observed data from the study area were used as the model predictors and predictands respectively the gep was chosen because it has proven good performances in solving similar nonlinear complexes climate downscaling problems 2 3 multiple linear regression model we used the multiple linear regression to model rice yield function based on the observed data which are composed of the monthly maximum and minimum temperatures and rainfall variables the general form of the multiple linear regression equation is given as 1 y a β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 β 3 x 3 β 4 x 4 ε where y is the yield variable a is the intercept x 1 x 2 a n d x 3 stand for the rainfall maximum and minimum temperatures variables respectively β 1 β 2 and β 3 are their beta coefficients analogue to the slope of the linear equation ε is the error term 2 4 gene expression programming gep code development we employed the gene expression programming gep which is described as an evolutionary algorithm that automatically generates expression code for solving nonlinear problems the program is represented as a tree structure with terminals leaves and nodes functions through the process it allows the solution of the problems by automatically creating algorithms and expressions tree the trial programs obtained are evaluated against several fitness functions prior selected and simultaneously the program that yields the best solution is selected for modification and re evaluation and then kept if satisfactory this modification evaluation cycle is repeated until a correct program is found in ferreira 2001 more details on the gene expression mathematically programming are well provided to perform the rice yield forecast the study adopted several consecutive steps in the gep procedure to build yield code using only air temperatures and rainfall data see gep flowchart in fig 2 the model is also used in the study to downscale the climate variables from the gcms outputs over the study area in the general setting option the first step was to define the terminals conditions that include the independent variables of the problem samples size for the calibration and validation records the state variables of the system and then the functions with no arguments under simplify run option that subsequently keeps the best model option the chromosome architecture of the gep models are composed of several sub tree phenotype structures composed of the head size the number of genes and the genetic operators as shown in fig 3 for illustration the model was set with 3 5 genes 30 chromosomes evolved to 10 000 generations the second major step is to determine the genetic operators or set of functions including the e x sin x cos x atan tanh ln x log x 10 x inv x x a x 2 a x min max avg etc in the study among these genetic operators only the x a min avg ln x cos x sin x inv x tanh x and atan x were selected to be represented in the best model we also set the numerical constant per gene with a floating point between lower 10 and upper 10 bounds the genetic operators and terminal set used in this study are summarized in table 2 the third major step is the selection of certain parameters to control the runs the terminals and the functions are the components of the programs that form the junctions in the tree the expression coding requires to select only one arithmetic linking operator function i e etc between the sub tree codes as shown in fig 3 thus we set the linking function to the addition the choice of the components of the terminals and functions the program and the fitness functions establish the space that the gep searches for the control parameters contain the size of the population and the rate of crossover etc finally it is important to determine the criteria that terminate the run this is done by choosing the fitness measurement functions which identify the way of evaluating how good a given program solves a particular problem indeed we used the simplify run with an enabling simplicity increase option and the mean square error mse root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae relative squared error rse root relative squared error rrse and the coefficient of correlation r were chosen for the performance evaluation of the produced models during the calibration runs practically if the error of the model results gets reasonably close to zero and the r gets the highest value then the model is considered as acceptable we used multi genes chromosomes that contain multiple expression trees of different sizes each one of them is composed of a sub tree code which is structurally and functionally unique as shown in fig 3 they interact with one another with only one of the linking functions aforementioned to provide the final expression code as illustrated in fig 3 the arithmetic expression of the gene is read as sub et1 gene expression one gene 1 a sub et2 gene expression two genes a b c d sub et3 gene expression two genes a a b the final arithmetic expression of the individual is read as a a b c d a a b 2 5 data processing protocol in the gene expression programming environment the yield forecasting model was first calibrated using observed meteorological climate variables and historical yields recorded between 1979 and 2011 in order to construct the yield model the observed meteorological variables were used as the model inputs while the historical yields recorded data were used as the model targeted outputs the observed meteorological climatic variables were composed of the annual minimum and maximum air temperatures data the simulated yields outputs were then statistically compared against the observed yields in order to select the best model that can be deployed for further use i e to project the futuristic yields over year 2100 under the scenario sr a1b sr a2 and sr b1 mean ensemble co2 emission scenarios prior to perform the yield projection toward year 2100 the global climate model gcm outputs obtained from the ipcc ar4 were downscaled at a finer grid level over the study area the flowchart of the procedure adopted in the study with the gene expression programming to perform the yield forecast is detailed in fig 4 for the climate downscaling to the fore of executing the gene expression program the observed datasets were divided into two parts namely the calibration 1979 2009 and validation 2010 2011 sets due to the limitation of the observed data the gcms data were taken from 1979 to 2011 during the analysis which obviously falls in the recommended thirty years baseline period during the downscaling the predictors were composed of the gcms coarse outputs described in section 2 2 meanwhile the observed precipitation and minimum and maximum temperatures gathered from the study area were used as the model predictands subsequently for the projection of the weather variables between 2012 and 2100 the gene expression models were fed with the gcms coarse outputs of the same period to generate finer scale climate variables of the study area 2 6 model performances assessment the performances of the gene expression programming in upland rice yields forecasting were evaluated against the observed recorded yield values in this regard we used various statistical fitness functions for comparison during the model calibration test noted also that the statistical fitness functions were used to test the accuracies of the climate variables downscaled by the gene expression programming from the gcms coarse outputs over the study area the statistical fitness functions used herein include the mean square error mse the root mean square error rmse the mean absolute error mae the relative squared error rse the root relative squared error rrse and the correlation coefficient r the fitness function indices were very useful for guiding in the selection of the best fits model feng et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 the following equations are illustrative for the statistic fitness functions of the rmse mae rrse and the r 2 rmse i 1 n y i y i 2 n 3 mae 1 n i 1 n y i y i 4 rrse i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 5 r i 1 n y i y i y i y i i i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y i where y i represents the observed upland rice yield from field y i is the gep produced yield for the ith values y i and y i represent the average values of the corresponding variable and n represents the number of data in the sample moreover a linear regression y α x β is also applied for evaluating the model ability to exactly reproduce rice yield values where y is the dependent observed rice yield x the independent model outputs α the slope and β the regression intercept the first difference order time series data was applied to assess the independency between climate variables and upland rice yields we also employed the post hoc multiple means comparisons turkey test in anova to compare the significance difference between the three co2 emission scenarios sr a1b sr b1 and sr a2 for the projected climate and forecasted variables yield over the study area 3 results and discussion 3 1 climate accountability in rice yield function we applied the correlation analysis on the first difference time series data in order to track the independency between climate variables and rice yields to assess the effect of climate variables on crops nicholls 1997 have suggested using a common approach of the first difference of time series data for yield and climate variables the approach minimizes the influence of slowly changing factors as crop management lobell and field 2007 table 3 shows the climate variables accountability in the yield changes between 1979 and 2011 in bobo dioulasso region the results attested that upland rice yields are very sensitive to weather conditions rainfall variable was positively and significantly correlated to the rice yield implying that an increase of rains will increase yield among the historical climatic variables observed rainfall was found with the highest correlation coefficient r 0 513 p value 0 008 to rice yield in the study area this is in agreement with the findings of kima et al 2014 in three other regions of burkina faso both minimum and maximum temperatures were negatively correlated to the yield variable implying that increase of temperatures may probably decrease rice yields we employed a multiple linear regression for constructing conventionally the rice yield responses function table 4 shows the multiple linear regression model accuracies in representing rice yield responses function based on the weather variables obviously this conventional multiple linear regression poorly performed for calibrating rice yield response function to climate variables note that the yield function is a nonlinear complex process that requires a robust machine coding computation section 3 2 discusses the deployment of the gene expression programming for constructing the yield responses function in the study area 3 2 yieldcast tool in this study we used gene expression coding to construct upland rice yield response forecasting code which can be deployed as a decision support tool to help decision makers and planners for chosen the right adaptation measures adequately and timely the rice yield forecasting code derived toward the gene expression programming is referred herein as yieldcast tool the yieldcast code is weather based explanatory yield response trend model that uses only rainfall and temperatures variables to forecast yield in the study area the model was calibrated with long term observed historical data collected between 1979 and 2011 which is over the 32 year baseline period as opposed to many traditional methods that used synthetic generated data in yield modeling the use of location specific data minimizes the simulation bias niu et al 2009 the observed data was divided into two parts namely the calibration 1979 2009 and validation 2010 2011 sets for the calibration and validation of the yield modeling table 5 shows the statistical performances of the calibrated gene expression model for forecasting yields in the study area the correlation coefficient of 0 930 attested that the calibrated yieldcast derived from gep was statistically quite good the errors indices were also small for the mse 0 037 ton ha mae 0 155 ton ha and the rse 0 137 ton ha the respective root squared indices of these means errors also showed good accuracies of the rice yield forecast model developed in this study as the rmse and rrse were 0 192 and 0 370 ton ha respectively confalonieri et al 2009 found in their rice yield modeling studies a correlation coefficient greater than 0 79 fig 5 a c represents the comparative plots between the yields produced by both gep and multiple linear regression model versus the rice yields observed data in this representative figure the gene expression is referred as gepmodel for illustration convenience fig 5b shows clearly that the closest simulated yields values were obtained by the gepmodel vis à vis of the observed yields data gene expression outperformed the multiple linear regression model as shown in fig 5a b in fig 5c the regression points are less scattered for the gep and the model slope gets close to one 1 the intercept reaches almost zero with a regression coefficient of 0 85 which evidently confirmed the very good performance of the proposed yield forecast model for the study area in this sahelian region the forecasted upland rice yields regressing to the observed yields demonstrated the importance of climate variables in driving yields responses in sahel these results show that the yieldcast code developed herein is capable to reproduce the rice yields that have occurred in the past based on this good performance we fed the model with the gcms downscaled data over year 2100 the gene expression model code generated is given in fig 6 the model algebraic formulation derived from the tree expression is given by eq 6 y i e l d c a s t s u b e t 1 s u b e t 2 s u b e t 3 s u b e t 4 y i e l d c a s t 1 2 m i n tanh sin d 0 cos d 2 2 c 7 1 2 arctan 1 d 0 tan d 1 tanh c 5 c 6 sin l n tan l n d 2 tan d 2 1 2 6 sin d 1 c 8 d 2 1 3 sin tanh c 5 where do d1 and d2 represent the tmin tmax and rainfall variables respectively while c5 c6 c7 and c8 are the genes numerical constants given in appendix a in this equation rainfall was found to be the most influential weather dependent variable that has the most contribution in rice yield setting the model developed herein has the potential to increase our knowledge about the yield potential risks under weather threats it can also help in the choice of deciding the right priorities coping actions the effects of future changes in precipitation on upland rice yields are interpreted as more precipitation mean higher yield meanwhile less precipitation means lower yields crop yield trends may vary by location and under different agriculture practices it is therefore unlikely to expect that a single programming yield code to have a wide application across various regions therefore we suggest this model for upland rainfed rice and only to be applied for its originated developed area which is referred to bobo dioulasso in this study recently monteiro et al 2013 have also successfully forecasted rice yield based on weather conditions in brazil and they suggested that their model is mostly suited to estimate yield variability for rainfed crops reduced precipitation as well as increasing variability of precipitation is likely to reduce yields by assuming that with no change in current practices climate related loss and damage may result in causing severe damaging impacts on yields even in developed world according to aurbacher et al 2013 the literature shows that intra annual variability of weather interaction between crop growth and management decisions and the management actions influenced by these weather conditions have not yet been sufficiently analyzed the authors stated that this interaction however is important for explaining short term land use decisions however in the sahelian region there is not such tool therefore the yield forecasting tool proposed in this study will be extremely useful contribution accounting in climate adaptation decision taken action in the study of impact of climate change scenarios on crop yield bocchiola et al 2013 recommended weather based yield modeling as a benchmark objectively adaptation strategy for agricultural systems with an eye on least water consumption 3 3 downscaling climate variables for yields forecast prior to project the long term yields outputs we used the gene expression programming to downscale the gcms large scale outputs to a finer local climate variable over the study area the gene expression model capability to perform climate variables downscaling in this typical weather condition was assessed for bobo dioulasso at the western burkina faso specially we downscaled the monthly rainfall minimum and maximum temperatures variables under the low b1 medium a1b and high a2 co2 emissions scenarios of the ar sr means ensemble table 6 gives the comparative statistical performances between climate variables downscaled by the gep and the observed variables in the study area statistically regardless to the scenarios at the calibration the correlation coefficients values r of the downscaled monthly rainfall maximum and minimum temperatures variables were in the range of 0 868 0 888 0 894 0 914 and 0 905 0 922 respectively meanwhile at the validation stage they were 0 746 0 818 0 896 0 926 and 0 882 0 942 respectively at the calibration stage a close observation shows that the model performances for the minimum temperatures r 0 905 0 922 rmse 0 770 0 848 c mae 0 558 0 609 c were the highest compared to those of the maximum temperatures and rainfall variables under all scenarios it was also observed that the model accuracies for the maximum temperature r 0 894 0 914 rmse 1 070 1 186 c mae 0 816 0 922 c were also better than those of the rainfall r 0 868 0 888 rmse 43 702 47 359 mm mae 28 958 31 770 mm which yielded the lowest performances in both calibration and validation the performances for the rainfall variables downscaled were the lowest in this study whatever the co2 means ensemble scenarios considered at the validation stage the statistics accuracies for the minimum temperatures were the highest for ar sr b1 and ar sr a1b excepted for the ar sr a2 where the highest performance value was obtained with the maximum temperature by conducting a cross comparison assessment among scenarios we found that for the rainfall data the downscaling accuracies were similarly identical for the three scenarios at the calibration meanwhile at the validation stage by comparing the three scenarios for the rainfall we found that the highest accuracies were obtained under the ar sr a1b while the ar sr a2 produced the lowest accuracies for the maximum temperatures data the highest accuracies were obtained under the scenario ar sr a1b i e 0 914 r at the calibration and 0 949 r at the validation for the minimum temperature data at a low emission scenario ar sr b1 in the calibration stage the highest accuracy was found r 0 922 while the lowest accuracy was found r 0 905 with the highest emission scenario ar sr a2 in the same stage the overall model up down accuracy obtained during the downscaling are in the range of 67 37 75 77 for the rainfall 82 45 86 18 for the maximum temperature and 83 29 87 35 for the minimum temperature data fig 7 shows the scatter diagrams of the gene expression model produced rainfall and temperatures variables versus the observed variables under the three scenarios in the figure the gene expression model is referred as gepmodel for reading convenience only obviously the accuracies are quite good although the temperatures data produced the closest accuracies by fitting well the regression line at the 45 angle than those of the rainfall fig 7 further the overall results obtained with the gene expression programming are jugged satisfactory under all scenarios and suggested that the downscaled climate variables derived herein over the study area can be used in the rice yields long term forecasting over year 2100 3 4 rice yield long term forecast 2012 2100 we used the gcms downscaled outputs with the yield model to forecast rice yield between 2012 2100 we firstly represented in fig 8 the comparative plots of the climate variables projected under the three mean ensemble co2 emission scenarios over the study area obviously the climate variables projected herein showed clearly that the rains trends are predicted to decrease in the region under all scenarios the rains declines are more pronounced with scenarios sr a1b and sr b1 than the scenario sr a2 statistically as shown in table 7 from the post hoc multiple comparisons turkey tests in anova there is a significant difference between monthly mean rainfalls predicted under the three scenarios the highest monthly mean values were produced by the scenario a2 83 93 mm followed by the scenarios sr a1b 76 71 mm and sr b1 72 92 mm the maximum monthly values of the predicted rainfall found between 2012 2100 for the study area were 531 78 332 39 and 277 71 mm for the sr a2 sr a1b and sr b1 respectively the temperatures steadily increase under all scenarios and table 7 shows significant mean differences between all scenarios for the maximum temperature significant statistical means differences are also found between scenarios for the minimum temperature except between sr a1b and sr a2 the highest increases of both minimum and maximum temperatures were observed with the sr a2 between 2012 2100 however the highest average value of the rice yield forecasted 1 536 ton ha was also found under the same scenario when comparing to the sr b1 1 252 ton ha and sr a1b 1 214 ton ha when looking at the yields responses trends forecasts some statistical differences in trends are noticeable between scenarios there are significant statistical mean differences between scenarios for the rice yields sr a2 produced the highest average yield value according to erda et al 2005 rice yields are generally shown to increase under the a2 emissions scenario when the co2 direct effect is included in the simulation this is because the co2 fertilization effectively offsets yield decreases caused by shorter growth duration due to higher temperatures the authors stated that generally climate change itself tends to reduce crop yields but the fertilization effect of co2 tends to increase yield and this can be favored for adaptation as higher levels of co2 resulting from global human activities mean that plants absorb more co2 a process known as co2 fertilization hendrey and kimball 1994 an elevated co2 emission enhanced crop yield long et al 2006 parry et al 2004 in this study it is not surprising that under high emission scenario sr a2 yields averages values were the highest this is more likely explained by the high amount of rains obtained with sr a2 for the downscaled climate variables it was observed that under all scenarios the highest monthly rains values were occurred on the month of august with some extend either earlier on july or later on september this can indicate that even with a high amount of rains the effective rains for crops may be concentrated only in few months compromising crops yields this suggested that the cropping calendar should be considered accordingly in climate change circumstance in sahel with this regard adaptation planning can be anticipated when knowing the yield trend impact due to climate for instance shifting the cropping calendar to accommodate rainfall pattern will reduce impact on yield conversely the highest maximum forecasted yield value was obtained under the scenario sr b1 2 697 ton ha followed by the sr a1b 2 523 ton ha and sr a2 2 053 ton ha by comparing the maximum values of the observed yields 1979 2011 to these forecasted values 2012 2100 there is a decrease of 0 1 6 6 and 23 9 for the sr b1 a1b and a2 respectively meanwhile for the minimum values the highest minimum yield value found was with the sr a1b 0 592 ton ha when comparing to the sr b1 0 810 ton ha and sr a2 0 828 ton ha these results inform us that in good rainy seasons yield can substantially be increased in the region and climate adaptation axed on rainwater management can play a critical role in such move to reduce water stress in crops rainwater harvesting techniques need to be promoted nhamo et al 2014 particularly in low rainfall areas where crops are mainly rainfed the production of rice in burkina faso is being decreased due to rainwater shortage therefore it is necessary to promote supplemental irrigation for increasing and stabilizing yields dembele 1994 even though there is a statistically significant difference between these three scenarios in term of the yields forecasted table 7 the rice crop yields average values are still below the 1 60 ton ha which is very low when considering the rice yield potential in a well rainy condition overall we found the highest mean of the minimum and maximum temperatures under the sr a2 however there are also temperatures increase observed under the sr a1b and sr a2 furthermore the highest average yield value observed under the scenario sr a2 is very insignificant with regard to the rice crop yield productive potential in the region these suggested that rice yields in sahel under the climate scenarios context will be either reduced or hindered to substantially increase felkner et al 2009 found that the rice yield decreases for high and low emissions scenarios by 3 53 and 13 79 respectively change in temperature and rainfall affect crop water needed nkomozepi and chung 2012 and yield may be affected kima et al 2014 islam et al 2012 found that temperature increase is the most influential in yield decrease these findings tell us that in the sahel region climate change may rise up both minimum and maximum temperature even though the increase are more accentuated with sr a2 and sr a1b than sr b1 in either way an increase in temperatures may undermine rice yields or increase yield risk exposure to potential reduction in sahel fig 9 a b represents the projected upland rice yield trends and its cumulative values under co2 emission scenarios between 2012 and 2100 respectively it was observed that rice yield under the emission scenarios substantially fluctuate with not major increase the cumulative yields attested the low productivity of the upland rice in the sahelian region and climate change will exacerbate negative impacts with regard to the yieldcast yield trends derived in the present study the country will hardly meet its food demand and climate change threat is not arranging the current crop exposure situation we anticipate that in the country the rice yield may not increase over time unless the right decisions are taken specifically for implementing robust adaptation with close regard to rainwater effective management by 2020 in some countries yields from rain fed agriculture could be reduced by up to 50 ipcc 2007b if the right adaptation decision and measures are taken and implemented communities may likely cope with negative impacts in order to alleviate severe damages on upland rice yields even though there are climate stressors negative impacts on yields in sahel the future of crops yield productivity would also largely depend on future technological development in the region to support the adaptation measures as suggested by several studies the future climatic change is likely to shift the rainfall and temperatures patterns to the worst scenario in sahel hence by holding to this assumption rice yield will have no significant increasing in the study area unless supported by robust adaptation plan with no change in current practices in the sahel region loss and damage climate related may severely impacts yields 4 conclusion yieldcast forecasting tool was developed in this study using rice yield historical data and observed meteorological parameters of a local weather station in a sahelian region the data covered over 32 years which are good enough as suitable baseline periods the results showed that the gene expression programming is an effective modeling tool able to forecast upland rice yield in the sahel region we found that the gene expression is also good in downscaling global circulation model coarse outputs to a finer local scale over the area under study herein statistically the results showed that the developed yieldcast code is capable to reproduce the yields that have occurred in the past the projected rice yields responses trends toward year 2100 showed a noticeable statistically significant difference between climate scenarios although the rice yields substantially fluctuate with not major increase the averaged rice yields values found were very low with regard to the rice crop yield production potential in a well watering condition the findings showed that in the sahel region climate change may rise up both minimum and maximum temperatures but the increase will be much higher with scenario sr a2 than those of sr a1b than sr b1 similar results were also found with rainfall variable an increase in temperatures may undermine rice yields and meantime increase yield exposure to potential risk these suggested that rice yields in sahel under the climate change scenarios context will be either reduced or hindered to substantially increase adaptation is too broad strategy but with the yieldcast its focus may vary by extend of climate impact on yields so not having such forecasting tool sahel will still be under the trap of this broad array of adaptation strategy which is mostly trial and error less specific and costly by detecting the powerful weather variables in crop yield setting and understanding the future yield trends we found essentially important to focus the adaptation on rainwater saving and on farm water use and management for sustaining upland rice yield in sahel when right decisions are taken based on yield forecast information it can evidently help stakeholders to anticipate coping adequately with climate stressors negative impacts in sahel the yieldcast introduced herein can easily be translated into interactive webpage forcing directly by the

10556,rice yield responses forecast yieldcast is a very useful decision support tool in climate adaptation in sahel where crops are purely rainfed climate stressors sensitive this study aims to construct upland rice yield responses forecasting algebraic formulation code referred as yieldcast by using gene expression programming gep based on observed rainfall and temperatures data 1979 2011 and forcing with global climate model gcm downscaled outputs under co2 emission scenarios sr a1b a2 and b1 2012 2100 over bobo dioulasso a sahelian region statistically gep is a capable tool to downscale climate variables in the region r 0 746 0 949 and construct reliable rice yieldcast tool r 0 930 mse 0 037 ton ha mae 0 155 ton ha rse 0 137 ton ha yields forecasted 2012 2100 showed a noticeable statistically significant difference between scenarios however fluctuating with no substantial increase average below 1 60 ton ha suggesting that the increase observed in temperatures and decrease in rains will either reduced or hindered yield to largely increase in sahel with no such yieldcast tool to support adaptation decision sahel will still be under the trap of the broad array of adaptation strategy which is a trial and error less specific and costly the model can help anticipate adaptation decision support on farm water management shift to suitable planting periods and use of improved drought resistant and short duration varieties adapted to a local weather pattern keywords yieldcast upland rice climate change adaptation decision support sahel gene expression programming 1 introduction crop yields models are often employed to assess the impacts of climate change on farm outputs or simulate the futuristic agricultural production trends subjected to co2 emission scenarios there are several outstanding studies that have simulated crops growths by generating synthetics data to analyze the projection effects of greenhouse gases emissions on crops outputs according to ipcc ar4 report in the past decades the sahel has experienced the most substantial and sustained decline in rainfall recorded anywhere in the world hulme and kelly 1997 the report stated that the linear regression of 1901 1990 rainfall data from 24 stations in the west african sahel yields a negative slope amounting to a decline of 1 9 standard deviations in the period 1950 1985 nicholson and palao 1993 rainfall decreased substantially across the sahel from the 1950s until at least the late 1980s dai et al 2004 since 1971 the average of all stations fell below the 89 year average and showed a persistent downward trend since 1951 the region is now experiencing severe extreme drought events and slow onset change in rain traore and owiyo 2013 and the situation is worsening as the rainfall in sahel is likely expected to decrease as reported in the ipcc ar4 even though little consensus exists between climate models the region depends largely on agriculture and climate change may alter the availability of water resources ipcc 2007a which will negatively impacted crops yields upland rice cultivation is supported by a large scale development program in burkina faso the country boosted its rice sector and produced 235 810 tons of rice during the 2008 2009 campaign in 2009 2010 about 100 000 ha were cultivated and approximately 300 000 tons of rice were produced zhang et al 2019a 2019b according to oort van and zwart 2018 considering the shorter growing periods due to temperature rise the upland rice yield will decrease by 32 in the rcp8 5 scenario in 2070 compared with the baseline year 2000 in this sahelian country agriculture is not only one of the significant drivers of climate change but is also directly affected by shifting climatic conditions aurbacher et al 2013 mi et al 2019 zhang et al 2019a 2019b as it solely relies upon climate condition particularly for a semiarid environment rainfed based livelihood system so crops production trends for the future are also expected to be negative especially for the sahel region where rainfall is among the lowest furthermore overcoming the climate change negative impacts has become increasingly important for sahel because all livelihood production systems are based on rainy phase seasonality which is now capricious and agriculture has already been severely hit moreover the rainfed rice yield potential which is one of the most important staple food crops in the region has already been severely undermined and limited by both rainwater shortage and its uneven distribution over the region tactically right adaptations decision taking that focus priority on key intervention areas is a great assistance for local people to adapt and cope timely with climate stressors negative impacts there is a risk that the adaptation measures for supporting rainfed crops fail in sahel if the root cause of the crop vulnerability that involves certain powerful weather variables in crop yield setting is not taking into account during field intervention adapting to climate change requires to take the right measure and timely also for economic reasons tapping into the right adaptation option will make the investment more effective avoiding the trial and error one of the major difficulties of climate adaptation in sahel is the extrapolation of measures all azimuth which can be avoided by disposing of a decision support tool that assess production futuristic trend or impacts in order to assist on the choice of the right decision and prioritize intervention measures accordingly in such process crop yield response forecasting tool that use climate information is much needed for sahel region to build such decision forecasting support tool it requires sufficient crop yield long term observed data and local meteorological information in order to support climate adaption decision making in sahel the intend in this study is to construct yield forecasting tool based on the historical observed data which are recorded from field crop yields and also observed from a local weather station meteorological data moreover the study is intended to use global circulation model downscaled outputs to project future crop yields in burkina faso in fact there are several reported studies using linear and nonlinear soft computing methodologies for simulating crops growth and yields for the crops yield modeling there are machine codes soft computing techniques which are nowadays considered as among the most powerful nonlinear tools in past most studies used other methodologies for example shin et al 2010 deployed a dynamic crop model system to assess crop yield simulations with various seasonal climate data prasad et al 2006 employed remote sensing to crop yield estimation semenov and porter 1995 used a stochastic weather generator computer program to model yield and cantelaube and terre 2005 used an ensemble multi model approach in yield modeling in a recent past heinzow and tol 2003 and dahikar and rode 2014 used artificial neural network in crop yield prediction most of these studies have explored connections between crop yields and several other production parameters including either crop growth information soil sensing and physical properties production inputs or weather information in a data scarce environment like sahel where it is very hard to have such enormous field data the application of some of these methods will somewhat be restricted it must be remembered that many interactions between crops and weather are non linear semenov and porter 1995 and sahel has not shown an exception as it is well known that climate stressors are the main drivers of the crop yields in the conceptual basis model proposed by doorenbos and kassam 1979 crop yields are function of weather information agrawal and jain 1982 applied composite model for forecasting rice yield and laxmi and kumar 2011 used weather based forecasting model for rice yield prediction wang et al 2014 applied a statistical downscaling method and oryza2000 to forecast rice yield in china agrawal and mehta 2007 have also conducted weather based forecasting for rice yields in india this attested the feasibility of rice yield forecast based on weather information unfortunately these studies were only reported in other parts of the world and most of these models do not mathematically express the programming code in order to ease the model further deployment in real field application for adaptation purpose it was also noted that most studies used crop growths models to generate or create synthetic data in their modeling process instead of using real field long term harvested historical yield data using a generated synthetic data may often increase uncertainties in yield modeling one of the most interesting areas of future research and refinement of the crop model is in using actual observed yields either obtained by experiment stations or by best farmers for the regions and countries droogers et al 2001 however despite all these advances crops growth models that use for the most part synthetics generated or simulated data a challenge still needs to be overcame in sahel this challenge relies on deploying a new computational algebraic expression code by using field observed long term data and climate downscaled variables it is therefore very relevant to dispose of a rainfed crop yield forecasting tool in sahel using high sophisticated soft computing techniques with observed field data gene expression programming gep is one of the most powerful machine coding sources for solving nonlinear problem basically gene expression programming has demonstrated outstanding results in the subject of climate change and agriculture engineering as reported in the work of guven et al 2007 tung et al 2009 kisi and guven 2010 guven and kisi 2011 traore and guven 2011 2012 and britaldo et al 2013 although the gep has recently received a great deal of attention note that sahel is still lagging behind in finding yield related codes to its typical weather condition and the deployment of a soft computing machine code programming methodology for such work is poorly reference in literature for the region the only intent was recently made in our previous investigation that has showed the highest capability of the gep to perform rice yield modeling in other areas therefore the main objective of this study is to construct yield forecasting tool yieldcast using observed and forcing with the gcm downscaled data for supporting climate adaption decision making in sahel the model is then compared to the conventional multiple linear regression modeling function wilby et al 2004 have proven the downscaling to be very useful techniques in climate impacts studies as the techniques can produce information from coarse resolution to local finer level in this study we applied the statistical downscaling technique to bring at finer scale the global climate model gcm coarse outputs over the study area forecasting the crops yield is a fundamental decision support tool as it can provide timely key information about futuristic yield trends that may help for prioritizing interventions and also for supporting the right adaptation decision in sahel adaptation is a consequential action that can be anticipated when knowing a futuristic yield trend to reduce impact on rice yield with climate change adaptation challenges rainfall and temperatures are expected to be the most critical weather variables for driving crops yields in sahel one of the most important aspects is to assist growers planners and decision makers by supporting them to analyze yield trends timely and take the right adaptation decision for building robust resilience 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the area under investigation the study area is bobo dioulasso located latitude 11 172291 n longitude 4 302551 w at the houet province within the haut bassin region in the western burkina faso fig 1 shows the location of the bobo dioulasso region within burkina faso indeed burkina faso is well known as a sahelian country and its agriculture systems are mainly rainfed based irrigation agriculture is still at its early ramping stage in most part of the country there is an increase of a number of extremes drought events and slow onset changes in rainfall several reports and studies have directly linked these events to climate changes according to michela biasutti 2019 rainfall is more intense and intermittent and wetting is concentrated in the late rainy season in bobo dioulasso the foremost climatic features are for the one hand the low rainfall that is unevenly distributed spatially and temporally and for the other hand the high temperatures the rainy season are very short between may and september and the rainfall is dependent on the west african monsoon which varies considerably on inter annual and inter decadal timescales the average annual rainfall has declined significantly in the past fifty years cereal crops are mainly rainfed and therefore exposed to the climatic risks and the continuous degradation of the soils and environment the extremes events known in the regions are mainly drought flooding high temperature strong winds and erratic storms the large variability in rains induced direct consequences on crop production the country is highly vulnerable to weather stressors and the local rural communities have a very low adaptive capacity to face climate change impacts the soil is characterized by a flat of long geomorphological evolution the latosols and alisos soils are found in the region and they are considered to respond well to fertilization and proper crop and water management practices the soils are generally low organic matter content farmers generally apply little fertilizer to rainfed rice water resources differs from north to south but are characterized by rivers tributaries natural pools and shallows the biodiversity is composed of flora and fauna diversity including aquatic flora with woody terrestrial flora consists of trees shrubs and vines and herbaceous plants and savanna 2 2 description of the datasets employed two datasets were used in the study i the observed data and ii the global climate model outputs the observed data were composed of upland rice yields data recorded in bobo dioulasso between 1979 and 2011 and the meteorological data collected from the local weather synoptic station located in bobo dioulasso for the same record period as the yields the meteorological data include monthly rainfall maximum and minimum air temperatures the meteorological data were quality controlled with no missing data and were provided by the general direction of the meteorology which is under the auspice of the ministry of transport of burkina faso meanwhile the upland rice yields were collected from the ministry of agriculture and the national research institute for environment and agriculture inera the observed yields data and meteorological variables were used to calibrate and generate the yieldcast code table 1 gives the descriptive statistics of the observed meteorological variables and the historical yields recorded in bobo dioulasso in the study area the mean values of the maximum and minimum temperatures rainfall and upland rice yields are 33 37 c 21 90 c 991 37 mm and 1 41 ton ha respectively the monthly averages values of the rains during the cropping season are 98 mm may 128 mm june 193 mm july 267 mm august and 174 mm september meanwhile the monthly temperatures values of the cropping season are ranged between 31 c and 35 c tmax and 21 24 c tmin for the global climate model gcm the monthly data were downloaded from the ar4 intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc as 20 year and 30 year covering the same geographical coordinates as the study zone the ipcc ar4 data is well organized and readily available for statistical downscaling studies brands et al 2011 the data were referenced as ar4 2007 cgcm3t47 mean sr a1b a2 and b1 the gps coordinates of study area were used to retrieve data from the cccsn http www cccsn ec gc ca for the ar4 sr a1b b1 and a2 mean ensemble emission scenarios of all twenty four available international modeling centers with the baseline years of 1971 2100 in the ipcc fourth assessment ar4 sr a1b b1 and a2 represent the medium low and high emission scenario respectively in all models the annual co2 concentration in the a1b is estimated to reach 717 ppm by 2100 from the average value of 331 ppm in the baseline period ipcc 2007 for the b1 scenario co2 production increases until it reaches 549 ppm in the year 2100 future co2 concentrations are highest in the a2 scenario reaching 856 ppm by 2100 the gcms data retrieved were the precipitation total mm day air temperature mean max 2 m c air temperature mean min 2 m c air temperature mean 2 m c surface down welling shortwave radiation w m2 and wind speed mean 10 m m s the national centers for environmental prediction ncep has interpolated the monthly gcms model outputs to a common grid resolution at 2 5 2 5 in this study we used the gene expression programming gep model to downscale the gcms coarse outputs to finer local information for the study area in bobo dioulasso burkina faso in this process the gcms coarse data and the observed data from the study area were used as the model predictors and predictands respectively the gep was chosen because it has proven good performances in solving similar nonlinear complexes climate downscaling problems 2 3 multiple linear regression model we used the multiple linear regression to model rice yield function based on the observed data which are composed of the monthly maximum and minimum temperatures and rainfall variables the general form of the multiple linear regression equation is given as 1 y a β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 β 3 x 3 β 4 x 4 ε where y is the yield variable a is the intercept x 1 x 2 a n d x 3 stand for the rainfall maximum and minimum temperatures variables respectively β 1 β 2 and β 3 are their beta coefficients analogue to the slope of the linear equation ε is the error term 2 4 gene expression programming gep code development we employed the gene expression programming gep which is described as an evolutionary algorithm that automatically generates expression code for solving nonlinear problems the program is represented as a tree structure with terminals leaves and nodes functions through the process it allows the solution of the problems by automatically creating algorithms and expressions tree the trial programs obtained are evaluated against several fitness functions prior selected and simultaneously the program that yields the best solution is selected for modification and re evaluation and then kept if satisfactory this modification evaluation cycle is repeated until a correct program is found in ferreira 2001 more details on the gene expression mathematically programming are well provided to perform the rice yield forecast the study adopted several consecutive steps in the gep procedure to build yield code using only air temperatures and rainfall data see gep flowchart in fig 2 the model is also used in the study to downscale the climate variables from the gcms outputs over the study area in the general setting option the first step was to define the terminals conditions that include the independent variables of the problem samples size for the calibration and validation records the state variables of the system and then the functions with no arguments under simplify run option that subsequently keeps the best model option the chromosome architecture of the gep models are composed of several sub tree phenotype structures composed of the head size the number of genes and the genetic operators as shown in fig 3 for illustration the model was set with 3 5 genes 30 chromosomes evolved to 10 000 generations the second major step is to determine the genetic operators or set of functions including the e x sin x cos x atan tanh ln x log x 10 x inv x x a x 2 a x min max avg etc in the study among these genetic operators only the x a min avg ln x cos x sin x inv x tanh x and atan x were selected to be represented in the best model we also set the numerical constant per gene with a floating point between lower 10 and upper 10 bounds the genetic operators and terminal set used in this study are summarized in table 2 the third major step is the selection of certain parameters to control the runs the terminals and the functions are the components of the programs that form the junctions in the tree the expression coding requires to select only one arithmetic linking operator function i e etc between the sub tree codes as shown in fig 3 thus we set the linking function to the addition the choice of the components of the terminals and functions the program and the fitness functions establish the space that the gep searches for the control parameters contain the size of the population and the rate of crossover etc finally it is important to determine the criteria that terminate the run this is done by choosing the fitness measurement functions which identify the way of evaluating how good a given program solves a particular problem indeed we used the simplify run with an enabling simplicity increase option and the mean square error mse root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae relative squared error rse root relative squared error rrse and the coefficient of correlation r were chosen for the performance evaluation of the produced models during the calibration runs practically if the error of the model results gets reasonably close to zero and the r gets the highest value then the model is considered as acceptable we used multi genes chromosomes that contain multiple expression trees of different sizes each one of them is composed of a sub tree code which is structurally and functionally unique as shown in fig 3 they interact with one another with only one of the linking functions aforementioned to provide the final expression code as illustrated in fig 3 the arithmetic expression of the gene is read as sub et1 gene expression one gene 1 a sub et2 gene expression two genes a b c d sub et3 gene expression two genes a a b the final arithmetic expression of the individual is read as a a b c d a a b 2 5 data processing protocol in the gene expression programming environment the yield forecasting model was first calibrated using observed meteorological climate variables and historical yields recorded between 1979 and 2011 in order to construct the yield model the observed meteorological variables were used as the model inputs while the historical yields recorded data were used as the model targeted outputs the observed meteorological climatic variables were composed of the annual minimum and maximum air temperatures data the simulated yields outputs were then statistically compared against the observed yields in order to select the best model that can be deployed for further use i e to project the futuristic yields over year 2100 under the scenario sr a1b sr a2 and sr b1 mean ensemble co2 emission scenarios prior to perform the yield projection toward year 2100 the global climate model gcm outputs obtained from the ipcc ar4 were downscaled at a finer grid level over the study area the flowchart of the procedure adopted in the study with the gene expression programming to perform the yield forecast is detailed in fig 4 for the climate downscaling to the fore of executing the gene expression program the observed datasets were divided into two parts namely the calibration 1979 2009 and validation 2010 2011 sets due to the limitation of the observed data the gcms data were taken from 1979 to 2011 during the analysis which obviously falls in the recommended thirty years baseline period during the downscaling the predictors were composed of the gcms coarse outputs described in section 2 2 meanwhile the observed precipitation and minimum and maximum temperatures gathered from the study area were used as the model predictands subsequently for the projection of the weather variables between 2012 and 2100 the gene expression models were fed with the gcms coarse outputs of the same period to generate finer scale climate variables of the study area 2 6 model performances assessment the performances of the gene expression programming in upland rice yields forecasting were evaluated against the observed recorded yield values in this regard we used various statistical fitness functions for comparison during the model calibration test noted also that the statistical fitness functions were used to test the accuracies of the climate variables downscaled by the gene expression programming from the gcms coarse outputs over the study area the statistical fitness functions used herein include the mean square error mse the root mean square error rmse the mean absolute error mae the relative squared error rse the root relative squared error rrse and the correlation coefficient r the fitness function indices were very useful for guiding in the selection of the best fits model feng et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 the following equations are illustrative for the statistic fitness functions of the rmse mae rrse and the r 2 rmse i 1 n y i y i 2 n 3 mae 1 n i 1 n y i y i 4 rrse i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 5 r i 1 n y i y i y i y i i i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y i where y i represents the observed upland rice yield from field y i is the gep produced yield for the ith values y i and y i represent the average values of the corresponding variable and n represents the number of data in the sample moreover a linear regression y α x β is also applied for evaluating the model ability to exactly reproduce rice yield values where y is the dependent observed rice yield x the independent model outputs α the slope and β the regression intercept the first difference order time series data was applied to assess the independency between climate variables and upland rice yields we also employed the post hoc multiple means comparisons turkey test in anova to compare the significance difference between the three co2 emission scenarios sr a1b sr b1 and sr a2 for the projected climate and forecasted variables yield over the study area 3 results and discussion 3 1 climate accountability in rice yield function we applied the correlation analysis on the first difference time series data in order to track the independency between climate variables and rice yields to assess the effect of climate variables on crops nicholls 1997 have suggested using a common approach of the first difference of time series data for yield and climate variables the approach minimizes the influence of slowly changing factors as crop management lobell and field 2007 table 3 shows the climate variables accountability in the yield changes between 1979 and 2011 in bobo dioulasso region the results attested that upland rice yields are very sensitive to weather conditions rainfall variable was positively and significantly correlated to the rice yield implying that an increase of rains will increase yield among the historical climatic variables observed rainfall was found with the highest correlation coefficient r 0 513 p value 0 008 to rice yield in the study area this is in agreement with the findings of kima et al 2014 in three other regions of burkina faso both minimum and maximum temperatures were negatively correlated to the yield variable implying that increase of temperatures may probably decrease rice yields we employed a multiple linear regression for constructing conventionally the rice yield responses function table 4 shows the multiple linear regression model accuracies in representing rice yield responses function based on the weather variables obviously this conventional multiple linear regression poorly performed for calibrating rice yield response function to climate variables note that the yield function is a nonlinear complex process that requires a robust machine coding computation section 3 2 discusses the deployment of the gene expression programming for constructing the yield responses function in the study area 3 2 yieldcast tool in this study we used gene expression coding to construct upland rice yield response forecasting code which can be deployed as a decision support tool to help decision makers and planners for chosen the right adaptation measures adequately and timely the rice yield forecasting code derived toward the gene expression programming is referred herein as yieldcast tool the yieldcast code is weather based explanatory yield response trend model that uses only rainfall and temperatures variables to forecast yield in the study area the model was calibrated with long term observed historical data collected between 1979 and 2011 which is over the 32 year baseline period as opposed to many traditional methods that used synthetic generated data in yield modeling the use of location specific data minimizes the simulation bias niu et al 2009 the observed data was divided into two parts namely the calibration 1979 2009 and validation 2010 2011 sets for the calibration and validation of the yield modeling table 5 shows the statistical performances of the calibrated gene expression model for forecasting yields in the study area the correlation coefficient of 0 930 attested that the calibrated yieldcast derived from gep was statistically quite good the errors indices were also small for the mse 0 037 ton ha mae 0 155 ton ha and the rse 0 137 ton ha the respective root squared indices of these means errors also showed good accuracies of the rice yield forecast model developed in this study as the rmse and rrse were 0 192 and 0 370 ton ha respectively confalonieri et al 2009 found in their rice yield modeling studies a correlation coefficient greater than 0 79 fig 5 a c represents the comparative plots between the yields produced by both gep and multiple linear regression model versus the rice yields observed data in this representative figure the gene expression is referred as gepmodel for illustration convenience fig 5b shows clearly that the closest simulated yields values were obtained by the gepmodel vis à vis of the observed yields data gene expression outperformed the multiple linear regression model as shown in fig 5a b in fig 5c the regression points are less scattered for the gep and the model slope gets close to one 1 the intercept reaches almost zero with a regression coefficient of 0 85 which evidently confirmed the very good performance of the proposed yield forecast model for the study area in this sahelian region the forecasted upland rice yields regressing to the observed yields demonstrated the importance of climate variables in driving yields responses in sahel these results show that the yieldcast code developed herein is capable to reproduce the rice yields that have occurred in the past based on this good performance we fed the model with the gcms downscaled data over year 2100 the gene expression model code generated is given in fig 6 the model algebraic formulation derived from the tree expression is given by eq 6 y i e l d c a s t s u b e t 1 s u b e t 2 s u b e t 3 s u b e t 4 y i e l d c a s t 1 2 m i n tanh sin d 0 cos d 2 2 c 7 1 2 arctan 1 d 0 tan d 1 tanh c 5 c 6 sin l n tan l n d 2 tan d 2 1 2 6 sin d 1 c 8 d 2 1 3 sin tanh c 5 where do d1 and d2 represent the tmin tmax and rainfall variables respectively while c5 c6 c7 and c8 are the genes numerical constants given in appendix a in this equation rainfall was found to be the most influential weather dependent variable that has the most contribution in rice yield setting the model developed herein has the potential to increase our knowledge about the yield potential risks under weather threats it can also help in the choice of deciding the right priorities coping actions the effects of future changes in precipitation on upland rice yields are interpreted as more precipitation mean higher yield meanwhile less precipitation means lower yields crop yield trends may vary by location and under different agriculture practices it is therefore unlikely to expect that a single programming yield code to have a wide application across various regions therefore we suggest this model for upland rainfed rice and only to be applied for its originated developed area which is referred to bobo dioulasso in this study recently monteiro et al 2013 have also successfully forecasted rice yield based on weather conditions in brazil and they suggested that their model is mostly suited to estimate yield variability for rainfed crops reduced precipitation as well as increasing variability of precipitation is likely to reduce yields by assuming that with no change in current practices climate related loss and damage may result in causing severe damaging impacts on yields even in developed world according to aurbacher et al 2013 the literature shows that intra annual variability of weather interaction between crop growth and management decisions and the management actions influenced by these weather conditions have not yet been sufficiently analyzed the authors stated that this interaction however is important for explaining short term land use decisions however in the sahelian region there is not such tool therefore the yield forecasting tool proposed in this study will be extremely useful contribution accounting in climate adaptation decision taken action in the study of impact of climate change scenarios on crop yield bocchiola et al 2013 recommended weather based yield modeling as a benchmark objectively adaptation strategy for agricultural systems with an eye on least water consumption 3 3 downscaling climate variables for yields forecast prior to project the long term yields outputs we used the gene expression programming to downscale the gcms large scale outputs to a finer local climate variable over the study area the gene expression model capability to perform climate variables downscaling in this typical weather condition was assessed for bobo dioulasso at the western burkina faso specially we downscaled the monthly rainfall minimum and maximum temperatures variables under the low b1 medium a1b and high a2 co2 emissions scenarios of the ar sr means ensemble table 6 gives the comparative statistical performances between climate variables downscaled by the gep and the observed variables in the study area statistically regardless to the scenarios at the calibration the correlation coefficients values r of the downscaled monthly rainfall maximum and minimum temperatures variables were in the range of 0 868 0 888 0 894 0 914 and 0 905 0 922 respectively meanwhile at the validation stage they were 0 746 0 818 0 896 0 926 and 0 882 0 942 respectively at the calibration stage a close observation shows that the model performances for the minimum temperatures r 0 905 0 922 rmse 0 770 0 848 c mae 0 558 0 609 c were the highest compared to those of the maximum temperatures and rainfall variables under all scenarios it was also observed that the model accuracies for the maximum temperature r 0 894 0 914 rmse 1 070 1 186 c mae 0 816 0 922 c were also better than those of the rainfall r 0 868 0 888 rmse 43 702 47 359 mm mae 28 958 31 770 mm which yielded the lowest performances in both calibration and validation the performances for the rainfall variables downscaled were the lowest in this study whatever the co2 means ensemble scenarios considered at the validation stage the statistics accuracies for the minimum temperatures were the highest for ar sr b1 and ar sr a1b excepted for the ar sr a2 where the highest performance value was obtained with the maximum temperature by conducting a cross comparison assessment among scenarios we found that for the rainfall data the downscaling accuracies were similarly identical for the three scenarios at the calibration meanwhile at the validation stage by comparing the three scenarios for the rainfall we found that the highest accuracies were obtained under the ar sr a1b while the ar sr a2 produced the lowest accuracies for the maximum temperatures data the highest accuracies were obtained under the scenario ar sr a1b i e 0 914 r at the calibration and 0 949 r at the validation for the minimum temperature data at a low emission scenario ar sr b1 in the calibration stage the highest accuracy was found r 0 922 while the lowest accuracy was found r 0 905 with the highest emission scenario ar sr a2 in the same stage the overall model up down accuracy obtained during the downscaling are in the range of 67 37 75 77 for the rainfall 82 45 86 18 for the maximum temperature and 83 29 87 35 for the minimum temperature data fig 7 shows the scatter diagrams of the gene expression model produced rainfall and temperatures variables versus the observed variables under the three scenarios in the figure the gene expression model is referred as gepmodel for reading convenience only obviously the accuracies are quite good although the temperatures data produced the closest accuracies by fitting well the regression line at the 45 angle than those of the rainfall fig 7 further the overall results obtained with the gene expression programming are jugged satisfactory under all scenarios and suggested that the downscaled climate variables derived herein over the study area can be used in the rice yields long term forecasting over year 2100 3 4 rice yield long term forecast 2012 2100 we used the gcms downscaled outputs with the yield model to forecast rice yield between 2012 2100 we firstly represented in fig 8 the comparative plots of the climate variables projected under the three mean ensemble co2 emission scenarios over the study area obviously the climate variables projected herein showed clearly that the rains trends are predicted to decrease in the region under all scenarios the rains declines are more pronounced with scenarios sr a1b and sr b1 than the scenario sr a2 statistically as shown in table 7 from the post hoc multiple comparisons turkey tests in anova there is a significant difference between monthly mean rainfalls predicted under the three scenarios the highest monthly mean values were produced by the scenario a2 83 93 mm followed by the scenarios sr a1b 76 71 mm and sr b1 72 92 mm the maximum monthly values of the predicted rainfall found between 2012 2100 for the study area were 531 78 332 39 and 277 71 mm for the sr a2 sr a1b and sr b1 respectively the temperatures steadily increase under all scenarios and table 7 shows significant mean differences between all scenarios for the maximum temperature significant statistical means differences are also found between scenarios for the minimum temperature except between sr a1b and sr a2 the highest increases of both minimum and maximum temperatures were observed with the sr a2 between 2012 2100 however the highest average value of the rice yield forecasted 1 536 ton ha was also found under the same scenario when comparing to the sr b1 1 252 ton ha and sr a1b 1 214 ton ha when looking at the yields responses trends forecasts some statistical differences in trends are noticeable between scenarios there are significant statistical mean differences between scenarios for the rice yields sr a2 produced the highest average yield value according to erda et al 2005 rice yields are generally shown to increase under the a2 emissions scenario when the co2 direct effect is included in the simulation this is because the co2 fertilization effectively offsets yield decreases caused by shorter growth duration due to higher temperatures the authors stated that generally climate change itself tends to reduce crop yields but the fertilization effect of co2 tends to increase yield and this can be favored for adaptation as higher levels of co2 resulting from global human activities mean that plants absorb more co2 a process known as co2 fertilization hendrey and kimball 1994 an elevated co2 emission enhanced crop yield long et al 2006 parry et al 2004 in this study it is not surprising that under high emission scenario sr a2 yields averages values were the highest this is more likely explained by the high amount of rains obtained with sr a2 for the downscaled climate variables it was observed that under all scenarios the highest monthly rains values were occurred on the month of august with some extend either earlier on july or later on september this can indicate that even with a high amount of rains the effective rains for crops may be concentrated only in few months compromising crops yields this suggested that the cropping calendar should be considered accordingly in climate change circumstance in sahel with this regard adaptation planning can be anticipated when knowing the yield trend impact due to climate for instance shifting the cropping calendar to accommodate rainfall pattern will reduce impact on yield conversely the highest maximum forecasted yield value was obtained under the scenario sr b1 2 697 ton ha followed by the sr a1b 2 523 ton ha and sr a2 2 053 ton ha by comparing the maximum values of the observed yields 1979 2011 to these forecasted values 2012 2100 there is a decrease of 0 1 6 6 and 23 9 for the sr b1 a1b and a2 respectively meanwhile for the minimum values the highest minimum yield value found was with the sr a1b 0 592 ton ha when comparing to the sr b1 0 810 ton ha and sr a2 0 828 ton ha these results inform us that in good rainy seasons yield can substantially be increased in the region and climate adaptation axed on rainwater management can play a critical role in such move to reduce water stress in crops rainwater harvesting techniques need to be promoted nhamo et al 2014 particularly in low rainfall areas where crops are mainly rainfed the production of rice in burkina faso is being decreased due to rainwater shortage therefore it is necessary to promote supplemental irrigation for increasing and stabilizing yields dembele 1994 even though there is a statistically significant difference between these three scenarios in term of the yields forecasted table 7 the rice crop yields average values are still below the 1 60 ton ha which is very low when considering the rice yield potential in a well rainy condition overall we found the highest mean of the minimum and maximum temperatures under the sr a2 however there are also temperatures increase observed under the sr a1b and sr a2 furthermore the highest average yield value observed under the scenario sr a2 is very insignificant with regard to the rice crop yield productive potential in the region these suggested that rice yields in sahel under the climate scenarios context will be either reduced or hindered to substantially increase felkner et al 2009 found that the rice yield decreases for high and low emissions scenarios by 3 53 and 13 79 respectively change in temperature and rainfall affect crop water needed nkomozepi and chung 2012 and yield may be affected kima et al 2014 islam et al 2012 found that temperature increase is the most influential in yield decrease these findings tell us that in the sahel region climate change may rise up both minimum and maximum temperature even though the increase are more accentuated with sr a2 and sr a1b than sr b1 in either way an increase in temperatures may undermine rice yields or increase yield risk exposure to potential reduction in sahel fig 9 a b represents the projected upland rice yield trends and its cumulative values under co2 emission scenarios between 2012 and 2100 respectively it was observed that rice yield under the emission scenarios substantially fluctuate with not major increase the cumulative yields attested the low productivity of the upland rice in the sahelian region and climate change will exacerbate negative impacts with regard to the yieldcast yield trends derived in the present study the country will hardly meet its food demand and climate change threat is not arranging the current crop exposure situation we anticipate that in the country the rice yield may not increase over time unless the right decisions are taken specifically for implementing robust adaptation with close regard to rainwater effective management by 2020 in some countries yields from rain fed agriculture could be reduced by up to 50 ipcc 2007b if the right adaptation decision and measures are taken and implemented communities may likely cope with negative impacts in order to alleviate severe damages on upland rice yields even though there are climate stressors negative impacts on yields in sahel the future of crops yield productivity would also largely depend on future technological development in the region to support the adaptation measures as suggested by several studies the future climatic change is likely to shift the rainfall and temperatures patterns to the worst scenario in sahel hence by holding to this assumption rice yield will have no significant increasing in the study area unless supported by robust adaptation plan with no change in current practices in the sahel region loss and damage climate related may severely impacts yields 4 conclusion yieldcast forecasting tool was developed in this study using rice yield historical data and observed meteorological parameters of a local weather station in a sahelian region the data covered over 32 years which are good enough as suitable baseline periods the results showed that the gene expression programming is an effective modeling tool able to forecast upland rice yield in the sahel region we found that the gene expression is also good in downscaling global circulation model coarse outputs to a finer local scale over the area under study herein statistically the results showed that the developed yieldcast code is capable to reproduce the yields that have occurred in the past the projected rice yields responses trends toward year 2100 showed a noticeable statistically significant difference between climate scenarios although the rice yields substantially fluctuate with not major increase the averaged rice yields values found were very low with regard to the rice crop yield production potential in a well watering condition the findings showed that in the sahel region climate change may rise up both minimum and maximum temperatures but the increase will be much higher with scenario sr a2 than those of sr a1b than sr b1 similar results were also found with rainfall variable an increase in temperatures may undermine rice yields and meantime increase yield exposure to potential risk these suggested that rice yields in sahel under the climate change scenarios context will be either reduced or hindered to substantially increase adaptation is too broad strategy but with the yieldcast its focus may vary by extend of climate impact on yields so not having such forecasting tool sahel will still be under the trap of this broad array of adaptation strategy which is mostly trial and error less specific and costly by detecting the powerful weather variables in crop yield setting and understanding the future yield trends we found essentially important to focus the adaptation on rainwater saving and on farm water use and management for sustaining upland rice yield in sahel when right decisions are taken based on yield forecast information it can evidently help stakeholders to anticipate coping adequately with climate stressors negative impacts in sahel the yieldcast introduced herein can easily be translated into interactive webpage forcing directly by the

10557,groundwater over extraction is a problem facing many countries around the world water pricing and developing property rights to enable groundwater trade are potential demand based approaches to address the over extraction of groundwater resources however successful implementation of groundwater trading requires knowledge about groundwater demand and its interaction substitutability with surface water and given the paucity of empirical data on groundwater markets price elasticity of groundwater demand is rarely estimated in the literature we analysed 10 years of monthly surface and groundwater temporary market data july 2008 april 2018 within the murrumbidgee catchment of the murray darling basin australia to explore a the lead lag relationship between surface and groundwater temporary markets and b the price elasticity of groundwater market demand results illustrate that surface water markets show price leadership to groundwater temporary markets and that groundwater demand is price elastic with a 1 05 price elasticity estimate in our time period keywords murray darling basin price leadership groundwater demand elasticity groundwater markets 1 introduction water extractions have been increasing worldwide by about 1 per year and global water demand is expected to increase at a similar rate until 2050 wwap 2019 as a result over extraction of groundwater resources is a growing problem and a consequence of a common pool resource dilemma ostrom 1990 groundwater overuse represents significant costs to society it can increase withdrawal costs as water has to be pumped from a greater depth it generates cones of depression wheeler et al 2016 and can lead to surface and groundwater depletion along with significant infrastructure costs asci et al 2017 silva et al 2019 given agriculture extracts 69 of available freshwater resources in the world wwap 2019 the increased use of irrigation water pricing and property rights has been suggested as a potential mean to cope with water scarcity blanco gutiérrez et al 2011 the literature has shown that increased water prices usually through irrigation water charges can favour the adoption of water conservation technologies caswell and zilberman 1985 caswell et al 1990 and decrease irrigation groundwater use smith et al 2017 groundwater markets often emerge as formal or informal tools to put a price on water and reallocate scarce groundwater resources examples of formal groundwater markets are found in australia wheeler et al 2016 the western united states colby 2000 and china zhang and zhang 2008 while informal markets exist in countries such as india manjunatha et al 2011 and pakistan khair et al 2012 although groundwater markets remain limited in their extent they have been shown to generate significant benefits in various contexts groundwater markets can involve significant gains from trade knapp et al 2003 gao et al 2013 palazzo and brozovic 2014 even in the presence of market power bruno and sexton 2020 with participants becoming more efficient in their water extraction i e generating more outputs with the same amount of water manjunatha et al 2011 razzaq et al 2019 in india groundwater markets have allowed resource poor farmers access to irrigation water mukherji 2007 little empirical research on the demand elasticities and market dynamics of groundwater markets has been conducted worldwide largely because operating examples of groundwater markets with sufficient data are rare necessary conditions for water markets to be successful include i well defined property rights ii effective and adaptive governance and legislation regarding enabling resources including a cap on water rights issued iii sufficient knowledge about hydrology and resource constraint iv proper accounting and monitoring of water extraction and consumption v a sufficiently diverse potential market for water notably in terms of diversity of value added consumption and vi the existence of institutional arrangements to address externalities wheeler et al 2017 public perception of water markets hérivaux et al 2020 and vested interests wheeler and garrick 2020 are two other factors potentially influencing the existence of and participation in groundwater markets allowing trade in the absence of adequate administrative arrangements can endanger water security maestu and gomez ramos 2013 young 2014 wheeler et al 2017 where water extraction rights cannot be enforced the risk of overuse is heightened diwakara and nagaraj 2003 zhang 2007 as is the importance of understanding the connectivity and substitutability between surface and groundwater resources australia provides a rare example of a mature dataset on groundwater markets because of its long functioning history and development of markets over the past thirty years wheeler et al 2017 in many instances groundwater markets in australia coexist with surface water markets in cases where both type of water resources are available the substitutability and connectivity between surface and groundwater is a major water policy issue for example understanding the actual impact of irrigation efficiency subsidies requires knowledge about the volume represented by return flows irrigation surface water flowing to aquifers following its use grafton et al 2018 williams and grafton 2019 furthermore groundwater pumping in areas close to rivers has been shown to decrease available surface water in nearby streams and this situation has led to inter state conflict in the united states kuwayama and brozović 2013 a well known substitution phenomenon was also identified between surface and groundwater in the murray darling basin mdb haensch et al 2016 these interactions affect water markets when they coexist in the same area as noted in california in the 1980 drought where farmers sold their water to the government and compensated by increasing groundwater pumping wheeler et al 2016 similar evidence has been found in australia wheeler and cheeseman 2013 and china zhang 2007 therefore improving the knowledge about the interconnections between surface and groundwater resource management is important ross 2018 williamson and grafton 2019 to design appropriate water markets regulations seidl et al 2020a wheeler and garrick 2020 this is also because the monitoring of groundwater extraction in the mdb remains weak for example in nsw many bores are not required by law to be metered for example those termed basic rights namely those used for stock and domestic purposes and all are exempt from the telemetry provisions that were introduced in 2018 holley et al 2020 nelson 2019 wheeler et al 2020 moreover the appropriateness of property rights and pricing policies in general is conditioned by a sufficiently high elasticity of irrigation water demand in cases where water demand is inelastic a water pricing policy targeting a reduction in irrigation withdrawals would need to considerably increase the water price in order to reduce irrigation water consumption thereby strongly affecting farm income de fraiture and perry 2007 with a perfectly inelastic groundwater demand the lack of a rationing mechanism based on the productivity of water consumption has been shown to generate inefficiency wang and segarra 2011 given this context the interest of this research is twofold first this study adds to the literature by providing a rare estimate of groundwater temporary market demand price elasticities using over a decade of exogenous water price variations from a key groundwater extraction area the murrumbidgee in the mdb australia second we examine the dynamics of groundwater temporary markets by analysing drivers of prices and trade along with the connectivity and substitutability between surface and groundwater markets our results provide insights that can be used to inform pricing and water market policies in the countries choosing to implement such tools studies on the price elasticity of irrigation surface water use or irrigation water use in general have often used mathematical programming methodologies estimates varied between 0 and 2 81 in absolute value depending on study characteristics shumway 1973 frank and beatie 1979 howitt et al 1980 pagan et al 1997 hooker and alexander 1998 scheierling et al 2004 other studies used econometrics to estimate surface water temporary market demand elasticity assuming or holding other factors constant elasticity estimates range between 3 56 and 0 81 schoengold et al 2006 brooks and harris 2008 wheeler et al 2008 studies estimating groundwater demand elasticity have mostly focused on groundwater irrigation charges and pumping costs only and estimates have ranged from 0 10 to 0 80 nieswiadomy 1985 ogg and gollehon 1989 moore et al 1994 gonzalez alvarez et al 2006 hendricks and peterson 2012 mieno and brozovic 2016 badiani magnusson and jessoe 2019 apart from this studies using exogeneous changes in groundwater price to study irrigation groundwater demand elasticity are rare alamdarlo et al 2019 employed mathematical programming to analyse the impact of supply and demand policies in an informal groundwater market framework in the qazvin plain in iran and found groundwater demand elasticities from 0 to 0 17 we could find no other study estimating groundwater demand elasticity using actual groundwater market transactions many factors can influence the estimation of groundwater demand elasticity including the price at which elasticity is estimated the econometric methodology temperature and the existence of high value crops in an area scheierling et al 2006 irrigation methods frija et al 2011 pfeiffer and lin 2014 and measurement errors mieno and brozovic 2016 besides there has been some discussion regarding the influences on groundwater markets that can affect prices and thus the elasticity estimation such markets are influenced by traditional surface water market drivers including rainfall and temperature allocations received dam storages output prices for commodities grown in the area and seasonal factors wheeler et al 2008 evidence of price clustering has also been reported brooks et al 2013 in the case of groundwater markets salinity can also be of influence gill et al 2017 furthermore brooks and harris 2014 found evidence of price leadership between two surface water trading zones in the goulburn murray irrigation district price leadership is a lead lag relationship between two indexes whereby variations in one index can be explained by past variations of another market index such lead lag relationships have been found in various contexts in financial markets such as between futures and their underlying stocks min and najand 1999 or between different markets offering similar market products roope and zurbruegg 2002 however to the best of our knowledge no study to date has considered the potential lead lag relationship between surface and groundwater markets nevertheless as it is expected that more liquid markets such as surface water markets in australia react quickly to new information the existence of such a lead lag relationship in the mdb is highly likely therefore this study analysed in detail the dynamics of groundwater temporary markets between july 2008 and april 2018 in a key groundwater extraction area the murrumbidgee in australia it investigated the existence of a lead lag relationship between surface and groundwater temporary markets it also provided one of the first estimates of groundwater market demand price elasticities using exogenous variations in groundwater price taking into account a variety of groundwater market dynamics 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area 2 1 1 overview water markets in australia s mdb emerged formally in the 1980s and evolved to become the most active water market area in the world grafton et al 2011 seidl et al 2020b most water trades in the mdb are surface water transactions especially in the southern connected system however groundwater markets have also been established in various other parts of australia the largest australia wide groundwater markets in terms of number of permanent and temporary trades appear in table 1 between 2 july 2008 and 20 april 2018 6 943 groundwater temporary trades were recorded australia wide in the bom water market database along with 12 029 permanent trades while most groundwater trades occurred in new south wales queensland and south australia also showed a significant number of transactions temporary trade involves the seasonal or temporary transfer of water known in australia as water allocation trade and permanant trade involves the ongoing transfer of the right to an ongoing share of water resources at a given source known in australia as water entitlement trade wheeler and garrick 2020 we focused on temporary groundwater markets in the murrumbidgee region for several reasons first trading was generally not allowed between different groundwater systems as in the murrumbidgee which argued for the application of a single water system second permanent groundwater price transactions were relatively scarce which hampered the creation of consistent time series data third the murrumbidgee groundwater market represented 9 5 of all groundwater trades in australia but contained a considerably lower proportion of zero priced trades 33 than most other regions 2 1 2 murrumbidgee groundwater extraction for irrigation purposes in the murrumbidgee started in the early 1960s before 1982 groundwater access was unrestricted since 2006 new water extraction licences were no longer issued and licenses became fully tradeable and separated from land titles green et al 2011 the murrumbidgee catchment fig 1 is the fourth largest catchment in the mdb and covers about 84 000 km² gilligan 2005 the catchment hosts one of the most active groundwater markets in australia coexisting with a significant surface water market irrigated agriculture in the murrumbidgee mainly includes rice and cotton representing around 65 of the total agricultural water extractions in 2016 17 abs 2018 other crops includes cereals pastures fruits and nuts douglas et al 2016 water extraction in the murrumbidgee is based on an annual accounting system along regulated water sources such as the murrumbidgee river or the murrumbidgee alluvium each water user must own a water license an initial available water determination is made at the beginning of the year 1 1 water years in australia begin on july 1st and end on june 30th determining the amount of water delivered to each of the shares listed on a user s water license green et al 2011 water determinations may increase throughout the year depending on climatic circumstances different categories of surface and groundwater licenses exist defining access to surface or groundwater according to varying levels of priorities i e risk on the use of surface water resources the most common surface water license in the murrumbidgee is general security license or an aquifer access license in the case of groundwater douglas et al 2016 groundwater trading has been occurring since 1987 mainly in the lower murrumbidgee deep water source while early trades involved temporary transfers called allocation transfers permanent groundwater transfers called groundwater license entitlement transfers have been permitted since 2006 they are however rarer groundwater markets are considerably less active than surface water markets and are limited to a shared groundwater source trading between different groundwater sources is not permitted green et al 2011 fig 2 illustrates water market prices and the groundwater volume traded in the murrumbidgee temporary water markets from 2008 onwards groundwater markets in the murrumbidgee show higher prices and a higher level of market activity in times of scarcity between 2008 and 2010 the existence of the millennium drought resulted in much higher surface and groundwater prices and an increase in the quantity of water traded in contrast flooding in 2010 11 led to surface water prices falling to under aud 20 ml while the total quantity of groundwater traded also reduced considerably note that the price of surface water median price of aud 94 62 ml was consistently higher than groundwater aud 22 93 ml expressed in constant 2018 prices this reflects the fact that in many areas irrigators favour surface water extraction over groundwater extraction reasons for this preference include the energy costs of groundwater extraction mitchell et al 2012 greater tradability of surface water and frequent presence of malfunctioning bores with high salinity gill et al 2017 hooker and alexander 1998 2 2 data the study used 10 years july 2008 april 2018 of surface and groundwater temporary market trade data in the murrumbidgee australia water market data monthly price and quantity traded our dependent variables for this study was extracted from the australian bureau of meteorology s bom national water market database independent variables collected included climate variables rainfall and mean temperature using bom s hay airport automatic weather station aws located in the murrumbidgee diesel prices were collected from the australian institute for petroleum output prices were collected from the australian bureau for agricultural and resources economics and sciences abares all prices were adjusted using the consumer price index from the reserve bank of australia rba 2 2 several other variables were tested but not included in the final analysis including the groundwater level and electricity prices with the base year 2018 descriptive statistics can be found in table a1 2 3 methodology the method followed two stages first we modelled the price of temporary groundwater trade to question the existence of a price leadership relationship between surface and groundwater temporary markets second we modelled the quantity of temporary groundwater traded in order to investigate the influence of the groundwater price and infer the price elasticity of groundwater demand 2 3 1 price leadership method in order to investigate the existence of a lead lag relationship in various markets vector auto regressive var frameworks have often been used in the literature brooks and harris 2014 chordia and swaminathan 2000 chevallier 2010 most var frameworks are parsimonious chevallier 2010 brooks and harris 2014 in the sense that they only used a few covariates however in the case of water markets climatic variables have been shown to have a clear influence on market price and quantities traded wheeler et al 2008 brooks and harris 2008 loch et al 2012 therefore we used a var x model including four temporary water market variables price and quantity traded for surface and groundwater trade and two climatic variables rainfall and mean temperature var x models include endogenous variables used as dependent and independent variables successively and exogenous variables that are only used as independent variables market variables were defined as endogenous due to the potential interconnections between surface and groundwater trade while rainfall and mean temperature variables were considered exogenous thus we alternatively used each temporary market variable price and quantity traded for surface sw and groundwater gw as a dependent variable and regressed it on the past values

sensitivity tested and the results were similar in addition surface water allocation percentage was tested but was found to be highly correlated with surface water prices correlation coefficient 0 83

stationary once logged and first differenced first differences d of climatic variables were found stationary therefore market variables have been logged log and then first differenced while climatic variables were simply first differenced var x frameworks can be applied using a different number of past values for each variable indicators such as fpe akaike s ic hqic or the schwarz bayesian ic were used in order to determine the number of lags to include each regression was run using an alternative number of lags and various information criteria were compared the australian water year begins in july and ends in june where the early months in the season usually show lower trade intensities as irrigators face higher uncertainty therefore the maximum potential number of lags in these tests was set to be nine results showed that the fpe and aic indicated the use of nine lags while the hqic and sbic suggested the use of one lag in order to avoid overfitting we chose to use one lagged value for each variable in our analysis the varx 1 model using logs and first differences estimated the following 1 d l o g g w p r i c e t α 0 α 1 d l o g g w p r i c e t 1 α 2 d l o g g w q u

causal relationships between our variables we then applied impulse response functions irf and forecast error variance decomposition in order to understand the duration and extent of the interconnections between surface and groundwater temporary markets 2 3 2 price elasticity of groundwater demand method given that the groundwater price and the groundwater volume are simultaneously determined this raised the possibility of endogeneity thus we used an instrumental variables approach in order to identify the demand equation a valid instrument must be found for groundwater price such a variable should impact groundwater supply e g influence water sellers without affecting groundwater demand e g water buyers in a water market context the difficulty in finding a proper instrument is exacerbated by the fact that water sellers can also be water buyers several instruments were tested and variables such as the groundwater level electricity prices and various agricultural output prices were found to impact demand and hence were unsuitable however the rice price was identified as an appropriate instrument for groundwater price rice growers tend to own large general security water licenses grow rice in wet years and can earn some income by selling water in drought years when water prices are high and water allocations are low douglas et al 2016 nguyen ky et al 2018 notably it has been reported that selling water allocations when water prices were greater than aud 200 ml was perceived as a better and less risky strategy than growing rice loch et al 2012 zuo et al 2015 therefore the price of rice can influence water supply on the market as rice producers are frequent water sellers on the murrumbidgee water markets especially in times of water scarcity thus we expect rice prices to mainly influence groundwater supply and to have a limited effect on groundwater demand this makes it a valid instrument for groundwater price and allows price elasticity of groundwater demand to be properly estimated following wheeler et al 2008 a linear log log specification was used the instrumental approach used a two stage least squares 2sls estimation g w p r i c e t f x t z t where x was a vector of explanatory variables and z the instrument rice price in month t the estimation used the predicted value of the groundwater temporary price g w v o l t f x t g w p r i c e t ˆ several control variables were included given that groundwater markets may be potentially influenced by surface water markets in the murrumbidgee prices of permanent and temporary surface water entitlements were included as many irrigators use diesel pumps to extract groundwater the average annual diesel price 4 4 due to data availability constraints we used diesel price in sydney as a proxy for murrumbidgee data was included finally climate variables rainfall and mean temperature in month and seasonal dummies were used to consider climatic circumstances and seasonal patterns several other control variables were tested 5 5 red wine and cotton prices rainfall in the last three months electricity price the mean groundwater level in six bores over the murrumbidgee alluvium the general security surface water allocation level a month index but for a variety of reasons collinearity continual lack of significance and relevance etc were not included in

suggested the existence of a price leadership phenomenon from surface water temporary markets to groundwater temporary markets the percent change in groundwater price is caused by the past change in the surface water temporary price the parameter of the surface water price in regression 1 is positive and highly significant similar evidence was found regarding groundwater temporary allocation quantity traded the percent change in quantity of groundwater traded can be explained by the past change of surface water quantity traded in order to analyse the duration and extent of the interaction between surface and groundwater temporary markets roca and tularam 2012 orthogonalized impulse response functions and the forecast error variance decomposition were generated see fig b1 they suggested that a one percent change in the surface water market generated a response in groundwater temporary price that is positive and significantly different from zero at lag one see fig b1 this response weakens in the second month and disappears four months later furthermore 83 2 of the error variance for groundwater temporary price was found to be due to groundwater price s own changes and 14 4 was due to changes in surface water temporary price note that table b1 also shows that 84 of the error variance for surface water temporary price was due to its own changes and 11 8 was due to changes in groundwater temporary price which could suggest that the opposite groundwater market characteristics impact surface water markets could be also true however granger causality tests and regression estimates do not show any impact of the past percent change in groundwater market characteristics on either surface water market temporary prices or quantities traded impulse response functions also showed no significant response in surface water temporary price for lags one to eight following a one percent change in groundwater price overall these results suggested that market sensitive information is first incorporated by the surface water temporary market and then transmitted to groundwater temporary markets in the murrumbidgee such a result is coherent with the financial literature showing that more liquid markets tend to incorporate market information faster roope and zurbruegg 2002 brooks and harris 2014 3 2 price elasticity of groundwater demand results from the 2sls modelling are shown in table 4 the durbin wu hausman test confirmed the endogeneity of the groundwater temporary price under identification and weak instrument tests e g kleibergen paap rk lm and wald f statistics suggested no under identification or weak instrument and our instrument had a significant positive impact on the groundwater price second stage estimates revealed a groundwater temporary demand price elasticity close to the unit elasticity 1 05 a one percent increase in the groundwater temporary price led to a 1 05 percent decrease in groundwater demand this is a relatively high estimate compared to other results in the literature for example mieno and brozovic 2016 estimate was 0 5 for changes in groundwater extraction in response to changes in pumping costs in the united states however greater price elasticities for groundwater trade markets are expected as found by the surface water temporary market price elasticity literature e g wheeler et al 2008 found a 1 51 temporary surface water demand elasticity from 1997 to 2007 in the goulburn australia our result suggests that while the groundwater market demand seems generally more elastic than other studies that have focussed on irrigation charges only it is less elastic than surface water temporary market demand this is most likely explained by the fact that surface water trade volume is much larger the price is generally higher the market is more liquid and the market covers a far greater tradeable area across the southern mdb than the murrumbidgee groundwater market as expected surface water temporary and permanent prices statistically significantly and positively affected groundwater temporary prices in the murrumbidgee this confirmed the existence of a substitution effect between surface and groundwater haensch et al 2016 diesel prices had a negative impact on groundwater temporary prices similar to a decrease in farmers income an increase in diesel prices shifts the water demand curve to the left as groundwater pumping costs increase as water demand is reduced groundwater temporary prices fall mean temperature was positively associated with groundwater temporary prices as evapotranspiration increases crop water demand while not affecting supply rainfall had no statistically significant impact finally we found that groundwater temporary prices were slightly higher at the beginning of the water season i e between july and september this confirmed a seasonal trend already noted in the literature as uncertainty related to water resources availability is higher farmers buying water early in the season tend to pay more this is perceived as an insurance premium and in the case of groundwater in murrumbidgee we found that this impact disappeared after october this study has focussed on one groundwater region in the mdb and an analysis of other areas would be warranted a further limitation of this study is related to its investigation between the full connectivity of surface and ground water resources since our level of analysis is at the trading district level we cannot control for the distance and or physical connectivity between a given bore s aquifer and the nearest surface water body future research would be necessary in this space however this study s findings of the economic interdependency between surface and groundwater markets is a possible indication of the close physical connectivity between the two resources that allows for increased substitution between them further understanding of this relationship will be crucial for designing appropriate water management policies 4 conclusion this study used a ten year dataset of monthly groundwater and surface water market prices and quantity traded in the murrumbidgee murray darling basin and identified two key water policy results first we found that there is a significant price leadership phenomenon from surface water markets to groundwater temporary markets surface water markets are used the most by irrigators in the murrumbidgee hence they incorporate market sensitive information first and this information is then transmitted to groundwater markets the price of temporary groundwater and its quantity traded were found dependent on the price and quantity of the surface water traded in the region this suggested the existence of a substitution effect between surface and groundwater despite irrigators preference for surface water therefore the need for an integrated water policy that applies to both surface and groundwater resources is imperative conjunctive management of water resources could offer several benefits in this perspective if water policies only target surface water resources it is likely that irrigators will substitute groundwater for surface water and indeed there is increasing evidence of such behaviour furthermore quantifying return flows is also important along with the need for greater regulation and monitoring of groundwater extraction in the mdb the second key water policy result was that groundwater temporary market demand in the murrumbidgee was unitary elastic 1 05 in our period of study indicating the price elastic link between groundwater prices and groundwater pumping demand other key influences on groundwater temporary prices included diesel cost rice prices temperature and early season timing

10557,groundwater over extraction is a problem facing many countries around the world water pricing and developing property rights to enable groundwater trade are potential demand based approaches to address the over extraction of groundwater resources however successful implementation of groundwater trading requires knowledge about groundwater demand and its interaction substitutability with surface water and given the paucity of empirical data on groundwater markets price elasticity of groundwater demand is rarely estimated in the literature we analysed 10 years of monthly surface and groundwater temporary market data july 2008 april 2018 within the murrumbidgee catchment of the murray darling basin australia to explore a the lead lag relationship between surface and groundwater temporary markets and b the price elasticity of groundwater market demand results illustrate that surface water markets show price leadership to groundwater temporary markets and that groundwater demand is price elastic with a 1 05 price elasticity estimate in our time period keywords murray darling basin price leadership groundwater demand elasticity groundwater markets 1 introduction water extractions have been increasing worldwide by about 1 per year and global water demand is expected to increase at a similar rate until 2050 wwap 2019 as a result over extraction of groundwater resources is a growing problem and a consequence of a common pool resource dilemma ostrom 1990 groundwater overuse represents significant costs to society it can increase withdrawal costs as water has to be pumped from a greater depth it generates cones of depression wheeler et al 2016 and can lead to surface and groundwater depletion along with significant infrastructure costs asci et al 2017 silva et al 2019 given agriculture extracts 69 of available freshwater resources in the world wwap 2019 the increased use of irrigation water pricing and property rights has been suggested as a potential mean to cope with water scarcity blanco gutiérrez et al 2011 the literature has shown that increased water prices usually through irrigation water charges can favour the adoption of water conservation technologies caswell and zilberman 1985 caswell et al 1990 and decrease irrigation groundwater use smith et al 2017 groundwater markets often emerge as formal or informal tools to put a price on water and reallocate scarce groundwater resources examples of formal groundwater markets are found in australia wheeler et al 2016 the western united states colby 2000 and china zhang and zhang 2008 while informal markets exist in countries such as india manjunatha et al 2011 and pakistan khair et al 2012 although groundwater markets remain limited in their extent they have been shown to generate significant benefits in various contexts groundwater markets can involve significant gains from trade knapp et al 2003 gao et al 2013 palazzo and brozovic 2014 even in the presence of market power bruno and sexton 2020 with participants becoming more efficient in their water extraction i e generating more outputs with the same amount of water manjunatha et al 2011 razzaq et al 2019 in india groundwater markets have allowed resource poor farmers access to irrigation water mukherji 2007 little empirical research on the demand elasticities and market dynamics of groundwater markets has been conducted worldwide largely because operating examples of groundwater markets with sufficient data are rare necessary conditions for water markets to be successful include i well defined property rights ii effective and adaptive governance and legislation regarding enabling resources including a cap on water rights issued iii sufficient knowledge about hydrology and resource constraint iv proper accounting and monitoring of water extraction and consumption v a sufficiently diverse potential market for water notably in terms of diversity of value added consumption and vi the existence of institutional arrangements to address externalities wheeler et al 2017 public perception of water markets hérivaux et al 2020 and vested interests wheeler and garrick 2020 are two other factors potentially influencing the existence of and participation in groundwater markets allowing trade in the absence of adequate administrative arrangements can endanger water security maestu and gomez ramos 2013 young 2014 wheeler et al 2017 where water extraction rights cannot be enforced the risk of overuse is heightened diwakara and nagaraj 2003 zhang 2007 as is the importance of understanding the connectivity and substitutability between surface and groundwater resources australia provides a rare example of a mature dataset on groundwater markets because of its long functioning history and development of markets over the past thirty years wheeler et al 2017 in many instances groundwater markets in australia coexist with surface water markets in cases where both type of water resources are available the substitutability and connectivity between surface and groundwater is a major water policy issue for example understanding the actual impact of irrigation efficiency subsidies requires knowledge about the volume represented by return flows irrigation surface water flowing to aquifers following its use grafton et al 2018 williams and grafton 2019 furthermore groundwater pumping in areas close to rivers has been shown to decrease available surface water in nearby streams and this situation has led to inter state conflict in the united states kuwayama and brozović 2013 a well known substitution phenomenon was also identified between surface and groundwater in the murray darling basin mdb haensch et al 2016 these interactions affect water markets when they coexist in the same area as noted in california in the 1980 drought where farmers sold their water to the government and compensated by increasing groundwater pumping wheeler et al 2016 similar evidence has been found in australia wheeler and cheeseman 2013 and china zhang 2007 therefore improving the knowledge about the interconnections between surface and groundwater resource management is important ross 2018 williamson and grafton 2019 to design appropriate water markets regulations seidl et al 2020a wheeler and garrick 2020 this is also because the monitoring of groundwater extraction in the mdb remains weak for example in nsw many bores are not required by law to be metered for example those termed basic rights namely those used for stock and domestic purposes and all are exempt from the telemetry provisions that were introduced in 2018 holley et al 2020 nelson 2019 wheeler et al 2020 moreover the appropriateness of property rights and pricing policies in general is conditioned by a sufficiently high elasticity of irrigation water demand in cases where water demand is inelastic a water pricing policy targeting a reduction in irrigation withdrawals would need to considerably increase the water price in order to reduce irrigation water consumption thereby strongly affecting farm income de fraiture and perry 2007 with a perfectly inelastic groundwater demand the lack of a rationing mechanism based on the productivity of water consumption has been shown to generate inefficiency wang and segarra 2011 given this context the interest of this research is twofold first this study adds to the literature by providing a rare estimate of groundwater temporary market demand price elasticities using over a decade of exogenous water price variations from a key groundwater extraction area the murrumbidgee in the mdb australia second we examine the dynamics of groundwater temporary markets by analysing drivers of prices and trade along with the connectivity and substitutability between surface and groundwater markets our results provide insights that can be used to inform pricing and water market policies in the countries choosing to implement such tools studies on the price elasticity of irrigation surface water use or irrigation water use in general have often used mathematical programming methodologies estimates varied between 0 and 2 81 in absolute value depending on study characteristics shumway 1973 frank and beatie 1979 howitt et al 1980 pagan et al 1997 hooker and alexander 1998 scheierling et al 2004 other studies used econometrics to estimate surface water temporary market demand elasticity assuming or holding other factors constant elasticity estimates range between 3 56 and 0 81 schoengold et al 2006 brooks and harris 2008 wheeler et al 2008 studies estimating groundwater demand elasticity have mostly focused on groundwater irrigation charges and pumping costs only and estimates have ranged from 0 10 to 0 80 nieswiadomy 1985 ogg and gollehon 1989 moore et al 1994 gonzalez alvarez et al 2006 hendricks and peterson 2012 mieno and brozovic 2016 badiani magnusson and jessoe 2019 apart from this studies using exogeneous changes in groundwater price to study irrigation groundwater demand elasticity are rare alamdarlo et al 2019 employed mathematical programming to analyse the impact of supply and demand policies in an informal groundwater market framework in the qazvin plain in iran and found groundwater demand elasticities from 0 to 0 17 we could find no other study estimating groundwater demand elasticity using actual groundwater market transactions many factors can influence the estimation of groundwater demand elasticity including the price at which elasticity is estimated the econometric methodology temperature and the existence of high value crops in an area scheierling et al 2006 irrigation methods frija et al 2011 pfeiffer and lin 2014 and measurement errors mieno and brozovic 2016 besides there has been some discussion regarding the influences on groundwater markets that can affect prices and thus the elasticity estimation such markets are influenced by traditional surface water market drivers including rainfall and temperature allocations received dam storages output prices for commodities grown in the area and seasonal factors wheeler et al 2008 evidence of price clustering has also been reported brooks et al 2013 in the case of groundwater markets salinity can also be of influence gill et al 2017 furthermore brooks and harris 2014 found evidence of price leadership between two surface water trading zones in the goulburn murray irrigation district price leadership is a lead lag relationship between two indexes whereby variations in one index can be explained by past variations of another market index such lead lag relationships have been found in various contexts in financial markets such as between futures and their underlying stocks min and najand 1999 or between different markets offering similar market products roope and zurbruegg 2002 however to the best of our knowledge no study to date has considered the potential lead lag relationship between surface and groundwater markets nevertheless as it is expected that more liquid markets such as surface water markets in australia react quickly to new information the existence of such a lead lag relationship in the mdb is highly likely therefore this study analysed in detail the dynamics of groundwater temporary markets between july 2008 and april 2018 in a key groundwater extraction area the murrumbidgee in australia it investigated the existence of a lead lag relationship between surface and groundwater temporary markets it also provided one of the first estimates of groundwater market demand price elasticities using exogenous variations in groundwater price taking into account a variety of groundwater market dynamics 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area 2 1 1 overview water markets in australia s mdb emerged formally in the 1980s and evolved to become the most active water market area in the world grafton et al 2011 seidl et al 2020b most water trades in the mdb are surface water transactions especially in the southern connected system however groundwater markets have also been established in various other parts of australia the largest australia wide groundwater markets in terms of number of permanent and temporary trades appear in table 1 between 2 july 2008 and 20 april 2018 6 943 groundwater temporary trades were recorded australia wide in the bom water market database along with 12 029 permanent trades while most groundwater trades occurred in new south wales queensland and south australia also showed a significant number of transactions temporary trade involves the seasonal or temporary transfer of water known in australia as water allocation trade and permanant trade involves the ongoing transfer of the right to an ongoing share of water resources at a given source known in australia as water entitlement trade wheeler and garrick 2020 we focused on temporary groundwater markets in the murrumbidgee region for several reasons first trading was generally not allowed between different groundwater systems as in the murrumbidgee which argued for the application of a single water system second permanent groundwater price transactions were relatively scarce which hampered the creation of consistent time series data third the murrumbidgee groundwater market represented 9 5 of all groundwater trades in australia but contained a considerably lower proportion of zero priced trades 33 than most other regions 2 1 2 murrumbidgee groundwater extraction for irrigation purposes in the murrumbidgee started in the early 1960s before 1982 groundwater access was unrestricted since 2006 new water extraction licences were no longer issued and licenses became fully tradeable and separated from land titles green et al 2011 the murrumbidgee catchment fig 1 is the fourth largest catchment in the mdb and covers about 84 000 km² gilligan 2005 the catchment hosts one of the most active groundwater markets in australia coexisting with a significant surface water market irrigated agriculture in the murrumbidgee mainly includes rice and cotton representing around 65 of the total agricultural water extractions in 2016 17 abs 2018 other crops includes cereals pastures fruits and nuts douglas et al 2016 water extraction in the murrumbidgee is based on an annual accounting system along regulated water sources such as the murrumbidgee river or the murrumbidgee alluvium each water user must own a water license an initial available water determination is made at the beginning of the year 1 1 water years in australia begin on july 1st and end on june 30th determining the amount of water delivered to each of the shares listed on a user s water license green et al 2011 water determinations may increase throughout the year depending on climatic circumstances different categories of surface and groundwater licenses exist defining access to surface or groundwater according to varying levels of priorities i e risk on the use of surface water resources the most common surface water license in the murrumbidgee is general security license or an aquifer access license in the case of groundwater douglas et al 2016 groundwater trading has been occurring since 1987 mainly in the lower murrumbidgee deep water source while early trades involved temporary transfers called allocation transfers permanent groundwater transfers called groundwater license entitlement transfers have been permitted since 2006 they are however rarer groundwater markets are considerably less active than surface water markets and are limited to a shared groundwater source trading between different groundwater sources is not permitted green et al 2011 fig 2 illustrates water market prices and the groundwater volume traded in the murrumbidgee temporary water markets from 2008 onwards groundwater markets in the murrumbidgee show higher prices and a higher level of market activity in times of scarcity between 2008 and 2010 the existence of the millennium drought resulted in much higher surface and groundwater prices and an increase in the quantity of water traded in contrast flooding in 2010 11 led to surface water prices falling to under aud 20 ml while the total quantity of groundwater traded also reduced considerably note that the price of surface water median price of aud 94 62 ml was consistently higher than groundwater aud 22 93 ml expressed in constant 2018 prices this reflects the fact that in many areas irrigators favour surface water extraction over groundwater extraction reasons for this preference include the energy costs of groundwater extraction mitchell et al 2012 greater tradability of surface water and frequent presence of malfunctioning bores with high salinity gill et al 2017 hooker and alexander 1998 2 2 data the study used 10 years july 2008 april 2018 of surface and groundwater temporary market trade data in the murrumbidgee australia water market data monthly price and quantity traded our dependent variables for this study was extracted from the australian bureau of meteorology s bom national water market database independent variables collected included climate variables rainfall and mean temperature using bom s hay airport automatic weather station aws located in the murrumbidgee diesel prices were collected from the australian institute for petroleum output prices were collected from the australian bureau for agricultural and resources economics and sciences abares all prices were adjusted using the consumer price index from the reserve bank of australia rba 2 2 several other variables were tested but not included in the final analysis including the groundwater level and electricity prices with the base year 2018 descriptive statistics can be found in table a1 2 3 methodology the method followed two stages first we modelled the price of temporary groundwater trade to question the existence of a price leadership relationship between surface and groundwater temporary markets second we modelled the quantity of temporary groundwater traded in order to investigate the influence of the groundwater price and infer the price elasticity of groundwater demand 2 3 1 price leadership method in order to investigate the existence of a lead lag relationship in various markets vector auto regressive var frameworks have often been used in the literature brooks and harris 2014 chordia and swaminathan 2000 chevallier 2010 most var frameworks are parsimonious chevallier 2010 brooks and harris 2014 in the sense that they only used a few covariates however in the case of water markets climatic variables have been shown to have a clear influence on market price and quantities traded wheeler et al 2008 brooks and harris 2008 loch et al 2012 therefore we used a var x model including four temporary water market variables price and quantity traded for surface and groundwater trade and two climatic variables rainfall and mean temperature var x models include endogenous variables used as dependent and independent variables successively and exogenous variables that are only used as independent variables market variables were defined as endogenous due to the potential interconnections between surface and groundwater trade while rainfall and mean temperature variables were considered exogenous thus we alternatively used each temporary market variable price and quantity traded for surface sw and groundwater gw as a dependent variable and regressed it on the past values of other market variables while controlling for climatic factors 3 3 monthly rainfall and mean monthly temperature were used in the final results although the cumulative three months rainfall was also sensitivity tested and the results were similar in addition surface water allocation percentage was tested but was found to be highly correlated with surface water prices correlation coefficient 0 83 and therefore was not included in the final model augmented dickey fuller and kpss stationarity tests revealed that most market variables prices and quantities were not stationary but became stationary once logged and first differenced first differences d of climatic variables were found stationary therefore market variables have been logged log and then first differenced while climatic variables were simply first differenced var x frameworks can be applied using a different number of past values for each variable indicators such as fpe akaike s ic hqic or the schwarz bayesian ic were used in order to determine the number of lags to include each regression was run using an alternative number of lags and various information criteria were compared the australian water year begins in july and ends in june where the early months in the season usually show lower trade intensities as irrigators face higher uncertainty therefore the maximum potential number of lags in these tests was set to be nine results showed that the fpe and aic indicated the use of nine lags while the hqic and sbic suggested the use of one lag in order to avoid overfitting we chose to use one lagged value for each variable in our analysis the varx 1 model using logs and first differences estimated the following 1 d l o g g w p r i c e t α 0 α 1 d l o g g w p r i c e t 1 α 2 d l o g g w q u

causal relationships between our variables we then applied impulse response functions irf and forecast error variance decomposition in order to understand the duration and extent of the interconnections between surface and groundwater temporary markets 2 3 2 price elasticity of groundwater demand method given that the groundwater price and the groundwater volume are simultaneously determined this raised the possibility of endogeneity thus we used an instrumental variables approach in order to identify the demand equation a valid instrument must be found for groundwater price such a variable should impact groundwater supply e g influence water sellers without affecting groundwater demand e g water buyers in a water market context the difficulty in finding a proper instrument is exacerbated by the fact that water sellers can also be water buyers several instruments were tested and variables such as the groundwater level electricity prices and various agricultural output prices were found to impact demand and hence were unsuitable however the rice price was identified as an appropriate instrument for groundwater price rice growers tend to own large general security water licenses grow rice in wet years and can earn some income by selling water in drought years when water prices are high and water allocations are low douglas et al 2016 nguyen ky et al 2018 notably it has been reported that selling water allocations when water prices were greater than aud 200 ml was perceived as a better and less risky strategy than growing rice loch et al 2012 zuo et al 2015 therefore the price of rice can influence water supply on the market as rice producers are frequent water sellers on the murrumbidgee water markets especially in times of water scarcity thus we expect rice prices to mainly influence groundwater supply and to have a limited effect on groundwater demand this makes it a valid instrument for groundwater price and allows price elasticity of groundwater demand to be properly estimated following wheeler et al 2008 a linear log log specification was used the instrumental approach used a two stage least squares 2sls estimation g w p r i c e t f x t z t where x was a vector of explanatory variables and z the instrument rice price in month t the estimation used the predicted value of the groundwater temporary price g w v o l t f x t g w p r i c e t ˆ several control variables were included given that groundwater markets may be potentially influenced by surface water markets in the murrumbidgee prices of permanent and temporary surface water entitlements were included as many irrigators use diesel pumps to extract groundwater the average annual diesel price 4 4 due to data availability constraints we used diesel price in sydney as a proxy for murrumbidgee data was included finally climate variables rainfall and mean temperature in month and seasonal dummies were used to consider climatic circumstances and seasonal patterns several other control variables were tested 5 5 red wine and cotton prices rainfall in the last three months electricity price the mean groundwater level in six bores over the murrumbidgee alluvium the general security surface water allocation level a month index but for a variety of reasons collinearity continual lack of significance and relevance etc were not included in the final model descriptive statistics are provided in table a1 and maximum likelihood estimation was used to estimate the model s parameters the two stage least squares regression was stage 1 5 l n g

suggested the existence of a price leadership phenomenon from surface water temporary markets to groundwater temporary markets the percent change in groundwater price is caused by the past change in the surface water temporary price the parameter of the surface water price in regression 1 is positive and highly significant similar evidence was found regarding groundwater temporary allocation quantity traded the percent change in quantity of groundwater traded can be explained by the past change of surface water quantity traded in order to analyse the duration and extent of the interaction between surface and groundwater temporary markets roca and tularam 2012 orthogonalized impulse response functions and the forecast error variance decomposition were generated see fig b1 they suggested that a one percent change in the surface water market generated a response in groundwater temporary price that is positive and significantly different from zero at lag one see fig b1 this response weakens in the second month and disappears four months later furthermore 83 2 of the error variance for groundwater temporary price was found to be due to groundwater price s own changes and 14 4 was due to changes in surface water temporary price note that table b1 also shows that 84 of the error variance for surface water temporary price was due to its own changes and 11 8 was due to changes in groundwater temporary price which could suggest that the opposite groundwater market characteristics impact surface water markets could be also true however granger causality tests and regression estimates do not show any impact of the past percent change in groundwater market characteristics on either surface water market temporary prices or quantities traded impulse response functions also showed no significant response in surface water temporary price for lags one to eight following a one percent change in groundwater price overall these results suggested that market sensitive information is first incorporated by the surface water temporary market and then transmitted to groundwater temporary markets in the murrumbidgee such a result is coherent with the financial literature showing that more liquid markets tend to incorporate market information faster roope and zurbruegg 2002 brooks and harris 2014 3 2 price elasticity of groundwater demand results from the 2sls modelling are shown in table 4 the durbin wu hausman test confirmed the endogeneity of the groundwater temporary price under identification and weak instrument tests e g kleibergen paap rk lm and wald f statistics suggested no under identification or weak instrument and our instrument had a significant positive impact on the groundwater price second stage estimates revealed a groundwater temporary demand price elasticity close to the unit elasticity 1 05 a one percent increase in the groundwater temporary price led to a 1 05 percent decrease in groundwater demand this is a relatively high estimate compared to other results in the literature for example mieno and brozovic 2016 estimate was 0 5 for changes in groundwater extraction in response to changes in pumping costs in the united states however greater price elasticities for groundwater trade markets are expected as found by the surface water temporary market price elasticity literature e g wheeler et al 2008 found a 1 51 temporary surface water demand elasticity from 1997 to 2007 in the goulburn australia our result suggests that while the groundwater market demand seems generally more elastic than other studies that have focussed on irrigation charges only it is less elastic than surface water temporary market demand this is most likely explained by the fact that surface water trade volume is much larger the price is generally higher the market is more liquid and the market covers a far greater tradeable area across the southern mdb than the murrumbidgee groundwater market as expected surface water temporary and permanent prices statistically significantly and positively affected groundwater temporary prices in the murrumbidgee this confirmed the existence of a substitution effect between surface and groundwater haensch et al 2016 diesel prices had a negative impact on groundwater temporary prices similar to a decrease in farmers income an increase in diesel prices shifts the water demand curve to the left as groundwater pumping costs increase as water demand is reduced groundwater temporary prices fall mean temperature was positively associated with groundwater temporary prices as evapotranspiration increases crop water demand while not affecting supply rainfall had no statistically significant impact finally we found that groundwater temporary prices were slightly higher at the beginning of the water season i e between july and september this confirmed a seasonal trend already noted in the literature as uncertainty related to water resources availability is higher farmers buying water early in the season tend to pay more this is perceived as an insurance premium and in the case of groundwater in murrumbidgee we found that this impact disappeared after october this study has focussed on one groundwater region in the mdb and an analysis of other areas would be warranted a further limitation of this study is related to its investigation between the full connectivity of surface and ground water resources since our level of analysis is at the trading district level we cannot control for the distance and or physical connectivity between a given bore s aquifer and the nearest surface water body future research would be necessary in this space however this study s findings of the economic interdependency between surface and groundwater markets is a possible indication of the close physical connectivity between the two resources that allows for increased substitution between them further understanding of this relationship will be crucial for designing appropriate water management policies 4 conclusion this study used a ten year dataset of monthly groundwater and surface water market prices and quantity traded in the murrumbidgee murray darling basin and identified two key water policy results first we found that there is a significant price leadership phenomenon from surface water markets to groundwater temporary markets surface water markets are used the most by irrigators in the murrumbidgee hence they incorporate market sensitive information first and this information is then transmitted to groundwater markets the price of temporary groundwater and its quantity traded were found dependent on the price and quantity of the surface water traded in the region this suggested the existence of a substitution effect between surface and groundwater despite irrigators preference for surface water therefore the need for an integrated water policy that applies to both surface and groundwater resources is imperative conjunctive management of water resources could offer several benefits in this perspective if water policies only target surface water resources it is likely that irrigators will substitute groundwater for surface water and indeed there is increasing evidence of such behaviour furthermore quantifying return flows is also important along with the need for greater regulation and monitoring of groundwater extraction in the mdb the second key water policy result was that groundwater temporary market demand in the murrumbidgee was unitary elastic 1 05 in our period of study indicating the price elastic link between groundwater prices and groundwater pumping demand other key influences on groundwater temporary prices included diesel cost rice prices temperature and early season timing

10558,trade can conserve water resources in an administrative region if the region imports water intensive commodities rather than producing them domestically however many recent studies of domestic virtual water flows vwfs have found that there is a net vwf from water scarce regions to water rich regions within large countries such as china inter provincial grain trade will result in a considerable geographical redistribution of water through vwfs which will make the situation of the water shortage more serious therefore it is necessary to identify the governing factors of the vwfs to understand the less than ideal water use patterns and to build well informed regulations for saving water taking grain production in china as a case study this paper studies the drivers of inter regional vwfs an integrated method combining a logarithmic mean divisia index lmdi decomposition method and a gravity model is proposed in this work in the method the changes in vwfs are decomposed into four portions with the lmdi method firstly based on that a vwf gravity model is developed to analyze the social economic and natural driving force behind the four changes and the total domestic grain vwfs the main empirical results are as follows 1 there is a trend toward the separation of grain consumers and grain producers in china net positive vwf within china has occurred from water scarce north to water rich south and there has been a sharp growth trend in the size of this flow over time the existing pattern of inter province virtual water trade is exacerbating scarcities in already water scarce regions 2 the growth of grain exchanges was responsible for most of the increase in grain vwf the decreasing unit water footprint of grain production drives down the number of grain vwfs however this decrease cannot offset the boost provided by the other effects 3 water endowments and geographical distance are demonstrated as have not significant influences in domestic vwfs the most important drivers of inter regional vwf within a country is the outward push force of the exporter and the inward pull force of the importer the technological level of grain production and the economic conditions in the import region are less important drivers the results indicate that the domestic vwfs of the grain trade are governed primarily by industrial distribution and regional division in the national economy rather than by water endowment although implementing water saving policies in water scarce and water export regions further helped to alleviate this situation the fundamental solution is to change the industrial distribution and regional division in the national economy keywords virtual water flows vwfs grain production inter regional logarithmic mean divisia index lmdi decomposition method gravity model 1 introduction a water footprint a multi dimensional measure of freshwater that can be used both directly and indirectly by producers and consumers makes it possible to analyze the link between human consumption and the appropriation of water to produce the products consumed hoekstra 2013 the term virtual water refers to the amount of water embedded in traded products fracasso et al 2016 trade in water intensive commodities results in so called virtual water flows vwfs between exporting and importing regions trade can conserve water resources in an administrative region if the region imports water intensive commodities rather than producing them domestically chapagain et al 2006 however many recent studies of domestic vwfs have found that there is a net vwf from water scarce regions to water rich regions within a large country like china ma et al 2006 guan and hubacek 2007 zhang and anadon 2014 dalin et al 2014 sun et al 2013 zhao et al 2015 zhuo et al 2016 and india verma et al 2009 katyaini and barua 2017 which makes the situation more serious in areas in which water is scarce and creates pressing problems related to the sustainability of water use china has already faced the situation of water scarcity as a result of that the per capita water volume only accounts for a quarter of the world average moreover the northern part of china has been facing increasingly severe water scarcity as a result of topographical distribution jiang 2015 agriculture accounts for the greatest proportion of water use and grain production accounts for the biggest proportion of agricultural production kang et al 2017 wang et al 2019 thus the grain trade requires greater attention to water scarcity and water security in china however a significant spatial imbalance occurs between the production and consumption of grain in china sun et al 2019 the inter provincial grain trade will result in the considerable geographical redistribution of water through vwfs which will make the situation of the water shortage more serious therefore it is necessary to identify the governing factors of the vwfs for understanding the less than ideal water use patterns and for building well informed regulations for saving water most of the previous research related to this issue is the studies on the role of water scarcity in international virtual water trade and on drivers of international vwfs table 1 many researchers believe that the theoretical foundation for the saving water function of the vwfs is the theory of comparative advantage in trade ansink 2010 debaere 2014 certain scholars do not agree with this view and believe that trading strategies based on the virtual water perspective are not consistent with the economic concept of comparative advantage wichelns 2010 2015 furthermore using the heckscher ohlin trade model ansink 2010 refute the claim that virtual water trade levels uneven water distribution and reduces the potential for water conflict in addition to the theoretical analysis some researches systematically analyze the major factors of the vwfs with various empirical analysis methods tamea et al 2014 found that population gross domestic product and geographical distance are the major drivers of virtual water flows with the gravity laws model fracasso 2014 and fracasso et al 2016 investigate the determinants of the bilateral vwf associated with international trade in agricultural goods with the gravity model and showed that bilateral vwfs are affected by the classical determinants of trade by national water endowments and by the level of pressure on water resources tuninetti et al 2017b regarded geographical distances population and fertilizer use as the governing factors of the vwfs with the gravity law model chouchane et al 2018 takes gross domestic product gdp irrigated land precipitation and population as the major drivers with a multiple regression model cui et al 2018 proposes that water use competition among sectors of the economic system determine the direction of virtual water flow as a result a virtual water strategy is not necessarily suitable for all water scarce areas duarte et al 2019 considers that the environmental condition economic and population growth are the major drivers by the means of trade gravity approach researchers have analyzed the drivers of international vwfs of food trade systematically and with rich results however few studies have focused on inter regional vwfs within a country and explained the unsustainable virtual water flows at the national level although some studies have analyzed the driving force of virtual water exports and imports or water footprint change in a city or a country with decomposition analysis xu et al 2015 feng et al 2017 tuninetti et al 2017a the results of these studies can only provide single angle information production angle or consumption angle the only two studies focus on the drivers of regional bilateral virtual water transfers within a country are cai et al 2019 and zhao et al 2019 cai et al 2019 studied the drivers of comprehensive trade vwf in china using structural decomposition analysis with the result that local efficiency gains and consumption pattern changes are the major drivers of the vwfs in addition to water zhao et al 2019 considers the other production factor land and labor and explains the inter regional vwfs within a country with comparative advantage theory it is found that the current market forces reflect the scarcity of land resources but does not reflect the water scarcity in the context of interregional trade in china although the two studies make a good attempt and provide useful information the underlying cause for domestic vwfs is still not clear taking china throughout 1997 2015 as a case this study analyses the drivers of domestic grain vwfs using an integrated method that combines a logarithmic mean divisia index lmdi decomposition method and a gravity model this paper makes fresh attempts in the following four aspects 1 although much research has explored vwf patterns in china few systematic studies on the origins of these patterns exist and the results are not clear this work contributes to studies on drivers of the inter regional vwf trend which is also meaningful for international vwfs because inter regional trade within a country is the end of the process of economic globalization and trade liberalization 2 the lmdi decomposition method which has been firmly established as the preferred approach in index decomposition analysis ida has been widely adopted in energy and emission studies ang 2015 the popularity of the lmdi approach stems from its multiple desirable properties such as its theoretical foundation adaptability ease of use and interpretation of results ang 2004 it has not been used in decomposing vwfs and the approach in this study proved that this method provides clear results 3 often referred to as the workhorse in international trade the gravity model is one of the most popular and successful frameworks in economics this model has a form similar to newton s law of universal gravitation and can usually be used to study and quantify the effects of various determinants of international trade yotov et al 2016 compared to other trade models the gravity model is more intuitive and flexible and is based on solid theoretical foundations because one of the important parts of grain vwfs is grain trade we develop a gravity model of the vwfs to study the determinants of inter regional grain vwfs compared with previous research using this model the model form and variable selection of this study are very different on the one hand the model is not like the international trade gravity model rather we pay more attention to the effects of variables that can explain regional grain production and grain expenditure other than those factors such as contiguity linguistic heterogeneity trade and monetary arrangements which is non negligible for international trade on the other hand the basic gravity model used here is derived from economic theory and the variables were selected according to economic knowledge 4 an integrated method combining the lmdi decomposition method and the gravity model is proposed in this work the lmdi method is used to decompose the changes in vwf based on it the vwf gravity model is developed to clarify the specific drivers of domestic grain vwf by combining the results of these two methods the social economic and natural driving forces underlying the domestic vwf and their magnitudes are expounded in this study the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the method and data resources used to calculate decompose and explain grain vwf in china section 3 describes and analyses the results of empirical research sections 4 and 5 provide some discussion and present the primary conclusions 2 methodology and data 2 1 method of assessing inter regional grain virtual water flows the vwf of grain crops from region i to region j is calculated as follows hoekstra et al 2011 sun et al 2016 1 vwf ij uwf i g ij wf i gp i g ij gwf i bwf i gp i g ij where vwf ij is the virtual water flow of grain crops from region i to region j m 3 uwf i is the water footprint of per unit mass of grain in region i m 3 kg g ij is the amount of grain transfer from region i to region j kg uwf wf i gp i where wf i is the total water footprint of the process of growing grain in region i m 3 and gp i is the total grain production of region i kg the water footprint measures all the crop water use during crop growth that is the amount of water embedded in crops virtual water the water footprint is the sum of the green water footprint gwf and the blue water footprint bwf the former refers to the rain water used in crop growth and the latter refers to the crop water from the irrigation system following hoekstra et al 2011 the green and blue water footprints of crops can be estimated with the food and agriculture organization s cropwat model food and agriculture organization 2016 2 gwf 10 min et c pre e s bwf 10 max 0 et c pre e s where et c is the crop evapotranspiration of grain mm pre e is the effective precipitation during the growth period of grain mm s i is the sown area of grain ha the 10 converts water depths in millimetres into water volumes per land surface in m 3 ha the crop evapotranspiration et c and the effective precipitation pre e were calculated for each 10 day period and summed for the length of the growing period using the cropwat 8 0 model food and agriculture organization 2016 in this model the crop evapotranspiration et c is calculated by multiplying the reference crop evapotranspiration et 0 by the crop coefficient k c k c depends on the growing stage of the crop calculation of reference crop evapotranspiration was based on the penman monteith method allen et al 1998 the effective precipitation during the growth period of grain is calculated according to the method developed by the united states department of agriculture usda according to doll and siebert 2002 the grain transfer between regions is calculated as follows wang et al 2014 sun et al 2016 3 g ij g i g i 0 g i g j g i 0 g j 0 0 g i 0 or g i 0 where g i is the total net grain export of region i kg g i is calculated as follows 4 g i gp i pop i gp i pop i where pop i is the population of region i capita 2 2 the logarithmic mean divisia index decomposition method the lmdi approach involves variations in the following three dimensions method lmdi i versus lmdi ii decomposition procedure additive versus multiplicative decomposition and aggregate indicator quantity indicator versus intensity indicator ang 2015 considering the study objectives and the additional desirable properties of the lmdi i consistent in aggregation and perfect in decomposition at the subcategory level the additive and quantity indicator lmdi i model is selected based on eq 1 the vwf of grain crops from region i to region j is equal to the product of the unit water footprint of grain production in region i region j s share of the total grain export from region i g i region i s share of the total grain trade and the total grain trade g the vwf is as follows 5 vwf ij uwf i g ij j i g ij j i g ij i j i g ij i j i g ij uwf i g ij g i g i g g from period 0 to period t the aggregate changes from vwf ij 0 uwf i 0 g ij 0 g i 0 g i 0 g 0 g 0 to vwf ij t uwf i t g ij t g i t g i t g t g t lmdi i additive decomposition is as follows ang 2004 6 vwf ij vwf ij t vwf ij 0 vwf ie ij vwf cse ij vwf pse ij vwf se ij vwf ie ij l vwf ij t vwf ij 0 ln uwf i t uwf i 0 vwf cse ij l vwf ij

numbers a and b given by 7 l a b a b ln a ln b a b a a b therefore the trends in grain vwf between regions in a country can be explained by the intensity effect ie which identifies the contribution of changes in unit water footprints to changes in vwf between regions the consumption structure effect cse which quantifies how changes in the import region composition of grain exports from specific regions affect vwf between regions the production structure effect pse which indicates the extent to which variations in the contribution of export regions to total grain transfer affect vwf between regions and the scale effect se which measures how much of the change in vwf is explained by changes in the volume of grain transfer 8 ie vwf ie ij vwf ij 100 l vwf ij t vwf ij 0 vwf ij ln uwf i t uwf

vwf ij t vwf ij 0 vwf ij ln g t g 0 100 the lmdi formulae contain logarithmic terms and the variables cannot have negative values this is a limitation of the lmdi although there are no negative values zero values occur in this study to eliminate this problem all zero vwf and grain export values in the dataset are replaced by a small positive constant 10 10 the results converge as the small positive constant approaches zero ang et al 1998 2 3 an empirical gravity model of grain virtual water flows the complete gravity model of trade is as follows yotov et al 2016 9 x ij b y i e j t ij θ t ij θ t ij π i p j σ 1 π i j t ij p j 1 σ e i y p j i ρ i p i t ij 1 σ 1 1 σ where x ij is export from regions i to j b is the inverse of total production b 1 y y i is region i s domestic production e j is region j s aggregate expenditure t ij θ is the total trade cost between regions i and j t ij is the bilateral trade cost σ is the elasticity of substitution among goods from different regions and ρ is the preference parameter t ij is typically approximated in the literature by various geographic and trade policy variables such as bilateral distance 1 π i represents outward multilateral resistances and measures exporter i s ease of market access and 1 p j represents inward multilateral resistance and measures importer j s ease of market access anderson and van wincoop 2003 based on the above common model the gravity model of grain vwf can be developed as follows 10 vwf ij uwf i 1 i gp i gp i ge j t ij π i p j σ 1 where ge j is the grain expenditure of the region j in yuan the candidate explanatory variables of the vwf can be classified into six distinct categories the per unit water footprint of the exporter uwf i the grain production of the exporter gp i the grain expenditure of the importer ge j the trade costs between the exporter and the importer t ij the outward push force of the exporter π i and the inward pull force of the importer p j we select four variables to explain per unit water footprint these include two meteorological variables annual average temperature tem i c and annual total sunshine hours of region sh i h a water endowment variable the amount of water resources per land area wr i m 3 ha and an irrigation variable the share of grain irrigation area in total grain sown area ia i to account for grain production we consider the following three variables the rural population per hectare of arable land rp i capita ha the power of agricultural machinery per hectare of arable land m i kw ha and the consumption of chemical fertilizer per hectare of arable land f i kg ha three variables are selected to explain grain expenditure namely the gross domestic product gdp j yuan the ratio of per capita consumption to per capita income cr j and engel s coefficient ec j which is computed as the ratio of income spent on food to total expenditures one variable namely the geographical distance between two regions d ij km is selected to explain trade costs although in studies of international trade it is common to consider other factors such as contiguity linguistic heterogeneity trade and monetary arrangements these factors are not included in this study because they do not have a large effect on inter regional trade within a country one variable is selected as a proxy of outward push force π i namely the ratio of rural to urban per capita income rui i one variable is selected as a proxy of inward pull force p j namely the ratio of non arable land area to total land area na j to avoid multicollinearity the outward push force variables and inward pull force variables are not symmetrical by introducing the above described explanatory variables the form of the estimated gravity model of grain vwf can be rewritten as 11 vwf ij α 1 tem

α 4 with eq 12 the ordinary least squares ols estimator can be used to estimate the gravity model of the vwf an obvious drawback of the ols approach however is that ols cannot take into account the information contained in zero trade flows because these observations are simply eliminated from the estimation sample when the value of the vwf is logarithmically transformed we will use three approaches to handle the presence of zero vwf and will discuss the result in the following sections one method is to apply the ols approach after adding 1 to all vwf values the second method is to estimate in two stages as proposed by helpman et al 2008 i a first stage probit estimation that determines the probability of export and ii a second stage ols estimation based on the positive sample of the vwf the third method is to apply the poisson pseudo maximum likelihood ppml estimator to estimate the model this estimates the model in multiplicative form instead of logarithmic form and

work in the method the changes in vwfs are decomposed into four effect the intensity effect variations in the unit water footprint the consumption structure effect changes in grain importer structure the production structure effect changes in grain exporter structure and the scale effect growth in the volume of grain transfer with the lmdi method firstly based on that a vwf gravity model is developed to analyze the social economic and natural driving force behind the four changes and the total domestic grain vwfs the nexus between the lmdi method and the gravity model is shown in fig 1 four variables annual average temperature annual total sunshine hours of the region the amount of water resources per land area and the share of the grain irrigation area in total grain sown area is selected to explain per unit water footprint in vwf gravity model and which corresponds to the intensity effect in lmdi decomposition the grain production of the exporter and the grain expenditure of the importer in the vwf gravity model correspond to the production structure effect and the consumption structure effect in lmdi decomposition respectively in addition the corresponding variables in the vwf gravity model for the scale effect in lmdi decomposition is trade costs between the exporter and the importer the outward push force of the exporter and the inward pull force of importer 2 5 study area and data description the research area in this study is mainland china taiwan hong kong and macao are not included in this study provincial panel data are used to illustrate inter regional grain vwf trends and to estimate the determinants of the vwf trends 31 provinces autonomous regions and municipal cities from 1997 to 2015 the data used to estimate and decompose grain vwf include the

affairs of the people s republic of china 2016 the total amount of water resources was obtained from the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2015 the geographical data are available from the national geometrics center of china 2016 and the longitudes and latitudes of the geographical centers of regions and the distances between regions were calculated using r table 2 shows summary statistics for the variables in the vwf gravity model 3 results 3 1 inter regional grain virtual water flows in china the total water footprint of grain production in china decreased slowly over the period 1997 2015 the smallest value 560 54 billion m 3 was observed in 2001 and the largest value 739 66 billion m 3 was observed in 1998 fig 2 the contribution of the water scarce northern region to the water footprint of national grain production increased steadily from 45 06 in 1997 to 54 29 in 2015 compared to the water rich southern region over the study period 1997 2015 the total gross inter regional trade of grain virtual water increased by a factor of 1 76 from 73 00 to 128 28 billion m 3 fig 3 on average 39 35 of the trade is virtual blue water trade and 60 65 of the trade is virtual green water trade the net positive vwf within china moved from northern to southern china and the size of this flow increased over time the lowest ratio of the vwf from northern to southern china to the total inter regional trade in china was 33 28 in 2000 and the largest was 78 42 in 2013 by 2015 the net grain vwf from northern to southern china reached 98 33 billion m 3 equivalent to 28 04 of the total water footprint of grain production in northern china the main driving factor for this change was the rapid increase in grain production in northern china and the rapid increase in the population of southern china fig 4 presents the annual average virtual water trade balances of all provinces from 1997 to 2015 for total vwf as well as for blue and green virtual water trade individually positive balances reflect net virtual water import and negative balances indicate net virtual water export over the period 1997 2015 heilongjiang was the largest net virtual water exporting province 34 64 billion m 3 year followed by jilin 15 74 billion m 3 year and inner mongolia 10 93 billion m 3 year the three largest exporters are all located in the north guangdong zhejiang and fujian in the south were the largest net importers their annual average grain virtual water imports were 25 57 12 52 and 8 09 billion m 3 year respectively however jiangsu hunan jiangxi hebei and liaoning were net grain virtual water exporters and hubei tibet sichuan chongqing gansu and yunnan were net grain virtual water importers over 1997 2015 these provinces were not net water exporters or importers throughout the entire period of the study for example jiangsu and hunan changed from net grain virtual water exporters to net grain virtual water importers in 2011 and 2013 respectively in most years except 1998 and 2015 jiangxi and hebei respectively were exporters sichuan has been a steady net grain virtual water exporter since 2006 tibet gansu and yunan were importers except in 2000 2003 2014 and 2003 respectively the inter regional virtual water related to grain trade changed over the study period fig 5 northeast china was always a net virtual water exporter central china was a net virtual water exporter for almost all years south china and southwest china were net virtual water importers during the entire study period north china was a net virtual water importer for most years east china changed to a net grain virtual water importer in 2000 northwest china changed from a net grain virtual water importer to a net grain virtual water exporter in 2011 the details of inter regional grain vwf in china for 1997 2001 and 2011 2015 are shown in fig 6 in the period 1997 2001 the three largest vwfs were from northeast china to south china 46 89 billion m 3 from northeast china to east china 36 76 billion m 3 and from northeast china to north china 26 98 billion m 3 in the period 2011 2015 these three flows were still the largest and the values increased to 135 58 120 55 and 53 44 billion m 3 respectively comparing the vwfs in the more recent 5 year period with those in the earlier 5 year period it can be observed that southwest china became a pure importer and northeast china became a pure exporter northwest china increased flows to north china and east china north china increased flows to east china it can be seen that there is a continuously growing vwf trend within china from northern and western china to southern and eastern china the main reason behind this trend is the rapid increase in grain production in northern and western china combined with the rapid increase in population in southern and eastern china however because of the water resources distribution in china in which northern and western china exporters are water scarce regions and southern and eastern china importers are water rich regions this pattern of inter province virtual water trade is unsustainable the water resources distribution pattern in china has been remarkably state these years as shown in fig 6 the existing vwf trend places increasing pressure on the already limited water resources of northern china 3 2 decomposition analysis of virtual water flow changes in the following a lmdi decomposition method is applied to study the role of variations in the unit water footprint ie changes in grain importer structure cse changes in grain exporter structure pse and increased volume of grain transfer se in driving the increase in virtual water trade between 1997 and 2015 the total gross inter regional trade in grain virtual water increased by 55 28 billion m 3 between 1997 and 2015 fig 3 the decomposition results are shown in fig 7 the ie cse pse and se are 40 81 22 56 billion m 3 8 69 4 80 billion m 3 7 60 4 20 billion m 3 and 124 53 68 83 billion m 3 respectively the se that is the significant increase in grain exchange during these years with all other factors held constant was the most important driver of the increase in grain vwf the volume of grain trade grew by a factor of 2 34 from 5 17 to 12 12 billion kg between 1997 and 2015 fig 8 the unit water footprint of grain production in china is decreasing fig 8 and drives down the amount of grain vwf therefore ie is a negative driver of grain vwf although it does not offset the boost provided by the se between 1997 and 2015 the grain production and consumption structure changed fig 9 some of the significant changes are listed here certain provinces henan heilongjiang and jilin increased their shares of grain exports by 11 49 from 3 11 to 14 60 7 19 from 30 73 to 37 91 and 5 35 from 14 44 to 19 79 respectively guangdong zhejiang and beijing increased their shares of grain imports by 10 98 from 18 39 to 29 37 8 74 from 5 77 to 14 51 and 2 51 from 5 09 to 7 60 respectively liaoning changed from a grain importer 6 93 to a grain exporter 0 13 yunan guizhou and gansu reduced their shares of grain imports by 5 13 from 7 39 to 2 25 4 87 from 8 33 to 3 47 and 4 60 from 4 67 to 0 06 respectively jiangsu hunan and sichuan changed from grain exporters to grain importers hubei and shandong reduced their shares of grain exports by 4 64 from 5 06 to 0 42 and 3 81 from 5 86 to 2 05 respectively these changes in the shares of provinces in the grain trade also involved an increase in the exchanges of grain virtual water inter annual variations in virtual water trade in china and their decomposition results are shown in fig 10 compared with the decomposition result between 1997 and 2015 the ie plays a more significant role in the inter annual variation of virtual water trade in china although the unit water footprint exhibited a declining trend over the period 1997 2015 in certain years 1998 2001 2009 2011 2012 and 2014 the increase in unit water footprint was the main force driving up the vwf compared with the cse s the pse s yields a clearer result the provincial variations in vwf between 1997 and 2015 and their decomposition results are shown in fig 11 grain virtual water export per province and fig 12 grain virtual water import per province sichuan hunan jiangsu and hebei changed from grain virtual water exporters to importers in 2015 compared to 1997 the direction for liaoning reversed over the same period consistent with the decomposition results for the whole country the se encouraged grain virtual water trade expansion while the ie prevented greater virtual water transfer some differences occur when examining the two structure effects to exporters the pse is a decisive factor in the direction of virtual water trade increasing grain virtual water export is associated with positive pse s and decreasing grain virtual water export is associated with negative pse s symmetrically the change in grain virtual water import is accompanied by a change in the share of the regional grain import for the whole country 3 3 gravity model analysis of virtual water flows the results obtained with the gravity model are shown in table 3 columns 1 and 2 use the ols estimator adding 1 to all vwf data to deal with zero values columns 3 4 and 5 show the results of two stage ols estimation and columns 6 and 7 employ the ppml estimator columns 2 5 and 7 control importer exporter and time fixed effects and estimate robust standard errors note that estimating gravity equations with fixed effects for the importer and exporter which could be used to capture the multilateral resistance terms is a common practice and is recommended by major empirical trade economists year dummy variables are added to define the impact of the total volume of the grain trade the estimated effect of the coefficient on the logarithm is the elasticity of the value of virtual water trade flows the table reports the estimated coefficients of the explanatory variables the t values are given in parentheses as reported in table 3 the overall estimation results are as expected with r 2 0 581 0 810 and 0 956 the econometric specification delivers the standard fit the estimates of most of the variables are statistically significant and have the expected signs this result confirms the good descriptive capability of the selected drivers for the grain virtual water trade especially the ppml estimator among the variables that might explain the unit water footprint temperature and sunshine hours have a significant negative influence while the amount of water resources per land area has a positive influence on virtual water export for most of the models the ppml estimates column 7 of the effect of temperature are significantly positive the estimate of the ratio of grain irrigation area to the total grain sown area varies between different estimators this factor has a negative impact on the volume of grain virtual water export in the general model however the impact changes to positive when importer exporter and time dummy variables are included among the variables for explaining grain production the power of agricultural machinery and the consumption of chemical fertilizer are positive and statistically significant however grain vwf is inversely related to the rural population one possible reason for this is that the rural population variable is not closely related to the amount of agricultural labor but instead represents consumers of grain which will drive down the net grain virtual water export the effects of the variables that explain grain consumption and the engel s coefficient are positive and statistically significant for all estimates the estimates of gdp and the ratio of consumption are significant and positive for most of the estimates gdp has a negative influence on virtual water import but a positive influence on the volume of virtual water import in the two stage model the influence of the ratio of consumption is exactly the opposite among the variables that might explain the trade cost between two regions the influence of the ratio of rural and urban per capita income for exporters and the ratio of non arable land area to total land area for exporters is as expected positive and significant the estimate of the effect of distance is ambiguous in the general model distance has a negative effect on grain vwf and on whether there is net grain virtual water export from one region to another however the direction of the impact is inverted or the impact is changed insignificantly when the number of the vwfs is investigated using a fixed effect model the result is very different from the results of previous studies that addressed international trade the reason for this is that geographical distance is not an important barrier to inter regional trade of virtual water within a country as in china in this study and the industrial division among regions promotes grain transfer across remote regions compared to the ols estimates in columns 2 and 5 the ppml estimates with fixed effects that are listed in column 7 of table 3 show differences in terms of magnitude significance and even sign considering the qualities of the ppml estimator the ppml estimator is more favored than the ols estimator ppml estimates obtained using fixed effects indicate that temperature amount of water resources proportion of irrigation area power of agricultural machinery consumption of chemical fertilizers ratio of rural to urban income in the export region gdp ratio of consumption engel s coefficient and the proportion of non arable land area in the import region are the major drivers of grain vwf 3 4 results combining the lmdi and gravity model methods the relationship between the drivers decomposed with lmdi and the drivers obtained using the gravity model is shown in fig 13 the different effects of the drivers on vwf can be seen clearly natural conditions such as temperature the amount of water resource and the proportion of irrigation area can cause variations in the unit water footprint ie that account for 40 81 of the vwf this indicates that although the three determinants are important drivers of the vwf they are limited in their effects in the export region of the vwf the ratio of rural to urban income in the export region and the proportion of non arable land area in the import region will affect the growth in the volume of grain transfer se which account for 124 53 of the vwf this means that rural and urban incomes in the export region and the proportion of non arable land areas in the import region are the most important drivers of the vwf rural and urban incomes in the export region represent the economic foundation for grain trade and can be seen as a determinant of the supply of grain as an outward push force of the exporter in addition as an inward pull force of the importer the proportion of non arable land areas in the import region represents the demand for grain because there will be a less arable land area with the rapid development of the economy resulting in a greater proportion of the non arable land area as can be seen grain production will increase if income increases and this will create a supply of grain on the other hand with the rapid development of industry the arable area will decrease creating more demand for grain the power of agricultural machinery and the consumption of chemical fertilizers can cause changes in grain exporter structure pse which accounts for 7 6 of the vwf this means that these two elements are less important drivers of the vwf these two elements can be seen as an effect of technological advances in grain production gdp the ratio of consumption and engel s coefficient will affect changes in grain importer structure cse which accounts for 8 69 of the vwf this means that gdp the ratio of consumption and engel s coefficient are also less important drivers of the vwf these three elements can be seen as overall economic conditions in grain importing regions when the lmdi is combined with the gravity model different effects of the ten drivers on vwf are found rural and urban incomes in the export region and the proportion of non arable land areas in the import region which correspond to se are found to be the most important drivers of the vwf natural conditions such as temperature the amount of water resource and the proportion of irrigation area which correspond to ie are also important drivers although they are indeed constraint elements of the vwf in addition the power of agricultural machinery the consumption of chemical fertilizers the gdp the ratio of consumption and engel s coefficient which together correspond to pse and cse are found to be less important drivers of the vwf therefore regional economy division rather than water resource endowment is the main driving factor 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of results although a few pieces of research are focusing on the drivers of domestic vwfs many researchers studied the drivers of international vwfs using various methods as shown in table 1 some studies targeted the volume of virtual water flows of a country or the world as a whole using decomposition analysis and with the result that trade or scale effect is the main driver duarte et al 2016b a the gravity model is built on solid trade theory however it is a regression model essentially and a sufficient number of samples is necessary with this method that is why it is used mainly in research about bilateral virtual water trade flows between countries fracasso 2014 tamea et al 2014 fracasso et al 2016 duarte et al 2019 in addition another research analysis net virtual water import of crops in tunisia using a common multiple regression model the water endowments population gross domestic product and geographical distance are demonstrated as the main drivers of bilateral virtual water trade flows between countries in these studies this study investigates the drivers of domestic vwfs related to the production of grain by combining the lmdi decomposition method with a gravity model lmdi decomposition points the way for framework building and variables selection of gravity model and gravity model provides the theoretical foundation and extended the results of the lmdi decomposition by combining the two approaches we cannot only identify the drivers of domestic grain vwfs but can also clarify which drivers are vital in domestic grain vwf in china the same with the result of research studying the whole volume of virtual water flows using decomposition analysis duarte et al 2016b a growth in the volume of product transfer is the main driver the detailed comparison of results using different decomposition methods is discussed in section 4 2 it is worth mentioning that cai et al 2019 analyzed the drivers of domestic vwfs using structural decomposition analysis with the result that water use efficiency and consumption pattern were the major drivers the reason is that the object in this study is all products not only grain food or agricultural products as our study and duarte et al 2016b a compare with those studies analyzing bilateral virtual water trade flows between countries the result of this study is very different water endowments and geographical distance are demonstrated as have not significant influences in domestic vwfs domestic vwfs are governed primarily by industrial distribution and regional division in the national economy our results have important significance for agricultural water resources management for a country and the earth on the one hand this study provides a reasonable explanation for the unsustainable virtual water flows at the national level that has been observed by this study and many studies in china zhang and anadon 2014 zhuo et al 2016 and in india katyaini and barua 2017 it is worth noted that zhao et al 2019 also paid attention to this problem and provide another explanation with comparative advantage theory that study shows that the current market forces reflect the scarcity of land resources however does not reflect the water scarcity in the context of interregional trade in china zhao et al 2019 the proportion of non arable land area in the import region which correspond to se are also found to be one of the most important drivers of the vwf in our study on the other hand the results are also meaningful for international virtual trade as that the end of the process of economic globalization and trade liberalization is close to domestic vwfs 4 2 another decomposition method the lmdi method has several advantages including ease of formulation perfect decomposition simple interpretation of results and consistent aggregation ang 2005 however other decomposition methods are also used to decompose vwf we applied another decomposition method developed by duarte et al 2016b and compared the decomposition results for the variable vwf ij which depends on the explicative factors uwf i g ij g i g i g and g additive decomposition can be obtained through the total differential using the average of the two polar decompositions the changes in vwf from region i to region j can thus be decomposed as follows 14 vwf ij vwf ie ij vwf cse ij vwf pse ij vwf se ij vwf ie ij uwf i g ijt 1 g it 1 g it 1 g t 1 g t 1 uwf i g ijt g it g it g t g t 2 vwf cse ij uwf it g ij g i g it 1 g t 1 g t 1 uwf it 1 g ij g i g it g t g t 2 vwf pse ij uwf it g ijt g it g i g g t 1 uwf it 1 g ijt 1 g it 1 g i g g t 2 vwf se ij uwf it g ijt g it g it g t g uwf it 1 g ijt 1 g it 1 g it 1 g t 1 g 2 the decomposition results obtained using this method are essentially consistent with the results of the lmdi method fig 14 the ie cse pse and se are 54 52 0 32 0 43 and 155 26 respectively the grain virtual water export expansion is entirely due to se s while the other three effects prevent greater vwf both the cse and the pse show negative signs 4 3 symmetry of the virtual water flow in the previous section we used eq 3 to test the net grain vwf between regions the test implies that the vwf from region j to region i is zero when the vwf from region i to region j is positive the driving factors and their influencing forces should theoretically be the same for vwf ij and symmetric vwf ji here we remove the symmetrical zero vwf data and re estimate the grain vwf gravity model to obtain clearer results the estimates obtained using the model are reported in table 4 the estimates of the effects of variables are qualitatively identical to the results presented in section 3 the only notable difference is that all the coefficients decreased in the new specification this result is expected due to the presence of fewer zero value dependent variables in the model overall these results reinforce the conclusions based on the results shown in table 3 5 conclusions this study investigates the drivers of domestic vwfs related to the production of grain by combining the lmdi decomposition method with a gravity model by combining the two approaches we can not only identify the drivers of domestic grain vwfs but can also clarify which drivers are vital the main conclusions are as follows one is that there is a trend toward the separation of grain consumers and grain producers in china it is even found that the distance between regions has a positive effect on grain vwf the other finding is that domestic virtual water trade is governed by industrial distribution and regional division in the national economy rather than by water endowment the concentration of a growing portion of agricultural production in more arid regions creates pressing problems related to the sustainability of water use the mismatch between industrial layout and water distribution is the fundamental cause for this unsustainable trend in virtual water flows there is a need to rethink policy governing agriculture and water use at the national and state level to solve this problem on the one hand water scarce and water rich areas should be distinguished for different policies in water scarce regions policy should focus on saving water and limiting water use should include water pricing that reflects scarcity conditions and should promote improvements in water saving technology in water rich regions policy should focus on encouraging water intensive agriculture production including economic incentives to improve the enthusiasm for growing grain and developing high tech agriculture to overcome the challenges limiting arable land on the other hand as a whole national strategies regarding industrial distribution and regional division also must be based on a broader set of information that includes the virtual water trade and water endowment of each region this study provides a reasonable explanation for the unsustainable virtual water flows at the national level that have important relevance for agricultural water resources management both nationally and worldwide there is room for improvement for example the accuracy of inter regional grain trade calculation could be improved given the paucity of definite data detailing inter provincial trade within a country a method such as the input output model the general equilibrium model and linear programming optimization could allow more accurate simulations another is that the gravity model for vwfs has huge potential to be developed and used in the agricultural water management field a gravity model could be developed that details multilateral resistance and trade costs to study and quantify the effects of various water policies such a model could be integrated within a wide class of broader general equilibrium models in order to study the ripple effects of the water policies in other countries regions and sectors conflict of interest none declared acknowledgments this work is

10558,trade can conserve water resources in an administrative region if the region imports water intensive commodities rather than producing them domestically however many recent studies of domestic virtual water flows vwfs have found that there is a net vwf from water scarce regions to water rich regions within large countries such as china inter provincial grain trade will result in a considerable geographical redistribution of water through vwfs which will make the situation of the water shortage more serious therefore it is necessary to identify the governing factors of the vwfs to understand the less than ideal water use patterns and to build well informed regulations for saving water taking grain production in china as a case study this paper studies the drivers of inter regional vwfs an integrated method combining a logarithmic mean divisia index lmdi decomposition method and a gravity model is proposed in this work in the method the changes in vwfs are decomposed into four portions with the lmdi method firstly based on that a vwf gravity model is developed to analyze the social economic and natural driving force behind the four changes and the total domestic grain vwfs the main empirical results are as follows 1 there is a trend toward the separation of grain consumers and grain producers in china net positive vwf within china has occurred from water scarce north to water rich south and there has been a sharp growth trend in the size of this flow over time the existing pattern of inter province virtual water trade is exacerbating scarcities in already water scarce regions 2 the growth of grain exchanges was responsible for most of the increase in grain vwf the decreasing unit water footprint of grain production drives down the number of grain vwfs however this decrease cannot offset the boost provided by the other effects 3 water endowments and geographical distance are demonstrated as have not significant influences in domestic vwfs the most important drivers of inter regional vwf within a country is the outward push force of the exporter and the inward pull force of the importer the technological level of grain production and the economic conditions in the import region are less important drivers the results indicate that the domestic vwfs of the grain trade are governed primarily by industrial distribution and regional division in the national economy rather than by water endowment although implementing water saving policies in water scarce and water export regions further helped to alleviate this situation the fundamental solution is to change the industrial distribution and regional division in the national economy keywords virtual water flows vwfs grain production inter regional logarithmic mean divisia index lmdi decomposition method gravity model 1 introduction a water footprint a multi dimensional measure of freshwater that can be used both directly and indirectly by producers and consumers makes it possible to analyze the link between human consumption and the appropriation of water to produce the products consumed hoekstra 2013 the term virtual water refers to the amount of water embedded in traded products fracasso et al 2016 trade in water intensive commodities results in so called virtual water flows vwfs between exporting and importing regions trade can conserve water resources in an administrative region if the region imports water intensive commodities rather than producing them domestically chapagain et al 2006 however many recent studies of domestic vwfs have found that there is a net vwf from water scarce regions to water rich regions within a large country like china ma et al 2006 guan and hubacek 2007 zhang and anadon 2014 dalin et al 2014 sun et al 2013 zhao et al 2015 zhuo et al 2016 and india verma et al 2009 katyaini and barua 2017 which makes the situation more serious in areas in which water is scarce and creates pressing problems related to the sustainability of water use china has already faced the situation of water scarcity as a result of that the per capita water volume only accounts for a quarter of the world average moreover the northern part of china has been facing increasingly severe water scarcity as a result of topographical distribution jiang 2015 agriculture accounts for the greatest proportion of water use and grain production accounts for the biggest proportion of agricultural production kang et al 2017 wang et al 2019 thus the grain trade requires greater attention to water scarcity and water security in china however a significant spatial imbalance occurs between the production and consumption of grain in china sun et al 2019 the inter provincial grain trade will result in the considerable geographical redistribution of water through vwfs which will make the situation of the water shortage more serious therefore it is necessary to identify the governing factors of the vwfs for understanding the less than ideal water use patterns and for building well informed regulations for saving water most of the previous research related to this issue is the studies on the role of water scarcity in international virtual water trade and on drivers of international vwfs table 1 many researchers believe that the theoretical foundation for the saving water function of the vwfs is the theory of comparative advantage in trade ansink 2010 debaere 2014 certain scholars do not agree with this view and believe that trading strategies based on the virtual water perspective are not consistent with the economic concept of comparative advantage wichelns 2010 2015 furthermore using the heckscher ohlin trade model ansink 2010 refute the claim that virtual water trade levels uneven water distribution and reduces the potential for water conflict in addition to the theoretical analysis some researches systematically analyze the major factors of the vwfs with various empirical analysis methods tamea et al 2014 found that population gross domestic product and geographical distance are the major drivers of virtual water flows with the gravity laws model fracasso 2014 and fracasso et al 2016 investigate the determinants of the bilateral vwf associated with international trade in agricultural goods with the gravity model and showed that bilateral vwfs are affected by the classical determinants of trade by national water endowments and by the level of pressure on water resources tuninetti et al 2017b regarded geographical distances population and fertilizer use as the governing factors of the vwfs with the gravity law model chouchane et al 2018 takes gross domestic product gdp irrigated land precipitation and population as the major drivers with a multiple regression model cui et al 2018 proposes that water use competition among sectors of the economic system determine the direction of virtual water flow as a result a virtual water strategy is not necessarily suitable for all water scarce areas duarte et al 2019 considers that the environmental condition economic and population growth are the major drivers by the means of trade gravity approach researchers have analyzed the drivers of international vwfs of food trade systematically and with rich results however few studies have focused on inter regional vwfs within a country and explained the unsustainable virtual water flows at the national level although some studies have analyzed the driving force of virtual water exports and imports or water footprint change in a city or a country with decomposition analysis xu et al 2015 feng et al 2017 tuninetti et al 2017a the results of these studies can only provide single angle information production angle or consumption angle the only two studies focus on the drivers of regional bilateral virtual water transfers within a country are cai et al 2019 and zhao et al 2019 cai et al 2019 studied the drivers of comprehensive trade vwf in china using structural decomposition analysis with the result that local efficiency gains and consumption pattern changes are the major drivers of the vwfs in addition to water zhao et al 2019 considers the other production factor land and labor and explains the inter regional vwfs within a country with comparative advantage theory it is found that the current market forces reflect the scarcity of land resources but does not reflect the water scarcity in the context of interregional trade in china although the two studies make a good attempt and provide useful information the underlying cause for domestic vwfs is still not clear taking china throughout 1997 2015 as a case this study analyses the drivers of domestic grain vwfs using an integrated method that combines a logarithmic mean divisia index lmdi decomposition method and a gravity model this paper makes fresh attempts in the following four aspects 1 although much research has explored vwf patterns in china few systematic studies on the origins of these patterns exist and the results are not clear this work contributes to studies on drivers of the inter regional vwf trend which is also meaningful for international vwfs because inter regional trade within a country is the end of the process of economic globalization and trade liberalization 2 the lmdi decomposition method which has been firmly established as the preferred approach in index decomposition analysis ida has been widely adopted in energy and emission studies ang 2015 the popularity of the lmdi approach stems from its multiple desirable properties such as its theoretical foundation adaptability ease of use and interpretation of results ang 2004 it has not been used in decomposing vwfs and the approach in this study proved that this method provides clear results 3 often referred to as the workhorse in international trade the gravity model is one of the most popular and successful frameworks in economics this model has a form similar to newton s law of universal gravitation and can usually be used to study and quantify the effects of various determinants of international trade yotov et al 2016 compared to other trade models the gravity model is more intuitive and flexible and is based on solid theoretical foundations because one of the important parts of grain vwfs is grain trade we develop a gravity model of the vwfs to study the determinants of inter regional grain vwfs compared with previous research using this model the model form and variable selection of this study are very different on the one hand the model is not like the international trade gravity model rather we pay more attention to the effects of variables that can explain regional grain production and grain expenditure other than those factors such as contiguity linguistic heterogeneity trade and monetary arrangements which is non negligible for international trade on the other hand the basic gravity model used here is derived from economic theory and the variables were selected according to economic knowledge 4 an integrated method combining the lmdi decomposition method and the gravity model is proposed in this work the lmdi method is used to decompose the changes in vwf based on it the vwf gravity model is developed to clarify the specific drivers of domestic grain vwf by combining the results of these two methods the social economic and natural driving forces underlying the domestic vwf and their magnitudes are expounded in this study the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the method and data resources used to calculate decompose and explain grain vwf in china section 3 describes and analyses the results of empirical research sections 4 and 5 provide some discussion and present the primary conclusions 2 methodology and data 2 1 method of assessing inter regional grain virtual water flows the vwf of grain crops from region i to region j is calculated as follows hoekstra et al 2011 sun et al 2016 1 vwf ij uwf i g ij wf i gp i g ij gwf i bwf i gp i g ij where vwf ij is the virtual water flow of grain crops from region i to region j m 3 uwf i is the water footprint of per unit mass of grain in region i m 3 kg g ij is the amount of grain transfer from region i to region j kg uwf wf i gp i where wf i is the total water footprint of the process of growing grain in region i m 3 and gp i is the total grain production of region i kg the water footprint measures all the crop water use during crop growth that is the amount of water embedded in crops virtual water the water footprint is the sum of the green water footprint gwf and the blue water footprint bwf the former refers to the rain water used in crop growth and the latter refers to the crop water from the irrigation system following hoekstra et al 2011 the green and blue water footprints of crops can be estimated with the food and agriculture organization s cropwat model food and agriculture organization 2016 2 gwf 10 min et c pre e s bwf 10 max 0 et c pre e s where et c is the crop evapotranspiration of grain mm pre e is the effective precipitation during the growth period of grain mm s i is the sown area of grain ha the 10 converts water depths in millimetres into water volumes per land surface in m 3 ha the crop evapotranspiration et c and the effective precipitation pre e were calculated for each 10 day period and summed for the length of the growing period using the cropwat 8 0 model food and agriculture organization 2016 in this model the crop evapotranspiration et c is calculated by multiplying the reference crop evapotranspiration et 0 by the crop coefficient k c k c depends on the growing stage of the crop calculation of reference crop evapotranspiration was based on the penman monteith method allen et al 1998 the effective precipitation during the growth period of grain is calculated according to the method developed by the united states department of agriculture usda according to doll and siebert 2002 the grain transfer between regions is calculated as follows wang et al 2014 sun et al 2016 3 g ij g i g i 0 g i g j g i 0 g j 0 0 g i 0 or g i 0 where g i is the total net grain export of region i kg g i is calculated as follows 4 g i gp i pop i gp i pop i where pop i is the population of region i capita 2 2 the logarithmic mean divisia index decomposition method the lmdi approach involves variations in the following three dimensions method lmdi i versus lmdi ii decomposition procedure additive versus multiplicative decomposition and aggregate indicator quantity indicator versus intensity indicator ang 2015 considering the study objectives and the additional desirable properties of the lmdi i consistent in aggregation and perfect in decomposition at the subcategory level the additive and quantity indicator lmdi i model is selected based on eq 1 the vwf of grain crops from region i to region j is equal to the product of the unit water footprint of grain production in region i region j s share of the total grain export from region i g i region i s share of the total grain trade and the total grain trade g the vwf is as follows 5 vwf ij uwf i g ij j i g ij j i g ij i j i g ij i j i g ij uwf i g ij g i g i g g from period 0 to period t the aggregate changes from vwf ij 0 uwf i 0 g ij 0 g i 0 g i 0 g 0 g 0 to vwf ij t uwf i t g ij t g i t g i t g t g t lmdi i additive decomposition is as follows ang 2004 6 vwf ij vwf ij t vwf ij 0 vwf ie ij vwf cse ij vwf pse ij vwf se ij vwf ie ij l vwf ij t vwf ij 0 ln uwf i t uwf i 0 vwf cse ij l vwf ij

numbers a and b given by 7 l a b a b ln a ln b a b a a b therefore the trends in grain vwf between regions in a country can be explained by the intensity effect ie which identifies the contribution of changes in unit water footprints to changes in vwf between regions the consumption structure effect cse which quantifies how changes in the import region composition of grain exports from specific regions affect vwf between regions the production structure effect pse which indicates the extent to which variations in the contribution of export regions to total grain transfer affect vwf between regions and the scale effect se which measures how much of the change in vwf is explained by changes in the volume of grain transfer 8 ie vwf ie ij vwf ij 100 l vwf ij t vwf ij 0 vwf ij ln uwf i t uwf

vwf ij t vwf ij 0 vwf ij ln g t g 0 100 the lmdi formulae contain logarithmic terms and the variables cannot have negative values this is a limitation of the lmdi although there are no negative values zero values occur in this study to eliminate this problem all zero vwf and grain export values in the dataset are replaced by a small positive constant 10 10 the results converge as the small positive constant approaches zero ang et al 1998 2 3 an empirical gravity model of grain virtual water flows the complete gravity model of trade is as follows yotov et al 2016 9 x ij b y i e j t ij θ t ij θ t ij π i p j σ 1 π i j t ij p j 1 σ e i y p j i ρ i p i t ij 1 σ 1 1 σ where x ij is export from regions i to j b is the inverse of total production b 1 y y i is region i s domestic production e j is region j s aggregate expenditure t ij θ is the total trade cost between regions i and j t ij is the bilateral trade cost σ is the elasticity of substitution among goods from different regions and ρ is the preference parameter t ij is typically approximated in the literature by various geographic and trade policy variables such as bilateral distance 1 π i represents outward multilateral resistances and measures exporter i s ease of market access and 1 p j represents inward multilateral resistance and measures importer j s ease of market access anderson and van wincoop 2003 based on the above common model the gravity model of grain vwf can be developed as follows 10 vwf ij uwf i 1 i gp i gp i ge j t ij π i p j σ 1 where ge j is the grain expenditure of the region j in yuan the candidate explanatory variables of the vwf can be classified into six distinct categories the per unit water footprint of the exporter uwf i the grain production of the exporter gp i the grain expenditure of the importer ge j the trade costs between the exporter and the importer t ij the outward push force of the exporter π i and the inward pull force of the importer p j we select four variables to explain per unit water footprint these include two meteorological variables annual average temperature tem i c and annual total sunshine hours of region sh i h a water endowment variable the amount of water resources per land area wr i m 3 ha and an irrigation variable the share of grain irrigation area in total grain sown area ia i to account for grain production we consider the following three variables the rural population per hectare of arable land rp i capita ha the power of agricultural machinery per hectare of arable land m i kw ha and the consumption of chemical fertilizer per hectare of arable land f i kg ha three variables are selected to explain grain expenditure namely the gross domestic product gdp j yuan the ratio of per capita consumption to per capita income cr j and engel s coefficient ec j which is computed as the ratio of income spent on food to total expenditures one variable namely the geographical distance between two regions d ij km is selected to explain trade costs although in studies of international trade it is common to consider other factors such as contiguity linguistic heterogeneity trade and monetary arrangements these factors are not included in this study because they do not have a large effect on inter regional trade within a country one variable is selected as a proxy of outward push force π i namely the ratio of rural to urban per capita income rui i one variable is selected as a proxy of inward pull force p j namely the ratio of non arable land area to total land area na j to avoid multicollinearity the outward push force variables and inward pull force variables are not symmetrical by introducing the above described explanatory variables the form of the estimated gravity model of grain vwf can be rewritten as 11 vwf ij α 1 tem

α 4 with eq 12 the ordinary least squares ols estimator can be used to estimate the gravity model of the vwf an obvious drawback of the ols approach however is that ols cannot take into account the information contained in zero trade flows because these observations are simply eliminated from the estimation sample when the value of the vwf is logarithmically transformed we will use three approaches to handle the presence of zero vwf and will discuss the result in the following sections one method is to apply the ols approach after adding 1 to all vwf values the second method is to estimate in two stages as proposed by helpman et al 2008 i a first stage probit estimation that determines the probability of export and ii a second stage ols estimation based on the positive sample of the vwf the third method is to apply the poisson pseudo maximum likelihood ppml estimator to estimate the model this estimates the model in multiplicative form instead of logarithmic form and accounts for heteroscedasticity yotov et al 2016 13 vwf ij exp α β 1 ln tem i β 2 ln sh i β 3 ln wr i β 4 ln ia i β 5 ln rp i β 6 ln m i β 7 ln f i β 8 ln gdp j β 9 ln cr j β 10 ln ec j β 11 ln d ij β

work in the method the changes in vwfs are decomposed into four effect the intensity effect variations in the unit water footprint the consumption structure effect changes in grain importer structure the production structure effect changes in grain exporter structure and the scale effect growth in the volume of grain transfer with the lmdi method firstly based on that a vwf gravity model is developed to analyze the social economic and natural driving force behind the four changes and the total domestic grain vwfs the nexus between the lmdi method and the gravity model is shown in fig 1 four variables annual average temperature annual total sunshine hours of the region the amount of water resources per land area and the share of the grain irrigation area in total grain sown area is selected to explain per unit water footprint in vwf gravity model and which corresponds to the intensity effect in lmdi decomposition the grain production of the exporter and the grain expenditure of the importer in the vwf gravity model correspond to the production structure effect and the consumption structure effect in lmdi decomposition respectively in addition the corresponding variables in the vwf gravity model for the scale effect in lmdi decomposition is trade costs between the exporter and the importer the outward push force of the exporter and the inward pull force of importer 2 5 study area and data description the research area in this study is mainland china taiwan hong kong and macao are not included in this study provincial panel data are used to illustrate inter regional grain vwf trends and to estimate the determinants of the vwf trends 31 provinces autonomous regions and municipal cities from 1997 to 2015 the data used to estimate and decompose grain vwf include the grain production gp the sown area of grain s the population pop and the meteorological data used to calculate green and water footprints gwf and bwf respectively the grain production the sown area of grain and the population data were obtained from the chinese national bureau of statistics 1998 the meteorological data including minimum temperature maximum temperature wind speed relative humidity hours of sunshine and precipitation were obtained from the china meteorological data service center 2015 the data used to analyze the drivers of grain vwf include the annual average temperature tem the annual total sunshine hours sh the total amount of water resources and land area used to calculate wr and na the grain irrigation area used to calculate ia the rural population and arable land

year are all provincial data for the provincial capital city are used to represent the corresponding province s annual average temperature and annual total sunshine hours all of the data other than the data on land area the total amount of water resources and geographical data were obtained from the chinese national bureau of statistics 2016a the land area was taken from the ministry of civil affairs of the people s republic of china 2016 the total amount of water resources was obtained from the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2015 the geographical data are available from the national geometrics center of china 2016 and the longitudes and latitudes of the geographical centers of regions and the distances between regions were calculated using r table 2 shows summary statistics for the variables in the vwf gravity model 3 results 3 1 inter regional grain virtual water flows in china the total water footprint of grain production in china decreased slowly over the period 1997 2015 the smallest value 560 54 billion m 3 was observed in 2001 and the largest value 739 66 billion m 3 was observed in 1998 fig 2 the contribution of the water scarce northern region to the water footprint of national grain production increased steadily from 45 06 in 1997 to 54 29 in 2015 compared to the water rich southern region over the study period 1997 2015 the total gross inter regional trade of grain virtual water increased by a factor of 1 76 from 73 00 to 128 28 billion m 3 fig 3 on average 39 35 of the trade is virtual blue water trade and 60 65 of the trade is virtual green water trade the net positive vwf within china moved from northern to southern china and the size of this flow increased over time the lowest ratio of the vwf from northern to southern china to the total inter regional trade in china was 33 28 in 2000 and the largest was 78 42 in 2013 by 2015 the net grain vwf from northern to southern china reached 98 33 billion m 3 equivalent to 28 04 of the total water footprint of grain production in northern china the main driving factor for this change was the rapid increase in grain production in northern china and the rapid increase in the population of southern china fig 4 presents the annual average virtual water trade balances of all provinces from 1997 to 2015 for total vwf as well as for blue and green virtual water trade individually positive balances reflect net virtual water import and negative balances indicate net virtual water export over the period 1997 2015 heilongjiang was the largest net virtual water exporting province 34 64 billion m 3 year followed by jilin 15 74 billion m 3 year and inner mongolia 10 93 billion m 3 year the three largest exporters are all located in the north guangdong zhejiang and fujian in the south were the largest net importers their annual average grain virtual water imports were 25 57 12 52 and 8 09 billion m 3 year respectively however jiangsu hunan jiangxi hebei and liaoning were net grain virtual water exporters and hubei tibet sichuan chongqing gansu and yunnan were net grain virtual water importers over 1997 2015 these provinces were not net water exporters or importers throughout the entire period of the study for example jiangsu and hunan changed from net grain virtual water exporters to net grain virtual water importers in 2011 and 2013 respectively in most years except 1998 and 2015 jiangxi and hebei respectively were exporters sichuan has been a steady net grain virtual water exporter since 2006 tibet gansu and yunan were importers except in 2000 2003 2014 and 2003 respectively the inter regional virtual water related to grain trade changed over the study period fig 5 northeast china was always a net virtual water exporter central china was a net virtual water exporter for almost all years south china and southwest china were net virtual water importers during the entire study period north china was a net virtual water importer for most years east china changed to a net grain virtual water importer in 2000 northwest china changed from a net grain virtual water importer to a net grain virtual water exporter in 2011 the details of inter regional grain vwf in china for 1997 2001 and 2011 2015 are shown in fig 6 in the period 1997 2001 the three largest vwfs were from northeast china to south china 46 89 billion m 3 from northeast china to east china 36 76 billion m 3 and from northeast china to north china 26 98 billion m 3 in the period 2011 2015 these three flows were still the largest and the values increased to 135 58 120 55 and 53 44 billion m 3 respectively comparing the vwfs in the more recent 5 year period with those in the earlier 5 year period it can be observed that southwest china became a pure importer and northeast china became a pure exporter northwest china increased flows to north china and east china north china increased flows to east china it can be seen that there is a continuously growing vwf trend within china from northern and western china to southern and eastern china the main reason behind this trend is the rapid increase in grain production in northern and western china combined with the rapid increase in population in southern and eastern china however because of the water resources distribution in china in which northern and western china exporters are water scarce regions and southern and eastern china importers are water rich regions this pattern of inter province virtual water trade is unsustainable the water resources distribution pattern in china has been remarkably state these years as shown in fig 6 the existing vwf trend places increasing pressure on the already limited water resources of northern china 3 2 decomposition analysis of virtual water flow changes in the following a lmdi decomposition method is applied to study the role of variations in the unit water footprint ie changes in grain importer structure cse changes in grain exporter structure pse and increased volume of grain transfer se in driving the increase in virtual water trade between 1997 and 2015 the total gross inter regional trade in grain virtual water increased by 55 28 billion m 3 between 1997 and 2015 fig 3 the decomposition results are shown in fig 7 the ie cse pse and se are 40 81 22 56 billion m 3 8 69 4 80 billion m 3 7 60 4 20 billion m 3 and 124 53 68 83 billion m 3 respectively the se that is the significant increase in grain exchange during these years with all other factors held constant was the most important driver of the increase in grain vwf the volume of grain trade grew by a factor of 2 34 from 5 17 to 12 12 billion kg between 1997 and 2015 fig 8 the unit water footprint of grain production in china is decreasing fig 8 and drives down the amount of grain vwf therefore ie is a negative driver of grain vwf although it does not offset the boost provided by the se between 1997 and 2015 the grain production and consumption structure changed fig 9 some of the significant changes are listed here certain provinces henan heilongjiang and jilin increased their shares of grain exports by 11 49 from 3 11 to 14 60 7 19 from 30 73 to 37 91 and 5 35 from 14 44 to 19 79 respectively guangdong zhejiang and beijing increased their shares of grain imports by 10 98 from 18 39 to 29 37 8 74 from 5 77 to 14 51 and 2 51 from 5 09 to 7 60 respectively liaoning changed from a grain importer 6 93 to a grain exporter 0 13 yunan guizhou and gansu reduced their shares of grain imports by 5 13 from 7 39 to 2 25 4 87 from 8 33 to 3 47 and 4 60 from 4 67 to 0 06 respectively jiangsu hunan and sichuan changed from grain exporters to grain importers hubei and shandong reduced their shares of grain exports by 4 64 from 5 06 to 0 42 and 3 81 from 5 86 to 2 05 respectively these changes in the shares of provinces in the grain trade also involved an increase in the exchanges of grain virtual water inter annual variations in virtual water trade in china and their decomposition results are shown in fig 10 compared with the decomposition result between 1997 and 2015 the ie plays a more significant role in the inter annual variation of virtual water trade in china although the unit water footprint exhibited a declining trend over the period 1997 2015 in certain years 1998 2001 2009 2011 2012 and 2014 the increase in unit water footprint was the main force driving up the vwf compared with the cse s the pse s yields a clearer result the provincial variations in vwf between 1997 and 2015 and their decomposition results are shown in fig 11 grain virtual water export per province and fig 12 grain virtual water import per province sichuan hunan jiangsu and hebei changed from grain virtual water exporters to importers in 2015 compared to 1997 the direction for liaoning reversed over the same period consistent with the decomposition results for the whole country the se encouraged grain virtual water trade expansion while the ie prevented greater virtual water transfer some differences occur when examining the two structure effects to exporters the pse is a decisive factor in the direction of virtual water trade increasing grain virtual water export is associated with positive pse s and decreasing grain virtual water export is associated with negative pse s symmetrically the change in grain virtual water import is accompanied by a change in the share of the regional grain import for the whole country 3 3 gravity model analysis of virtual water flows the results obtained with the gravity model are shown in table 3 columns 1 and 2 use the ols estimator adding 1 to all vwf data to deal with zero values columns 3 4 and 5 show the results of two stage ols estimation and columns 6 and 7 employ the ppml estimator columns 2 5 and 7 control importer exporter and time fixed effects and estimate robust standard errors note that estimating gravity equations with fixed effects for the importer and exporter which could be used to capture the multilateral resistance terms is a common practice and is recommended by major empirical trade economists year dummy variables are added to define the impact of the total volume of the grain trade the estimated effect of the coefficient on the logarithm is the elasticity of the value of virtual water trade flows the table reports the estimated coefficients of the explanatory variables the t values are given in parentheses as reported in table 3 the overall estimation results are as expected with r 2 0 581 0 810 and 0 956 the econometric specification delivers the standard fit the estimates of most of the variables are statistically significant and have the expected signs this result confirms the good descriptive capability of the selected drivers for the grain virtual water trade especially the ppml estimator among the variables that might explain the unit water footprint temperature and sunshine hours have a significant negative influence while the amount of water resources per land area has a positive influence on virtual water export for most of the models the ppml estimates column 7 of the effect of temperature are significantly positive the estimate of the ratio of grain irrigation area to the total grain sown area varies between different estimators this factor has a negative impact on the volume of grain virtual water export in the general model however the impact changes to positive when importer exporter and time dummy variables are included among the variables for explaining grain production the power of agricultural machinery and the consumption of chemical fertilizer are positive and statistically significant however grain vwf is inversely related to the rural population one possible reason for this is that the rural population variable is not closely related to the amount of agricultural labor but instead represents consumers of grain which will drive down the net grain virtual water export the effects of the variables that explain grain consumption and the engel s coefficient are positive and statistically significant for all estimates the estimates of gdp and the ratio of consumption are significant and positive for most of the estimates gdp has a negative influence on virtual water import but a positive influence on the volume of virtual water import in the two stage model the influence of the ratio of consumption is exactly the opposite among the variables that might explain the trade cost between two regions the influence of the ratio of rural and urban per capita income for exporters and the ratio of non arable land area to total land area for exporters is as expected positive and significant the estimate of the effect of distance is ambiguous in the general model distance has a negative effect on grain vwf and on whether there is net grain virtual water export from one region to another however the direction of the impact is inverted or the impact is changed insignificantly when the number of the vwfs is investigated using a fixed effect model the result is very different from the results of previous studies that addressed international trade the reason for this is that geographical distance is not an important barrier to inter regional trade of virtual water within a country as in china in this study and the industrial division among regions promotes grain transfer across remote regions compared to the ols estimates in columns 2 and 5 the ppml estimates with fixed effects that are listed in column 7 of table 3 show differences in terms of magnitude significance and even sign considering the qualities of the ppml estimator the ppml estimator is more favored than the ols estimator ppml estimates obtained using fixed effects indicate that temperature amount of water resources proportion of irrigation area power of agricultural machinery consumption of chemical fertilizers ratio of rural to urban income in the export region gdp ratio of consumption engel s coefficient and the proportion of non arable land area in the import region are the major drivers of grain vwf 3 4 results combining the lmdi and gravity model methods the relationship between the drivers decomposed with lmdi and the drivers obtained using the gravity model is shown in fig 13 the different effects of the drivers on vwf can be seen clearly natural conditions such as temperature the amount of water resource and the proportion of irrigation area can cause variations in the unit water footprint ie that account for 40 81 of the vwf this indicates that although the three determinants are important drivers of the vwf they are limited in their effects in the export region of the vwf the ratio of rural to urban income in the export region and the proportion of non arable land area in the import region will affect the growth in the volume of grain transfer se which account for 124 53 of the vwf this means that rural and urban incomes in the export region and the proportion of non arable land areas in the import region are the most important drivers of the vwf rural and urban incomes in the export region represent the economic foundation for grain trade and can be seen as a determinant of the supply of grain as an outward push force of the exporter in addition as an inward pull force of the importer the proportion of non arable land areas in the import region represents the demand for grain because there will be a less arable land area with the rapid development of the economy resulting in a greater proportion of the non arable land area as can be seen grain production will increase if income increases and this will create a supply of grain on the other hand with the rapid development of industry the arable area will decrease creating more demand for grain the power of agricultural machinery and the consumption of chemical fertilizers can cause changes in grain exporter structure pse which accounts for 7 6 of the vwf this means that these two elements are less important drivers of the vwf these two elements can be seen as an effect of technological advances in grain production gdp the ratio of consumption and engel s coefficient will affect changes in grain importer structure cse which accounts for 8 69 of the vwf this means that gdp the ratio of consumption and engel s coefficient are also less important drivers of the vwf these three elements can be seen as overall economic conditions in grain importing regions when the lmdi is combined with the gravity model different effects of the ten drivers on vwf are found rural and urban incomes in the export region and the proportion of non arable land areas in the import region which correspond to se are found to be the most important drivers of the vwf natural conditions such as temperature the amount of water resource and the proportion of irrigation area which correspond to ie are also important drivers although they are indeed constraint elements of the vwf in addition the power of agricultural machinery the consumption of chemical fertilizers the gdp the ratio of consumption and engel s coefficient which together correspond to pse and cse are found to be less important drivers of the vwf therefore regional economy division rather than water resource endowment is the main driving factor 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of results although a few pieces of research are focusing on the drivers of domestic vwfs many researchers studied the drivers of international vwfs using various methods as shown in table 1 some studies targeted the volume of virtual water flows of a country or the world as a whole using decomposition analysis and with the result that trade or scale effect is the main driver duarte et al 2016b a the gravity model is built on solid trade theory however it is a regression model essentially and a sufficient number of samples is necessary with this method that is why it is used mainly in research about bilateral virtual water trade flows between countries fracasso 2014 tamea et al 2014 fracasso et al 2016 duarte et al 2019 in addition another research analysis net virtual water import of crops in tunisia using a common multiple regression model the water endowments population gross domestic product and geographical distance are demonstrated as the main drivers of bilateral virtual water trade flows between countries in these studies this study investigates the drivers of domestic vwfs related to the production of grain by combining the lmdi decomposition method with a gravity model lmdi decomposition points the way for framework building and variables selection of gravity model and gravity model provides the theoretical foundation and extended the results of the lmdi decomposition by combining the two approaches we cannot only identify the drivers of domestic grain vwfs but can also clarify which drivers are vital in domestic grain vwf in china the same with the result of research studying the whole volume of virtual water flows using decomposition analysis duarte et al 2016b a growth in the volume of product transfer is the main driver the detailed comparison of results using different decomposition methods is discussed in section 4 2 it is worth mentioning that cai et al 2019 analyzed the drivers of domestic vwfs using structural decomposition analysis with the result that water use efficiency and consumption pattern were the major drivers the reason is that the object in this study is all products not only grain food or agricultural products as our study and duarte et al 2016b a compare with those studies analyzing bilateral virtual water trade flows between countries the result of this study is very different water endowments and geographical distance are demonstrated as have not significant influences in domestic vwfs domestic vwfs are governed primarily by industrial distribution and regional division in the national economy our results have important significance for agricultural water resources management for a country and the earth on the one hand this study provides a reasonable explanation for the unsustainable virtual water flows at the national level that has been observed by this study and many studies in china zhang and anadon 2014 zhuo et al 2016 and in india katyaini and barua 2017 it is worth noted that zhao et al 2019 also paid attention to this problem and provide another explanation with comparative advantage theory that study shows that the current market forces reflect the scarcity of land resources however does not reflect the water scarcity in the context of interregional trade in china zhao et al 2019 the proportion of non arable land area in the import region which correspond to se are also found to be one of the most important drivers of the vwf in our study on the other hand the results are also meaningful for international virtual trade as that the end of the process of economic globalization and trade liberalization is close to domestic vwfs 4 2 another decomposition method the lmdi method has several advantages including ease of formulation perfect decomposition simple interpretation of results and consistent aggregation ang 2005 however other decomposition methods are also used to decompose vwf we applied another decomposition method developed by duarte et al 2016b and compared the decomposition results for the variable vwf ij which depends on the explicative factors uwf i g ij g i g i g and g additive decomposition can be obtained through the total differential using the average of the two polar decompositions the changes in vwf from region i to region j can thus be decomposed as follows 14 vwf ij vwf ie ij vwf cse ij vwf pse ij vwf se ij vwf ie ij uwf i g ijt 1 g it 1 g it 1 g t 1 g t 1 uwf i g ijt g it g it g t g t 2 vwf cse ij uwf it g ij g i g it 1 g t 1 g t 1 uwf it 1 g ij g i g it g t g t 2 vwf pse ij uwf it g ijt g it g i g g t 1 uwf it 1 g ijt 1 g it 1 g i g g t 2 vwf se ij uwf it g ijt g it g it g t g uwf it 1 g ijt 1 g it 1 g it 1 g t 1 g 2 the decomposition results obtained using this method are essentially consistent with the results of the lmdi method fig 14 the ie cse pse and se are 54 52 0 32 0 43 and 155 26 respectively the grain virtual water export expansion is entirely due to se s while the other three effects prevent greater vwf both the cse and the pse show negative signs 4 3 symmetry of the virtual water flow in the previous section we used eq 3 to test the net grain vwf between regions the test implies that the vwf from region j to region i is zero when the vwf from region i to region j is positive the driving factors and their influencing forces should theoretically be the same for vwf ij and symmetric vwf ji here we remove the symmetrical zero vwf data and re estimate the grain vwf gravity model to obtain clearer results the estimates obtained using the model are reported in table 4 the estimates of the effects of variables are qualitatively identical to the results presented in section 3 the only notable difference is that all the coefficients decreased in the new specification this result is expected due to the presence of fewer zero value dependent variables in the model overall these results reinforce the conclusions based on the results shown in table 3 5 conclusions this study investigates the drivers of domestic vwfs related to the production of grain by combining the lmdi decomposition method with a gravity model by combining the two approaches we can not only identify the drivers of domestic grain vwfs but can also clarify which drivers are vital the main conclusions are as follows one is that there is a trend toward the separation of grain consumers and grain producers in china it is even found that the distance between regions has a positive effect on grain vwf the other finding is that domestic virtual water trade is governed by industrial distribution and regional division in the national economy rather than by water endowment the concentration of a growing portion of agricultural production in more arid regions creates pressing problems related to the sustainability of water use the mismatch between industrial layout and water distribution is the fundamental cause for this unsustainable trend in virtual water flows there is a need to rethink policy governing agriculture and water use at the national and state level to solve this problem on the one hand water scarce and water rich areas should be distinguished for different policies in water scarce regions policy should focus on saving water and limiting water use should include water pricing that reflects scarcity conditions and should promote improvements in water saving technology in water rich regions policy should focus on encouraging water intensive agriculture production including economic incentives to improve the enthusiasm for growing grain and developing high tech agriculture to overcome the challenges limiting arable land on the other hand as a whole national strategies regarding industrial distribution and regional division also must be based on a broader set of information that includes the virtual water trade and water endowment of each region this study provides a reasonable explanation for the unsustainable virtual water flows at the national level that have important relevance for agricultural water resources management both nationally and worldwide there is room for improvement for example the accuracy of inter regional grain trade calculation could be improved given the paucity of definite data detailing inter provincial trade within a country a method such as the input output model the general equilibrium model and linear programming optimization could allow more accurate simulations another is that the gravity model for vwfs has huge potential to be developed and used in the agricultural water management field a gravity model could be developed that details multilateral resistance and trade costs to study and quantify the effects of various water policies such a model could be integrated within a wide class of broader general equilibrium models in order to study the ripple effects of the water policies in other countries regions and sectors conflict of interest none declared acknowledgments this work is

10559,different cultivation practices with mulching materials have been applied in the semi arid areas of china however there is still insufficient systematic research on its eﬀ ects on ecological indexes and crop water productivity therefore a ﬁeld trial was carried out in three consecutive study years 2015 2018 to evaluate ecological productivity crop water productivity and wheat production under six different treatments ct conventional flat tillage without mulching tsm conventional flat tillage with gravel mulching tpm conventional flat tillage with plastic film mulching rp ridges covered with plastic film and furrows without mulching rsm ridges covered with plastic film and furrows with gravel mulching rpm ridges and furrows covered with plastic film mulching we found that different cultivation and mulching materials practices considerably improved soil moisture content crop productivity ecological eﬀ ects and evapotranspiration et rates the rp cropping system with different mulching practices signiﬁcantly increased soil moisture and ecosystem co2 and no2 emissions during the three consecutive study years the rp cropping system with gravel or plastic film mulching on the furrows improved the dry matter per plant and lai at the late growth stage and it improved crop water productivity compared to the ct cultivation practice the annual net primary productivity npp and net ecosystem productivity nep were signiﬁcantly increased by 13 and 70 respectively with the rpm in the rpm treatment the cwpeco and cwpyield were significantly improved by 66 and 84 respectively relative to the ct cultivation practice in addition rpm treatment improved the spike partitioning index by 16 maintained a fruiting eﬃciency that was 12 higher increased water

available water becomes limited there is a significant effect on the sustainability of dry land agricultural productivity chen et al 2015 kang et al 2017 as a result there is a persistent decline of the water table that has been caused by excessive exploitation of ground water resources from shallow and deep aquifers for irrigation zhang et al 2009 even in the signiﬁcant zones of groundwater depression such as tianjin the groundwater table depth has been declining by one m year in the northern part of china during the last 20 years zhao et al 2013 innovative farming strategies to enhance crop water productivity and to confirm food safety in response to climate change in rain fed agricultural systems is essential fang et al 2010 agricultural water management tools are required to develop water saving agricultural technology that meets real crop water prerequisites wang et al 2016 cultivation practices with various mulching strategies have been used in water limited agricultural regions to increase soil moisture content and wheat productivity man et al 2015 kang et al 2017 plastics are light weight and economical however plastics pollute the environment and pose diﬃculties during recycling gravel mulching has also been widely recommended for sustaining dry land agricultural systems and avoiding environmental pollution in china zhao et al 2014 however gravel mulching in the furrow zone improves microbial access to carbon substrates leading to an increase in soil co2 emissions dong et al 2012 a ridge furrow covered with plastic ﬁlm system plays a key role in dry land farming systems due to their clear improvements in crop water productivity and maximum precipitation consumption gan et al 2013 soils are key for storing and transmitting water to plants the atmosphere groundwater lakes and rivers keesstra et al 2016 cerdà et al 2017 the rp cultivation practice is commonly used to accumulate rainwater with maximum rainwater exploitation zhang et al

promising approach to increasing grain yield uddling et al 2008 wang et al 2015 however straw mulches have been found to be very efficient to prevent runoff and erosion in different agricultural settings lucas borja et al 2018 keesstra et al 2019 cropping practices and using diﬀ erent mulching materials can improve the soil s hydro thermal and carbon status and improve ecological activities li and gong 2002 the diversity of soil organisms is crucial to many functional aspects of soils such as soil structure water regulation and nutrient cycling keesstra et al 2018 crop production and crop water productivity ultimately will be influenced by various cultivation techniques morison et al 2008 previous research works have given more consideration to crop water productivity such as the ratio of productivity to water use at the exchange of net ecosystem and economic yield monson et al 2010 adak et al 2013 dry matter production is a key sign of rain fed agricultural sustainability gan et al 2013 ceschia et al 2010 zhou et al 2014 showed that agriculture crops release approximately 11 13 of greenhouse gas emissions worldwide the agriculture sector releases 5 1 6 1 pg co2 equivalents per year according to the ipcc 2014 therefore the associations among the ecological eﬀ ects of farm land and wheat productivity must be considered smith et al 2008 the total carbon accumulation amount in ecosystems is useful to estimate the productivity of the net ecosystem shurpali et al 2013 shen et al 2013 quantifying the eﬀ ects of cropping practices and using diﬀ erent mulching materials to improve crop water productivity is necessary for developing eﬃcient crop water productivity practices and investigating their eco hydrological eﬀ ects on dry land cultivation systems kang et al 2002 thus the purpose of this study was to clarify the eﬀ ect of cultivation practices by using diﬀ erent mulching materials on soil water co2 and no2 fluxes and crop water productivity during the three study years several researchers have shown that decreasing et is an important technique of sustaining soil water storage chen et al 2010 gong et al 2017 in this study we investigated the mechanisms of

as follows soil density 1 21 g cm3 alkalized nitrogen 32 16 mg kg available phosphorus 3 06 mg kg organic matter 9 12 g kg and ph 7 16 2 2 field management and research design a randomized completely block design was used having five replications each plot area was 4 4 5 m 22 m2 it consisted of six treatments 1 ct conventional flat tillage without mulching 2 tsm conventional flat tillage with gravel mulching 8 kg m 2 of 2 4 cm diameter gravel mulching covering 100 of the soil surface 3 tpm traditional flat tillage with white plastic film mulching 4 rp ridges covered with plastic film and furrows without mulching 5 rsm ridges covered with plastic film and furrows with gravel mulching and 6 rpm ridges and furrows covered with plastic film mulching the gravel was removed once the crop was harvested to avoid the gravel mixing with the soil the height of each ridge was 15 cm with 40 60 cm widths of the ridges and furrows under the rp planting conditions the nitrogen supply was all provided in the furrows while it was applied to the whole plot under the ct planting at sowing time 40 of total jointing 30 and flowering stages 30 the wheat cultivar ping an 8 was sown at a seed rate of 2 250 000 ha 1 wheat seeds were sown on 13 october 2015 15 october 2016 and 12 october 2017 the wheat crop was harvested on 30 may 2016 28 may 2017 and on 1 june 2018 a 1 5 m wide space was left to stop water and nitrogen leakage between adjacent plots throughout the three growing seasons irrigation was not supplied and weeds were manually controlled 2 3 sampling and measurements 2 3 1 soil water content and et rate the soil water sw content was measured at sowing time tillering re wintering jointing flowering grain filling and maturity stages the soil depths of 0 120 cm at 20 cm intervals were recorded for soil water by using a tdr machine time domain reflectometry soil water storage sws was calculated by using the following equation ren et al 2008 1 sws c ρ h 10 where c is the soil moisture ρ is the soil bulk density and h is the soil depth the evapotranspiration et was calculated on a seasonal basis by using the following equation ali et al 2017 2 et p c sw1 sw2 d r where p mm is the total rainfall c is the upward flow into the root zone sw1 mm is the soil moisture content at planting time sw2 is the soil moisture content at the maturity stage d is the downward drainage and r is the surface runoff the groundwater table remains at a depth of 80 m so the upward flow into the root was insignificant the trial field was flat so runoff was never observed drainage was considered to be insignificant to a depth of 120 cm fig 1 2 3 2 stem water soluble carbohydrates wsc fruiting efficiency and spike partitioning index five stem samples 0 2 m2 were taken for

et al 2017 11 cwpyield economic yield et 2 3 4 total dry matter and wheat production five plants were selected randomly from each plot at five different growth stages during three growing seasons and then oven drying at 105 c for 1 h and then at 70 c until it reached a stable weight four rows were hand harvested from the centre of each treatment to determine the grain yield we randomly selected five plants from each plot at the tillering re wintering jointing flowering and grain filling stages and leaf area per plant was calculated in cm2 with the help of software win folia pro 2007b and a

results 3 1 soil water contents swc evapotranspiration et and soil water storage the swc was significantly affected by various cultivation and mulching materials strategies at the various growth stages at a soil depth of 0 120 cm fig 2 the swc showed signiﬁcant differences among the different mulching techniques under both planting practices at various growth stages a variation in swc was indicated at the jointing stage where rpm treatment had the maximum swc over all three years the swc value at the ﬂowering stage was signiﬁcantly higher under the rpm treatment compared to the other treatments during the study years however its swc was decreased from the flowering stage to the grain filling stage except for the 2016 2017 study year there were no significant variations in swc between tpm and rsm treatments for the whole soil proﬁle during the 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 study years however the swc value was signiﬁcantly lower under the ct treatment at maturity than for all of the other treatments during three consecutive growing seasons of winter wheat crops differences in soil water content can significantly affect the total et rate during three consecutive study years the et rate in the ct treatment was a considerable maximum compared with rp treatment from the sowing to tillering stage during the three consecutive study years and the et rate was a considerable maximum relative to the rpm treatment in 2017 2018 table 1 there were non significance variances in the et rate between the rp and rpm treatments during the three consecutive growing seasons however the et value of the ct was a considerable maximum compared with that of the rp treatment at the tillering to jointing stage the et rate for the tpm treatment was considerably lower compared with the other treatments the et rate for the tsm treatment was a considerable maximum compared with the rsm treatment in 2017 2018 there were no differences in et value between tpm and rp treatments in 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 at the jointing to anthesis stage while et for the ct and tsm treatments was a considerable maximum relative to the other treatments during 2015 2016 the et value in the ct treatment was a much smaller than it was for the rp treatment at the anthesis to maturity stage during the three consecutive study years the et of the ct treatment was at a minimum compared to the rp treatment in 2015 2016 but non significant variations were indicated for the rp and tpm treatments the soil water storage sws was a significant maximum under different mulch practices with both planting patterns table 2 the sws was improved during the sowing to jointing stage except 2015 2016 but the variances were all non signiﬁcant the rp system had a considerable maximum sws during the jointing stage relative to the ct practice during the three consecutive growing seasons the use of different mulch materials under two cropping practices increased sws at the jointing and flowering stages the sws of the rpm treatment was a considerable maximum compared with the rest of the treatments during the three consecutive growing seasons these results indicated that the rpm treatment had considerable retained maximum sws at the flowering to grain ﬁlling stage when significantly low rainfall occurred under the ct practice with gravel mulching a signiﬁcantly minimum sws occurred at the maturity stage during 2015 2016 table 3 3 2 total dry matter plant 1 and leaf area index lai various mulching materials signiﬁcantly increased the total dry matter at the different growth stages dry matter per plant was improved with the rp system at various growth stages compared with ct treatment the rpm treatment considerable improved total dry matter at the late growth stages relative to the tpm treatment total dry matter of the rpm was a considerable maximum compared with rsm at the re wintering stage from 2015 to 2016 and 2017 to 2018 however the variations between the rsm and rpm treatments were not signiﬁcant from 2016 to 2017 total dry matter with the rpm cultivation practice was a considerable maximum from 2015 to 2016 and 2016 to 2017 at the flowering to maturity stage compared with the rsm treatment however the variations between the rsm and rpm treatments were non signiﬁcant from 2017 to 2018 the probable reason is the high sws therefore in the long term plastic film mulching or gravels mulching under the rp system can improve the biomass per plant the dynamic variation in the lai was significantly influenced by the planting practices with various mulching materials practices during the three consecutive growing seasons fig 2 the variations in lai started at the jointing and reached a peak value during the flowering stage from the flowering stage to the grain filling stages the lai was slowly declining due to yellowing of the leaves the application of mulching materials significantly affected lai under the two cultivation practices excluding the tillering and re wintering stages during the winter wheat later growth stage the lai values under the ct practice tended to decline much more compared with the rp practice using different mulching materials thereby indicating that a lack of mulching materials could lead to early leaf senescence under both planting practices the differences in the lai values were not significant between tpm and rsm at different growth stages 3 3 stem water soluble carbohydrates wsc contents wsc traits in the stem and corresponding statistics are presented in table 4 during the three consecutive growing seasons planting practices with different mulching techniques signiﬁcantly aﬀ ected stem wsc at flowering and maturity and the apparent translocation amounts of wsc in the stem during the three consecutive growing seasons seasonal conditions modulated the eﬀ ect of planting practices on wsc in the stem to understand the multifaceted responses of wsc in the stem we combined the data during the three consecutive growing seasons by comparisons between the two planting practices with different mulching techniques at flowering wsc content in the stem improved in the rpm treatment but it did not show significant changes among the rsm rp and tsm treatments at maturity stem wsc content increased under the rpm and rsm cultivation practices but there was non considerable variance in the 2015 2016 and 2017 2018 study years consequently a significantly higher stem wsc translocation amount was recorded for the rpm cultivation practice but there was non considerable variance among the rp and tpm cultivation practices and the tsm and ct treatments during the 2015 2016 and 2017 2018 study years the stem wsc translocation ratio had non considerable variation among the different treatments except for the 2017 2018 study years generally the rpm treatment increased the apparent translocation amount and ratio of stem wsc at the flowering and maturity stages compared with the rest of the treatments as shown in table 4 the fruiting efficiency under the rp system with ridges and furrows covered with plastic film mulching were higher than in the other treatments during the three year experiment compared with rpm treatment the spi and fruiting efficiency in the rest of the treatments under the ct practices were a much smaller and in the rp practices they were much larger the rsm and rp treatment also improved fruiting efficiency and spi over that of the ct practice during the three year experiment 3 4 co2 and no2 ﬂuxes during the three consecutive growing seasons seasonal dynamics in co2 and no2 ﬂuxes were positive and underwent three fluctuations in all treatments fig 3 the emissions of co2 were low at the sowing stage and increased very quickly from flowering to the grain filling stage reaching its maximum at the grain filling stage and then showing a declining trend the emission of co2 and no2 under the rp system was significantly greater than that of the ct treatment fig 3 different planting practices with mulching materials at various growth stages significantly affected the emissions of co2 and no2 there were two peaks of n2o emissions during the three consecutive study years one at the jointing stage and the other at the grain filling stage fig 3 n2o emissions under the rpm planting practice were a considerable maximum compared with the rp planting practice fig 3 when compared with the rpm treatment the rsm and tpm treatments had no significant effects on n2o emissions during the study years from 2016 to 2017 and 2017 to 2018 for both planting practices mulching materials significantly affected n2o emissions the emission of n2o was lower at the grain filling stage and then improved very quickly from the tillering to the jointing stage reaching its maximum at the jointing stage and then it declined very sharply the rpm and rsm treatments changed n2o emissions significantly compared with the ct treatment while the n2o emission from the rp planting practice was a considerable maximum compared with ct treatment fig 3 the total emissions of co2 were also significantly influenced by planting methods with different mulching techniques over the three consecutive winter wheat growing seasons ranging from 3427 to 2927 kg co2 c ha 1 during 2015 2016 from 3330 to 2774 kg co2 c ha 1 during 2016 2017 and from 3395 to 2868 kg co2 c ha 1 during 2017 2018 respectively table 5 the ct rp and tsm treatments signiﬁcantly decreased the co2 emissions relative to the rpm and psm treatments over the three consecutive winter wheat growing seasons 3 5 npp nep crop water productivity and wheat production the annual npp ranged from 6524 to 5951 kg co2 ha 1 during 2015 2016 from 6638 to 5738 kg co2 ha 1 during 2016 2017 and from 6598 to 5862 kg co2 per ha 1 during 2017 to 2018 as presented in table 5 the annual npp had no considerable variations between the tpm and rpm treatments during 2017 2018 since the total biomass for all treatments had very similar values whereas during the 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 study years the rpm treatment had a higher annual npp value than that of the other treatments the nep involving the total amount of co2 ﬂuxes in the npp was significantly influenced by both planting models and diﬀ erent mulching materials during the three consecutive winter wheat growing seasons the annual nep ranged from 3565 to 2209 kg co2 ha 1 during the 2015 2016 period from 3270 to 1801 kg co2 ha 1 during the 2016 2017 period and from 3435 to 2022 kg co2 ha 1 during the 2017 2018 period table 5 the annual nep signiﬁcantly increased under rpm treatment compared to the rest of the treatments during the three consecutive winter wheat growing seasons an evaluation of crop water productivity from the 2015 to 2018 study years is presented in table 5 there was a considerable variation between the two planting practices in terms of cwpeco and cwpyield the cwpeco average value for the six treatments varied from 9 9 to 6 3 kg co2 ha 1 mm 1 during 2015 2016 from 7 7 to 4 3 kg co2 ha 1 mm 1 in 2016 2017 and from 8 7 to 5 2 kg co2 ha 1 mm 1 during 2017 2018 table 5 the mean value of the cwpyield significantly varied with a range of 20 9 12 8 kg seed ha 1 mm 1 during the 2015 2016 period from 18 3 to 8 8 kg seed ha 1 mm 1 during the 2016 2017 period and from 18 8 to 9 9 kg seed ha 1 mm 1 during the 2017 2018 period overall the rpm treatment cwpeco and cwpyield values were significantly higher than the rest of the treatments the means of three consecutive winter wheat growing seasons grain yield under the rpm rsm rp tpm and tsm treatments were 3 6 t ha 1 89 5 2 6 t ha 1 64 1 0 5 t ha 1 12 7 0 8 t ha 1 67 7 and 1 9 t ha 1 48 3 higher respectively than they were in the ct planting practice 4 discussion 4 1 soil water storage and evapotranspiration responses to various cultivation and mulching materials cultivation practices play a significant role in improving soil water storage in semi arid regions yuan et al 2009 lü et al 2013 plastic film mulching decreases evaporation and improves the soil water balance wang et al 2004 therefore improved crop water status mainly in a rain fed farming system where the key constraint affecting crop growth is water limitations can improve crop yields li et al 2000 the swc showed signiﬁcant differences among different mulching techniques under both planting practices at various growth stages gravel mulching protects the soil surface from direct sunlight and decreases soil radiation absorption and soil evaporation fang et al 2010 however swc decreased from the flowering stage into the grain filling stage except in the 2016 2017 study years there were no significant variations in swc between the tpm and rsm treatments for the whole soil proﬁle during the 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 study years however the swc value was signiﬁcantly low at maturity under the ct treatment relative to the other treatments during all three consecutive growing seasons of winter wheat crops the rp system with plastic film mulching enhanced crop production with a declining et rate as a result improving the crop water productivity under rain fed conditions wang et al 2011 the decrease of the et rate was mainly correlated with before flowering to limited water resources fang et al 2010 ma et al 2010 the et rate in the ct treatment was a considerable maximum compared with rp treatment from sowing to the tillering stage during the three consecutive study years and the et rate was a considerable maximum relative to the rpm treatment in the period from 2017 to 2018 there were non significance variances in the et rate between the rp and rpm treatments during the three consecutive growing seasons thus plastic mulching under the rp system improved the crop transpiration before and after flowering and this technique contributed to enhanced yields sadras and connor 1991 fereres and soriano 2007 soils around the world are affected by land degradation processes as a consequence of the abuse of grazing fire mining or agriculture sharma et al 2017 the gravel and plastic films used as surface mulching materials have been shown to improve the soil water balance and wheat yields bo et al 2015 pereira et al 2015 the rp system showed a considerable maximum sws during the jointing stage relative to the ct practice during the three consecutive growing seasons the use of different mulch materials under the two cropping practices increased sws at the jointing and flowering stages the sws for the rpm treatment was a considerable maximum compared with the rest of the treatments during the three consecutive growing seasons several field trials have shown that gravel mulching could significantly improve sws dry matter and wheat production lü et al 2013 qiu et al 2015 non suitable land management strategies and actions threaten the sustainable use of agricultural soils cerdà et al 2019 guadie et al 2020 our study showed that the total dry matter of the rpm was a considerable maximum compared with rsm at the re wintering stage during 2015 2016 and 2017 2018 however the variations between the rsm and rpm were non considerable during 2016 2017 the possible cause is the high sws so in the long term plastic film mulching or gravel mulching under the rp system will improve the biomass per plant plastic film use with returning crop rational coupling can decrease the et rate of wheat during the jointing to flowering stage fan et al 2005 chen et al 2017 reported that under the rp more water loss through transpiration is due to the maximum water uptake from a wide root distribution furthermore the maximum lai under different mulch treatments may also result in more transpiration than that of the ct treatment during the winter wheat later growth stage the lai values under the ct practice tended to decline much more compared with the rp practice using different mulching materials thereby indicating that a lack of mulching materials could lead to early leaf senescence under both planting practices 4 2 stem water soluble carbohydrates wsc contents responses to various cultivation and mulching materials the distribution of crop resources in response to different planting practices and mulching applications can stabilize crop production under drought conditions fang et al 2010 hu et al 2014 earlier field trials have revealed that different mulching practices under the rp system reduced the eﬀ ective tillers blum 1998 yang et al 2000 which resulted in improved wsc during flowering duggan et al 2005b and so more wsc translocation to the developing grain dreccer et al 2009 during the three consecutive growing seasons planting practices with different mulching techniques signiﬁcantly aﬀ ected wsc during flowering and ripening and obviously increased the translocation amount of wsc in the stem generally the rpm treatment increased the amount and ratio of wsc during the flowering and ripening stages more so than the rest of the treatments the crop grain yield is strongly correlated with the grain number spike 1 ji et al 2010 ferrante et al 2015 reported that grain yield is associated with biomass at flowering spi and fe while fischer 2011 showed that improvements of the grain yield might be attained by improving spi and fe our results indicated that fruiting efficiency under the rp system with ridges and furrows covered with plastic film mulching were higher than in the other treatments during the three year experiment compared with the rpm treatment the spi and fruiting efficiency in the rest of the treatments under the ct practices were a considerable minimum and in the rp practice were a considerable maximum 4 3 co2 and no2 ﬂuxes responses to various cultivation and mulching materials crop production and dry matter have a strong relationship to soil moisture content at various growth stages zhang et al 2009 bu et al 2013 the soil water balance is significantly associated with the conversion and capture of sunlight water inﬁltration and evaporation yuan et al 2009 moreover gravel mulching improves the soil carbon content and soil structure and decreases the soil bulk density bo et al 2015 liu et al 2016 during the three consecutive growing seasons seasonal dynamics in co2 and no2 ﬂuxes were positive and underwent three fluctuations in all treatments the emission of co2 and no2 by the rp planting was significantly greater than that in the ct treatment different cultivation practices with mulching materials at various growth stages significantly affected emissions of co2 and no2 the gravel and plastic film mulching improved the soil water content which aﬀ ected the co2 and no2 emissions li et al 2009 qiu et al 2015 abdalla et al 2013 indicated that greenhouse gas emissions and soil respiration are influenced by the soil water balance to evaluate net ecosystem production the total co2 fluxes have been studied from ecosystems lavigne et al 2004 in our study annual npp had no considerable variations between tpm and rpm treatment during 2017 2018 which was due to the total biomass for all treatments having very similar values whereas during the 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 study years the rpm treatment had a higher annual npp value than it did with the other treatments the nep linking the npp to the co2 emissions was significantly influenced by both planting models and diﬀ erent mulching materials during the three consecutive winter wheat growing seasons the annual nep signiﬁcantly increased under rpm treatment compared to the rest of the treatments during the three consecutive winter wheat growing seasons 4 4 crop water productivity and wheat production responses to various cultivation and

and mulching materials strategies had considerable effects on soil moisture content crop productivity ecological eﬀ ects and et rates under rain fed conditions in china the rp cultivation practice with different mulching practices signiﬁcantly increased soil moisture and ecosystem co2 and no2 emissions during the three consecutive study years the rp cropping system with gravel or plastic film mulching on the furrows improved the lai and biomass per plant at the late growth stage and it increased the cwps the nep and npp were signiﬁcantly influenced by rpm treatment during the three consecutive study years compared to the without mulch treatments the annual cwpeco and cwpyield significantly increased under the rpm treatment during the three study years in addition the rpm treatment significantly improved spi had a high fruiting eﬃciency increased wsc in the stem increased apparent translocation amount and ratio and then achieved a high grain yield in our study we showed that the rpm treatment was an eﬀ ective approach for water saving and led to significantly improved cwpeco cwpyield and wheat production under the semi arid conditions future study is necessary

covered with plastic film and furrows without mulching rsm ridges covered with plastic film and furrows with gravel mulching rpm ridges and furrows covered with plastic film mulching we found that different cultivation and mulching materials practices considerably improved soil moisture content crop productivity ecological eﬀ ects and evapotranspiration et rates the rp cropping system with different mulching practices signiﬁcantly increased soil moisture and ecosystem co2 and no2 emissions during the three consecutive study years the rp cropping system with gravel or plastic film mulching on the furrows improved the dry matter per plant and lai at the late growth stage and it improved crop water productivity compared to the ct cultivation practice the annual net primary productivity npp and net ecosystem productivity nep were signiﬁcantly increased by 13 and 70 respectively with the rpm in the rpm treatment the cwpeco and cwpyield were significantly improved by 66 and 84 respectively relative to the ct cultivation practice in addition rpm treatment improved the spike partitioning index by 16 maintained a fruiting eﬃciency that was 12 higher increased water

available water becomes limited there is a significant effect on the sustainability of dry land agricultural productivity chen et al 2015 kang et al 2017 as a result there is a persistent decline of the water table that has been caused by excessive exploitation of ground water resources from shallow and deep aquifers for irrigation zhang et al 2009 even in the signiﬁcant zones of groundwater depression such as tianjin the groundwater table depth has been declining by one m year in the northern part of china during the last 20 years zhao et al 2013 innovative farming strategies to enhance crop water productivity and to confirm food safety in response to climate change in rain fed agricultural systems is essential fang et al 2010 agricultural water management tools are required to

agricultural regions to increase soil moisture content and wheat productivity man et al 2015 kang et al 2017 plastics are light weight and economical however plastics pollute the environment and pose diﬃculties during recycling gravel mulching has also been widely recommended for sustaining dry land agricultural systems and avoiding environmental pollution in china zhao et al 2014 however gravel mulching in the furrow zone improves microbial access to carbon substrates leading to an increase in soil co2 emissions dong et al 2012 a ridge furrow covered with plastic ﬁlm system plays a key role

as follows soil density 1 21 g cm3 alkalized nitrogen 32 16 mg kg available phosphorus 3 06 mg kg organic matter 9 12 g kg and ph 7 16 2 2 field management and research design a randomized completely block design was used having five replications each plot area was 4 4 5 m 22 m2 it consisted of six treatments 1 ct conventional flat tillage without mulching 2 tsm conventional flat tillage with gravel mulching 8 kg m 2 of 2 4 cm diameter gravel mulching covering 100 of the soil surface 3 tpm traditional flat tillage with white plastic film mulching 4 rp ridges covered with plastic film and furrows without mulching 5 rsm ridges covered with plastic film and furrows with gravel mulching and 6 rpm ridges and furrows covered with plastic film mulching the gravel was removed once the crop was harvested to avoid the gravel mixing with the soil the height of each ridge was 15 cm with 40 60 cm widths of the ridges and furrows under the rp planting conditions the nitrogen supply was all provided in the furrows while it was applied to the whole plot under the ct planting at sowing time 40 of total jointing 30 and flowering stages 30 the wheat cultivar ping an 8 was sown at a seed rate of 2 250 000 ha 1 wheat seeds were sown on 13 october 2015 15 october 2016 and 12 october 2017 the wheat crop was harvested on 30 may 2016 28 may 2017 and on 1 june 2018 a 1 5 m wide space was left to stop water and nitrogen leakage between adjacent plots throughout the three growing seasons irrigation was not supplied and weeds were manually controlled 2 3 sampling and measurements 2 3 1 soil water content and et rate the soil water sw content was measured at sowing time tillering re wintering jointing flowering grain filling and maturity stages the soil depths of 0 120 cm at 20 cm intervals were recorded for soil water by using a tdr machine time domain reflectometry soil water storage sws was calculated by using the following equation ren et al 2008 1 sws c ρ h 10 where c is the soil moisture ρ is the soil bulk density and h is the soil depth the evapotranspiration et was calculated on a seasonal basis by using the following equation ali et al 2017 2 et p c sw1 sw2 d r where p mm is the total rainfall c is the upward flow into the root zone sw1 mm is the soil moisture content at planting time sw2 is the soil moisture content at the maturity stage d is the downward drainage and r is the surface runoff the groundwater table remains at a depth of 80 m so the upward flow into the root was insignificant the trial field was flat so runoff was never observed drainage

then oven drying at 105 c for 1 h and then at 70 c until it reached a stable weight four rows were hand harvested from the centre of each treatment to determine the grain yield we randomly selected five plants from each plot at the tillering re wintering jointing flowering and grain filling stages and leaf area per plant was calculated in cm2 with the help of software win folia pro 2007b and a

results 3 1 soil water contents swc evapotranspiration et and soil water storage the swc was significantly affected by various cultivation and mulching materials strategies at the various growth stages at a soil depth of 0 120 cm fig 2 the swc showed signiﬁcant differences among the different mulching techniques under both planting practices at various growth stages a variation in swc was indicated at the jointing stage where rpm treatment had the maximum swc over all three years the swc value at the ﬂowering stage was signiﬁcantly higher under the rpm treatment compared to the other treatments during the study years however its swc was decreased from the flowering stage to the grain filling stage except for the 2016 2017 study year there were no significant variations in swc between tpm and rsm treatments for the whole soil proﬁle during the 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 study years however the swc value was signiﬁcantly lower under the ct treatment at maturity than for all of the other treatments during three consecutive growing seasons of winter wheat crops differences in soil water content can significantly affect the total et rate during three consecutive study years the et rate in the ct treatment was a considerable maximum compared with rp treatment from the sowing to tillering stage during the three consecutive study years and the et rate was a considerable maximum relative to the rpm treatment in 2017 2018 table 1 there were non significance variances in the et rate between the rp and rpm treatments during the three consecutive growing seasons however the et value of the ct was a considerable maximum compared with that of the rp treatment at the tillering to jointing stage the et rate for the tpm treatment was considerably lower compared with the other treatments the et rate for the tsm treatment was a considerable maximum compared with the rsm treatment in 2017 2018 there were no differences in et value between tpm and rp treatments in 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 at the jointing to anthesis stage while et for the ct and tsm treatments was a considerable maximum relative to the other treatments during 2015 2016 the et value in the ct treatment was a much smaller than it was for the rp treatment at the anthesis to maturity stage during the three consecutive study years the et of the ct treatment was at a minimum compared to the rp treatment in 2015 2016 but non significant variations were indicated for the rp and tpm treatments the soil water storage sws was a significant maximum under different mulch practices with both planting patterns table 2 the sws was improved during the sowing to jointing stage except 2015 2016 but the variances were all non signiﬁcant the rp system had a considerable maximum sws during the jointing stage relative to the ct practice during the three consecutive growing seasons the use of different mulch materials under two cropping practices increased sws at the jointing and flowering stages the sws of the rpm treatment was a considerable maximum compared with the rest of the treatments during the three consecutive growing seasons these results indicated that the rpm treatment had considerable retained maximum sws at the flowering to grain ﬁlling stage when significantly low rainfall occurred under the ct practice with gravel mulching a signiﬁcantly minimum sws occurred at the maturity stage during 2015 2016 table 3 3 2 total dry matter plant 1 and leaf area index lai various mulching materials signiﬁcantly increased the total dry matter at the different growth stages dry matter per plant was improved with the rp system at various growth stages compared with ct treatment the rpm treatment considerable improved total dry matter at the late growth stages relative to the tpm treatment total dry matter of the rpm was a considerable maximum compared with rsm at the re wintering stage from 2015 to 2016 and 2017 to 2018 however the variations between the rsm and rpm treatments were not signiﬁcant from 2016 to 2017 total dry matter with the rpm cultivation practice was a considerable maximum from 2015 to 2016 and 2016 to 2017 at the flowering to maturity stage compared with the rsm treatment however the variations between the rsm and rpm treatments were non signiﬁcant from 2017 to 2018 the probable reason is the high sws therefore in the long term plastic film mulching or gravels mulching under the rp system can improve the biomass per plant the dynamic variation in the lai was significantly influenced by the planting practices with various mulching materials practices during the three consecutive growing seasons fig 2 the variations in lai started at the jointing and reached a peak value during the flowering stage from the flowering stage to the grain filling stages the lai was slowly declining due to yellowing of the leaves the application of mulching materials significantly affected lai under the two cultivation practices excluding the tillering and re wintering stages during the winter wheat later growth stage the lai values under the ct practice tended to decline much more compared with the rp practice using different mulching materials thereby indicating that a lack of mulching materials could lead to early leaf senescence under both planting practices the differences in the lai values were not significant between tpm and rsm at different growth stages 3 3 stem water soluble carbohydrates wsc contents wsc traits in the stem and corresponding statistics are presented in table 4 during the three consecutive growing seasons planting practices with different mulching techniques signiﬁcantly aﬀ ected stem wsc at flowering and maturity and the apparent translocation amounts of wsc in the stem during the three consecutive growing seasons seasonal conditions modulated the eﬀ ect of planting practices on wsc in the stem to understand the multifaceted responses of wsc in the stem we combined the data during the three consecutive growing seasons by comparisons between the two planting practices with different mulching techniques at flowering wsc content in the stem improved in the rpm treatment but it did not show significant changes among the rsm rp and tsm treatments at maturity stem wsc content increased under the rpm and rsm cultivation practices but there was non considerable variance in the 2015 2016 and 2017 2018 study years consequently a significantly higher stem wsc translocation amount was recorded for the rpm cultivation practice but there was non considerable variance among the rp and tpm cultivation practices and the tsm and ct treatments during the 2015 2016 and 2017 2018 study years the stem wsc translocation ratio had non considerable variation among the different treatments except for the 2017 2018 study years generally the rpm treatment increased the apparent translocation amount and ratio of stem wsc at the flowering and maturity stages compared with the rest of the treatments as shown in table 4 the fruiting efficiency under the rp system with ridges and furrows covered with plastic film mulching were higher than in the other treatments during the three year experiment compared with rpm treatment the spi and fruiting efficiency in the rest of the treatments under the ct practices were a much smaller and in the rp practices they were much larger the rsm and rp treatment also improved fruiting efficiency and spi over that of the ct practice during the three year experiment 3 4 co2 and no2 ﬂuxes during the three consecutive growing seasons seasonal dynamics in co2 and no2 ﬂuxes were positive and underwent three fluctuations in all treatments fig 3 the emissions of co2 were low at the sowing stage and increased very quickly from flowering to the grain filling stage reaching its maximum at the grain filling stage and then showing a declining trend the emission of co2 and no2 under the rp system was significantly greater than that of the ct treatment fig 3 different planting practices with mulching materials at various growth stages significantly affected the emissions of co2 and no2 there were two peaks of n2o emissions during the three consecutive study years one at the jointing stage and the other at the grain filling stage fig 3 n2o emissions under the rpm planting practice were a considerable maximum compared with the rp planting practice fig 3 when compared with the rpm treatment the rsm and tpm treatments had no significant effects on n2o emissions during the study years from 2016 to 2017 and 2017 to 2018 for both planting practices mulching materials significantly affected n2o emissions the emission of n2o was lower at the grain filling stage and then improved very quickly from the tillering to the jointing stage reaching its maximum at the jointing stage and then it declined very sharply the rpm and rsm treatments changed n2o emissions significantly compared with the ct treatment while the n2o emission from the rp planting practice was a considerable maximum compared with ct treatment fig 3 the total emissions of co2 were also significantly influenced by planting methods with different mulching techniques over the three consecutive winter wheat growing seasons ranging from 3427 to 2927 kg co2 c ha 1 during 2015 2016 from 3330 to 2774 kg co2 c ha 1 during 2016 2017 and from 3395 to 2868 kg co2 c ha 1 during 2017 2018 respectively table 5 the ct rp and tsm treatments signiﬁcantly decreased the co2 emissions relative to the rpm and psm treatments over the three consecutive winter wheat growing seasons 3 5 npp nep crop water productivity and wheat production the annual npp ranged from 6524 to 5951 kg co2 ha 1 during 2015 2016 from 6638 to 5738 kg co2 ha 1 during 2016 2017 and from 6598 to 5862 kg co2 per ha 1 during 2017 to 2018 as presented in table 5 the annual npp had no considerable variations between the tpm and rpm treatments during 2017 2018 since the total biomass for all treatments had very similar values whereas during the 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 study years the rpm treatment had a higher annual npp value than that of the other treatments the nep involving the total amount of co2 ﬂuxes in the npp was significantly influenced by both planting models and diﬀ erent mulching materials during the three consecutive winter wheat growing seasons the annual nep ranged from 3565 to 2209 kg co2 ha 1 during the 2015 2016 period from 3270 to 1801 kg co2 ha 1 during the 2016 2017 period and from 3435 to 2022 kg co2 ha 1 during the 2017 2018 period table 5 the annual nep signiﬁcantly increased under rpm treatment compared to the rest of the treatments during the three consecutive winter wheat growing seasons an evaluation of crop water productivity from the 2015 to 2018 study years is presented in table 5 there was a considerable variation between the two planting practices in terms of cwpeco and cwpyield the cwpeco average value for the six treatments varied from 9 9 to 6 3 kg co2 ha 1 mm 1 during 2015 2016 from 7 7 to 4 3 kg co2 ha 1 mm 1 in 2016 2017 and from 8 7 to 5 2 kg co2 ha 1 mm 1 during 2017 2018 table 5 the mean value of the cwpyield significantly varied with a range of 20 9 12 8 kg seed ha 1 mm 1 during the 2015 2016 period from 18 3 to 8 8 kg seed ha 1 mm 1 during the 2016 2017 period and from 18 8 to 9 9 kg seed ha 1 mm 1 during the 2017 2018 period overall the rpm treatment cwpeco and cwpyield values were significantly higher than the rest of the treatments the means of three consecutive winter wheat growing seasons grain yield under the rpm rsm rp tpm and tsm treatments were 3 6 t ha 1 89 5 2 6 t ha 1 64 1 0 5 t ha 1 12 7 0 8 t ha 1 67 7 and 1 9 t ha 1 48 3 higher respectively than they were in the ct planting practice 4 discussion 4 1 soil water storage and evapotranspiration responses to various cultivation and mulching materials cultivation practices play a significant role in improving soil water storage in semi arid regions yuan et al 2009 lü et al 2013 plastic film mulching decreases evaporation and improves the soil water balance wang et al 2004 therefore improved crop water status mainly in a rain fed farming system where the key constraint affecting crop growth is water limitations can improve crop yields li et al 2000 the swc showed signiﬁcant differences among different mulching techniques under both planting practices at various growth stages gravel mulching protects the soil surface from direct sunlight and decreases soil radiation absorption and soil evaporation fang et al 2010 however swc decreased from the flowering stage into the grain filling stage except in the 2016 2017 study years there were no significant variations in swc between the tpm and rsm treatments for the whole soil proﬁle during the 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 study years however the swc value was signiﬁcantly low at maturity under the ct treatment relative to the other treatments during all three consecutive growing seasons of winter wheat crops the rp system with plastic film mulching enhanced crop production with a declining et rate as a result improving the crop water productivity under rain fed conditions wang et al 2011 the decrease of the et rate was mainly correlated with before flowering to limited water resources fang et al 2010 ma et al 2010 the et rate in the ct treatment was a considerable maximum compared with rp treatment from sowing to the tillering stage during the three consecutive study years and the et rate was a considerable maximum relative to the rpm treatment in the period from 2017 to 2018 there were non significance variances in the et rate between the rp and rpm treatments during the three consecutive growing seasons thus plastic mulching under the rp system improved the crop transpiration before and after flowering and this technique contributed to enhanced yields sadras and connor 1991 fereres and soriano 2007 soils around the world are affected by land degradation processes as a consequence of the abuse of grazing fire mining or agriculture sharma et al 2017 the gravel and plastic films used as surface mulching materials have been shown to improve the soil water balance and wheat yields bo et al 2015 pereira et al 2015 the rp system showed a considerable maximum sws during the jointing stage relative to the ct practice during the three consecutive growing seasons the use of different mulch materials under the two cropping practices increased sws at the jointing and flowering stages the sws for the rpm treatment was a considerable maximum compared with the rest of the treatments during the three consecutive growing seasons several field trials have shown that gravel mulching could significantly improve sws dry matter and wheat production lü et al 2013 qiu et al 2015 non suitable land management strategies and actions threaten the sustainable use of agricultural soils cerdà et al 2019 guadie et al 2020 our study showed that the total dry matter of the rpm was a considerable maximum compared with rsm at the re wintering stage during 2015 2016 and 2017 2018 however the variations between the rsm and rpm were non considerable during 2016 2017 the possible cause is the high sws so in the long term plastic film mulching or gravel mulching under the rp system will improve the biomass per plant plastic film use with returning crop rational coupling can decrease the et rate of wheat during the jointing to flowering stage fan et al 2005 chen et al 2017 reported that under the rp more water loss through transpiration is due to the maximum water uptake from a wide root distribution furthermore the maximum lai under different mulch treatments may also result in more transpiration than that of the ct treatment during the winter wheat later growth stage the lai values under the ct practice tended to decline much more compared with the rp practice using different mulching materials thereby indicating that a lack of mulching materials could lead to early leaf senescence under both planting practices 4 2 stem water soluble carbohydrates wsc contents responses to various cultivation and mulching materials the distribution of crop resources in response to different planting practices and mulching applications can stabilize crop production under drought conditions fang et al 2010 hu et al 2014 earlier field trials have revealed that different mulching practices under the rp system reduced the eﬀ ective tillers blum 1998 yang et al 2000 which resulted in improved wsc during flowering duggan et al 2005b and so more wsc translocation to the developing grain dreccer et al 2009 during the three consecutive growing seasons planting practices with different mulching techniques signiﬁcantly aﬀ ected wsc during flowering and ripening and obviously increased the translocation amount of wsc in the stem generally the rpm treatment increased the amount and ratio of wsc during the flowering and ripening stages more so than the rest of the treatments the crop grain yield is strongly correlated with the grain number spike 1 ji et al 2010 ferrante et al 2015 reported that grain yield is associated with biomass at flowering spi and fe while fischer 2011 showed that improvements of the grain yield might be attained by improving spi and fe our results indicated that fruiting efficiency under the rp system with ridges and furrows covered with plastic film mulching were higher than in the other treatments during the three year experiment compared with the rpm treatment the spi and fruiting efficiency in the rest of the treatments under the ct practices were a considerable minimum and in the rp practice were a considerable maximum 4 3 co2 and no2 ﬂuxes responses to various cultivation and mulching materials crop production and dry matter have a strong relationship to soil moisture content at various growth stages zhang et al 2009 bu et al 2013 the soil water balance is significantly associated with the conversion and capture of sunlight water inﬁltration and evaporation yuan et al 2009 moreover gravel mulching improves the soil carbon content and soil structure and decreases the soil bulk density bo et al 2015 liu et al 2016 during the three consecutive growing seasons seasonal dynamics in co2 and no2 ﬂuxes were positive and underwent three fluctuations in all treatments the emission of co2 and no2 by the rp planting was significantly greater than that in the ct treatment different cultivation practices with mulching materials at various growth stages significantly affected emissions of co2 and no2 the gravel and plastic film mulching improved the soil water content which aﬀ ected the co2 and no2 emissions li et al 2009 qiu et al 2015 abdalla et al 2013 indicated that greenhouse gas emissions and soil respiration are influenced by the soil water balance to evaluate net ecosystem production the total co2 fluxes have been studied from ecosystems lavigne et al 2004 in our study annual npp had no considerable variations between tpm and rpm treatment during 2017 2018 which was due to the total biomass for all treatments having very similar values whereas during the 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 study years the rpm treatment had a higher annual npp value than it did with the other treatments the nep linking the npp to the co2 emissions was significantly influenced by both planting models and diﬀ erent mulching materials during the three consecutive winter wheat growing seasons the annual nep signiﬁcantly increased under rpm treatment compared to the rest of the treatments during the three consecutive winter wheat growing seasons 4 4 crop water productivity and wheat production responses to various cultivation and mulching materials plastic and gravel mulching applications improving cwp yang et al 2004 grain yield relies on soil properties and depends on crop water productivity xie et al 2010 the cwpeco mean value for the six treatments ranged from 9 9 to 6 3 kg co2 ha 1 mm 1 during 2015 2016 from 7 7 to 4 3 kg co2 ha 1 mm 1 during 2016 2017 and from 8 7 to 5 2 kg co2 ha 1 mm 1 during 2017 2018 straw mulching improves the soil physicochemical properties di prima et al 2018 increases crop production and productivity and reduces land degradation neutrality challenges cerdà et al 2018 in semi arid areas both plastic film and gravel mulching could increase the cwpeco and cwpyield because they completely consume the rainfall or irrigation water morison et al 2008 gong et al 2017 the cwp has become one of the frontiers of field crops research feng et al 2016 li et al 2005 the means of the three consecutive winter wheat growing seasons grain yield under the rpm rsm rp tpm and tsm treatments were 3 6 t ha 1 89 5 2 6 t ha 1 64 1 0 5 t ha 1 12 7 0 8 t ha 1 67 7 and 1 9 t ha 1 48 3 higher respectively than that of the ct planting practice 5 conclusions we showed that cultivation and mulching materials strategies had considerable effects on soil moisture content crop productivity ecological eﬀ ects and et rates under rain fed conditions in china the rp cultivation practice with different mulching practices signiﬁcantly increased soil moisture and ecosystem co2 and no2 emissions during the three consecutive study years the rp cropping system with gravel or plastic film mulching on the furrows improved the lai and biomass per plant at the late growth stage and it increased the cwps the nep and npp were signiﬁcantly influenced by rpm treatment during the three consecutive study years compared to the without mulch treatments the annual cwpeco and cwpyield significantly increased under the rpm treatment during the three study years in addition the rpm treatment significantly improved spi had a high fruiting eﬃciency increased wsc in the stem increased apparent translocation amount and ratio and then achieved a high grain yield in our study we showed that the rpm treatment was an eﬀ ective approach for water saving and led to significantly improved cwpeco cwpyield and wheat production under the semi arid conditions future study is necessary
