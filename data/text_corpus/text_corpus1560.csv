7800,reservoir eutrophication is a critical natural hazard in countries with rapid agricultural and industrial development to simulate the eutrophication of the fengshan reservoir the algal bloom occurrence patterns in the reservoir were modeled using the environmental fluid dynamics code efdc for understanding the algal dynamics the calibration and validation of the efdc were performed by comparing the model results with field data the model was calibrated against the hydrodynamic data including the water level and water temperature and water quality data from four monitoring stations in the study area uncertainty analysis was conducted using a perturbance moment method pmm with the efdc model parameter uncertainty was considered in this study the order of importance of model parameters in terms of their uncertainty contribution to the overall uncertainty of water quality simulations was obtained the calibrated and validated model was then used to investigate three contaminant remediation scenarios a increasing the water level b dilution and c reaeration operational uncertainty was also considered as there exists variability in the remediation effort and project execution for a complex engineering system like reservoirs finally probabilistic eutrophication risk mapping was established for each remediation effort to facilitate decision making in eutrophication risk assessment graphical abstract ga1 keywords reservoir remediation operational uncertainty probabilistic eutrophication risk mapping eutrophication risk assessment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction reservoirs are the primary sources of water for industrial and domestic use lately because of the excessive development of catchment areas and poor soil and water conservation the water quality of reservoirs and their catchment areas has become a serious environmental concern among others reservoir eutrophication is a critical natural hazard in countries with rapid agricultural and industrial development reservoir eutrophication not only causes a severe impact on the ecological environment of the water body but also impairs the quality of drinking water water eutrophication will change the algae population and change the distribution of algae in the water resulting in species changes and abnormal increase in water biomass which will have substantial negative impacts on the water environment the massive growth in algae and plankton will augment the number of organic matters moreover in the future the algae will settle to the bottom to become sediment which may accelerate the aging of the reservoir six reservoirs in taiwan have been identified as a reservoir facing the crisis of eutrophication among these six reservoirs the fengshan reservoir exhibits the most severe eutrophication chang and chuang 2001 this study focuses on the fengshan reservoir in taiwan which is the only reservoir in kaohsiung city and is an off stream reservoir the main water source of the fengshan reservoir is the donggang river this reservoir also receives some water from the gaoping river during the rainy season the fengshan reservoir was originally aimed at providing public and industrial water however due to its deteriorating water quality the fengshan reservoir only supplies industrial water currently the pollution load sources of the fengshan reservoir include 1 nonpoint source pollution in its catchment area 2 a large amount of wastewater discharged by pig farmers into the donggang river and 3 the high turbidity overflow from the gaoping river barrage coupled hydrodynamic and eutrophication models which provide insights into the relationship between nutrients and eutrophication for a specific water body can be used to simulate the water quality of the fengshan reservoir and to enable managers to develop suitable remediation strategies for the reservoir therefore in this study the environmental fluids dynamics code efdc was selected as the computational platform for developing a coupled hydrodynamic and eutrophication model for the fengshan reservoir the efdc is a comprehensive three dimensional numerical model that was developed at the virginia institute of marine science hamrick 1992 the efdc contains some multidimensional modules such as hydrodynamics water quality sediment transport and toxics modules it solves 3d vertically hydrostatic free surface and turbulent averaged equations of motion for a variable density fluid the efdc model involves a the use of finite difference element instructed grids b the investigation of wetting drying boundary processes c the investigation of heat exchange with the atmosphere and d water quality variable simulation the efdc has been used in simulation and decision support analysis for many bodies of surface water such as rivers lakes estuaries reservoirs wetlands and coastal regions this code was used in the analysis of the salinity intrusion characteristics of the downstream part of the geum river sangman et al 2010 the efdc has also been used to examine eutrophication for example the efdc was used to simulate the eutrophication process in daoxiang lake beijing wu et al 2011 moreover the aforementioned code was used to explore the eutrophication responses to load reduction scenarios in lake yilong china zhao et al 2013 due to the complexity of changes in the water environment system in nature the current understanding regarding the physical processes and transformation principle of pollutants in space is insufficient akomeah et al 2021 thus data variability and the uncertainty associated with model parameters cannot be avoided in water quality modeling kumar et al 2021 palma et al 2014 pastres et al 1997 for example to simulate the process of eutrophication we need to use algae related parameters such as the growth rate and mortality however we usually cannot obtain dynamic values for such parameters using a constant rate for algae related parameters causes differences between the simulated values and the measured data due to the model conceptualization uncertainty oberkampf et al 2004 in addition variability exists in remediation efforts and project execution such variability leads to operation and regulation uncertainty as summarized in table 1 in engineering problems uncertainty originates from a lack of understanding of the model measurement errors and the limited availability of data in addition there exists variability in the remediation effort and project execution related to a complex engineering system which will lead to operation and management uncertainty liu et al 2021 accordingly to make informed decisions uncertainty must be considered in the mathematical modeling of a complex system such as reservoirs mcfarland and decarlo 2020 in general deterministic mathematical models always produce specific and unique outputs when they are provided with the same sequence of inputs and parameters these models may fail to provide comprehensive results because of uncertainties such as model conceptualization uncertainty and data related uncertainty franceschini and tsai 2010 the treatment of model uncertainty usually involves considering the probability of the data the input variables and model parameters must be considered as random variables thus each input variable or model parameter not only changes spatially and temporally but also has different probabilities at different locations and times kao 2018 numerous methods can be used to determine the uncertainty many researchers have contributed to the development of uncertainty analysis methods called point estimation methods pems one of the main advantages of pems is their high computational efficiency various pems such as the methods of rosenblueth 1975 harr 1989 li 1992 hong 1998 and tsai and franceschini 2005 have been used in uncertainty analysis franceschini et al 2012a 2012b suggested a state of the art method called the perturbance moment method pmm which provides a three point estimate based on taylor expansion the pmm was adopted in this study the most important characteristic of the pmm is that it can ignore the correlation between random variables this characteristic distinguishes the pmm from other pems the pmm uses steiner s theorem a so called parallel axis theorem to eliminate the possibility of generating negative variances when models or functions are nonlinear tsai et al 2019 2021 this paper is organized as follows in section two the study area fengshan reservoir is specified and its fundamental information is delivered in section three we introduce the methodology including two different modules in efdc the water quality module and the hydrodynamic module moreover uncertainty analysis using the perturbance moment method pmm comes after in section four the model set up calibration validation and three remediation efforts increasing the water level dilution and reaeration are performed next the probabilistic risk mapping of reservoir eutrophication is introduced in sections five and six discussion of the results limitation of this study and recommendations for future work are presented 2 study site the fengshan reservoir the fengshan reservoir is located at the southern end of fengshan in linyuan township kaohsiung city kaohsiung county southeast of xiaogang district taiwan the reservoir is located approximately 22 km from the center of kaohsiung city the construction of the reservoir was started in july 1980 to solve the water shortage problem in the kaohsiung area the construction was completed in january 1981 the water sources of the fengshan reservoir are the donggang river and gaoping river as shown in fig 1 these rivers contain large amounts of nutrients e g total phosphorus tp and ammonia nitrogen that originate from the wastewater generated during animal husbandry activities and are eventually introduced into the fengshan reservoir moreover in 2009 typhoon morakot hit taiwan and caused considerable damage after this disaster the turbidity and sediment concentration of the gaoping river increased which increased the nutrient concentration in the fengshan reservoir wu et al 2011 due to the extremely rich nutrient content of the reservoir a considerable number of algae which are called algal blooms grows in it consequently the fengshan reservoir has undergone eutrophication the purpose of the fengshan reservoir before the advent of eutrophication was to supply water for domestic use in kaohsiung after the emergence of eutrophication the reservoir has only been used to supply industrial water due to the extensive pollution of the fengshan reservoir over recent decades significant concerns exist regarding the reservoir s water quality especially its nutrient loading and eutrophication 3 methodology this study provides a comprehensive and realistic representation of the water transport and water quality variables in the fengshan reservoir by coupling deterministic modeling with uncertainty analysis as described in the following sections 3 1 efdc hydrodynamic module the efdc is composed of several modules including hydrodynamics water quality sediment transport and toxics modules the efdc has been used to conduct simulations and decision support analyses for many bodies of surface water such as rivers lakes estuaries reservoirs wetlands and coastal regions the hydrodynamic module mainly describes the movement of water flow which is the foundation of sediment transport and water quality migration the construction of governing equations commences with the development of the vertically hydrostatic boundary layer form of the turbulent equations of motion for an incompressible variable density fluid the equations are constructed under the assumption that ambient environmental flows are characterized by horizontal length scales that are multiple orders of magnitude higher than their vertical length scales in the horizontal direction the equations are expressed using a curvilinear coordinate system and in the vertical direction the equations are expressed using a sigma transformation the momentum and continuity equations are obtained from the vertically hydrostatic boundary layer form of the turbulent equations of motion and the boussinesq approximation of the variable density plus salinity and temperature are expressed as different parameters in the transport equation please refer to the appendix for more details 3 2 efdc water quality module the water quality eutrophication module is the core module of the efdc model its variable definitions and kinetic processes are derived from the ce qual icm water quality model cerco and cole 1955 as described by park et al 1995 organic forms of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus are expressed as refractory particulate labile particulate and labile dissolve the following sections explore the variables and their kinetic equations of interaction the governing mass balance equation for the water quality variables can be expressed as follows 1 t m x m y h c x m y h u c y m x h v c z m x m y w c x m y h a x m x c x y m x h a y m y c y z m x m y a z h c z m x m y h s c where m x and m y are the coordinate conversion factors whose values are equal to 1 in cartesian coordinates h is the total depth and is equal to the sum of the depth below and the free surface displacement h ζ h c denotes the water quality variable concentration a x a y and a z are the turbulent diffusion coefficients along the x y and z directions respectively the final three terms on the left side of eq 1 explain the advective transport and the first three terms on the right side explain the diffusive transport the final term in eq 1 is the source or sink term algae play an important role in the water quality process algae are grouped into three state variables in the efdc model namely cyanobacteria diatoms and green algae which are denoted by the subscripts c d and g respectively the sources and sinks for algae included in the model are growth production basal metabolism predation settling and external loads the kinetic equation of algae can be expressed as follows 2 b x t p x bm x pr x b x z ws x b x w b x v where b x denotes the algal biomass of algal group x g m 3 p x b m x and p r x are the production rate basal metabolism rate and predation rate of algal group x respectively day 1 ws x is the settling velocity of algal group x m day w b x is the external load of algal group x g day and v is the cell volume m 3 the vertical velocity along the σ coordinate is expressed as follows 3 w w z ζ t u m x ζ x v m y ζ y 1 z u m x h x v m y h y where w denotes the vertical velocity component along the σ coordinate m s and w is the physical vertical velocity m s 3 3 uncertainty analysis using perturbance moment method pmm in this study the pmm was used to determine the order of importance of each stochastic parameter the pmm is a point estimation method based on taylor series expansion and was proposed by franceschini et al 2012a 2012b the main advantages of the pmm are as follows 1 similar to other pems the pmm overcomes the shortcoming of time consumption in monte carlo simulation 2 pmm can be used to deal with a negative variance 3 the entire probability distribution of a random variable can be represented by three points with weighting coefficients and 4 the pmm can ignore correlations between random variables the three discrete points x i x o x i and corresponding weight coefficients p i p o p i of the ith random variable x i can be computed as follows 4 x γ xi 4 κ xi 3 γ xi 2 2 and x γ xi 4 κ xi 3 γ xi 2 2 5 x i μ xi x σ xi and p i 1 x x x 6 x i μ xi x σ xi and p i 1 x x x 7 x 0 μ xi and p 0 1 p i p i where x and x denote the standardized values of x i and x i respectively and μ xi σ xi γ xi and κ xi represent the mean value standard deviation skewness coefficient and kurtosis coefficient of the random variable x i respectively according to bolle 1994 the m th moment of the weighted averages of the distances d i can be defined as follows 8 e d i m p i d i m p i d i m where d i y i y and d i y i y y i denotes the discrete points of the output variable y i y is the central value of the output variable y i and e d i m is the perturbation moment of the m th order about the points y i and y i the expected value of y can be calculated as the sum of a central value y and n disturbing moments as follows 9 e y y i 1 n e d i m y i 1 n p i d i m p i d i m w h e r e m 1 f o r t h e f i r s t s t a t i s t i c a l m o m e n t to derive the variance of y e d i 2 must be redefined as the perturbation moment of the second order about the points y i and y i then the parallel axis theorem steiner s theorem is used to calculate the moment of inertia as follows 10 e d μ i 2 e d i 2 p i e i 2 where p i p i p i and e i is the distance between the weighted average of the function y evaluated at the discrete points of the variable x i and the value y the parameter e i can be expressed as follows 11 e i p i y i p i y i p 0 y y p i y i p i y i p i p i y the variance of y can be obtained by summing the central value var y and n disturbing moments e d μ i 2 as follows 12 var y var y i 1 n e d μ i 2 i 1 n e d μ i 2 4 model development and application 4 1 model setup model setup involves the generation of a grid and the development of the initial and boundary conditions 4 1 1 grid generation a curvilinear grid was developed to discretize the fengshan reservoir a water quality model was designed by assigning 680 active grids the smallest and largest grids covered areas of approximately 59 53 and 3848 91 m 2 respectively in the horizontal plane the average water depth of the fengshan reservoir is 5 33 m and the largest water depth of the reservoir is 8 04 m due to the low water depth in the reservoir no significant thermal stratification occurs moreover detailed stratification data are not available for the reservoir therefore only one vertical layer was considered for the fengshan reservoir one inflow outflow boundary and four water quality monitoring sites were allocated to the computation domain for water quality simulation fig 2 4 1 2 initial and boundary conditions in this study the initial conditions were the starting time water temperature water velocity water surface elevation and concentrations of water quality variables the starting time was january 1 2018 julian date 0 and the simulation period was from january 1 2018 to september 30 2019 as the data during this period are the most recent complete dataset available for efdc modeling according to the temperature measured in early january the initial water temperature was set as 21 75 the water velocity was initialized as 0 m s according to standard conventions in hydrodynamic modeling the initial elevation of the reservoir water surface was 44 56 m the water surface was assumed to be a plane information regarding the initial water quality was acquired through field monitoring in the reservoir in january 2018 the boundary conditions were the external driving forces applied to the eutrophication model system the lateral boundary conditions based on the data from the donggang river and gaoping river were the daily inflow and outflow rates monthly water temperature and monthly water quality constituent concentrations the lateral boundary conditions were obtained from the taiwan water corporation and the environmental protection administration for points with available data on the inflow rate and water quality concentrations the boundary conditions were set directly according to the observed data the surface boundary conditions were expressed in terms of daily meteorological conditions including the wind speed wind direction atmospheric pressure air temperature relative humidity precipitation evaporation solar radiation and cloud cover the meteorological data were acquired from the central weather bureau of taiwan in the fengshan reservoir eutrophication model the boundary conditions were configured according to the monitoring data collected during the study period 4 2 model calibration and validation model calibration was performed using data from january 1 to december 31 2018 moreover model validation was performed using data from january 1 to september 30 2019 model simulation was conducted with a time step of 3 s which was determined to be sufficiently small for guaranteeing stability and accuracy the parameters of the eutrophication model were calibrated through trial and error adjustment and grid search to reproduce the observed temporal and spatial patterns the key parameters are presented in table 2 in the hydrodynamic module the water elevation and water temperature were calibrated and validated at four monitoring stations in the reservoir figs 3 and 4a figs 3 and 4a indicate that the simulation results were in good agreement with the observed daily water elevation and monthly water temperature thus an overall balance existed among water mass related processes such as inflows outflows precipitation and evaporation the variables used for simulation in the water quality module included tp ammonia nitrogen nh 4 dissolved oxygen do and chlorophyll a chl a concentrations comparisons of the observed and simulated values are illustrated in fig 4b e the simulated results agreed well with the observed values which indicated that the established water quality model can accurately simulate the eutrophication process 4 3 remediation efforts after the eutrophication model of the fengshan reservoir was calibrated and validated the model was used to determine the eutrophication response to removing nutrient loadings or improving hydraulic conditions the primary purpose of developing the eutrophication model of the fengshan reservoir was to provide a series of potential management scenarios for reducing the nutrient content improving the water quality and finally mitigating eutrophication the three scenarios for controlling water quality are a increasing inflow by 7 5 to increase the water level b replacing the water from the sources with water from the linbian river and sizhong river and c increasing the do content to prevent the reduction of the bottom water layer and thereby reduce the production of ammonia nitrogen and dissolved phosphorus plus the three scenarios are discussed in more detail in 4 3 1 4 3 2 4 3 3 respectively the levels of nutrients and chl a in the eutrophication model of the fengshan reservoir were considered as the baseline conditions 4 3 1 increasing the water level in the case of shallow water bodies such as the fengshan reservoir sediment is disturbed by the wind and waves and nutrients are released the water surface can be raised to increase the height of the water layer to avoid such a phenomenon in addition to inhibiting the release of nutrients the growth of algae is suppressed due to the light limitation caused by the increased water depth in this study we considered an increase of 7 5 in the inflow to increase the water level and maximize the total capacity of the fengshan reservoir to its allowable limit in general no noticeable improvement was observed in the water quality when increasing the inflow rate because the water pollution load of the fengshan reservoir mainly originates from external sources the internal load cannot be reduced by increasing the water level nevertheless an increase in the water elevation which results in less light penetration into the water body increases the difficulty of photosynthesis thus the algae can be reduced the chl a concentration can be reduced by an average of 35 775 when increasing the flow rate fig 5a 4 3 2 dilution because up to 90 of the pollution sources of the fengshan reservoir originate from external sources the most direct method of water quality improvement is to perform dilution by replacing the water source introducing a water source that does not contain nutrients or micronutrients can reduce the pollution load of the entire water body in this study the linbian river and sizhong river to the south of the donggang river were considered for substituting the original water sources remarkable water quality improvement results were obtained when using alternative water sources mainly because the replacement of the original inferior water sources led to a significant reduction in the external pollution load the chl a concentration could be reduced by 35 675 and 73 6 when replacing the original water sources with the linbian river and sizhong river respectively fig 5b 4 3 3 reaeration the primary function of reaeration is to force water bodies to mix and increase the contact between the water layer and the atmosphere reservoir reareation can be achieved by hypolimnetic aeration and oxygenation or other engineering technology when the bottom of the reservoir is in an anaerobic state the amount of phosphorus released increases significantly thus increasing the do content can decrease the production of ammonia nitrogen and dissolved phosphorus in this study do was added to the water in the reservoir and the inflow water to achieve reaeration the water quality can be improved more effectively when increasing the do content in the inflow water than when increasing the do content in the reservoir because the pollution load of the fengshan reservoir mainly originates from external sources the chl a concentration can be reduced by 28 375 and 36 8 when reaerating the internal and external loads respectively fig 5c 4 3 4 scenario analysis comparison the primary purpose of this study was to reduce the algal biomass in the fengshan reservoir to mitigate its eutrophication accordingly we used the carlson trophic state index ctsi to determine the improvement efficiency for each considered scenario we concluded that the most efficient water quality improvement strategy is dilution followed by water level increase and reaeration table 3 4 4 uncertainty analysis after the calibration and validation of the efdc hydrodynamic and water quality modules the chl a concentration was simulated through uncertainty analysis in this study the pmm was adopted for uncertainty analysis 4 4 1 uncertain variables in the efdc model the five parameters selected after sensitivity analysis namely the background horizontal eddy viscosity aho background light extinction coefficient bl maximum growth rate for greens mg basal metabolism rate for greens bm and predation rate on greens pr were applied in the efdc model combined with the pmm to assess the eutrophication situation the assessment was conducted on the basis of one approximation that the correlations among the five random variables can be ignored a triangular distribution was selected for characterizing the parameter variability in uncertainty analysis the statistical characteristics of the five random variables and their representative points obtained using the pmm are presented in the supplementary information 4 4 2 influence of the random variables on the variability of outputs in this study the five selected parameters were assumed to be independent of each other and were treated as random variables unlike most of the data driven models lin etal 2021 efdc is a physically based model for hydrodynamics and water quality as such the nonlinear and complicated relationship between these variables has been mostly depicted in the governing equations according to the pmm we used 11 representative points to evaluate the expected value and standard deviation the variability of the chl a concentration was influenced by the random variables the contribution of each random variable to the variability of the chl a concentration was calculated as follows 13 δ var k var y run k var y run all 100 where var y run all is the variability when considering all the random variables and var y run k is as defined in table 4 each successive run contained one additional random variable the results of each run were compared to evaluate the degree of influence of the selected random variables the cumulative effects which are denoted by run 5 were also calculated the results indicated that the maximum growth rate for greens had the largest contribution to the overall variability of the chl a concentration fig 6 and table 5 to determine the order of significance among other stochastic random variables we develop a sequence of simulations by adding a single random variable one at a time as shown in table 6a and b with an increase in variance in each simulation it is easy to identify the major contributing random variable plus we simulate all the random variables in reverse order table 6c and d to observe whether the order of influence of each random variable changes the results shown in table 6 indicate that the ranking of the significant order is barely the same between the first and the second changing sequence of contribution to the variability of the output therefore it can be claimed that the hydrodynamic and contaminant transport processes are highly nonlinear and that different sources of uncertainty may produce either additive or compensative effects on the overall uncertainty tsai and li 2014 4 4 3 risk analysis if a standard chl a concentration is defined the risk of eutrophication is the probability of exceeding the predetermined standard risk as be defined as follows risk p c output c standard where c output is the output chl a concentration obtained using the pmm and c standard denotes the standard chl a concentration the following two assumptions were made in this study 1 the output chl a and tp concentrations follow a lognormal distribution and 2 the standard concentrations of chl a and tp are 50 µg l and 40 µg l respectively based on the established water quality standard we combined the multivariable index of ctsi with a single index of total phosphorous and transparency to compute the probability of chlorophyll a concentration exceeding the above water quality standard which is defined as risk the above standard can then be back calculated from the carlson trophic state index ctsi established for the fengshan reservoir in this study we calculated the risk of the chl a and tp concentrations changing with season we concluded that the eutrophication risk of the chl a concentration was the highest in the spring and the average risk was 74 664 the eutrophication risk of the tp concentration was very severe all the time and the average risk was 98 832 4 4 4 probabilistic eutrophication risk mapping deterministic eutrophication mapping was conducted to simulate the area covered by algae during eutrophication fig 7a illustrates the output chl a concentrations obtained through deterministic modeling for the four seasons the chl a concentrations in the south and north of the fengshan reservoir were larger than those in other parts of the reservoir thus the eutrophication situation is more severe in the south and north of the reservoir than in its other parts the chl a concentration was higher in the spring and winter than in the other seasons the average chl a concentrations in the spring and winter were 61 32 and 49 86 μ g l respectively the output chl a concentration obtained through deterministic modeling first exhibited a decreasing trend and then exhibited an increasing trend the highest and lowest chl a concentrations occurred in the spring and summer respectively the concentration gradually increased in the autumn and winter the next step was to further consider the uncertainty i e parameter uncertainty and operational uncertainty when modeling the output chl a concentration and to develop probabilistic eutrophication mapping the results of probabilistic eutrophication mapping are displayed in fig 7b as displayed in fig 7b the output chl a concentration obtained through stochastic modeling first exhibited a decreasing trend and then exhibited an increasing trend the highest and lowest chl a concentrations occurred in the spring and summer respectively the concentration gradually increased in the autumn and winter however when uncertainty was considered the average output chl a concentrations in the spring and winter reached 98 79 and 67 12 μ g l respectively in addition significant differences were noted between the cases with positive and negative standard deviations thus performing uncertainty analysis is essential the eutrophication potential can also be depicted using contours of the exceedance probability these contours indicate the exceedance probability of a certain chl a concentration the advantage of such contours is that they can be used to quickly determine the exceedance probability of a specific chl a concentration when compared to the established water quality threshold for instance if we consider the uncertainty of the model parameters fig 8a monitoring station 1 has a eutrophication probability of approximately 65 under the expected situation in the winter whereas the eutrophication probabilities of some parts of stations 2 4 are up to 90 95 moreover under the expected situations in the other seasons the probabilities of eutrophication of the entire reservoir are significantly higher ideal operation might not be achieved each time in the implementation of various contaminant remediation efforts thus deviations are caused during remediation procedure implementation consequently we must consider the operational uncertainty for example because achieving a full water level in every process is impossible we adjusted the operation water level between 90 and 100 of the target water level increase in the scenario analysis for increasing the water level as displayed in fig 8b except in summer the areas with the highest risk of eutrophication were in the north and south of the fengshan reservoir the probabilities of eutrophication in the north and south were more than 50 because replacing water sources can significantly improve the water quality identifying the areas of eutrophication risk is difficult when chl a is used as the concentration standard therefore we also used the ctsi single variable chl a concentration standard which is equal to 7 2 μ g l fig 8c to identify areas with high eutrophication risk as depicted in fig 8c the exceedance probability for the chl a concentration being 7 2 μ g l was relatively high especially in the north and south of the reservoir moreover the exceedance probabilities of stations 3 and 4 were always higher than 90 by contrast the exceedance probabilities for the chl a concentration being 50 μ g l were less significant fig 8d the highest exceedance probability under the condition was only 16 05 in the winter last with the exceeding probability contour the government can mark the location exposed under risk precisely with three types of remediation scenarios including raising the water level dilution and reaeration not only the release of nutrients is inhibited but also the growth of algae is suppressed 5 conclusions the primary purpose of this study was to develop a eutrophication model for the fengshan reservoir by using the efdc to investigate a series of potential management scenarios for reducing the nutrient content improving the water quality and mitigating eutrophication another purpose of this study was to couple a state of the art uncertainty analysis method called the pmm with the efdc hydrodynamic and water quality modules for analyzing the uncertainty of the chl a concentration the specific contributions of this study as opposed to several existing literature on reservoir water quality modeling and remediation e g chang and chuang 2001 cheng et al 2016 dai et al 2016 are two folds this study incorporates the pmm into a physically based hydrodynamic and water quality model to simulate reservoir eutrophication in a probabilistic manner moreover reservoir eutrophication potential mapping is developed under three remediation scenarios which allows a more comprehensive probabilistic evaluation of the pollution prone regions in the reservoir eutrophication is a common natural disaster that occurs in countries that have undergone rapid agricultural and industrial development it has many effects on the public environment and public health such as affecting the color and odor of a water body destroying the ecological environment around a water body and increasing the concentration of trihalomethane in drinking water this study developed a eutrophication model for the fengshan reservoir in kaohsiung city the model reasonably reproduced the observed water level water temperature and water quality variables and thus provided a fairly good numerical representation of the hydrodynamics and eutrophication kinetics in the reservoir three reservoir remediation efforts namely increasing the water level dilution and reaeration were considered for controlling the water quality in the fengshan reservoir the scenario analysis results indicated that the most efficient water quality improvement was yielded in the dilution scenario followed by increasing the water level and reaeration in this study five random variables namely aho bl mg bm and pr were used to conduct uncertainty analysis the correlations between each pair of random variables were negligible the results indicated that the chl a concentrations obtained with the pmm were always higher than those obtained through deterministic modeling furthermore when the chl a concentration was higher the variability of the output concentration was more significant this study determined the order of importance of each random variable mg had the largest contribution to the overall variability of the output chl a concentration however variations in the sequence of addition of the random variables changed the order of influence of each component thus different sources of uncertainty may produce additive or compensative effects on the overall uncertainty plus this study evaluated the risk of the output concentration exceeding a certain established threshold and developed probabilistic eutrophication mapping the results indicated that the eutrophication risk for the chl a concentration was the highest during spring and the average eutrophication risk for chl a was 74 664 the eutrophication risk for the tp concentration was very severe all the time and the average eutrophication risk for the tp was 98 832 the significant differences between the probabilistic eutrophication mapping results for positive and negative standard deviations revealed that uncertainty analysis is critical the advantage of probabilistic eutrophication mapping is that one can quickly and clearly identify areas with potential eutrophication risk under a specific chl a concentration we also consider the operational uncertainty in the various contaminant remediation efforts and we can conclude that the areas with the highest risk of eutrophication were in the north and south of the fengshan reservoir in summary probabilistic eutrophication potential mapping can facilitate decision making in eutrophication risk assessment 6 limitations of study and recommendation for future work the proposed probabilistic eutrophication model has a limited applicability to deep water reservoirs with strong stratification the simulation of eutrophication of the fengshan reservoir can be further improved with more comprehensive salinity silica and meteorological data moreover the optimization algorithms such as the genetic algorithm ga and particle swarm optimization pso can be used to facilitate model calibration thecorrelations among the adopted five critical model parameters in the perturbance moment method pmm should be further considered and quantified if available finally from the scenario analysis of increasing water level it can be found that owing to the increase of the water elevation which results in less light penetration into the water body and then suppresses the growth of algae other direct sunlight reduction methods can be further explored to achieve the purpose of inhibiting algae growth credit

7800,reservoir eutrophication is a critical natural hazard in countries with rapid agricultural and industrial development to simulate the eutrophication of the fengshan reservoir the algal bloom occurrence patterns in the reservoir were modeled using the environmental fluid dynamics code efdc for understanding the algal dynamics the calibration and validation of the efdc were performed by comparing the model results with field data the model was calibrated against the hydrodynamic data including the water level and water temperature and water quality data from four monitoring stations in the study area uncertainty analysis was conducted using a perturbance moment method pmm with the efdc model parameter uncertainty was considered in this study the order of importance of model parameters in terms of their uncertainty contribution to the overall uncertainty of water quality simulations was obtained the calibrated and validated model was then used to investigate three contaminant remediation scenarios a increasing the water level b dilution and c reaeration operational uncertainty was also considered as there exists variability in the remediation effort and project

risk assessment graphical abstract ga1 keywords reservoir remediation operational uncertainty probabilistic eutrophication risk mapping eutrophication risk assessment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction reservoirs are the primary sources of water for industrial and domestic use lately because of the excessive development of catchment areas and poor soil and water conservation the water quality of reservoirs and their catchment areas has become a serious environmental concern among others reservoir eutrophication is a critical natural hazard in countries with rapid agricultural and industrial development reservoir eutrophication not only causes a severe impact on the ecological environment of the water body but also impairs the quality of drinking water water eutrophication will change the algae population and change the distribution of algae in the water resulting in species changes and abnormal increase in water biomass which will have substantial negative impacts on the water environment the massive growth in algae and plankton will augment the number of organic matters moreover in the future the algae will settle to the bottom to become sediment which may accelerate the aging of the reservoir six reservoirs in taiwan have been identified as a reservoir facing the crisis of eutrophication among these six reservoirs the fengshan reservoir exhibits the most severe eutrophication chang and chuang 2001 this study focuses on the fengshan reservoir in taiwan which is the only reservoir in kaohsiung city and is an off stream reservoir the main water source of the fengshan reservoir is the donggang river this reservoir also receives some water from the gaoping river during the rainy season the fengshan reservoir was originally aimed at providing public and industrial water however due to its deteriorating water quality the fengshan reservoir only supplies industrial water currently the pollution load sources of the fengshan reservoir include 1 nonpoint source pollution in its catchment area 2 a large amount of wastewater discharged by pig farmers into the donggang river and 3 the high turbidity overflow from the gaoping river barrage coupled hydrodynamic and eutrophication models which provide insights into the relationship between nutrients and eutrophication for a specific water body can be used to simulate the water quality of the fengshan reservoir and to enable managers to develop suitable remediation strategies for the reservoir therefore in this study the environmental fluids dynamics code efdc was selected as the computational platform for developing a coupled hydrodynamic and eutrophication model for the fengshan reservoir the efdc is a comprehensive three dimensional numerical model that was developed at the virginia institute of marine science hamrick 1992 the efdc contains some multidimensional modules such as hydrodynamics water quality sediment transport and toxics modules it solves 3d vertically hydrostatic free surface and turbulent averaged equations of motion for a variable density fluid the efdc model involves a the use of finite difference element instructed grids b the investigation of wetting drying boundary processes c the investigation of heat exchange with the atmosphere and d water quality variable simulation the efdc has been used in simulation and decision support analysis for many bodies of surface water such as rivers lakes estuaries reservoirs wetlands and coastal regions this code was used in the analysis of the salinity intrusion characteristics of the downstream part of the geum river sangman et al 2010 the efdc has also been used to examine eutrophication for example the efdc was used to simulate the eutrophication process in daoxiang lake beijing wu et al 2011 moreover the aforementioned code was used to explore the eutrophication responses to load reduction scenarios in lake yilong china zhao et al 2013 due to the complexity of changes in the water environment system in nature the current understanding regarding the physical processes and transformation principle of pollutants in space is insufficient akomeah et al 2021 thus data variability and the uncertainty associated with model parameters cannot be avoided in water quality modeling kumar et al 2021 palma et al 2014 pastres et al 1997 for example to simulate the process of eutrophication we need to use algae related parameters such as the growth rate and mortality however we usually cannot obtain dynamic values for such parameters using a constant rate for algae related parameters causes differences between the simulated values and the measured data due to the model conceptualization uncertainty oberkampf et al 2004 in addition variability exists in remediation efforts and project execution such variability leads to operation and regulation uncertainty as summarized in table 1 in engineering problems uncertainty originates from a lack of understanding of the model measurement errors and the limited availability of data in addition there exists variability in the remediation effort and project execution related to a complex engineering system which will lead to operation and management uncertainty liu et al 2021 accordingly to make informed decisions uncertainty must be considered in the mathematical modeling of a complex system such as reservoirs mcfarland and decarlo 2020 in general deterministic mathematical models always produce specific and unique outputs when they are provided with the same sequence of inputs and parameters these models may fail to provide comprehensive results because of uncertainties such as model conceptualization uncertainty and data related uncertainty franceschini and tsai 2010 the treatment of model uncertainty usually involves considering the probability of the data the input variables and model parameters must be considered as random variables thus each input variable or model parameter not only changes spatially and temporally but also has different probabilities at different locations and times kao 2018 numerous methods can be used to determine the uncertainty many researchers have contributed to the development of uncertainty analysis methods called point estimation methods pems one of the main advantages of pems is their high computational efficiency various pems such as the methods of rosenblueth 1975 harr 1989 li 1992 hong 1998 and tsai and franceschini 2005 have been used in uncertainty analysis franceschini et al 2012a 2012b suggested a state of the art method called the perturbance moment method pmm which provides a three point estimate based on taylor expansion the pmm was adopted in this study the most important characteristic of the pmm is that it can ignore the correlation between random variables this characteristic distinguishes the pmm from other pems the pmm uses steiner s theorem a so called parallel axis theorem to eliminate the possibility of generating negative variances when models or functions are nonlinear tsai et al 2019 2021 this paper is organized as follows in section two the study area fengshan reservoir is specified and its fundamental information is delivered in section three we introduce the methodology including two different modules in efdc the water quality module and the hydrodynamic module moreover uncertainty analysis using the perturbance moment method pmm comes after in section four the model set up calibration validation and three remediation efforts increasing the water level dilution and reaeration are performed next the probabilistic risk mapping of reservoir eutrophication is introduced in sections five and six discussion of the results limitation of this study and recommendations for future work are presented 2 study site the fengshan reservoir the fengshan reservoir is located at the southern end of fengshan in linyuan township kaohsiung city kaohsiung county southeast of xiaogang district taiwan the reservoir is located approximately 22 km from the center of kaohsiung city the construction of the reservoir was started in july 1980 to solve the water shortage problem in the kaohsiung area the construction was completed in january 1981 the water sources of the fengshan reservoir are the donggang river and gaoping river as shown in fig 1 these rivers contain large amounts of nutrients e g total phosphorus tp and ammonia nitrogen that originate from the wastewater generated during animal husbandry activities and are eventually introduced into the fengshan reservoir moreover in 2009 typhoon morakot hit taiwan and caused considerable damage after this disaster the turbidity and sediment concentration of the gaoping river increased which increased the nutrient concentration in the fengshan reservoir wu et al 2011 due to the extremely rich nutrient content of the reservoir a considerable number of algae which are called algal blooms grows in it consequently the fengshan reservoir has undergone eutrophication the purpose of the fengshan reservoir before the advent of eutrophication was to supply water for domestic use in kaohsiung after the emergence of eutrophication the reservoir has only been used to supply industrial water due to the extensive pollution of the fengshan reservoir over recent decades significant concerns exist regarding the reservoir s water quality especially its nutrient loading and eutrophication 3 methodology this study provides a comprehensive and realistic representation of the water transport and water quality variables in the fengshan reservoir by coupling deterministic modeling with uncertainty analysis as described in the following sections 3 1 efdc hydrodynamic module the efdc is composed of several modules including hydrodynamics water quality sediment transport and toxics modules the efdc has been used to conduct simulations and decision support analyses for many bodies of surface water such as rivers lakes estuaries reservoirs wetlands and coastal regions the hydrodynamic module mainly describes the movement of water flow which is the foundation of sediment transport and water quality migration the construction of governing equations commences with the development of the vertically hydrostatic boundary layer form of the turbulent equations of motion for an incompressible variable density fluid the equations are constructed under the assumption that ambient environmental flows are characterized by horizontal length scales that are multiple orders of magnitude higher than their vertical length scales in the horizontal direction the equations are expressed using a curvilinear coordinate system and in the vertical direction the equations are expressed using a sigma transformation the momentum and continuity equations are obtained from the vertically hydrostatic boundary layer form of the turbulent equations of motion and the boussinesq approximation of the variable density plus salinity and temperature are expressed as different parameters in the transport equation please refer to the appendix for more details 3 2 efdc water quality module the water quality eutrophication module is the core module of the efdc model its variable definitions and kinetic processes are derived from the ce qual icm water quality model cerco and cole 1955 as described by park et al 1995 organic forms of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus are expressed as refractory particulate labile particulate and labile dissolve the following sections explore the variables and their kinetic equations of interaction the governing mass balance equation for the water quality variables can be expressed as follows 1 t m x m y h c x m y h u c y m x h v c z m x m y w c x m y h a x m x c x y m x h a y m y c y z m x m y a z h c z m x m y h s c where m x and m y are the coordinate conversion factors whose values are equal to 1 in cartesian coordinates h is the total depth and is equal to the sum of the depth below and the free surface displacement h ζ h c denotes the water quality variable concentration a x a y and a z are the turbulent diffusion coefficients along the x y and z directions respectively the final three terms on the left side of eq 1 explain the advective transport and the first three terms on the right side explain the diffusive transport the final term in eq 1 is the source or sink term algae play an important role in the water quality process algae are grouped into three state variables in the efdc model namely cyanobacteria diatoms and green algae which are denoted by the subscripts c d and g respectively the sources and sinks for algae included in the model are growth production basal metabolism predation settling and external loads the kinetic equation of algae can be expressed as follows 2 b x t p x bm x pr x b x z ws x b x w b x v where b x denotes the algal biomass of algal group x g m 3 p x b m x and p r x are the production rate basal metabolism rate and predation rate of algal group x respectively day 1 ws x is the settling velocity of algal group x m day w b x is the external load of algal group x g day and v is the cell volume m 3 the vertical velocity along the σ coordinate is expressed as follows 3 w w z ζ t u m x ζ x v m y ζ y 1 z u m x h x v m y h y where w denotes the vertical velocity component along the σ coordinate m s and w is the physical vertical velocity m s 3 3 uncertainty analysis using perturbance moment method pmm in this study the pmm was used to determine the order of importance of each stochastic parameter the pmm is a point estimation method based on taylor series expansion and was proposed by franceschini et al 2012a 2012b the main advantages of the pmm are as follows 1 similar to other pems the pmm overcomes the shortcoming of time consumption in monte carlo simulation 2 pmm can be used to deal with a negative variance 3 the entire probability distribution of a random variable can be represented by three points with weighting coefficients and 4 the pmm can ignore correlations between random variables the three discrete points x i x o x i and corresponding weight coefficients p i p o p i of the ith random variable x i can be computed as follows 4 x γ xi 4 κ xi 3 γ xi 2 2 and x γ xi 4 κ xi 3 γ xi 2 2 5 x i μ xi x σ xi and p i 1 x x x 6 x i μ xi x σ xi and p i 1 x x x 7 x 0 μ xi and p 0 1 p i p i where x and x denote the standardized values of x i and x i respectively and μ xi σ xi γ xi and κ xi represent the mean value standard deviation skewness coefficient and kurtosis coefficient of the random variable x i respectively according to bolle 1994 the m th moment of the weighted averages of the distances d i can be defined as follows 8 e d i m p i d i m p i d i m where d i y i y and d i y i y y i denotes the discrete points of the output variable y i y is the central value of the output variable y i and e d i m is the perturbation moment of the m th order about the points y i and y i the expected value of y can be calculated as the sum of a central value y and n disturbing moments as follows 9 e y y i 1 n e d i m y i 1 n p i d i m p i d i m w h e r e m 1 f o r t h e f i r s t s t a t i s t i c a l m o m e n t to derive the variance of y e d i 2 must be redefined as the perturbation moment of the second order about the points y i and y i then the parallel axis theorem steiner s theorem is used to calculate the moment of inertia as follows 10 e d μ i 2 e d i 2 p i e i 2 where p i p i p i and e i is the distance between the weighted average of the function y evaluated at the discrete points of the variable x i and the value y the parameter e i can be expressed as follows 11 e i p i y i p i y i p 0 y y p i y i p i y i p i p i y the variance of y can be obtained by summing the central value var y and n disturbing moments e d μ i 2 as follows 12 var y var y i 1 n e d μ i 2 i 1 n e d μ i 2 4 model development and application 4 1 model setup model setup involves the generation of a grid and the development of the initial and boundary conditions 4 1 1 grid generation a curvilinear grid was developed to discretize the fengshan reservoir a water quality model was designed by assigning 680 active grids the smallest and largest grids covered areas of approximately 59 53 and 3848 91 m 2 respectively in the horizontal plane the average water depth of the fengshan reservoir is 5 33 m and the largest water depth of the reservoir is 8 04 m due to the low water depth in the reservoir no significant thermal stratification occurs moreover detailed stratification data are not available for the reservoir therefore only one vertical layer was considered for the fengshan reservoir one inflow outflow boundary and four water quality monitoring sites were allocated to the computation domain for water quality simulation fig 2 4 1 2 initial and boundary conditions in this study the initial conditions were the starting time water temperature water velocity water surface elevation and concentrations of water quality variables the starting time was january 1 2018 julian date 0 and the simulation period was from january 1 2018 to september 30 2019 as the data during this period are the most recent complete dataset available for efdc modeling according to the temperature measured in early january the initial water temperature was set as 21 75 the water velocity was initialized as 0 m s according to standard conventions in hydrodynamic modeling the initial elevation of the reservoir water surface was 44 56 m the water surface was assumed to be a plane information regarding the initial water quality was acquired through field monitoring in the reservoir in january 2018 the boundary conditions were the external driving forces applied to the eutrophication model system the lateral boundary conditions based on the data from the donggang river and gaoping river were the daily inflow and outflow rates monthly water temperature and monthly water quality constituent concentrations the lateral boundary conditions were obtained from the taiwan water corporation and the environmental protection administration for points with available data on the inflow rate and water quality concentrations the boundary conditions were set directly according to the observed data the surface boundary conditions were expressed in terms of daily meteorological conditions including the wind speed wind direction atmospheric pressure air temperature relative humidity precipitation evaporation solar radiation and cloud cover the meteorological data were acquired from the central weather bureau of taiwan in the fengshan reservoir eutrophication model the boundary conditions were configured according to the monitoring data collected during the study period 4 2 model calibration and validation model calibration was performed using data from january 1 to december 31 2018 moreover model validation was performed using data from january 1 to september 30 2019 model simulation was conducted with a time step of 3 s which was determined to be sufficiently small for guaranteeing stability and accuracy the parameters of the eutrophication model were calibrated through trial and error adjustment and grid search to reproduce the observed temporal and spatial patterns the key parameters are presented in table 2 in the hydrodynamic module the water elevation and water temperature were calibrated and validated at four monitoring stations in the reservoir figs 3 and 4a figs 3 and 4a indicate that the simulation results were in good agreement with the observed daily water elevation and monthly water temperature thus an overall balance existed among water mass related processes such as inflows outflows precipitation and evaporation the variables used for simulation in the water quality module included tp ammonia nitrogen nh 4 dissolved oxygen do and chlorophyll a chl a concentrations comparisons of the observed and simulated values are illustrated in fig 4b e the simulated results agreed well with the observed values which indicated that the established water quality model can accurately simulate the eutrophication process 4 3 remediation efforts after the eutrophication model of the fengshan reservoir was calibrated and validated the model was used to determine the eutrophication response to removing nutrient loadings or improving hydraulic conditions the primary purpose of developing the eutrophication model of the fengshan reservoir was to provide a series of potential management scenarios for reducing the nutrient content improving the water quality and finally mitigating eutrophication the three scenarios for controlling water quality are a increasing inflow by 7 5 to increase the water level b replacing the water from the sources with water from the linbian river and sizhong river and c increasing the do content to prevent the reduction of the bottom water layer and thereby reduce the production of ammonia nitrogen and dissolved phosphorus plus the three scenarios are discussed in more detail in 4 3 1 4 3 2 4 3 3 respectively the levels of nutrients and chl a in the eutrophication model of the fengshan reservoir were considered as the baseline conditions 4 3 1 increasing the water level in the case of shallow water bodies such as the fengshan reservoir sediment is disturbed by the wind and waves and nutrients are released the water surface can be raised to increase the height of the water layer to avoid such a phenomenon in addition to inhibiting the release of nutrients the growth of algae is suppressed due to the light limitation caused by the increased water depth in this study we considered an increase of 7 5 in the inflow to increase the water level and maximize the total capacity of the fengshan reservoir to its allowable limit in general no noticeable improvement was observed in the water quality when increasing the inflow rate because the water pollution load of the fengshan reservoir mainly originates from external sources the internal load cannot be reduced by increasing the water level nevertheless an increase in the water elevation which results in less light penetration into the water body increases the difficulty of photosynthesis thus the algae can be reduced the chl a concentration can be reduced by an average of 35 775 when increasing the flow rate fig 5a 4 3 2 dilution because up to 90 of the pollution sources of the fengshan reservoir originate from external sources the most direct method of water quality improvement is to perform dilution by replacing the water source introducing a water source that does not contain nutrients or micronutrients can reduce the pollution load of the entire water body in this study the linbian river and sizhong river to the south of the donggang river were considered for substituting the original water sources remarkable water quality improvement results were obtained when using alternative water sources mainly because the replacement of the original inferior water sources led to a significant reduction in the external pollution load the chl a concentration could be reduced by 35 675 and 73 6 when replacing the original water sources with the linbian river and sizhong river respectively fig 5b 4 3 3 reaeration the primary function of reaeration is to force water bodies to mix and increase the contact between the water layer and the atmosphere reservoir reareation can be achieved by hypolimnetic aeration and oxygenation or other engineering technology when the bottom of the reservoir is in an anaerobic state the amount of phosphorus released increases significantly thus increasing the do content can decrease the production of ammonia nitrogen and dissolved phosphorus in this study do was added to the water in the reservoir and the inflow water to achieve reaeration the water quality can be improved more effectively when increasing the do content in the inflow water than when increasing the do content in the reservoir because the pollution load of the fengshan reservoir mainly originates from external sources the chl a concentration can be reduced by 28 375 and 36 8 when reaerating the internal and external loads respectively fig 5c 4 3 4 scenario analysis comparison the primary purpose of this study was to reduce the algal biomass in the fengshan reservoir to mitigate its eutrophication accordingly we used the carlson trophic state index ctsi to determine the improvement efficiency for each considered scenario we concluded that the most efficient water quality improvement strategy is dilution followed by water level increase and reaeration table 3 4 4 uncertainty analysis after the calibration and validation of the efdc hydrodynamic and water quality modules the chl a concentration was simulated through uncertainty analysis in this study the pmm was adopted for uncertainty analysis 4 4 1 uncertain variables in the efdc model the five parameters selected after sensitivity analysis namely the background horizontal eddy viscosity aho background light extinction coefficient bl maximum growth rate for greens mg basal metabolism rate for greens bm and predation rate on greens pr were applied in the efdc model combined with the pmm to assess the eutrophication situation the assessment was conducted on the basis of one approximation that the correlations among the five random variables can be ignored a triangular distribution was selected for characterizing the parameter variability in uncertainty analysis the statistical characteristics of the five random variables and their representative points obtained using the pmm are presented in the supplementary information 4 4 2 influence of the random variables on the variability of outputs in this study the five selected parameters were assumed to be independent of each other and were treated as random variables unlike most of the data driven models lin etal 2021 efdc is a physically based model for hydrodynamics and water quality as such the nonlinear and complicated relationship between these variables has been mostly depicted in the governing equations according to the pmm we used 11 representative points to evaluate the expected value and standard deviation the variability of the chl a concentration was influenced by the random variables the contribution of each random variable to the variability of the chl a concentration was calculated as follows 13 δ var k var y run k var y run all 100 where var y run all is the variability when considering all the random variables and var y run k is as defined in table 4 each successive run contained one additional random variable the results of each run were compared to evaluate the degree of influence of the selected random variables the cumulative effects which are denoted by run 5 were also calculated the results indicated that the maximum growth rate for greens had the largest contribution to the overall variability of the chl a concentration fig 6 and table 5 to determine the order of significance among other stochastic random variables we develop a sequence of simulations by adding a single random variable one at a time as shown in table 6a and b with an increase in variance in each simulation it is easy to identify the major contributing random variable plus we simulate all the random variables in reverse order table 6c and d to observe whether the order of influence of each random variable changes the results shown in table 6 indicate that the ranking of the significant order is barely the same between the first and the second changing sequence of contribution to the variability of the output therefore it can be claimed that the hydrodynamic and contaminant transport processes are highly nonlinear and that different sources of uncertainty may produce either additive or compensative effects on the overall uncertainty tsai and li 2014 4 4 3 risk analysis if a standard chl a concentration is defined the risk of eutrophication is the probability of exceeding the predetermined standard risk as be defined as follows risk p c output c standard where c output is the output chl a concentration obtained using the pmm and c standard denotes the standard chl a concentration the following two assumptions were made in this study 1 the output chl a and tp concentrations follow a lognormal distribution and 2 the standard concentrations of chl a and tp are 50 µg l and 40 µg l respectively based on the established water quality standard we combined the multivariable index of ctsi with a single index of total phosphorous and transparency to compute the probability of chlorophyll a concentration exceeding the above water quality standard which is defined as risk the above standard can then be back calculated from the carlson trophic state index ctsi established for the fengshan reservoir in this study we calculated the risk of the chl a and tp concentrations changing with season we concluded that the eutrophication risk of the chl a concentration was the highest in the spring and the average risk was 74 664 the eutrophication risk of the tp concentration was very severe all the time and the average risk was 98 832 4 4 4 probabilistic eutrophication risk mapping deterministic eutrophication mapping was conducted to simulate the area covered by algae during eutrophication fig 7a illustrates the output chl a concentrations obtained through deterministic modeling for the four seasons the chl a concentrations in the south and north of the fengshan reservoir were larger than those in other parts of the reservoir thus the eutrophication situation is more severe in the south and north of the reservoir than in its other parts the chl a concentration was higher in the spring and winter than in the other seasons the average chl a concentrations in the spring and winter were 61 32 and 49 86 μ g l respectively the output chl a concentration obtained through deterministic modeling first exhibited a decreasing trend and then exhibited an increasing trend the highest and lowest chl a concentrations occurred in the spring and summer respectively the concentration gradually increased in the autumn and winter the next step was to further consider the uncertainty i e parameter uncertainty and operational uncertainty when modeling the output chl a concentration and to develop probabilistic eutrophication mapping the results of probabilistic eutrophication mapping are displayed in fig 7b as displayed in fig 7b the output chl a concentration obtained through stochastic modeling first exhibited a decreasing trend and then exhibited an increasing trend the highest and lowest chl a concentrations occurred in the spring and summer respectively the concentration gradually increased in the autumn and winter however when uncertainty was considered the average output chl a concentrations in the spring and winter reached 98 79 and 67 12 μ g l respectively in addition significant differences were noted between the cases with positive and negative standard deviations thus performing uncertainty analysis is essential the eutrophication potential can also be depicted using contours of the exceedance probability these contours indicate the exceedance probability of a certain chl a concentration the advantage of such contours is that they can be used to quickly determine the exceedance probability of a specific chl a concentration when compared to the established water quality threshold for instance if we consider the uncertainty of the model parameters fig 8a monitoring station 1 has a eutrophication probability of approximately 65 under the expected situation in the winter whereas the eutrophication probabilities of some parts of stations 2 4 are up to 90 95 moreover under the expected situations in the other seasons the probabilities of eutrophication of the entire reservoir are significantly higher ideal operation might not be achieved each time in the implementation of various contaminant remediation efforts thus deviations are caused during remediation procedure implementation consequently we must consider the operational uncertainty for example because achieving a full water level in every process is impossible we adjusted the operation water level between 90 and 100 of the target water level increase in the scenario analysis for increasing the water level as displayed in fig 8b except in summer the areas with the highest risk of eutrophication were in the north and south of the fengshan reservoir the probabilities of eutrophication in the north and south were more than 50 because replacing water sources can significantly improve the water quality identifying the areas of eutrophication risk is difficult when chl a is used as the concentration standard therefore we also used the ctsi single variable chl a concentration standard which is equal to 7 2 μ g l fig 8c to identify areas with high eutrophication risk as depicted in fig 8c the exceedance probability for the chl a concentration being 7 2 μ g l was relatively high especially in the north and south of the reservoir moreover the exceedance probabilities of stations 3 and 4 were always higher than 90 by contrast the exceedance probabilities for the chl a concentration being 50 μ g l were less significant fig 8d the highest exceedance probability under the condition was only 16 05 in the winter last with the exceeding probability contour the government can mark the location exposed under risk precisely with three types of remediation scenarios including raising the water level dilution and reaeration not only the release of nutrients is inhibited but also the growth of algae is suppressed 5 conclusions the primary purpose of this study was to develop a eutrophication model for the fengshan reservoir by using the efdc to investigate a series of potential management scenarios for reducing the nutrient content improving the water quality and mitigating eutrophication another purpose of this study was to couple a state of the art uncertainty analysis method called the pmm with the efdc hydrodynamic and water quality modules for analyzing the uncertainty of the chl a concentration the specific contributions of this study as opposed to several existing literature on reservoir water quality modeling and remediation e g chang and chuang 2001 cheng et al 2016 dai et al 2016 are two folds this study incorporates the pmm into a physically based hydrodynamic and water quality model to simulate reservoir eutrophication in a probabilistic manner moreover reservoir eutrophication potential mapping is developed under three remediation scenarios which allows a more comprehensive probabilistic evaluation of the pollution prone regions in the reservoir eutrophication is a common natural disaster that occurs in countries that have undergone rapid agricultural and industrial development it has many effects on the public environment and public health such as affecting the color and odor of a water body destroying the ecological environment around a water body and increasing the concentration of trihalomethane in drinking water this study developed a eutrophication model for the fengshan reservoir in kaohsiung city the model reasonably reproduced the observed water level water temperature and water quality variables and thus provided a fairly good numerical representation of the hydrodynamics and eutrophication kinetics in the reservoir three reservoir remediation efforts namely increasing the water level dilution and reaeration were considered for controlling the water quality in the fengshan reservoir the scenario analysis results indicated that the most efficient water quality improvement was yielded in the dilution scenario followed by increasing the water level and reaeration in this study five random variables namely aho bl mg bm and pr were used to conduct uncertainty analysis the correlations between each pair of random variables were negligible the results indicated that the chl a concentrations obtained with the pmm were always higher than those obtained through deterministic modeling furthermore when the chl a concentration was higher the variability of the output concentration was more significant this study determined the order of importance of each random variable mg had the largest contribution to the overall variability of the output chl a concentration however variations in the sequence of addition of the random variables changed the order of influence of each component thus different sources of uncertainty may produce additive or compensative effects on the overall uncertainty plus this study evaluated the risk of the output concentration exceeding a certain established threshold and developed probabilistic eutrophication mapping the results indicated that the eutrophication risk for the chl a concentration was the highest during spring and the average eutrophication risk for chl a was 74 664 the eutrophication risk for the tp concentration was very severe all the time and the average eutrophication risk for the tp was 98 832 the significant differences between the probabilistic eutrophication mapping results for positive and negative standard deviations revealed that uncertainty analysis is critical the advantage of probabilistic eutrophication mapping is that one can quickly and clearly identify areas with potential eutrophication risk under a specific chl a concentration we also consider the operational uncertainty in the various contaminant remediation efforts and we can conclude that the areas with the highest risk of eutrophication were in the north and south of the fengshan reservoir in summary probabilistic eutrophication potential mapping can facilitate decision making in eutrophication risk assessment 6 limitations of study and recommendation for future work the proposed probabilistic eutrophication model has a limited applicability to deep water reservoirs with strong stratification the simulation of eutrophication of the fengshan reservoir can be further improved with more comprehensive salinity silica and meteorological data moreover the optimization algorithms such as the genetic algorithm ga and particle swarm optimization pso can be used to facilitate model calibration thecorrelations among the adopted five critical model parameters in the perturbance moment method pmm should be further considered and quantified if available finally from the scenario analysis of increasing water level it can be found that owing to the increase of the water elevation which results in less light penetration into the water body and then suppresses the growth of algae other direct sunlight reduction methods can be further explored to achieve the purpose of inhibiting algae growth credit

7801,study region guangdong province in china study focus water shortages due to the spatially uneven distribution of water resources have become the main obstacle to the sustainable development of regional society and the economy to alleviate this problem this study developed a framework including prediction optimization and decision making models to allocate available water resources among the different sectors of the cities in the region the framework was advantageous in efficiently predicting future water demand and supply for multiple cities quantitatively reflecting the level of the spatial equilibrium of water allocation sewa through coupling coordination degree ccd and achieving a higher level of sewa rather than just the equitable water distribution new hydrological insights for the region the results indicated that i by 2030 the deficit of water supply and demand of guangdong province would be further aggravated with a water shortage rate of 4 18 ii by optimal water allocation the water shortage rate of guangdong province decreased to 1 56 and the level of sewa improved significantly from moderate equilibrium to good equilibrium and iii from 2018 to 2030 key water saving sectors in different cities were identified while the industrial sector had a higher water saving intensity than other water use sectors this study could provide references for integrated water allocation strategies to realize the coordinated development of socioeconomic and environmental systems in other regions of the world graphical abstract ga1 keywords spatial equilibrium regional water allocation system dynamics multi objective optimization water saving data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water shortages due to the spatially uneven distribution of water resources have become a key global issue threatening the water security and restricting the sustainable development of society and the economy sun et al 2016 guo et al 2020 ma et al 2020b hou et al 2021 meanwhile this problem has also severely affected the coordinated development of regional socioeconomic and environmental systems cosgrove and loucks 2015 sun et al 2016 to achieve water security and sustainable development it is vital to implement the spatial equilibrium based allocation of water resources in regions fu et al 2017 ma et al 2020b furthermore with dramatic population and economic growth water demand will continue to increase under a limited water supply water shortages caused by the uneven distribution of water resources will further exacerbate water conflicts and make water problems more complicated naghdi et al 2021 as a result a rational and effective water allocation strategy considering spatial equilibrium and facing the future is necessary to help regional water resource managers mitigate these problems water resource allocation can balance supply and demand between different water use sectors among cities cai 2008 read et al 2014 hu et al 2016a previous studies tabari and soltani 2013 davijani et al 2016 yu and lu 2018 he et al 2020 have made great efforts to allocate regional water resources for maximum socioeconomic benefits with minimum environmental impacts flinn and guise 1970 proposed the concept of spatial equilibrium and applied it in water resource allocation to achieve rational allocation and water price marin and smith 1988 presented an approach for selecting water resource policies and investments based on the principle of spatial equilibrium after 2000 many studies wang et al 2002 murray et al 2012 li et al 2019a zuo et al 2019 yang et al 2021 bian et al 2022 utilizing the theory and assessment approach of spatial equilibrium of water allocation sewa were conducted in china and other countries the level of sewa refers to the degree of coordinated development of the socioeconomic and environmental systems carried by water resources at the regional or basin scale wang and liu 2016 ma et al 2021 sewa is a relative equilibrium that not only reflects the water use efficiency but also affects the level of socioeconomic development zheng et al 2020 hu et al 2016a and feng 2021 highlighted the importance of the equity or equality of water allocation between different subareas or water use sectors however sewa is not simply to achieve an equitable water distribution but to achieve a high degree of coordination of the socioeconomic and environmental systems carried by water resources few studies have considered the principle of sewa in regional water resource allocation although the gini coefficient is an effective approach to quantifying the equality of water resource allocation dai et al 2018 it is insufficient in reflecting the coordinated development of socioeconomic and environmental systems some studies have shown that the coupling coordination degree ccd can clearly describe the level of coordinated development between systems through their interaction mechanisms cui et al 2019 fan et al 2019 further it has a significant advantage in reflecting the level of sewa zheng et al 2020 therefore it is critical to conduct such a study considering the concept of sewa in the optimal allocation of regional water resources using the ccd model the prediction of the volume of water availability and water demand forms the basis for water resource allocation wei et al 2020 the most frequently used water supply and demand prediction methods include system dynamics sd forrester 1987 honti et al 2019 time series prediction firat et al 2009 and artificial neural networks raman and sunilkumar 1995 al zahrani and abo monasar 2015 the sd model constructed through detailed parameter estimation and numerical equations can effectively reduce uncertainty and improve accuracy and has become the most widely used in water resource management modeling neuwirth 2017 naghdi et al 2021 compared to other methods the most prominent advantage of the sd model is that it can explicitly explain multi feedback problems and effectively capture long term evolution characteristics and connections between the coupling system e g water resources socioeconomic and environmental coupling system however vensim a widely used sd model construction software is required to type the subscripts manually neuwirth 2017 it is complex and burdensome to construct sd models to estimate the future water supply and demand for multiple cities simultaneously therefore it is necessary to develop an efficient tool that can modify inputs and analyze outputs of the sd model based on computer programming and database techniques water resource allocation is a complicated problem involving optimization and decision making with multi objectives multi subjects and nonlinear correlations lu et al 2017 yu and lu 2018 many mathematical methods or theories can be applied to optimal water resource allocation including mathematical programming methods applied mathematics theories fuzzy mathematics theories and intelligent bionic evolutionary algorithms yu and lu 2018 among these methods or theories non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii is one of the most widely used and most efficient multi objective evolutionary algorithms which performs well in optimizing water resource allocation and can properly search for optimal water allocation solutions as proven by many previous studies deb et al 2002 chang et al 2016 li et al 2017 naghdi et al 2021 although the optimization model could provide many possible options available for decision makers it is difficult to select a final solution usually because of the trade offs among different objectives kiker et al 2005 thus decision making is an essential step toward a final solution among the techniques of multi criteria decision making mcdm the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution topsis tzeng and huang 2011 is a well known method for selecting the best alternative from pareto optimal solutions for water allocation problems ghazali et al 2018 li et al 2019b lin et al 2020 the entropy method is adopted to calculate index weights which can determine weights objectively kharanagh et al 2020 the entropy based topsis method is powerful for achieving the best compromise solutions in optimal water resource allocation mooselu et al 2020 this study focused on mitigating future water shortages caused by the spatially uneven distribution of regional water resources by a spatial equilibrium based optimal water allocation a framework including prediction optimization and decision making models was developed to allocate regional water resources considering the principle of sewa the rationality and efficiency of the framework were demonstrated in a case study of guangdong province with 21 cities in china the novel contributions of the study are as follows first we developed an efficient method to predict future water demand and supply for multiple cities in the region second we proposed a spatial equilibrium based optimization model of water allocation to improve the coordination degree between socioeconomic and environmental systems carried by water resources third this work would help the planners and decision makers establish an integrated water allocation strategy from the perspective of spatial equilibrium to better promote the coordinated development of regional socioeconomic and environmental systems and to fully cope with the future water shortages in the region 2 material and methods a spatial equilibrium based multi objective optimization framework was developed for water resource allocation and guangdong province was taken as a case study as shown in fig 1 with emphasis on the 1 estimation of the future water supply and demand for multiple cities using sd models established by an efficient approach i e a python script tool 2 spatial equilibrium based water resource allocation among the different sectors between cities using the multi objective optimization algorithm nsga ii and 3 the best compromise solution selected by the entropy based topsis method each of these parts is depicted below 2 1 study area and data collection 2 1 1 study area guangdong is a coastal province located in southern china covering an area of 17 96 104 km2 it is located at a latitude of 20 09 25 31 north and a longitude of 109 45 117 20 east it has a typical humid subtropical climate with annual average precipitation and temperature of 1300 2500 mm and 19 24 c respectively shen et al 2019 guangdong province has 21 cities as shown in fig 2 this province can be divided into four administrative regions the pearl river delta eastern guangdong northern guangdong and western guangdong guangdong is one of the provinces with the largest economy and population in china in 2018 the population was approximately 115 million people and the gross domestic product gdp was approximately 10 10 trillion yuan i e approximately 1 5 trillion us dollars the population and gdp of guangdong accounted for 8 13 and 10 80 of china respectively the total and per capita water resources in guangdong were 1895 1 108 m3 and 1670 28 m3 respectively the total amount of water resources in guangdong is relatively large but the amount of water resources per capita is small and lower than the national average furthermore the spatial distribution of water resources in guangdong is uneven and the rapid population growth and economic expansion have resulted in water demand increasing continuously he et al 2020 according to guangdong water resources bulletin 2017 approximately 42 44 108 t of industrial wastewater and 47 28 108 t of untreated domestic sewage are discharged into water environment annually the discharge of a large amount of wastewater and sewage has aggravated the deterioration of the water environment inadequate water quality exacerbates water scarcity in guangdong ma et al 2020a the water shortages caused by the uneven distribution of water resources and the deterioration of the water environment in guangdong have restricted the coordination and sustainability of socioeconomic and environmental systems to a certain extent 2 1 2 data collection the data involving water resources socioeconomic and environmental parameters of 21 cities in guangdong province from 2011 to 2018 were collected from statistical yearbooks and government departments cui et al 2019 the water supply and demand data of 21 cities were taken from the guangdong water resources bulletin 2011 2018 socioeconomic data were taken from the guangdong statistics yearbook 2011 2018 environmental data including wastewater and cod emissions were provided by the department of ecology and environment of guangdong province 2011 2018 details of the data used and their sources are presented in the supplementary material table s1 these collected data were organized and preserved in the sqlite database the historical data from 2011 to 2018 were used to establish and validate the sd models of the water system for 21 cities the water resources socioeconomic and environmental data in 2030 were predicted by sd models and were used as the input of the optimization model 2 2 prediction of water supply and demand for multiple cities to describe the water cycle system a general sd model was originally established by the software vensim then an efficient approach i e a python script tool was developed to establish the sd model for each city in the region the significance of model construction was to 1 clarify the water cycle structure as well as the internal relationship between water resources and the social economy and environment and 2 predict future water supply and demand for 21 cities in guangdong province and support the optimization of water resource allocation the system boundary was the administrative region of each city the simulation period was set from 2011 to 2030 and the time step was set to one year the historical data from 2011 to 2018 were used to validate the model based on validated sd models the water system of each city during 2019 2030 was simulated and 2030 was selected as the target year 2 2 1 general sd model established by vensim in the water system as shown in fig 3 water demand comprises four sectors the domestic industrial agricultural and ecological sectors and the water supply comes from surface water groundwater transfer water and wastewater reuse surface water is the main water supply source with the rapid socioeconomic development of guangdong province transfer water and wastewater reuse have become the available sources of water supply the general sd model constructed by vensim had a total of 69 variables included 10 state variables 10 rate variables 12 constants 12 table functions and 25 auxiliary variables the other complementary information about the water system is presented in supplementary material text s1 a detailed introduction of the sd model can be found in these studies abadi et al 2015 wei et al 2020 the representative formula operations between variables taking guangzhou city as an example are provided in supplementary material text s2 2 2 2 construction and validation of sd models for multiple cities the general sd model established by vensim was translated into python code using the pysd module houghton and siegel 2015 this module is free and open source https github com jamesphoughton pysd the time series data including the water supply water demand social economy and environment of 21 cities were organized and saved in the sqlite database a python script tool based on the pysd module was developed to connect the sd model and sqlite database and to modify the values of variables and the relational equations between variables for the cities in the region based on python s powerful data analysis and visualization capabilities the functional relationships among the variables could be efficiently determined and conveniently modified to ensure the accuracy and stability of the established sd model the relative error values between the simulated and observed data at each time step were calculated for each city the equation is shown below 1 r r s t m t m t 100 where s t and are the simulated and measured values at time t respectively an error value of less than 10 demonstrates that the performance of the established model is satisfactory and that the model is capable of reflecting the real water system li et al 2019c yang et al 2019 2 3 multi objective optimization based on sewa the optimization model was used to allocate multiple available water sources to multiple sectors in multiple cities with multiple objectives the optimization objectives including the maximum social benefit the maximum economic benefit and the minimum environmental impact were considered to maintain the development state of each system furthermore the level of sewa was considered to achieve the coordinated development between the socioeconomic and environmental systems in the region the main constraints include water supply water demand barely equilibrium and non negative constraints fig 1 shows the structure of the optimization model and the details are explained in the following sections 2 3 1 objectives 1 objective 1 maximizing the social benefit of water resource allocation by minimizing the squares of the water shortage rate 2 min f 1 s j 1 j k 1 k 1 i 1 i s i j k d j k 2 where f 1 is the sum of squares of the water shortage rates of sectors i is the index of the available water source and i 1 4 represent the surface water groundwater transfer water and wastewater reuse respectively j is the index of the city and j 1 21 denote the 21 cities in guangdong province respectively k is the index of the water sector and k 1 4 signify the industrial agricultural domestic and ecological water demand sectors respectively d jk is the water demand of city j in sector k 108 m3 and s ijk is the water supply of water source i giving sector k in city j 108 m3 2 objective 2 maximizing the economic benefit of water resource allocation 3 max f 2 s k k j j i i b j k s i j k where f 2 is the total economic benefit of water resource allocation in the province and b jk is the water supply benefit coefficient of water demand sector k in city j yuan m3 the water supply benefit coefficients b jk in the industrial and agricultural sectors are the ratio of the economic production value to water consumption in the corresponding sector respectively the water supply benefit coefficients in the domestic and ecological sectors are calculated based on previous studies dai et al 2018 jing et al 2018 the benefit coefficient in the domestic sector is set as the maximum value of them in the industrial and agricultural sectors the benefit coefficient in the ecological sector is set as the average value of them in the other three sectors the economic benefit coefficients among different sectors of cities in 2018 are presented in supplementary material table s2 3 objective 3 minimizing the environmental impact of water resource allocation according to existing studies and available datasets in this study chemical oxygen demand cod is selected as the most critical water quality indicator and the amount of cod emissions is calculated to represent the environmental impact of water resource allocation fu et al 2017 li et al 2022 4 min f 3 s j j k k 0 01 d j k h j k i i s i j k where f 3 is the cod emissions of total wastewater 104 tons d jk and h jk are the sewage discharge coefficient and cod concentration mg l of water demand sector k in city j 4 objective 4 maximizing the level of sewa the level of sewa is measured by the ccd model in the ccd model the coupling degree is used to represent the degree of interaction between systems or elements while the coordination index can reflect the coordination level between systems or elements within a virtuous circle li et al 2012 three representative indicators were selected to calculate the value of sewa these indicators were water consumption per capita water consumption per 10 000 yuan of gdp and cod emissions per 10 000 yuan of gdp the first two indicators can reflect the supply demand relationship between socioeconomic systems and water resources yang et al 2019 the third indicator is used to characterize the impact of socioeconomic development on the environment gao et al 2020 the subsystems form an organic whole and these subsystems act independently and interact with each other 5 max f 4 s z c t 6 c n 1 3 x n n 1 3 x n 3 3 1 3 7 t n 1 3 α n x n where f 4 is the coupling coordination degree i e the level of sewa 0 z 1 c and t are the coupling degree and the coordinated index of the socioeconomic and environmental systems respectively and x n is the evaluation indicator n in this study the three indicators considered were negative indicators α n is the weight coefficient of the evaluation index n generally the three systems of social economy and environment are equally important so the value of α n is taken as one third han et al 2021 as table 1 shows the level of sewa is classified into five levels including serious non equilibrium moderate non equilibrium slight equilibrium moderate equilibrium and good equilibrium zheng et al 2020 han et al 2021 2 3 2 constraints 1 water supply capacity constraints 8 j j k k s i j k w i where w i is the total water supply of water source i this constraint indicates the total water supply from the water source cannot exceed the initial water availability of that water source 2 water demand constraints 9 d j k min i 1 i s i j k d j k max where d j k min and d j k max are the minimum and maximum of the total water demand of water demand sector k in city j respectively this constraint indicates the total water supply to the water demand sector should be between the minimum and maximum total water demand for that sector 3 level of sewa constraints 10 z j c j t j 0 25 where z j c j and t j are the coupling coordination degree coupling degree and coordination index in city j respectively this constraint ensures that the sewa levels of all cities are higher than the status of slight equilibrium 4 variable non negative constraints 11

naghdi et al 2021 and this technique is applied in this study 2 4 multi criteria decision making method the topsis method was employed to make the order of the pareto front solutions and the different objective weights were calculated by the entropy method the entropy based topsis technique is composed of the following steps the decision matrix is defined as x x p q s t 1 p s 1 q t in which s and t are the numbers of evaluation indicators and evaluation objects respectively 1 the data are normalized by formulas 12 and 13 and the normalized decision matrix x x p q s t is obtained 12 p o s i t i v

the optimal level 3 results 3 1 validation of sd models and prediction of water resources 3 1 1 validation of sd models according to the sd models established in section 2 2 significant variables including total population gdp and water consumption in four sectors were estimated the values of these variables in 21 cities were compared with historical data from 2011 to 2018 the relative errors between the simulated and measured values of the main variables from 2013 to 2018 in 21 cities were analyzed statistically and depicted by box plots fig 4 a taking guangzhou as an example the comparison of the annual simulated and measured values is shown in fig 4 b almost all error values were less than 10 compared with the other research using sd models feng et al 2016 li et al 2018 2019c wei et al 2020 the sd models of 21 cities could achieve the simulation effects and performed better at reflecting the real water cycle system 3 1 2 prediction of water resources the trends of the water system in 21 cities from 2019 to 2030 were simulated by the validated sd models the years 2018 and 2030 were selected as the base year and the target year respectively fig 5 and table 2 present the water allocation and water shortage in 21 cities of guangdong province in 2030 as seen from the table the population and gdp of guangdong province in 2030 would be 13 089 93 104 people and 22 27 1012 yuan respectively the total amount of water supply and demand in 2030 would be 432 40 and 439 27 108 m3 respectively the deficit of water supply and demand would be 18 35 108 m3 with a water shortage rate of 4 18 indicating that guangdong province would face serious water shortages in the future as regards water supply surface water remained the main available water source accounting for 90 of the sum of the available water sources however the surface water decreased compared to that in 2018 fig 5 b which reflected the drought trend to a certain extent liu et al 2020 with the improvement of wastewater treatment the total amount of wastewater reuse increased significantly with the average rate of wastewater reuse being 15 li et al 2019c and increasing by 13 18 108 m3 compared to that in 2018 fig 5 b the available quantity of groundwater and transfer water was almost the same as that in 2018 as regards water demand domestic and industrial water demand would increase dramatically the agricultural water demand would decrease attributed to the implementation of agricultural water saving measures cao et al 2021 especially in the cities of zhanjiang meizhou qingyuan jieyang and shaoguan fig 5 b however the agricultural sector was still the largest water consumption user in guangdong province specifically by 2030 9 cities would suffer water shortages and 5 cities of them i e guangzhou dongguan shenzhen foshan and qingyuan would experience water shortages exceeding 1 108 m3 the water deficit of guangzhou was the largest amounting to 3 91 108 m3 the cities facing water shortages were located in the pearl river delta liu et al 2018 except for qingyuan there were different reasons why these cities would face water shortages as shown in fig 5 b dongguan and shenzhen would face water shortages because of an increase in domestic and industrial water demand foshan would face water shortages because of increasing industrial water demand guangzhou and qingyuan would face water shortages because of an increase in domestic water demand furthermore the other 12 cities would have more available water resources owing to a decrease in agricultural water demand fig 5 b including zhanjiang jieyang etc it was obvious that the problem of the uneven distribution of water supply and demand confronted by guangdong province would be further intensified this uneven distribution would further exacerbate water conflicts and impose serious constraints on population growth and regional economic development therefore it is necessary for water resource managers to address this problem by optimal water allocation considering the spatial equilibrium to increase regional water self sufficiency and promote the coordinated development of socioeconomic and environmental systems 3 2 optimization and decision making of water resource allocation the water resources socioeconomic and environmental data in 2030 were estimated by sd models and were used as the input of the optimization model regarding nsga ii parameters the population size and the maximum iteration number were set to 200 and 2000 respectively the rates of crossover and mutation were 0 9 and 0 05 respectively through the model calculation the pareto front of the four objectives is shown in fig 6 according to the characteristics of the pareto front solutions fig 6 a and b social benefits had a nonlinear contradiction with economic benefits and environmental impacts respectively this indicated that both economic benefits and environmental impacts had decreasing trends with increasing water shortages comparatively the relationships of the level of sewa with other objectives were relatively complicated with the increase in social benefits or water shortages the sewa level had an increasing trend the sewa level would decrease with increasing economic benefits the reason may be that the indicators of sewa considered were all negative indicators when the water shortage was larger the value of the indicators e g per capita water consumption would decrease making the ccd obtain a larger value additionally there was a trade off in the relationship between environmental impacts and the sewa levels denoting that the higher the level of sewa the fewer pollutants were discharged the complicated relationship could provide greater insight into the water system by considering sewa in the optimization model of water resource allocation obviously it was difficult to find an optimal solution furthermore the top five best compromise solutions were achieved by the entropy based topsis method table 3 and fig 6 b the results showed that the values of the four objectives between the top five best compromise solutions were relatively close especially the solutions of ranks 1 2 and 4 it was obvious that the best compromise solutions had a consistent sewa state i e good equilibrium fig 6 b by comparing the solutions of the rank 1 2 and 4 considering the less water shortage and greater economic benefits the ranking second solution was selected as the best solution of which the social benefit was 0 021 the economic benefit was 18 90 1012 yuan the cod emissions were 76 99 104 tons and the level of sewa was 0 509 3 3 solution of water resource allocation and comparisons of sewa levels fig 7 shows the best solution for water allocation between 21 cities of guangdong province in 2030 using the optimization model the water resources of guangdong province were reallocated it was clear that all 21 cities had different degrees of water shortages including cities that did not have water shortage problems before optimization the reason was that the gap in total water supply and demand in guangdong province still existed however the water deficit of guangdong province decreased from 18 35 to 7 6 108 m3 and the water shortage rate decreased to 1 56 the severe water shortages of the cities located in the pearl river delta were alleviated the water deficit of guangzhou decreased from 3 91 to 1 71 108 m3 the water deficit of other cities was lower than 1 108 m3 through the optimization process the final water allocation solution in guangdong fig 7 b showed that water resources were allocated from the cities located in the regions of eastern guangdong northern guangdong and western guangdong to the cities located in the pearl river delta with this knowledge about the solution to water allocation water resource managers should enhance the unified allocation of water resources in the region and each city should strengthen the intensive use of water resources by adopting water saving practices to ensure sustainable socioeconomic development song et al 2018 fig 8 shows the sewa levels in 21 cities of guangdong province in 2018 in 2030 before optimization and in 2030 after optimization the sewa levels of the province and its cities in 2030 before optimization declined compared to those in 2018 except for shenzhen and there were no cities with a status of non equilibrium fig 8a obviously the level of sewa in shenzhen was much higher than that of other cities through the optimization process the overall sewa level of guangdong province increased from 0 475 to 0 509 by 0 034 it was obvious that a qualitative change in the provincial level of sewa had occurred and the sewa level improved from moderate equilibrium to good equilibrium by optimization allocation specifically the sewa levels of heyuan and jiangmen improved from slight equilibrium to moderate equilibrium zhuhai and foshan increased from moderate equilibrium to good equilibrium the sewa levels of 21 cities in 2030 were close to or better than those in 2018 fig 8b and d these results indicated that the levels of sewa in the province and some cities were significantly improved by the optimization model finally there were 4 11 and 6 cities with slight moderate and good equilibrium respectively according to the spatial distribution of the sewa levels of 21 cities fig 8d the cities with higher levels of sewa were mainly located in the pearl river delta while the cities with lower sewa levels were mainly located in northern guangdong 4 discussion 4 1 efficiency of the proposed framework this study proposed a framework for the optimal allocation of regional water resources considering the principle of sewa the concept of sewa has become a key idea for water resource allocation in a region that faces water shortage problems song et al 2016 the lower the level of sewa the more likely the development of socioeconomic and environmental systems carried by water resources is uncoordinated and this uncoordinated development in turn can result in the inefficient use of water resources and affect the sewa level yue et al 2021 guangdong province has a tropical and subtropical monsoon climate with abundant precipitation but the spatial distribution of water resources is uneven meanwhile guangdong province is china s most economically developed province and has a large population with extremely high water demands the results showed that the water shortage problem caused by the uneven distribution of water supply and demand confronted by guangdong province would intensify in the future which was consistent with the research findings by he et al 2020 therefore to promote the coordinated development of the social economy and environment of guangdong province it is necessary to implement water optimization allocation based on the proposed framework the results demonstrated that the efficiency of water resource prediction was enhanced the water shortage was alleviated and the level of sewa was significantly improved by optimization allocation compared with seeking the maximum socioeconomic benefits and the minimum environmental impacts the proposed framework could obtain a compromise solution through the decision making method read et al 2014 underlined the importance of stability of allocation solution and suggested that selecting an inferior stable solution would be better than an unstable optimal solution the selection of compromise solutions and the consideration of the principle of sewa in this study could increase the stability of water allocation solutions somewhat hajkowicz and collins 2007 the cities in the pearl river delta facing a serious water shortage were at higher levels of sewa figs 7 and 8 the main reason for this phenomenon was that the sewa level was commonly affected by water shortages and water use efficiency a serious water shortage would reduce the sewa level while a high water use efficiency could improve the sewa level the positive effects of high water use efficiency were greater than the negative effects due to water shortages in the cities located in the pearl river delta which resulted in these cities being at higher sewa levels furthermore increasing the amount of water supply by water resource allocation was only one aspect of facilitating the spatial equilibrium of water resources it was also critical to improve water use efficiency through technological innovation and socioeconomic development to alleviate water resource pressure and improve the ecological environment therefore the principle of sewa was a critical driving force to reshape water resource management promote high quality socioeconomic development and restore the ecological environment in the region wang and liu 2016 ma et al 2021 the essence of spatial equilibrium based optimal water resource allocation was to realize the coordinated development of the socioeconomic and environmental systems carried by water resources 4 2 variations in water use indicators in the future after optimal allocation it is necessary to answer the question about how to use water in the different water use sectors in different cities the following four indicators were proposed the domestic water consumption per capita water consumption per 10 000 yuan of industrial value added water consumption per unit of arable land and cod emissions per 10 000 yuan of gdp these four indicators of guangdong province and its cities were compared in 2018 in 2030 before optimization and in 2030 after optimization as shown in fig 9 in terms of domestic water fig 9a the average domestic water consumption per capita of guangdong province was 169 83 l d in 2018 which would decrease to 151 94 l d by 2030 due to the population growth coupled with water shortages through the optimization process the average value of domestic water consumption per capita in guangdong province was increased by 5 63 l d indicating that the pressure of domestic water use had certainly been relieved importantly these indicator values of 6 cities facing water shortages including guangzhou dongguan shenzhen foshan and qingyuan increased by 5 94 27 19 l d compared to that before optimization for example domestic water consumption per capita in shenzhen in 2030 140 43 l d was slightly lower than an optimistic estimate 156 16 l d by li et al 2019c by 2030 zhuhai and foshan would be the two cities with the largest domestic water saving pressure the domestic water consumption per capita of these two cities decreased by 70 52 and 41 68 l d respectively the domestic water use of other cities decreased by 2 53 20 28 l d these results could contribute to the formulation of domestic water saving strategies for different cities water consumption per 10 000 yuan of industrial value added of guangdong province showed similar characteristics to per capita water consumption fig 9b the indicator average value of guangdong province would decrease from 25 89 to 14 51 m3 from 2018 to 2030 and by the optimization process the indicator value would decrease to 15 28 m3 with a reduced rate of 41 00 based on the related regulations issued in china water consumption per 10 000 yuan of industrial value added must be less than 40 m3 by 2030 gosc 2012 it was obvious that the indicator of water use in the industrial sector of each city in guangdong province would be below the target value by 2030 however there were 16 cities with a reduction rate exceeding 30 and it was a severe challenge for them to achieve the water use target especially for shaoguan heyuan and meizhou cities these results indicated that the cities in guangdong province are required to improve industrial water use efficiency and formulate relevant industrial water saving measures by considering the characteristics of industrial water use of different cities to achieve sustainable water usage and management lv et al 2020 compared with related indicators of domestic and industrial water use the provincial average value of water consumption per unit of arable land decreased after optimization fig 9c this indicator value of guangdong province would be 661 96 m3 mu in 2030 a decrease of 92 04 m3 mu compared to that in 2018 however the indicator values of some cities including shenzhen dongguan zhongshan etc had increased compared to that before optimization indicating that the irrigation water saving pressure of these cities was relieved by the optimization model to some extent the indicator value of jieyang had a maximum reduction rate of 30 32 indicating that jieyang was the city with the greatest water saving potential for agricultural irrigation by the proposed framework the quota of agricultural irrigation water use of each city in guangdong province would be clarified by 2030 which could provide a good reference for the technological development and the policy support of agricultural irrigation zhang et al 2019 the top key water saving cities in the domestic industrial and agricultural sectors were located in the pearl river delta northern guangdong and eastern guangdong respectively by comparing the reduction rates of four water use indicators of different sectors it was found that the industrial sector had greater water savings than that of other sectors and similar findings were obtained by bian et al 2022 to reduce the excessive water saving burden that poorly matched the city s capacity it was necessary to consider increasing the water supply by rainwater utilization transfer project construction and seawater desalination lv et al 2020 karandish et al 2021 to reflect the impact of socioeconomic development on the environment the cod emissions per 10 000 yuan of gdp were compared under different conditions fig 9d the cod emissions were associated with the quantity of domestic and industrial water use it was obvious that the reduced rates of cod emissions for almost all cities exceeded 50 in addition to qingyuan it should also be noted that the provincial average value of the cod emissions per 10 000 yuan of gdp showed a considerable decreasing trend from 0 63 kg to 0 28 kg from 2018 to 2030 which was conducive to preventing the further deterioration of the water environment 4 3 uncertainty of the proposed framework although sd models have better robustness which can effectively reduce uncertainty and improve accuracy neuwirth 2017 naghdi et al 2021 uncertainty inevitably arises due to many input variables and parameters needed in this study most of the input variables are collected from official bulletins or statistical yearbooks and a small part is referred to the published literature the sd model parameters are estimated by linear or nonlinear relationships of related variables these can reduce the uncertainty of model inputs and parameters and improve the accuracy of the model to a certain extent yang et al 2019 the structure of the sd model is a top priority for variable simulation and prediction which is influenced by the modeler s cognition and prior knowledge in this study the sd model is constructed based on a large number of results and experiences from existing studies to reduce the uncertainty of the model structure as much as possible koul et al 2016 li et al 2019c wei et al 2020 however it is still inevitable that the simulation and prediction results of the sd model have large uncertainties in the proposed framework decision making uncertainty is also existing thus it is necessary to use related methods or techniques to quantify the uncertainty of the research framework in future studies despite these apparent limitations the framework proposed in this study still has important and profound reference value for implementing spatial equilibrium based allocation of regional water resources and achieving socioeconomic and environmental sustainability 5 conclusions a spatial equilibrium based multi objective optimization framework for regional water resource allocation was proposed in this study the main findings and conclusions based on a case study of guangdong province in china were summarized as follows i the sd models for multiple cities could be efficiently established by a python script tool which helped to achieve a feasible and efficient path for establishing sd models for multiple cities the validated sd models projected that the deficit of water supply and demand would be 18 35 108 m3 with a water shortage rate of 4 18 the imbalances in water supply and demand among 21 cities would exacerbate the problem of the uneven spatial distribution of water resources in guangdong province ii the best solution of the optimal water allocation was able to significantly improve the sewa level while alleviating the severe situation of water scarcity by optimal allocation the water shortage of guangdong province could decrease to 1 56 iii after optimal allocation domestic water consumption per capita water consumption per 10 000 yuan of industrial value added and water consumption per unit of arable land would be 157 57 l d 15 28 m3 and 661 96 m3 mu respectively by 2030 the key water saving cities for the domestic industrial and agricultural sectors were mainly located in the pearl river delta northern guangdong and eastern guangdong respectively water conservation was more intense in the industrial sector than in other sectors the impact of the water allocation solution on the environment revealed that the solution was conducive to preventing further deterioration of the water environment the socioeconomic and environmental systems carried by water resources are complex and highly uncertain many studies find it difficult to establish a deterministic model to predict the quantity of the water supply and water demand hu et al 2016b water saving use is the basis of water resource management du et al 2021 and the concept of water saving priority should be involved in water resource optimization allocation lv et al 2020 thus future studies should couple prediction and optimization models by considering the key parameters of water savings and uncertainty to achieve the spatial equilibrium of water resources in contrast to traditional water resource allocation the concept of sewa was incorporated into the multi objective optimization model the application of compromise solutions and the consideration of the sewa principle could help strengthen the stability of water resource allocation the allocation solution attained in this study could effectively promote the coordinated regional development of socioeconomic and environmental systems this study provided a valuable guide for allocating regional water resources as well as for comprehensive water resource management and allocation in other

7801,study region guangdong province in china study focus water shortages due to the spatially uneven distribution of water resources have become the main obstacle to the sustainable development of regional society and the economy to alleviate this problem this study developed a framework including prediction optimization and decision making models to allocate available water resources among the different sectors of the cities in the region the framework was advantageous in efficiently predicting future water demand and supply for multiple cities quantitatively reflecting the level of the spatial equilibrium of water allocation sewa through coupling coordination degree ccd and achieving a higher level of sewa rather than just the equitable water distribution new hydrological insights for the region the results indicated that i by 2030 the deficit of water supply and demand of guangdong province would be further aggravated with a water shortage rate of 4 18 ii by optimal water allocation the water shortage rate of guangdong province decreased to 1 56 and the level of sewa improved significantly from moderate equilibrium to good equilibrium and iii from 2018 to 2030 key water saving sectors in different cities were identified while the industrial sector had a higher water saving intensity than other water use sectors this study could provide references for integrated water allocation strategies to realize the coordinated development of socioeconomic and environmental systems in other regions of the world graphical abstract ga1 keywords spatial equilibrium regional water allocation system dynamics multi objective optimization water saving data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water shortages due to the spatially uneven distribution of water resources have become a key global issue threatening the water security and restricting the sustainable development of society and the economy sun et al 2016 guo et al 2020 ma et al 2020b hou et al 2021 meanwhile this problem has also severely affected the coordinated development of regional socioeconomic and environmental systems cosgrove and loucks 2015 sun et al 2016 to achieve water security and sustainable development it is vital to implement the spatial equilibrium based allocation of water resources in regions fu et al 2017 ma et al 2020b furthermore with dramatic population and economic growth water demand will continue to increase under a limited water supply water shortages caused by the uneven distribution of water resources will further exacerbate water conflicts and make water problems more complicated naghdi et al 2021 as a result a rational and effective water allocation strategy considering spatial equilibrium and facing the future is necessary to help regional water resource managers mitigate these problems water resource allocation can balance supply and demand between different water use sectors among cities cai 2008 read et al 2014 hu et al 2016a previous studies tabari and soltani 2013 davijani et al 2016 yu and lu 2018 he et al 2020 have made great efforts to allocate regional water resources for maximum socioeconomic benefits with minimum environmental impacts flinn and guise 1970 proposed the concept of spatial equilibrium and applied it in water resource allocation to achieve rational allocation and water price marin and smith 1988 presented an approach for selecting water resource policies and investments based on the principle of spatial equilibrium after 2000 many studies wang et al 2002 murray et al 2012 li et al 2019a zuo et al 2019 yang et al 2021 bian et al 2022 utilizing the theory and assessment approach of spatial equilibrium of water allocation sewa were conducted in china and other countries the level of sewa refers to the degree of coordinated development of the socioeconomic and environmental systems carried by water resources at the regional or basin scale wang and liu 2016 ma et al 2021 sewa is a relative equilibrium that not only reflects the water use efficiency but also affects the level of socioeconomic development zheng et al 2020 hu et al 2016a and feng 2021 highlighted the importance of the equity or equality of water allocation between different subareas or water use sectors however sewa is not simply to achieve an equitable water distribution but to achieve a high degree of coordination of the socioeconomic and environmental systems carried by water resources few studies have considered the principle of sewa in regional water resource allocation although the gini coefficient is an effective approach to quantifying the equality of water resource allocation dai et al 2018 it is insufficient in reflecting the coordinated development of socioeconomic and environmental systems some studies have shown that the coupling coordination degree ccd can clearly describe the level of coordinated development between systems through their interaction mechanisms cui et al 2019 fan et al 2019 further it has a significant advantage in reflecting the level of sewa zheng et al 2020 therefore it is critical to conduct such a study considering the concept of sewa in the optimal allocation of regional water resources using the ccd model the prediction of the volume of water availability and water demand forms the basis for water resource allocation wei et al 2020 the most frequently used water supply and demand prediction methods include system dynamics sd forrester 1987 honti et al 2019 time series prediction firat et al 2009 and artificial neural networks raman and sunilkumar 1995 al zahrani and abo monasar 2015 the sd model constructed through detailed parameter estimation and numerical equations can effectively reduce uncertainty and improve accuracy and has become the most widely used in water resource management modeling neuwirth 2017 naghdi et al 2021 compared to other methods the most prominent advantage of the sd model is that it can explicitly explain multi feedback problems and effectively capture long term evolution characteristics and connections between the coupling system e g water resources socioeconomic and environmental coupling system however vensim a widely used sd model construction software is required to type the subscripts manually neuwirth 2017 it is complex and burdensome to construct sd models to estimate the future water supply and demand for multiple cities simultaneously therefore it is necessary to develop an efficient tool that can modify inputs and analyze outputs of the sd model based on computer programming and database techniques water resource allocation is a complicated problem involving optimization and decision making with multi objectives multi subjects and nonlinear correlations lu et al 2017 yu and lu 2018 many mathematical methods or theories can be applied to optimal water resource allocation including mathematical programming methods applied mathematics theories fuzzy mathematics theories and intelligent bionic evolutionary algorithms yu and lu 2018 among these methods or theories non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii is one of the most widely used and most efficient multi objective evolutionary algorithms which performs well in optimizing water resource allocation and can properly search for optimal water allocation solutions as proven by many previous studies deb et al 2002 chang et al 2016 li et al 2017 naghdi et al 2021 although the optimization model could provide many possible options available for decision makers it is difficult to select a final solution usually because of the trade offs among different objectives kiker et al 2005 thus decision making is an essential step toward a final solution among the techniques of multi criteria decision making mcdm the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution topsis tzeng and huang 2011 is a well known method for selecting the best alternative from pareto optimal solutions for water allocation problems ghazali et al 2018 li et al 2019b lin et al 2020 the entropy method is adopted to calculate index weights which can determine weights objectively kharanagh et al 2020 the entropy based topsis method is powerful for achieving the best compromise solutions in optimal water resource allocation mooselu et al 2020 this study focused on mitigating future water shortages caused by the spatially uneven distribution of regional water resources by a spatial equilibrium based optimal water allocation a framework including prediction optimization and decision making models was developed to allocate regional water resources considering the principle of sewa the rationality and efficiency of the framework were demonstrated in a case study of guangdong province with 21 cities in china the novel contributions of the study are as follows first we developed an efficient method to predict future water demand and supply for multiple cities in the region second we proposed a spatial equilibrium based optimization model of water allocation to improve the coordination degree between socioeconomic and environmental systems carried by water resources third this work would help the planners and decision makers establish an integrated water allocation strategy from the perspective of spatial equilibrium to better promote the coordinated development of regional socioeconomic and environmental systems and to fully cope with the future water shortages in the region 2 material and methods a spatial equilibrium based multi objective optimization framework was developed for water resource allocation and guangdong province was taken as a case study as shown in fig 1 with emphasis on the 1 estimation of the future water supply and demand for multiple cities using sd models established by an efficient approach i e a python script tool 2 spatial equilibrium based water resource allocation among the different sectors between cities using the multi objective optimization algorithm nsga ii and 3 the best compromise solution selected by the entropy based topsis method each of these parts is depicted below 2 1 study area and data collection 2 1 1 study area guangdong is a coastal province located in southern china covering an area of 17 96 104 km2 it is located at a latitude of 20 09 25 31 north and a longitude of 109 45 117 20 east it has a typical humid subtropical climate with annual average precipitation and temperature of 1300 2500 mm and 19 24 c respectively shen et al 2019 guangdong province has 21 cities as shown in fig 2 this province can be divided into four administrative regions the pearl river delta eastern guangdong northern guangdong and western guangdong guangdong is one of the provinces with the largest economy and population in china in 2018 the population was approximately 115 million people and the gross domestic product gdp was approximately 10 10 trillion yuan i e approximately 1 5 trillion us dollars the population and gdp of guangdong accounted for 8 13 and 10 80 of china respectively the total and per capita water resources in guangdong were 1895 1 108 m3 and 1670 28 m3 respectively the total amount of water resources in guangdong is relatively large but the amount of water resources per capita is small and lower than the national average furthermore the spatial distribution of water resources in guangdong is uneven and the rapid population growth and economic expansion have resulted in water demand increasing continuously he et al 2020 according to guangdong water resources bulletin 2017 approximately 42 44 108 t of industrial wastewater and 47 28 108 t of untreated domestic sewage are discharged into water environment annually the discharge of a large amount of wastewater and sewage has aggravated the deterioration of the water environment inadequate water quality exacerbates water scarcity in guangdong ma et al 2020a the water shortages caused by the uneven distribution of water resources and the deterioration of the water environment in guangdong have restricted the coordination and sustainability of socioeconomic and environmental systems to a certain extent 2 1 2 data collection the data involving water resources socioeconomic and environmental parameters of 21 cities in guangdong province from 2011 to 2018 were collected from statistical yearbooks and government departments cui et al 2019 the water supply and demand data of 21 cities were taken from the guangdong water resources bulletin 2011 2018 socioeconomic data were taken from the guangdong statistics yearbook 2011 2018 environmental data including wastewater and cod emissions were provided by the department of ecology and environment of guangdong province 2011 2018 details of the data used and their sources are presented in the supplementary material table s1 these collected data were organized and preserved in the sqlite database the historical data from 2011 to 2018 were used to establish and validate the sd models of the water system for 21 cities the water resources socioeconomic and environmental data in 2030 were predicted by sd models and were used as the input of the optimization model 2 2 prediction of water supply and demand for multiple cities to describe the water cycle system a general sd model was originally established by the software vensim then an efficient approach i e a python script tool was developed to establish the sd model for each city in the region the significance of model construction was to 1 clarify the water cycle structure as well as the internal relationship between water resources and the social economy and environment and 2 predict future water supply and demand for 21 cities in guangdong province and support the optimization of water resource allocation the system boundary was the administrative region of each city the simulation period was set from 2011 to 2030 and the time step was set to one year the historical data from 2011 to 2018 were used to validate the model based on validated sd models the water system of each city during 2019 2030 was simulated and 2030 was selected as the target year 2 2 1 general sd model established by vensim in the water system as shown in fig 3 water demand comprises four sectors the domestic industrial agricultural and ecological sectors and the water supply comes from surface water groundwater transfer water and wastewater reuse surface water is the main water supply source with the rapid socioeconomic development of guangdong province transfer water and wastewater reuse have become the available sources of water supply the general sd model constructed by vensim had a total of 69 variables included 10 state variables 10 rate variables 12 constants 12 table functions and 25 auxiliary variables the other complementary information about the water system is presented in supplementary material text s1 a detailed introduction of the sd model can be found in these studies abadi et al 2015 wei et al 2020 the representative formula operations between variables taking guangzhou city as an example are provided in supplementary material text s2 2 2 2 construction and validation of sd models for multiple cities the general sd model established by vensim was translated into python code using the pysd module houghton and siegel 2015 this module is free and open source https github com jamesphoughton pysd the time series data including the water supply water demand social economy and environment of 21 cities were organized and saved in the sqlite database a python script tool based on the pysd module was developed to connect the sd model and sqlite database and to modify the values of variables and the relational equations between variables for the cities in the region based on python s powerful data analysis and visualization capabilities the functional relationships among the variables could be efficiently determined and conveniently modified to ensure the accuracy and stability of the established sd model the relative error values between the simulated and observed data at each time step were calculated for each city the equation is shown below 1 r r s t m t m t 100 where s t and are the simulated and measured values at time t respectively an error value of less than 10 demonstrates that the performance of the established model is satisfactory and that the model is capable of reflecting the real water system li et al 2019c yang et al 2019 2 3 multi objective optimization based on sewa the optimization model was used to allocate multiple available water sources to multiple sectors in multiple cities with multiple objectives the optimization objectives including the maximum social benefit the maximum economic benefit and the minimum environmental impact were considered to maintain the development state of each system furthermore the level of sewa was considered to achieve the coordinated development between the socioeconomic and environmental systems in the region the main constraints include water supply water demand barely equilibrium and non negative constraints fig 1 shows the structure of the optimization model and the details are explained in the following sections 2 3 1 objectives 1 objective 1 maximizing the social benefit of water resource allocation by minimizing the squares of the water shortage rate 2 min f 1 s j 1 j k 1 k 1 i 1 i s i j k d j k 2 where f 1 is the sum of squares of the water shortage rates of sectors i is the index of the available water source and i 1 4 represent the surface water groundwater transfer water and wastewater reuse respectively j is the index of the city and j 1 21 denote the 21 cities in guangdong province respectively k is the index of the water sector and k 1 4 signify the industrial agricultural domestic and ecological water demand sectors respectively d jk is the water demand of city j in sector k 108 m3 and s ijk is the water supply of water source i giving sector k in city j 108 m3 2 objective 2 maximizing the economic benefit of water resource allocation 3 max f 2 s k k j j i i b j k s i j k where f 2 is the total economic benefit of water resource allocation in the province and b jk is the water supply benefit coefficient of water demand sector k in city j yuan m3 the water supply benefit coefficients b jk in the industrial and agricultural sectors are the ratio of the economic production value to water consumption in the corresponding sector respectively the water supply benefit coefficients in the domestic and ecological sectors are calculated based on previous studies dai et al 2018 jing et al 2018 the benefit coefficient in the domestic sector is set as the maximum value of them in the industrial and agricultural sectors the benefit coefficient in the ecological sector is set as the average value of them in the other three sectors the economic benefit coefficients among different sectors of cities in 2018 are presented in supplementary material table s2 3 objective 3 minimizing the environmental impact of water resource allocation according to existing studies and available datasets in this study chemical oxygen demand cod is selected as the most critical water quality indicator and the amount of cod emissions is calculated to represent the environmental impact of water resource allocation fu et al 2017 li et al 2022 4 min f 3 s j j k k 0 01 d j k h j k i i s i j k where f 3 is the cod emissions of total wastewater 104 tons d jk and h jk are the sewage discharge coefficient and cod concentration mg l of water demand sector k in city j 4 objective 4 maximizing the level of sewa the level of sewa is measured by the ccd model in the ccd model the coupling degree is used to represent the degree of interaction between systems or elements while the coordination index can reflect the coordination level between systems or elements within a virtuous circle li et al 2012 three representative indicators were selected to calculate the value of sewa these indicators were water consumption per capita water consumption per 10 000 yuan of gdp and cod emissions per 10 000 yuan of gdp the first two indicators can reflect the supply demand relationship between socioeconomic systems and water resources yang et al 2019 the third indicator is used to characterize the impact of socioeconomic development on the environment gao et al 2020 the subsystems form an organic whole and these subsystems act independently and interact with each other 5 max f 4 s z c t 6 c n 1 3 x n n 1 3 x n 3 3 1 3 7 t n 1 3 α n x n where f 4 is the coupling coordination degree i e the level of sewa 0 z 1 c and t are the coupling degree and the coordinated index of the socioeconomic and environmental systems respectively and x n is the evaluation indicator n in this study the three indicators considered were negative indicators α n is the weight coefficient of the evaluation index n generally the three systems of social economy and environment are equally important so the value of α n is taken as one third han et al 2021 as table 1 shows the level of sewa is classified into five levels including serious non equilibrium moderate non equilibrium slight equilibrium moderate equilibrium and good equilibrium zheng et al 2020 han et al 2021 2 3 2 constraints 1 water supply capacity constraints 8 j j k k s i j k w i where w i is the total water supply of water source i this constraint indicates the total water supply from the water source cannot exceed the initial water availability of that water source 2 water demand constraints 9 d j k min i 1 i s i j k d j k max where d j k min and d j k max are the minimum and maximum of the total water demand of water demand sector k in city j respectively this constraint indicates the total water supply to the water demand sector should be between the minimum and maximum total water demand for that sector 3 level of sewa constraints 10 z j c j t j 0 25 where z j c j and t j are the coupling coordination degree coupling degree and coordination index in city j respectively this constraint ensures that the sewa levels of all cities are higher than the status of slight equilibrium 4 variable non negative constraints 11

ecological sector in one of 21 cities i e s ijk i 1 i j 1 j k 1 k the nsga ii has been used successfully for multi objective optimization problems related to water resource allocation liu et al 2021 naghdi et al 2021 and this technique is applied in this study 2 4 multi criteria decision making method the topsis method was employed to make the order of the pareto front solutions and the different objective weights were calculated by the entropy method the entropy based topsis technique is composed of the following steps the decision matrix is defined as x x p q s t 1 p s 1 q t in which s and t are the numbers of evaluation indicators and evaluation objects respectively 1 the data are normalized by formulas 12 and 13 and the normalized decision matrix x x p q s t is obtained 12 p o s i t i v

the optimal level 3 results 3 1 validation of sd models and prediction of water resources 3 1 1 validation of sd models according to the sd models established in section 2 2 significant variables including total population gdp and water consumption in four sectors were estimated the values of these variables in 21 cities were compared with historical data from 2011 to 2018 the relative errors between the simulated and measured values of the main variables from 2013 to 2018 in 21 cities were analyzed statistically and depicted by box plots fig 4 a taking guangzhou as an example the comparison of the annual simulated and measured values is shown in fig 4 b almost all error values were less than 10 compared with the other research using sd models feng et al 2016 li et al 2018 2019c wei et al 2020 the sd models of 21 cities could achieve the simulation effects and performed better at reflecting the real water cycle system 3 1 2 prediction of water resources the trends of the water system in 21 cities from 2019 to 2030 were simulated by the validated sd models the years 2018 and 2030 were selected as the base year and the target year respectively fig 5 and table 2 present the water allocation and water shortage in 21 cities of guangdong province in 2030 as seen from the table the population and gdp of guangdong province in 2030 would be 13 089 93 104 people and 22 27 1012 yuan respectively the total amount of water supply and demand in 2030 would be 432 40 and 439 27 108 m3 respectively the deficit of water supply and demand would be 18 35 108 m3 with a water shortage rate of 4 18 indicating that guangdong province would face serious water shortages in the future as regards water supply surface water remained the main available water source accounting for 90 of the sum of the available water sources however the surface water decreased compared to that in 2018 fig 5 b which reflected the drought trend to a certain extent liu et al 2020 with the improvement of wastewater treatment the total amount of wastewater reuse increased significantly with the average rate of wastewater reuse being 15 li et al 2019c and increasing by 13 18 108 m3 compared to that in 2018 fig 5 b the available quantity of groundwater and transfer water was almost the same as that in 2018 as regards water demand domestic and industrial water demand would increase dramatically the agricultural water demand would decrease attributed to the implementation of agricultural water saving measures cao et al 2021 especially in the cities of zhanjiang meizhou qingyuan jieyang and shaoguan fig 5 b however the agricultural sector was still the largest water consumption user in guangdong province specifically by 2030 9 cities would suffer water shortages and 5 cities of them i e guangzhou dongguan shenzhen foshan and qingyuan would experience water shortages exceeding 1 108 m3 the water deficit of guangzhou was the largest amounting to 3 91 108 m3 the cities facing water shortages were located in the pearl river delta liu et al 2018 except for qingyuan there were different reasons why these cities would face water shortages as shown in fig 5 b dongguan and shenzhen would face water shortages because of an increase in domestic and industrial water demand foshan would face water shortages because of increasing industrial water demand guangzhou and qingyuan would face water shortages because of an increase in domestic water demand furthermore the other 12 cities would have more available water resources owing to a decrease in agricultural water demand fig 5 b including zhanjiang jieyang etc it was obvious that the problem of the uneven distribution of water supply and demand confronted by guangdong province would be further intensified this uneven distribution would further exacerbate water conflicts and impose serious constraints on population growth and regional economic development therefore it is necessary for water resource managers to address this problem by optimal water allocation considering the spatial equilibrium to increase regional water self sufficiency and promote the coordinated development of socioeconomic and environmental systems 3 2 optimization and decision making of water resource allocation the water resources socioeconomic and environmental data in 2030 were estimated by sd models and were used as the input of the optimization model regarding nsga ii parameters the population size and the maximum iteration number were set to 200 and 2000 respectively the rates of crossover and mutation were 0 9 and 0 05 respectively through the model calculation the pareto front of the four objectives is shown in fig 6 according to the characteristics of the pareto front solutions fig 6 a and b social benefits had a nonlinear contradiction with economic benefits and environmental impacts respectively this indicated that both economic benefits and environmental impacts had decreasing trends with increasing water shortages comparatively the relationships of the level of sewa with other objectives were relatively complicated with the increase in social benefits or water shortages the sewa level had an increasing trend the sewa level would decrease with increasing economic benefits the reason may be that the indicators of sewa considered were all negative indicators when the water shortage was larger the value of the indicators e g per capita water consumption would decrease making the ccd obtain a larger value additionally there was a trade off in the relationship between environmental impacts and the sewa levels denoting that the higher the level of sewa the fewer pollutants were discharged the complicated relationship could provide greater insight into the water system by considering sewa in the optimization model of water resource allocation obviously it was difficult to find an optimal solution furthermore the top five best compromise solutions were achieved by the entropy based topsis method table 3 and fig 6 b the results showed that the values of the four objectives between the top five best compromise solutions were relatively close especially the solutions of ranks 1 2 and 4 it was obvious that the best compromise solutions had a consistent sewa state i e good equilibrium fig 6 b by comparing the solutions of the rank 1 2 and 4 considering the less water shortage and greater economic benefits the ranking second solution was selected as the best solution of which the social benefit was 0 021 the economic benefit was 18 90 1012 yuan the cod emissions were 76 99 104 tons and the level of sewa was 0 509 3 3 solution of water resource allocation and comparisons of sewa levels fig 7 shows the best solution for water allocation between 21 cities of guangdong province in 2030 using the optimization model the water resources of guangdong province were reallocated it was clear that all 21 cities had different degrees of water shortages including cities that did not have water shortage problems before optimization the reason was that the gap in total water supply and demand in guangdong province still existed however the water deficit of guangdong province decreased from 18 35 to 7 6 108 m3 and the water shortage rate decreased to 1 56 the severe water shortages of the cities located in the pearl river delta were alleviated the water deficit of guangzhou decreased from 3 91 to 1 71 108 m3 the water deficit of other cities was lower than 1 108 m3 through the optimization process the final water allocation solution in guangdong fig 7 b showed that water resources were allocated from the cities located in the regions of eastern guangdong northern guangdong and western guangdong to the cities located in the pearl river delta with this knowledge about the solution to water allocation water resource managers should enhance the unified allocation of water resources in the region and each city should strengthen the intensive use of water resources by adopting water saving practices to ensure sustainable socioeconomic development song et al 2018 fig 8 shows the sewa levels in 21 cities of guangdong province in 2018 in 2030 before optimization and in 2030 after optimization the sewa levels of the province and its cities in 2030 before optimization declined compared to those in 2018 except for shenzhen and there were no cities with a status of non equilibrium fig 8a obviously the level of sewa in shenzhen was much higher than that of other cities through the optimization process the overall sewa level of guangdong province increased from 0 475 to 0 509 by 0 034 it was obvious that a qualitative change in the provincial level of sewa had occurred and the sewa level improved from moderate equilibrium to good equilibrium by optimization allocation specifically the sewa levels of heyuan and jiangmen improved from slight equilibrium to moderate equilibrium zhuhai and foshan increased from moderate equilibrium to good equilibrium the sewa levels of 21 cities in 2030 were close to or better than those in 2018 fig 8b and d these results indicated that the levels of sewa in the province and some cities were significantly improved by the optimization model finally there were 4 11 and 6 cities with slight moderate and good equilibrium respectively according to the spatial distribution of the sewa levels of 21 cities fig 8d the cities with higher levels of sewa were mainly located in the pearl river delta while the cities with lower sewa levels were mainly located in northern guangdong 4 discussion 4 1 efficiency of the proposed framework this study proposed a framework for the optimal allocation of regional water resources considering the principle of sewa the concept of sewa has become a key idea for water resource allocation in a region that faces water shortage problems song et al 2016 the lower the level of sewa the more likely the development of socioeconomic and environmental systems carried by water resources is uncoordinated and this uncoordinated development in turn can result in the inefficient use of water resources and affect the sewa level yue et al 2021 guangdong province has a tropical and subtropical monsoon climate with abundant precipitation but the spatial distribution of water resources is uneven meanwhile guangdong province is china s most economically developed province and has a large population with extremely high water demands the results showed that the water shortage problem caused by the uneven distribution of water supply and demand confronted by guangdong province would intensify in the future which was consistent with the research findings by he et al 2020 therefore to promote the coordinated development of the social economy and environment of guangdong province it is necessary to implement water optimization allocation based on the proposed framework the results demonstrated that the efficiency of water resource prediction was enhanced the water shortage was alleviated and the level of sewa was significantly improved by optimization allocation compared with seeking the maximum socioeconomic benefits and the minimum environmental impacts the proposed framework could obtain a compromise solution through the decision making method read et al 2014 underlined the importance of stability of allocation solution and suggested that selecting an inferior stable solution would be better than an unstable optimal solution the selection of compromise solutions and the consideration of the principle of sewa in this study could increase the stability of water allocation solutions somewhat hajkowicz and collins 2007 the cities in the pearl river delta facing a serious water shortage were at higher levels of sewa figs 7 and 8 the main reason for this phenomenon was that the sewa level was commonly affected by water shortages and water use efficiency a serious water shortage would reduce the sewa level while a high water use efficiency could improve the sewa level the positive effects of high water use efficiency were greater than the negative effects due to water shortages in the cities located in the pearl river delta which resulted in these cities being at higher sewa levels furthermore increasing the amount of water supply by water resource allocation was only one aspect of facilitating the spatial equilibrium of water resources it was also critical to improve water use efficiency through technological innovation and socioeconomic development to alleviate water resource pressure and improve the ecological environment therefore the principle of sewa was a critical driving force to reshape water resource management promote high quality socioeconomic development and restore the ecological environment in the region wang and liu 2016 ma et al 2021 the essence of spatial equilibrium based optimal water resource allocation was to realize the coordinated development of the socioeconomic and environmental systems carried by water resources 4 2 variations in water use indicators in the future after optimal allocation it is necessary to answer the question about how to use water in the different water use sectors in different cities the following four indicators were proposed the domestic water consumption per capita water consumption per 10 000 yuan of industrial value added water consumption per unit of arable land and cod emissions per 10 000 yuan of gdp these four indicators of guangdong province and its cities were compared in 2018 in 2030 before optimization and in 2030 after optimization as shown in fig 9 in terms of domestic water fig 9a the average domestic water consumption per capita of guangdong province was 169 83 l d in 2018 which would decrease to 151 94 l d by 2030 due to the population growth coupled with water shortages through the optimization process the average value of domestic water consumption per capita in guangdong province was increased by 5 63 l d indicating that the pressure of domestic water use had certainly been relieved importantly these indicator values of 6 cities facing water shortages including guangzhou dongguan shenzhen foshan and qingyuan increased by 5 94 27 19 l d compared to that before optimization for example domestic water consumption per capita in shenzhen in 2030 140 43 l d was slightly lower than an optimistic estimate 156 16 l d by li et al 2019c by 2030 zhuhai and foshan would be the two cities with the largest domestic water saving pressure the domestic water consumption per capita of these two cities decreased by 70 52 and 41 68 l d respectively the domestic water use of other cities decreased by 2 53 20 28 l d these results could contribute to the formulation of domestic water saving strategies for different cities water consumption per 10 000 yuan of industrial value added of guangdong province showed similar characteristics to per capita water consumption fig 9b the indicator average value of guangdong province would decrease from 25 89 to 14 51 m3 from 2018 to 2030 and by the optimization process the indicator value would decrease to 15 28 m3 with a reduced rate of 41 00 based on the related regulations issued in china water consumption per 10 000 yuan of industrial value added must be less than 40 m3 by 2030 gosc 2012 it was obvious that the indicator of water use in the industrial sector of each city in guangdong province would be below the target value by 2030 however there were 16 cities with a reduction rate exceeding 30 and it was a severe challenge for them to achieve the water use target especially for shaoguan heyuan and meizhou cities these results indicated that the cities in guangdong province are required to improve industrial water use efficiency and formulate relevant industrial water saving measures by considering the characteristics of industrial water use of different cities to achieve sustainable water usage and management lv et al 2020 compared with related indicators of domestic and industrial water use the provincial average value of water consumption per unit of arable land decreased after optimization fig 9c this indicator value of guangdong province would be 661 96 m3 mu in 2030 a decrease of 92 04 m3 mu compared to that in 2018 however the indicator values of some cities including shenzhen dongguan zhongshan etc had increased compared to that before optimization indicating that the irrigation water saving pressure of these cities was relieved by the optimization model to some extent the indicator value of jieyang had a maximum reduction rate of 30 32 indicating that jieyang was the city with the greatest water saving potential for agricultural irrigation by the proposed framework the quota of agricultural irrigation water use of each city in guangdong province would be clarified by 2030 which could provide a good reference for the technological development and the policy support of agricultural irrigation zhang et al 2019 the top key water saving cities in the domestic industrial and agricultural sectors were located in the pearl river delta northern guangdong and eastern guangdong respectively by comparing the reduction rates of four water use indicators of different sectors it was found that the industrial sector had greater water savings than that of other sectors and similar findings were obtained by bian et al 2022 to reduce the excessive water saving burden that poorly matched the city s capacity it was necessary to consider increasing the water supply by rainwater utilization transfer project construction and seawater desalination lv et al 2020 karandish et al 2021 to reflect the impact of socioeconomic development on the environment the cod emissions per 10 000 yuan of gdp were compared under different conditions fig 9d the cod emissions were associated with the quantity of domestic and industrial water use it was obvious that the reduced rates of cod emissions for almost all cities exceeded 50 in addition to qingyuan it should also be noted that the provincial average value of the cod emissions per 10 000 yuan of gdp showed a considerable decreasing trend from 0 63 kg to 0 28 kg from 2018 to 2030 which was conducive to preventing the further deterioration of the water environment 4 3 uncertainty of the proposed framework although sd models have better robustness which can effectively reduce uncertainty and improve accuracy neuwirth 2017 naghdi et al 2021 uncertainty inevitably arises due to many input variables and parameters needed in this study most of the input variables are collected from official bulletins or statistical yearbooks and a small part is referred to the published literature the sd model parameters are estimated by linear or nonlinear relationships of related variables these can reduce the uncertainty of model inputs and parameters and improve the accuracy of the model to a certain extent yang et al 2019 the structure of the sd model is a top priority for variable simulation and prediction which is influenced by the modeler s cognition and prior knowledge in this study the sd model is constructed based on a large number of results and experiences from existing studies to reduce the uncertainty of the model structure as much as possible koul et al 2016 li et al 2019c wei et al 2020 however it is still inevitable that the simulation and prediction results of the sd model have large uncertainties in the proposed framework decision making uncertainty is also existing thus it is necessary to use related methods or techniques to quantify the uncertainty of the research framework in future studies despite these apparent limitations the framework proposed in this study still has important and profound reference value for implementing spatial equilibrium based allocation of regional water resources and achieving socioeconomic and environmental sustainability 5 conclusions a spatial equilibrium based multi objective optimization framework for regional water resource allocation was proposed in this study the main findings and conclusions based on a case study of guangdong province in china were summarized as follows i the sd models for multiple cities could be efficiently established by a python script tool which helped to achieve a feasible and efficient path for establishing sd models for multiple cities the validated sd models projected that the deficit of water supply and demand would be 18 35 108 m3 with a water shortage rate of 4 18 the imbalances in water supply and demand among 21 cities would exacerbate the problem of the uneven spatial distribution of water resources in guangdong province ii the best solution of the optimal water allocation was able to significantly improve the sewa level while alleviating the severe situation of water scarcity by optimal allocation the water shortage of guangdong province could decrease to 1 56 iii after optimal allocation domestic water consumption per capita water consumption per 10 000 yuan of industrial value added and water consumption per unit of arable land would be 157 57 l d 15 28 m3 and 661 96 m3 mu respectively by 2030 the key water saving cities for the domestic industrial and agricultural sectors were mainly located in the pearl river delta northern guangdong and eastern guangdong respectively water conservation was more intense in the industrial sector than in other sectors the impact of the water allocation solution on the environment revealed that the solution was conducive to preventing further deterioration of the water environment the socioeconomic and environmental systems carried by water resources are complex and highly uncertain many studies find it difficult to establish a deterministic model to predict the quantity of the water supply and water demand hu et al 2016b water saving use is the basis of water resource management du et al 2021 and the concept of water saving priority should be involved in water resource optimization allocation lv et al 2020 thus future studies should couple prediction and optimization models by considering the key parameters of water savings and uncertainty to achieve the spatial equilibrium of water resources in contrast to traditional water resource allocation the concept of sewa was incorporated into the multi objective optimization model the application of compromise solutions and the consideration of the sewa principle could help strengthen the stability of water resource allocation the allocation solution attained in this study could effectively promote the coordinated regional development of socioeconomic and environmental systems this study provided a valuable guide for allocating regional water resources as well as for comprehensive water resource management and allocation in other

7802,study region the north and south sources in the upper stream of qiantang river basin china study focus identifying the relative contribution of climate change and human activities to runoff variation is essential for an enhanced understanding on efficient management of regional water resources we used multiplied abrupt change testing methods to determine the baseline period bp and two variation periods vp1 and vp2 and used six budyko based methods to detect the quantitative hydrological response to climate change and human activities new hydrological insights for the region the annual mean runoff of north source witnessed a decrease in vp1 before it increased during vp2 while it continued to increase in south source the climate change dominated the runoff variation in the north source while it was human activities that was the main driver for south source the human induced effect contributed to runoff decline in north source while it led to the continuous runoff increasing in south source it shows that the runoff change due to climate was more sensitive to precipitation than potential evapotranspiration the land use analysis illustrates that human induced runoff changes were composed of two aspects 1 the increased proportion of woodland and decreased ratio of farmland reduced runoff 2 the increased percentage of town and country land increased runoff the former influence was relatively limited compared to the latter as well as the climate change graphical abstract ga1 keywords climate change human activities runoff qiantang river basin land uses data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction the past several decades have witnessed the increasing intensity and frequency of extreme meteorological and hydrological extreme events due to climate change worldwide solomon et al 2007 xu et al 2012 klasic et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 human influence on the climate system is now detected with greater certainty the runoff variation which is largely dependent on the combined effect of climate change and human activities plays an important role in hydrological cycle and water resources system milly et al 2005 xu et al 2013 ahn and merwade 2014 jiang et al 2015 dey and mishra 2017 climate change causes the variations of temperature precipitation and other factors so as to affect the hydrological runoff process while human activities mainly cause the change of underlying surface so as to influence the runoff generation mechanism dong et al 2012 the substantial increase in runoff may result in flood disasters and the continuous downward trend in runoff may lead to a shortage of water resources both of which will induce serious social and ecological issues therefore an enhanced understanding of separating the impacts related to climate change and human activities are desperately needed in order to take efficient actions to maintain the relative balance of water resources and improve the abilities of dealing with climate issues great efforts have been paid by researchers to investigate the influences on hydrology some studies focus on only one factor ignoring the comprehensive impact of climate change and human activities setegn et al 2011 xu et al 2013 bian et al 2021 other previous studies using data contrastive analysis do not propose an explicit method to quantitatively separate the contribution of the two drivers yang et al 2004 guo et al 2008 recently studies have attempted to quantify the contribution rate of climate change and human activities miao et al 2011 ye et al 2013 zhao et al 2014 liu et al 2017 2019 xie et al 2019 tang et al in preparation generally the methods can be divided into three categories empirical statistics hydrological simulation and elasticity based methods wu et al 2017 huang et al 2020 empirical statistics usually form a relationship between runoff and precipitation based on the long term historical hydro meteorological data zhao et al 2015 applied a linear regression method to construct the annual water discharge in response to climate change in the yangtze river indicating 72 and 28 contribution of climate change and human activities to water discharge reduction from 1970 to 2010 they extended their research by double mass curve method for further investigate on attribution of the decreasing trend on water discharge and sediment load of tributaries in this area zhao et al 2017 empirical statistics method requires long time hydro meteorological observations and the existing studies reflected that it tends to be more suitable at a large regional scale miao et al 2011 kong et al 2016 and its accuracy is largely affected by the reconstructed regression equation for the baseline period wu et al 2017 hydrological model estimates the climate induced effects on runoff variation by comparing simulations driven by different climate variable values zhao and tao 2017 used the variable infiltration capacity vic model and long term runoff observation to attribute the runoff change to climate change and human activities in seven typical catchments across china from 1961 to 2014 indicating more contributions by human activities to runoff change after 2000 tang et al 2021 applied soil and water assessment tool swat model in lancang river basin showing the reduction in the streamflow in june and november was mainly caused by decreased precipitation and increased evapotranspiration while the changes in the streamflow in other months were mainly due to human activities hydrological simulation is able to describe the physical processes to a certain extent and is a convincing method for small time scales such as month or day but it is the most difficult method that requires sufficient hydrological data and involves large uncertainties in determining parameter guo et al 2015 zhu et al 2016 which limits its application in ungauged basin elasticity based methods evaluate the climate change effects on runoff by elasticities in meteorological factors sankarasubramanian et al 2001 proposed a nonparametric method to obtain climate elasticity from data and a more physically based method integrates the water balance equation with the budyko hypothesis tang and wang 2021 proposed an attribution approach based on budyko framework and applied it to six sub basins in mekong river basin indicating that the observed streamflow decadal changes are mostly due to anthropogenic activities with some decadal contributions from changes in precipitation cheng et al 2019 used multiple hydrologic metrics and the budyko equation to study the yangtze river showing the joint effects of human activities and climate change varied among the river reaches in the different decades the latter method based on water balance has advantage in reducing uncertainties on large time scales guo et al 2015 besides many studies have reported different kinds of improved version of budyko based method which facility the development of quantitative contribution assessment of climate change and human activities to runoff zhou et al 2015 2016 yang et al 2020 china has suffered a lot from the water related natural disasters such as flooding or water shortage researches have investigated some major rivers and northern china areas zhang et al 2011 jiang et al 2015 yuan et al 2016 wu et al 2017 huang et al 2020 ning et al 2016 xue et al 2021 interestingly majority of these areas feature a downward trend of runoff which maybe the result of human activities such as reservoir construction water consumption and land use land cover change in recent years the frequency of extreme hydrological events increases in south east china as well qiu 2010 the qiantang river basin a typical catchment in southeast coast of china different from other catchments it has three sub basins and two of which are located in the upper stream that are respectively its north source and south source this area often suffers from many disasters such as typhoon flooding and drought wen et al 2006 that attracts more and more attentions it is therefore of great importance to detect the potential impacts on these hydrological events the existing studies are seldom related to the attribution of runoff variation xu et al 2013 analysed the impact of climate change on precipitation potential evapotranspiraton and river runoff in a sub basin of upper reaches of qiantang river basin by swat method at the time scale of month but they did not separate the human induced effects and the time scale is small in this study we aim to evaluate and compare the quantitative contributions of the climate change and human activities to the runoff variation in both upper stream sources of qiantang river basin the results could provide a scientific basis for monitoring and preventing water related disaster and have an important reference value for sustainable development of water resources and management decisions the paper is organized as follows first data and methods will be introduced including the introduction of study area data sources and the way of quantifying the contributions of climate change and human activities then the descriptions of results are presented involving the determination of baseline period and variation periods and attribution of runoff variation in the north and south sources of qiantang river basin it is followed by the comparison of the two sources and the discussion of potential causes finally the conclusion is given 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the qiantang river is located in the east of china the upstream of the river has north and south sources that both originate in xiuning county anhui province the north source xin an river with an elevation of about 1350 m flows through anhui and zhejiang provinces and into the xin an river reservoir xin an river is a mountain stream river with the trunk length of 359 km and basin area of about 11 700 km2 the south source that lies in majin river upper stream of lan river has an altitude of 810 m the length of main stream of lan river is about 303 km and the catchment area is about 19 350 km2 xin an river and lan river converge in jiande and flow into fuchun river passing through hangzhou city before flowing into the east china sea which is the downstream of qiantang river this paper studies the main sub basins of upper stream qiantang river basin including xin an river basin north source and lan river basin south source dominated by a sub tropical humid monsoon climate this area has abundant precipitation and high temperature in summer but is rainless and cold in winter due to the geographical differences precipitation distributes unevenly for example the average annual rainfall from 1970 to 2019 at huangshan and dongyang stations is 2395 6 and 1421 9 mm respectively fig 1 tables 1 and 2 show the location of the study area and the information of hydrological and meteorological stations 2 2 data long time series of daily runoff data from 1970 to 2019 of the xin anjiang and yuankou hydrological stations for the north source xin an river basin and the lanxi hydrological station for the south source lan river basin are provided by zhejiang provincial hydrology bureau contemporaneous daily meteorological data at eight meteorological stations including precipitation actual evapotranspiration temperature sunshine duration relative humidity wind speed atmospheric pressure maximum and minimum air temperature is obtained from the national meteorological data centre of china meteorological administration http data cma cn land use information can be got in the resource and environment science and data centre chinese academy of sciences https www resdc cn 2 3 methods 2 3 1 definition of baseline period baseline period determination is an important step to analyse the contribution of climate change and human activities to runoff the most commonly used methods are human designed method and abrupt change method wu et al 2017 the former method selects an early period of time as a baseline period during which the anthropogenic effect is assumed to be tiny miao et al 2011 xu 2007 the standard of limited human effect is hard to be defined and it relies much on subjective judgment that inevitably increases the uncertainty and unreliability on the final results the latter method is based on the long term hydrological data using statistical techniques to evaluate the abrupt change points liang et al 2015 li et al 2007 these techniques include mann kendall test huang et al 2020 pettitt test liang et al 2015 moving t test etc then the abrupt change points divide the long hydrological series into a baseline period e g pre change period and the variation periods e g post change periods the abrupt change method is suggested to be used for its statistical basis but one abrupt change testing may not be accurate thus we used multiple techniques to find the intersection 2 3 2 quantifying contributions of climate change and human activities the total annual mean runoff variations during a period time in a given river basin can be represented by the differences of annual mean runoff between the baseline period and the variation periods which reads 1 δ q t o t a l q variaton q baseline where δ q t o t a l is the total change in annual mean runoff and q variation and q baseline are the annual mean runoff during the variation period and the baseline period respectively it is well recognized that the runoff processing is impacted by both climatic and anthropogenic factors thus the combined effects on runoff variation due to climate change and human activities also lead to the total change in annual mean runoff and their relative contributions in percentage can be written as 2 δ q t o t a l δ q climate δ q human 3 μ climate δ q climate δ q t o t a l 100 4 μ human δ q human δ q t o t a l 100 where δ q climate and δ q human are the changes in annual mean runoff due to climate change and human activities and μ climate and μ human are the percentage contributions of climate change and human activities to the total runoff variations respectively δ q t o t a l can be easily assessed by the annual mean runoff during baseline period and variation periods as long as the abrupt change points are determined to separate the impacts of climate change and human activities on runoff changes we applied the budyko based method to evaluate the runoff changes by climate change and then the anthropogenic contribution can be obtained 2 3 3 budyko based methods the long term water balance equation is the foundation of budyko hypothesis 5 q p e δ s where q is the runoff p is the precipitation e is the actual evapotranspiration and δ s is the variation of the basin water storage that can be assumed to be zero over a relatively long period of time e g 5 10 years dingman 2002 runoff can be modeled as a function of climate factors i e precipitation and potential evapotranspiration and catchment features 6 q f p e 0 c where e 0 is the potential evapotranspiration that is calculated by the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 and c is the comprehensive impact of catchment factors on runoff which is assumed to be caused by human activities then the varied runoff due to climate change can be expressed as 7 δ q climate q p δ p q e 0 δ e 0 where δ q δ p and δ e 0 are the changes of runoff precipitation and potential evapotranspiration respectively introducing the climate elasticity of runoff ε 8 ε q q x x where x is the climate factors i e precipitation and potential evapotranspiration eq 7 can be rewritten as 9 δ q climate ε p δ p p ε e 0 δ e 0 e 0 q based on budyko hypothesis the actual evapotranspiration is mainly controlled by available water and energy the ratio of actual evapotranspiration to precipitation is a function of dryness index φ e 0 p which reads 10 e p f φ combined with eq 5 and eq 10 eq 8 for precipitation and potential evapotranspiration can be calculated as 11 ε p 1 φ f φ 1 f φ 12 ε e 0 φ f φ 1 f φ where f φ is derived function of f φ and it can be found ε p ε e 0 1 the key point to estimate the climate elasticities is how to determine the function f φ a lot of efforts have been made by researchers and we applied six popular functions for comprehensively comparison shown in table 3 3 results 3 1 hydro meteorological data analysis xin an river and shouchang river controlled by xin anjiang and yuankou stations converged together and flowed out of xin an river basin so we used hydrological data of both xin anjiang and yuankou stations to investigate the runoff processing of the north source catchment lanxi was the final gauge station of lan river basin and was used to analyse the runoff data in south source catchment in order to get more convincing results we combined abrupt change techniques of mann kendall test m k test pettitt test and moving t test to distinguish the baseline period and variation periods in two sub basins of qiantang river basin figs 2 and 3 show the abrupt change points assessed by different methods for the north source and south source respectively and they were summarized in table 4 several intersections were calculated using m k test which needed other methods for further detection for the north source uf value decreased to negative after the crossover point 1999 in m k test fig 2 a ut value was over the positive 0 05 significant level fig 2 b2 and t value was over the positive 0 01 significant level in 1999 fig 2 c2 which illustrated that the runoff experienced a decreased change after this year although there was no intersection point in 2009 by m k test the other two methods both indicated an increased change in this year fig 2 b1 and c1 for lan river basin uf value increased to positive after the crossover points 1988 and 2009 in m k test fig 3 a ut value was below the negative 0 05 significant level in 1988 fig 3 b and t value was below the negative 0 01 significant level in 2009 fig 3 c which illustrated that the runoff had two increased changes in both 1988 and 2009 overall the baseline period of north source of qiantang river basin was 1970 1998 and the variation periods were 1999 2008 and 2009 2019 the south source of qiantang river basin had a baseline period from 1970 to1987 and two variation periods from 1988 to 2008 and from 2009 to 2019 interestingly the north source had longer baseline period than south source and they both shared an increased variation period of 2009 2019 here baseline period is abbreviated as bp the first and second variation periods are abbreviated as vp1 and vp2 respectively fig 4 compares the different periods of runoff and meteorological factors in north and south source of qiantang river basin the annual meteorological factors for each source basin were calculated using thiessen polygons method to divide each basin into several sections according to the meteorological stations and spatially interpolate the annual precipitation temperature and evapotranspiration and potential evapotranspiration during the period of 1970 2019 fig 4 a1 and a2 show the annual mean runoff of the two sources during the study period were around 900 mm which were 915 mm and 877 mm for north source and south source respectively the runoff in north source witnessed a decrease before increasing from 2009 while it continued to increase in south source the results agreed with the analysis of the abrupt change tests fig 4 b1 and b2 illustrate the precipitation of the two sources over the years the precipitation in north source during bp was 1748 57 mm it first reduced to 1616 74 mm during vp1 and then rose to 1887 65 mm during vp2 which was similar with the trend of its runoff despite the continuous increase in the south source it seemed to rise disproportionately with its runoff as shown in fig 4 a2 it can be seen from fig 4 c1 and c2 that the mean temperatures of vp2 for north source and south source were 16 30 and 18 24 which were 0 17 and 0 56 higher than vp1 and 0 95 and 1 27 higher than bp respectively the averaged temperature in the north source was lower than that in south source and both the catchments saw a significant upward trend in temperature due to the background of global warming especially since the 1970 s jones and moberg 2003 the temperature of qiantang river basin also began to rise from 1970 s and increased rapidly from about 1990 it is well recognized that the warming climate would intensify the hydrological cycle process and promote the variation of precipitation and evapotranspiration which contributes to enhancing the frequency of hydrological extreme events and affecting the regional water resources distribution arnell et al 2001 dore 2005 huntington 2006 shaw and riha 2011 mukherji 2022 fig 4 d1 e2 indicate the actual and potential evapotranspiration for the study area although the potential evapotranspiration during vp1 and vp2 changed little compared with bp with relative variation ratio of 2 57 and 1 44 for north source and 0 18 and 1 42 for south source fig 4 e1 e2 the actual evapotranspiration was on the rise as a whole which may result from the increasing temperature 3 2 contributions of climate change and human activities to runoff six budyko based methods were used to analyse the attribution of runoff variation as introduced in 2 3 according to eq 10 and table 3 the parameters m 2 086 and ω 0 584 in fu et al 2007 and zhang et al 2001 were calibrated by precipitation potential evapotranspiration and actual evapotranspiration of north source during baseline period and m 2 420 and ω 0 962 were obtained in the same way for the south source table 5 indicates the influences of climate change and human activities on runoff and fig 5 shows their relative contributions to runoff change table 5 presents the changes in annual mean runoff due to climate change and human activities and their relative percentage contributions estimated by six methods in general these methods showed the similar results of the main influence factor on runoff we averaged the results of the six methods in order to reduce error and obtain a relative more accurate outcome compared to bp the north source experienced a decline in runoff during vp1 144 5 mm and an upward trend during vp2 97 1 mm the contribution of climate change approached 100 during vp1 while the effect of human activities only accounted for 3 16 indicating both the climate change and human activities contributed to the runoff decreasing and the change of runoff at this period was mainly dominated by climate change interestingly during vp2 the contribution of the climate change was over 100 and that of human activities was negative 22 8 which illustrated that the climate induced effect led to the increasing runoff while man induced effect resulted in the declined runoff during study periods in north source the climate change was the main driver of runoff variation and human activities contributed to the decreased runoff on the whole in the south source the runoff continued to grow the percentage contribution of climate change was 20 20 during vp1 and slightly increased to 36 19 during vp2 while human activities contributed 79 80 and 63 81 of runoff increase in vp1 and vp2 respectively during study periods in south source the human caused factor was the main driver of runoff variation and both the climate change and human activities contributed to the upward trend of runoff fig 5 compares attribution of changes in runoff in north and south sources during variation periods the total contribution of climate and human activities should be 100 the positive or negative values in percentage means whether the climate change or human activities contributed in the same trend as the runoff change during vp1 in north source both the climate change and human activities resulted in the runoff decreased so their contributions to runoff change at this period were positive during vp2 a higher percentage of climate contribution north source 122 28 illustrated that the climate induced effect played a dominate role on runoff increasing while human induced effect led to runoff decline which was opposite to the runoff variation trend in the south source runoff changing was mainly dependent on human activities both of the factors promoted the runoff increasing during the variation periods interestingly the climate induced effect seemed to increase in both north and south sources during vp2 4 discussion 4 1 sensitivity analysis one of the key points to analyse the attribution of runoff changes is the determination of the varied runoff due to climate change and the runoff variation due to human activities can be readily obtained by eq 2 as shown in eq 9 the two main meteorological factors that affect the runoff change due to climate are precipitation and potential evapotranspiration in order to investigate how the runoff responds to the two meteorological factors sensitivity analysis was carried out for variation periods in the north and south sources fig 6 shows that the runoff varies with the change rate of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration when they are tuned by 30 based on the averaged values in table 5 it can be seen that the runoff change is more sensitive to precipitation than the potential evapotranspiration the slopes of runoff change rate lines reflect the relative ratio of potential evapotranspiration impact to precipitation effect the steeper the line is the greater the influence of rainfall is than that of potential evapotranspiration it helps to analyse the influence of changed climate factors on the runoff variation which provides a potential method to predict future runoff trend according to climate factors 4 2 land use analysis it is interesting to investigate the changes in runoff and the potential causes that led to the differences between north and south sources it is well known that the underlying surface would directly affect the runoff process we analysed the land uses in both north and south sources at various times hoping to explain the phenomena shown in results fig 7 presents the proportions of five kinds of land uses in north and south sources in several years from 1980 to 2018 and its corresponding time periods i e bp vp1 and vp2 in north south the land uses were relative stable during bp as shown in 1980 and 1990 with about two thirds woodland and a very small amount of town and country land during vp1 represented by 2000 in fig 7 a prominent decline in farmland from 16 7 in 1990 to 9 2 in 2000 and an obvious increase in woodland from 69 1 in 1990 to 78 in 2000 were observed in 1999 zhejiang province launched a pilot project of ecological public welfare forest construction in 21 river source counties and key forest counties and lots of the pilots were located in the north source on the basis of the pilot the implementation plan of returning farmland to forest in the whole province was formulated so the woodland replaced some part of farmland and increased to over 77 of the land use in north source since 2000 it is well recognized that forest vegetation has the function of water conservation besides the direct effect of precipitation on the runoff decrease at vp1 the human activities of returning farmland to forest might also contribute to the reduced runoff moreover during vp2 the percentage contribution of climate change to the increasing runoff was over 100 and human induced effect was negative which might also be due to the continuous forest construction effect the land uses of north source in 2000 representing vp1 and 1980 representing bp in fig 7 illustrate that when other kinds of land uses remained approximately invariant the increase of woodland and farmland helped to conserve soil and water and led to runoff decrease but the influence was relatively limited compared to climate induced effect which dominated the runoff change in the north source ns in fig 5 in the south source the woodland made up over half of the land use and the town and country land was the least in bp similar to the change of north source there was an upward trend in woodland proportion in 2000 which might result from forest construction conducted in the whole zhejiang province the increase of woodland was supposed to reduce runoff but the increase rate was too smaller that its effect was overlooked by the increase of town and country land the proportion of town and country land grew only 0 3 before 2000 but an abrupt increase was spotted in 2010 rising to the third place of all the land uses since then this kind of land use has seen a steady growth the change in town and country land directly reflected the increase in impervious surface area by human activities such as urbanization construction which promoted the runoff increasing and might be one of the possible reasons that the runoff change in south source was dominated by human activities during variation periods it is noted that the continuous increasing runoff in the south source is a latent danger for flood disaster the development of urbanization needs more and more town and country land that expose more impervious surface people would be at greater risks during flood season especially this area is easily attacked by typhoon due to its location necessary measures may be demanded another point illustrated by fig 7 is that the water areas in two sources were steady and the water area in north source was about more than 5 times that of south source owing to xin anjiang reservoir in the north source large area of water helped to attemperation to some extent so both the temperature and its variation range in the north source was smaller than the south source fig 4 c1 and c2 in this paper the human induce effects are analysed by land uses changes but in fact there may have other ways that human activities affect the runoff further studies are demanded to quantitatively investigate more possible human activities besides the climate change and human activities are not completely independent to each other how to quantitatively describe the relationship between the two factors and separate the impacts of each part more accurately are worthy to be studied 5 conclusion qiantang river basin has north and south sources in its upper reaches divided into two sub basin named xin an river basin and lan river basin long time series of daily hydrological and meteorological data from 1970 to 2019 were used and six budyko based methods were applied to detect and compare the hydrological response to climate change and human activities in the two sources the different results between north and south sources were discussed our main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 combining the multiplied abrupt change testing methods the baseline period of the north source and south source were 1970 1998 and 1970 1987 two variation periods were spotted the first variation periods were 1999 2008 and 1988 2008 for the north source and south source respectively and they shared the same second variation period from 2009 to 2019 2 the annual mean runoff of north source witnessed a decrease in vp1 before it increased from the beginning of vp2 while it continued to increase in south source the precipitation had the same changing tendency with its runoff during study period in general but the change range was not necessarily proportional the average temperature in both sources saw a significant upward trend the actual evapotranspiration was on the rise as a whole and the potential evapotranspiration changed inapparently 3 five functions based on budyko based method were applied to compare the attribution of changes in runoff in north and south sources during variation periods the climate change dominated the runoff variation in the north source during variation period while it was human activities that was the main driver for south source the human induced effect contributed to runoff decline in the north source while it led to the runoff increasing in the south source 4 sensitivity analysis was carried out to investigate the response of runoff due to climate to the precipitation and potential evapotranspiration it shows that the runoff change is more sensitive to precipitation than the potential evapotranspiration 5 land uses in the two sources at various times were investigated it illustrated that human induced runoff change were composed of two aspects 1 increased proportion of woodland and decreased ratio of farmland that reduced runoff 2 increased percentage of town and country land that promoted runoff the former influence was relatively limited compared to the latter as well as the climate change necessary measures are demanded to weaken the human induced impact on runoff increasing in south source so as to reduce the possible flood risks credit authorship

7802,study region the north and south sources in the upper stream of qiantang river basin china study focus identifying the relative contribution of climate change and human activities to runoff variation is essential for an enhanced understanding on efficient management of regional water resources we used multiplied abrupt change testing methods to determine the baseline period bp and two variation periods vp1 and vp2 and used six budyko based methods to detect the quantitative hydrological response to climate change and human activities new hydrological insights for the region the annual mean runoff of north source witnessed a decrease in vp1 before it increased during vp2 while it continued to increase in south source the climate change dominated the runoff variation in the north source while it was human activities that was the main driver for south source the human induced effect contributed to runoff decline in north source while it led to the continuous runoff increasing in south source it shows that the runoff change due to climate was more sensitive to precipitation than potential evapotranspiration the land use analysis illustrates that human induced runoff changes were composed of two aspects 1 the increased proportion of woodland and decreased ratio of farmland reduced runoff 2 the increased percentage of town and country land increased runoff the former influence was relatively limited compared to the latter as well as the climate change graphical abstract ga1 keywords climate change human activities runoff qiantang river basin land uses data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction the past several decades have witnessed the increasing intensity and frequency of extreme meteorological and hydrological extreme events due to climate change worldwide solomon et al 2007 xu et al 2012 klasic et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 human influence on the climate system is now detected with greater certainty the runoff variation which is largely dependent on the combined effect of climate change and human activities plays an important role in hydrological cycle and water resources system milly et al 2005 xu et al 2013 ahn and merwade 2014 jiang et al 2015 dey and mishra 2017 climate change causes the variations of temperature precipitation and other factors so as to affect the hydrological runoff process while human activities mainly cause the change of underlying surface so as to influence the runoff generation mechanism dong et al 2012 the substantial increase in runoff may result in flood disasters and the continuous downward trend in runoff may lead to a shortage of water resources both of which will induce serious social and ecological issues therefore an enhanced understanding of separating the impacts related to climate change and human activities are desperately needed in order to take efficient actions to maintain the relative balance of water resources and improve the abilities of dealing with climate issues great efforts have been paid by researchers to investigate the influences on hydrology some studies focus on only one factor ignoring the comprehensive impact of climate change and human activities setegn et al 2011 xu et al 2013 bian et al 2021 other previous studies using data contrastive analysis do not propose an explicit method to quantitatively separate the contribution of the two drivers yang et al 2004 guo et al 2008 recently studies have attempted to quantify the contribution rate of climate change and human activities miao et al 2011 ye et al 2013 zhao et al 2014 liu et al 2017 2019 xie et al 2019 tang et al in preparation generally the methods can be divided into three categories empirical statistics hydrological simulation and elasticity based methods wu et al 2017 huang et al 2020 empirical statistics usually form a relationship between runoff and precipitation based on the long term historical hydro meteorological data zhao et al 2015 applied a linear regression method to construct the annual water discharge in response to climate change in the yangtze river indicating 72 and 28 contribution of climate change and human activities to water discharge reduction from 1970 to 2010 they extended their research by double mass curve method for further investigate on attribution of the decreasing trend on water discharge and sediment load of tributaries in this area zhao et al 2017 empirical statistics method requires long time hydro meteorological observations and the existing studies reflected that it tends to be more suitable at a large regional scale miao et al 2011 kong et al 2016 and its accuracy is largely affected by the reconstructed regression equation for the baseline period wu et al 2017 hydrological model estimates the climate induced effects on runoff variation by comparing simulations driven by different climate variable values zhao and tao 2017 used the variable infiltration capacity vic model and long term runoff observation to attribute the runoff change to climate change and human activities in seven typical catchments across china from 1961 to 2014 indicating more contributions by human activities to runoff change after 2000 tang et al 2021 applied soil and water assessment tool swat model in lancang river basin showing the reduction in the streamflow in june and november was mainly caused by decreased precipitation and increased evapotranspiration while the changes in the streamflow in other months were mainly due to human activities hydrological simulation is able to describe the physical processes to a certain extent and is a convincing method for small time scales such as month or day but it is the most difficult method that requires sufficient hydrological data and involves large uncertainties in determining parameter guo et al 2015 zhu et al 2016 which limits its application in ungauged basin elasticity based methods evaluate the climate change effects on runoff by elasticities in meteorological factors sankarasubramanian et al 2001 proposed a nonparametric method to obtain climate elasticity from data and a more physically based method integrates the water balance equation with the budyko hypothesis tang and wang 2021 proposed an attribution approach based on budyko framework and applied it to six sub basins in mekong river basin indicating that the observed streamflow decadal changes are mostly due to anthropogenic activities with some decadal contributions from changes in precipitation cheng et al 2019 used multiple hydrologic metrics and the budyko equation to study the yangtze river showing the joint effects of human activities and climate change varied among the river reaches in the different decades the latter method based on water balance has advantage in reducing uncertainties on large time scales guo et al 2015 besides many studies have reported different kinds of improved version of budyko based method which facility the development of quantitative contribution assessment of climate change and human activities to runoff zhou et al 2015 2016 yang et al 2020 china has suffered a lot from the water related natural disasters such as flooding or water shortage researches have investigated some major rivers and northern china areas zhang et al 2011 jiang et al 2015 yuan et al 2016 wu et al 2017 huang et al 2020 ning et al 2016 xue et al 2021 interestingly majority of these areas feature a downward trend of runoff which maybe the result of human activities such as reservoir construction water consumption and land use land cover change in recent years the frequency of extreme hydrological events increases in south east china as well qiu 2010 the qiantang river basin a typical catchment in southeast coast of china different from other catchments it has three sub basins and two of which are located in the upper stream that are respectively its north source and south source this area often suffers from many disasters such as typhoon flooding and drought wen et al 2006 that attracts more and more attentions it is therefore of great importance to detect the potential impacts on these hydrological events the existing studies are seldom related to the attribution of runoff variation xu et al 2013 analysed the impact of climate change on precipitation potential evapotranspiraton and river runoff in a sub basin of upper reaches of qiantang river basin by swat method at the time scale of month but they did not separate the human induced effects and the time scale is small in this study we aim to evaluate and compare the quantitative contributions of the climate change and human activities to the runoff variation in both upper stream sources of qiantang river basin the results could provide a scientific basis for monitoring and preventing water related disaster and have an important reference value for sustainable development of water resources and management decisions the paper is organized as follows first data and methods will be introduced including the introduction of study area data sources and the way of quantifying the contributions of climate change and human activities then the descriptions of results are presented involving the determination of baseline period and variation periods and attribution of runoff variation in the north and south sources of qiantang river basin it is followed by the comparison of the two sources and the discussion of potential causes finally the conclusion is given 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the qiantang river is located in the east of china the upstream of the river has north and south sources that both originate in xiuning county anhui province the north source xin an river with an elevation of about 1350 m flows through anhui and zhejiang provinces and into the xin an river reservoir xin an river is a mountain stream river with the trunk length of 359 km and basin area of about 11 700 km2 the south source that lies in majin river upper stream of lan river has an altitude of 810 m the length of main stream of lan river is about 303 km and the catchment area is about 19 350 km2 xin an river and lan river converge in jiande and flow into fuchun river passing through hangzhou city before flowing into the east china sea which is the downstream of qiantang river this paper studies the main sub basins of upper stream qiantang river basin including xin an river basin north source and lan river basin south source dominated by a sub tropical humid monsoon climate this area has abundant precipitation and high temperature in summer but is rainless and cold in winter due to the geographical differences precipitation distributes unevenly for example the average annual rainfall from 1970 to 2019 at huangshan and dongyang stations is 2395 6 and 1421 9 mm respectively fig 1 tables 1 and 2 show the location of the study area and the information of hydrological and meteorological stations 2 2 data long time series of daily runoff data from 1970 to 2019 of the xin anjiang and yuankou hydrological stations for the north source xin an river basin and the lanxi hydrological station for the south source lan river basin are provided by zhejiang provincial hydrology bureau contemporaneous daily meteorological data at eight meteorological stations including precipitation actual evapotranspiration temperature sunshine duration relative humidity wind speed atmospheric pressure maximum and minimum air temperature is obtained from the national meteorological data centre of china meteorological administration http data cma cn land use information can be got in the resource and environment science and data centre chinese academy of sciences https www resdc cn 2 3 methods 2 3 1 definition of baseline period baseline period determination is an important step to analyse the contribution of climate change and human activities to runoff the most commonly used methods are human designed method and abrupt change method wu et al 2017 the former method selects an early period of time as a baseline period during which the anthropogenic effect is assumed to be tiny miao et al 2011 xu 2007 the standard of limited human effect is hard to be defined and it relies much on subjective judgment that inevitably increases the uncertainty and unreliability on the final results the latter method is based on the long term hydrological data using statistical techniques to evaluate the abrupt change points liang et al 2015 li et al 2007 these techniques include mann kendall test huang et al 2020 pettitt test liang et al 2015 moving t test etc then the abrupt change points divide the long hydrological series into a baseline period e g pre change period and the variation periods e g post change periods the abrupt change method is suggested to be used for its statistical basis but one abrupt change testing may not be accurate thus we used multiple techniques to find the intersection 2 3 2 quantifying contributions of climate change and human activities the total annual mean runoff variations during a period time in a given river basin can be represented by the differences of annual mean runoff between the baseline period and the variation periods which reads 1 δ q t o t a l q variaton q baseline where δ q t o t a l is the total change in annual mean runoff and q variation and q baseline are the annual mean runoff during the variation period and the baseline period respectively it is well recognized that the runoff processing is impacted by both climatic and anthropogenic factors thus the combined effects on runoff variation due to climate change and human activities also lead to the total change in annual mean runoff and their relative contributions in percentage can be written as 2 δ q t o t a l δ q climate δ q human 3 μ climate δ q climate δ q t o t a l 100 4 μ human δ q human δ q t o t a l 100 where δ q climate and δ q human are the changes in annual mean runoff due to climate change and human activities and μ climate and μ human are the percentage contributions of climate change and human activities to the total runoff variations respectively δ q t o t a l can be easily assessed by the annual mean runoff during baseline period and variation periods as long as the abrupt change points are determined to separate the impacts of climate change and human activities on runoff changes we applied the budyko based method to evaluate the runoff changes by climate change and then the anthropogenic contribution can be obtained 2 3 3 budyko based methods the long term water balance equation is the foundation of budyko hypothesis 5 q p e δ s where q is the runoff p is the precipitation e is the actual evapotranspiration and δ s is the variation of the basin water storage that can be assumed to be zero over a relatively long period of time e g 5 10 years dingman 2002 runoff can be modeled as a function of climate factors i e precipitation and potential evapotranspiration and catchment features 6 q f p e 0 c where e 0 is the potential evapotranspiration that is calculated by the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 and c is the comprehensive impact of catchment factors on runoff which is assumed to be caused by human activities then the varied runoff due to climate change can be expressed as 7 δ q climate q p δ p q e 0 δ e 0 where δ q δ p and δ e 0 are the changes of runoff precipitation and potential evapotranspiration respectively introducing the climate elasticity of runoff ε 8 ε q q x x where x is the climate factors i e precipitation and potential evapotranspiration eq 7 can be rewritten as 9 δ q climate ε p δ p p ε e 0 δ e 0 e 0 q based on budyko hypothesis the actual evapotranspiration is mainly controlled by available water and energy the ratio of actual evapotranspiration to precipitation is a function of dryness index φ e 0 p which reads 10 e p f φ combined with eq 5 and eq 10 eq 8 for precipitation and potential evapotranspiration can be calculated as 11 ε p 1 φ f φ 1 f φ 12 ε e 0 φ f φ 1 f φ where f φ is derived function of f φ and it can be found ε p ε e 0 1 the key point to estimate the climate elasticities is how to determine the function f φ a lot of efforts have been made by researchers and we applied six popular functions for comprehensively comparison shown in table 3 3 results 3 1 hydro meteorological data analysis xin an river and shouchang river controlled by xin anjiang and yuankou stations converged together and flowed out of xin an river basin so we used hydrological data of both xin anjiang and yuankou stations to investigate the runoff processing of the north source catchment lanxi was the final gauge station of lan river basin and was used to analyse the runoff data in south source catchment in order to get more convincing results we combined abrupt change techniques of mann kendall test m k test pettitt test and moving t test to distinguish the baseline period and variation periods in two sub basins of qiantang river basin figs 2 and 3 show the abrupt change points assessed by different methods for the north source and south source respectively and they were summarized in table 4 several intersections were calculated using m k test which needed other methods for further detection for the north source uf value decreased to negative after the crossover point 1999 in m k test fig 2 a ut value was over the positive 0 05 significant level fig 2 b2 and t value was over the positive 0 01 significant level in 1999 fig 2 c2 which illustrated that the runoff experienced a decreased change after this year although there was no intersection point in 2009 by m k test the other two methods both indicated an increased change in this year fig 2 b1 and c1 for lan river basin uf value increased to positive after the crossover points 1988 and 2009 in m k test fig 3 a ut value was below the negative 0 05 significant level in 1988 fig 3 b and t value was below the negative 0 01 significant level in 2009 fig 3 c which illustrated that the runoff had two increased changes in both 1988 and 2009 overall the baseline period of north source of qiantang river basin was 1970 1998 and the variation periods were 1999 2008 and 2009 2019 the south source of qiantang river basin had a baseline period from 1970 to1987 and two variation periods from 1988 to 2008 and from 2009 to 2019 interestingly the north source had longer baseline period than south source and they both shared an increased variation period of 2009 2019 here baseline period is abbreviated as bp the first and second variation periods are abbreviated as vp1 and vp2 respectively fig 4 compares the different periods of runoff and meteorological factors in north and south source of qiantang river basin the annual meteorological factors for each source basin were calculated using thiessen polygons method to divide each basin into several sections according to the meteorological stations and spatially interpolate the annual precipitation temperature and evapotranspiration and potential evapotranspiration during the period of 1970 2019 fig 4 a1 and a2 show the annual mean runoff of the two sources during the study period were around 900 mm which were 915 mm and 877 mm for north source and south source respectively the runoff in north source witnessed a decrease before increasing from 2009 while it continued to increase in south source the results agreed with the analysis of the abrupt change tests fig 4 b1 and b2 illustrate the precipitation of the two sources over the years the precipitation in north source during bp was 1748 57 mm it first reduced to 1616 74 mm during vp1 and then rose to 1887 65 mm during vp2 which was similar with the trend of its runoff despite the continuous increase in the south source it seemed to rise disproportionately with its runoff as shown in fig 4 a2 it can be seen from fig 4 c1 and c2 that the mean temperatures of vp2 for north source and south source were 16 30 and 18 24 which were 0 17 and 0 56 higher than vp1 and 0 95 and 1 27 higher than bp respectively the averaged temperature in the north source was lower than that in south source and both the catchments saw a significant upward trend in temperature due to the background of global warming especially since the 1970 s jones and moberg 2003 the temperature of qiantang river basin also began to rise from 1970 s and increased rapidly from about 1990 it is well recognized that the warming climate would intensify the hydrological cycle process and promote the variation of precipitation and evapotranspiration which contributes to enhancing the frequency of hydrological extreme events and affecting the regional water resources distribution arnell et al 2001 dore 2005 huntington 2006 shaw and riha 2011 mukherji 2022 fig 4 d1 e2 indicate the actual and potential evapotranspiration for the study area although the potential evapotranspiration during vp1 and vp2 changed little compared with bp with relative variation ratio of 2 57 and 1 44 for north source and 0 18 and 1 42 for south source fig 4 e1 e2 the actual evapotranspiration was on the rise as a whole which may result from the increasing temperature 3 2 contributions of climate change and human activities to runoff six budyko based methods were used to analyse the attribution of runoff variation as introduced in 2 3 according to eq 10 and table 3 the parameters m 2 086 and ω 0 584 in fu et al 2007 and zhang et al 2001 were calibrated by precipitation potential evapotranspiration and actual evapotranspiration of north source during baseline period and m 2 420 and ω 0 962 were obtained in the same way for the south source table 5 indicates the influences of climate change and human activities on runoff and fig 5 shows their relative contributions to runoff change table 5 presents the changes in annual mean runoff due to climate change and human activities and their relative percentage contributions estimated by six methods in general these methods showed the similar results of the main influence factor on runoff we averaged the results of the six methods in order to reduce error and obtain a relative more accurate outcome compared to bp the north source experienced a decline in runoff during vp1 144 5 mm and an upward trend during vp2 97 1 mm the contribution of climate change approached 100 during vp1 while the effect of human activities only accounted for 3 16 indicating both the climate change and human activities contributed to the runoff decreasing and the change of runoff at this period was mainly dominated by climate change interestingly during vp2 the contribution of the climate change was over 100 and that of human activities was negative 22 8 which illustrated that the climate induced effect led to the increasing runoff while man induced effect resulted in the declined runoff during study periods in north source the climate change was the main driver of runoff variation and human activities contributed to the decreased runoff on the whole in the south source the runoff continued to grow the percentage contribution of climate change was 20 20 during vp1 and slightly increased to 36 19 during vp2 while human activities contributed 79 80 and 63 81 of runoff increase in vp1 and vp2 respectively during study periods in south source the human caused factor was the main driver of runoff variation and both the climate change and human activities contributed to the upward trend of runoff fig 5 compares attribution of changes in runoff in north and south sources during variation periods the total contribution of climate and human activities should be 100 the positive or negative values in percentage means whether the climate change or human activities contributed in the same trend as the runoff change during vp1 in north source both the climate change and human activities resulted in the runoff decreased so their contributions to runoff change at this period were positive during vp2 a higher percentage of climate contribution north source 122 28 illustrated that the climate induced effect played a dominate role on runoff increasing while human induced effect led to runoff decline which was opposite to the runoff variation trend in the south source runoff changing was mainly dependent on human activities both of the factors promoted the runoff increasing during the variation periods interestingly the climate induced effect seemed to increase in both north and south sources during vp2 4 discussion 4 1 sensitivity analysis one of the key points to analyse the attribution of runoff changes is the determination of the varied runoff due to climate change and the runoff variation due to human activities can be readily obtained by eq 2 as shown in eq 9 the two main meteorological factors that affect the runoff change due to climate are precipitation and potential evapotranspiration in order to investigate how the runoff responds to the two meteorological factors sensitivity analysis was carried out for variation periods in the north and south sources fig 6 shows that the runoff varies with the change rate of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration when they are tuned by 30 based on the averaged values in table 5 it can be seen that the runoff change is more sensitive to precipitation than the potential evapotranspiration the slopes of runoff change rate lines reflect the relative ratio of potential evapotranspiration impact to precipitation effect the steeper the line is the greater the influence of rainfall is than that of potential evapotranspiration it helps to analyse the influence of changed climate factors on the runoff variation which provides a potential method to predict future runoff trend according to climate factors 4 2 land use analysis it is interesting to investigate the changes in runoff and the potential causes that led to the differences between north and south sources it is well known that the underlying surface would directly affect the runoff process we analysed the land uses in both north and south sources at various times hoping to explain the phenomena shown in results fig 7 presents the proportions of five kinds of land uses in north and south sources in several years from 1980 to 2018 and its corresponding time periods i e bp vp1 and vp2 in north south the land uses were relative stable during bp as shown in 1980 and 1990 with about two thirds woodland and a very small amount of town and country land during vp1 represented by 2000 in fig 7 a prominent decline in farmland from 16 7 in 1990 to 9 2 in 2000 and an obvious increase in woodland from 69 1 in 1990 to 78 in 2000 were observed in 1999 zhejiang province launched a pilot project of ecological public welfare forest construction in 21 river source counties and key forest counties and lots of the pilots were located in the north source on the basis of the pilot the implementation plan of returning farmland to forest in the whole province was formulated so the woodland replaced some part of farmland and increased to over 77 of the land use in north source since 2000 it is well recognized that forest vegetation has the function of water conservation besides the direct effect of precipitation on the runoff decrease at vp1 the human activities of returning farmland to forest might also contribute to the reduced runoff moreover during vp2 the percentage contribution of climate change to the increasing runoff was over 100 and human induced effect was negative which might also be due to the continuous forest construction effect the land uses of north source in 2000 representing vp1 and 1980 representing bp in fig 7 illustrate that when other kinds of land uses remained approximately invariant the increase of woodland and farmland helped to conserve soil and water and led to runoff decrease but the influence was relatively limited compared to climate induced effect which dominated the runoff change in the north source ns in fig 5 in the south source the woodland made up over half of the land use and the town and country land was the least in bp similar to the change of north source there was an upward trend in woodland proportion in 2000 which might result from forest construction conducted in the whole zhejiang province the increase of woodland was supposed to reduce runoff but the increase rate was too smaller that its effect was overlooked by the increase of town and country land the proportion of town and country land grew only 0 3 before 2000 but an abrupt increase was spotted in 2010 rising to the third place of all the land uses since then this kind of land use has seen a steady growth the change in town and country land directly reflected the increase in impervious surface area by human activities such as urbanization construction which promoted the runoff increasing and might be one of the possible reasons that the runoff change in south source was dominated by human activities during variation periods it is noted that the continuous increasing runoff in the south source is a latent danger for flood disaster the development of urbanization needs more and more town and country land that expose more impervious surface people would be at greater risks during flood season especially this area is easily attacked by typhoon due to its location necessary measures may be demanded another point illustrated by fig 7 is that the water areas in two sources were steady and the water area in north source was about more than 5 times that of south source owing to xin anjiang reservoir in the north source large area of water helped to attemperation to some extent so both the temperature and its variation range in the north source was smaller than the south source fig 4 c1 and c2 in this paper the human induce effects are analysed by land uses changes but in fact there may have other ways that human activities affect the runoff further studies are demanded to quantitatively investigate more possible human activities besides the climate change and human activities are not completely independent to each other how to quantitatively describe the relationship between the two factors and separate the impacts of each part more accurately are worthy to be studied 5 conclusion qiantang river basin has north and south sources in its upper reaches divided into two sub basin named xin an river basin and lan river basin long time series of daily hydrological and meteorological data from 1970 to 2019 were used and six budyko based methods were applied to detect and compare the hydrological response to climate change and human activities in the two sources the different results between north and south sources were discussed our main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 combining the multiplied abrupt change testing methods the baseline period of the north source and south source were 1970 1998 and 1970 1987 two variation periods were spotted the first variation periods were 1999 2008 and 1988 2008 for the north source and south source respectively and they shared the same second variation period from 2009 to 2019 2 the annual mean runoff of north source witnessed a decrease in vp1 before it increased from the beginning of vp2 while it continued to increase in south source the precipitation had the same changing tendency with its runoff during study period in general but the change range was not necessarily proportional the average temperature in both sources saw a significant upward trend the actual evapotranspiration was on the rise as a whole and the potential evapotranspiration changed inapparently 3 five functions based on budyko based method were applied to compare the attribution of changes in runoff in north and south sources during variation periods the climate change dominated the runoff variation in the north source during variation period while it was human activities that was the main driver for south source the human induced effect contributed to runoff decline in the north source while it led to the runoff increasing in the south source 4 sensitivity analysis was carried out to investigate the response of runoff due to climate to the precipitation and potential evapotranspiration it shows that the runoff change is more sensitive to precipitation than the potential evapotranspiration 5 land uses in the two sources at various times were investigated it illustrated that human induced runoff change were composed of two aspects 1 increased proportion of woodland and decreased ratio of farmland that reduced runoff 2 increased percentage of town and country land that promoted runoff the former influence was relatively limited compared to the latter as well as the climate change necessary measures are demanded to weaken the human induced impact on runoff increasing in south source so as to reduce the possible flood risks credit authorship

7803,study region north and south carolina usa study focus intense precipitation poses risks to life and property its frequency can change in response to global scale drivers but its spatial expression can vary seasonally and regionally and be dependent on how it is measured and what analysis period is used we investigate forty four historical stations from the u s historical climatology network ushcn across north and south carolina to determine trends in the pluviometric regime defined by the expert team on climate change detection and indices etccdi new hydrological insights for the region most of the stations in this area do not display consistent statistically significant trends across the suite of etccdi measures of precipitation amount frequency and intensity in addition the direction spatial patterns and cross seasonal results are not consistent for the small number of stations that do show a trend in annual or seasonal precipitation totals a third of stations have a statistically significant increasing trend in the annual number of light rain days these generally match those with a statistically significant trend in wet days relatively few stations typically around 10 per cent have statistically significant trends in precipitation intensity measures notable exceptions include 2 and 5 day fall maximum precipitation values our findings contribute to a broader literature regarding trends in the southeastern united states seus and have significant relevance in adaptation planning that seeks to understand the relative contribution of multiple causes

kunkel et al 2020a b tabari 2020 in the southeastern united states seus moisture content controls on precipitation intensity have been generally consistent with the cc relationship easterling et al 2013 ivancic and shaw 2016 however as in other regions precipitation rates respond in a complex way dependent on moisture availability but also on stability changes storm dynamics and regional to local geography zhang et al 2017 seus storm systems vary seasonally and geographic features such as the proximity to warm water bodies and orography strongly influence heavy precipitation events in the cool season heavy precipitation is typically caused by mid latitude cyclones or associated fronts their frequency and magnitude is influenced by el niño southern oscillation enso phase ropelewski

knight and davis 2009 konrad and perry 2009 kunkel et al 2012 skeeter et al 2018 this complexity could lead to large spatial variations in precipitation scaling across the seus in addition to the complexity of causation the very measure of precipitation intensity presents challenges pendergrass 2018 while a variety of standards are recognized zhang et al 2011a alexander et al 2006 2019 only a few previous studies considered a wide suite of metrics across long time frames such as those documented here specifically the investigation presented herein is to our knowledge unprecedented in the seus with respect to record length number of stations and number of precipitation measures prior research documenting the nature of precipitation intensity changes in the seus reveals the challenges associated with its measurement and shows how choice of metric e g measures of precipitation frequency duration or intensity analysis period spatial extent and season can influence results bishop et al 2019 brown et al 2019 powell and keim 2015 skeeter et al 2018 kam et al 2014 diem 2013 several findings emerge from this work first in the post world war ii era precipitation intensity increased in many parts of the southeast for example powell and keim 2015 show 1948 2012 increases in several of the expert team on climate change detection and indices etccdi for precipitation intensity alexander et al 2006 kunkel et al 2020a document increases from 1949 to 2016 in 1 to 5 day accumulation for events with an estimated 1 to 5 year recurrence interval easterling et al 2017 show a 49 regional increase in the number of 5 year 2 day precipitation events and a 27 increase in 99th percentile events from 1958 to 2016 second the results for trends extending from the early 20th century are less definitive using 1901 2016 data easterling et al 2017 found a 16 increase in the 1 day precipitation maxima expected every five years and a 58 increase in the number of 5 year 2 day events by contrast kunkel et al 2012 found no increasing trend in daily extremes for 1 in 5 year events in the southeast using 1908 2009 data and subdividing trends by storm type similarly bonnin et al 2011 found that the magnitude of southeast precipitation intensity trends from 1908 2007 was small particularly as measured against interannual and interdecadal variability third results differ across seasons with the most pronounced increases observed in autumn easterling et al 2017 park williams et al 2017 skeeter et al 2018 fourth precipitation intensity trends vary spatially across the region in particular there are many stations in north and south carolina with no precipitation intensity trend or with smaller trends than stations further north or west or when compared against results aggregated across the seus powell and keim 2015 brown et al 2019 skeeter et al 2018 brown et al 2020 kunkel et al 2020a this study explores the carolinas anomaly expanding upon the best aspects of prior work by analyzing as many stations as possible across an extensive time period using a wide suite of metrics related to annual seasonal and monthly precipitation amounts frequency and intensity examining a smaller region allows us to take advantage of a longer record park williams et al 2017 and one that includes some of the geographic features e g orography and coastal proximity that influence heavy precipitation fig 1 in addition the use of a wide range of metrics allows us to explore inter relationships between variables 2 data and methods we used the historical climatology network ushcn daily data set the ushcn is derived predominantly from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa cooperative observer program coop network using sites selected for overall spatial coverage record length data completeness and historical stability noaa 2021 the ushcn is a high quality data set including basic meteorological variables from 1218 observing stations across the united states the period of record varies for each station but all ushcn stations must meet requirements regarding record length percent missing data number of station moves and other changes affecting data homogeneity menne et al 2006 before performing statistical and trend analyses the resulting dataset was subjected to a thorough quality check to identify outliers that could affect the trend analysis to this end the occurrence of record high precipitation in the dataset was carefully cross checked and validated only if the observation was confirmed by records at a nearby station and or relevant metadata e g local or national news daily records from 44 stations in north and south carolina were selected to maximize temporal and spatial coverage tables 1 and 2 each record starts in approximately 1900 two begin in the 1910s most extend to 2019 the earliest ends in 1999 since incomplete years affect trend estimates we filtered out years with more than 30 missing days i e including only those stations with less than 10 of missing daily records powell and keim 2015 tables 1 and 2 summarize period of record geographic coordinates and total number of observations for each station in the two regions our first analysis was designed to identify similarities in precipitation patterns in order to characterize subregions across the geography of the carolinas we selected seven reference stations spread geographically south to north and from the coast to the mountains and with relatively complete records asheville nc conway sc effingham sc hendersonville nc randleman nc walhalla sc and willard nc we applied a wilcoxon rank sum test to detect similarity in monthly seasonal and annual precipitation between these reference stations and all remaining stations each station with a p value of 0 05 95th confidence or higher was identified as having no statistically significant difference with the reference station this method yielded three logically organized regions representing coastal central and upstate portions of north and south carolina the main difference between these areas is a higher summer precipitation peak near the ocean a winter peak in the upstate and overall lower values in the central inner coastal plain and piedmont region for precipitation intensity duration and frequency we used the 10 etccdi core precipitation measures alexander et al 2007 zhang et al 2011b adding a few others following definitions specified below because changes in precipitation vary by season easterling et al 2017 we conduct our analysis seasonally using the following standard spring march 1 may 31 summer june 1 august 31 fall september 1 november 30 and winter december 1 february 28 29 we calculated each index as follows 2 0 1 rx1day seasonal maximum

rainfall frequency we employ the mann kendall trend test widely used in climatological analysis to detect trends wilks 2019 the magnitude of each time series trend was determined using sen s slope test atta ur and muhammad 2017 r package trend version 1 1 4 pohlert 2020 was used to perform mann kendall and sen s slope tests the version of the mann kendall test implemented in this package works only on complete time series i e without missing data which was ensured by the removal of the incomplete years as described above 3 results and discussion eight of forty four stations show a significant trend in total annual precipitation six of these show an increasing trend and are mostly located in the coastal region two with decreasing trends are found in the central region fig 2 likewise most stations show no trend in seasonal precipitation totals and in general there is no overlap between the detection of seasonal and annual trends fig 3 only three stations showed a trend in spring two decreasing one increasing five significant decreasing trends in summer were detected in the central region four significant decreasing trends were found in the upstate area during winter only five stations showed a significant increasing trend in autumn contrary to the autumn precipitation increases found by others investigating larger portions of the southeastern united states that excluded the carolinas bishop et al 2019 fifteen stations 34 show a significant increasing trend in the number of light rain 1 10 mm days they are scattered across the entire study area fig 4 four stations also widely scattered show a significant decreasing trend in light rain days the stations showing a significant trend in light rain nearly match the stations that show a significant trend in the number of wet days fig 5 these results echo those showing large spatial variability in observed precipitation intensity e g qian et al 2010 and suggesting compensation across the precipitation distribution at the global scale e g thackeray et al 2018 nine stations have a significant decrease in medium rain 10 20 mm events only clemson sc shows a significant increasing trend heavy rain events 20 50 mm significantly decreased at five stations in the coastal plain or piedmont two had an increasing trend days with rainfall amounts exceeding 50 mm very heavy rain increased significantly at four coastal and two central sites and decreased at two upstate sites this last result does not appear related to the frequency of tropical systems in the last two decades but is in agreement with brown et al 2020 who found similar patterns analyzing a broader region in the seus and suggested their potential relation with changes in the frequency of faster moving frontal events or to droughts impacting the area we conducted preliminary analysis for all stations from their initial year through 2000 and again using only 1950 2019 data to test sensitivity to time period both tests revealed only minor differences from the trends for the entire period of record all things being equal the lack of trends in seasonal or annual precipitation combined with a shift in light rain events would decrease flooding risks mean values of the simple precipitation intensity index sdii the ratio of daily precipitation amount on wet days to the number of wet days are typically highest in coastal regions during summer and fall and in the upstate during fall and winter supplementary materials fig 2s we found sdii trends in 23 to 39 of all stations examined depending on season fig 6 these trends are mixed in spring and fall but during summer and particularly winter there is a clear trend of decreasing precipitation intensity as measured by sdii as evidenced by the black circles enclosing the common clusters between the two different indices there is a strong correlation between those stations experiencing this decreased intensity and those that show an increasing trend in the number of light rain days a pattern most clearly seen in winter fig 7 in fall and winter we find a related correlation between increasing trends in wet days and increasing light rain days fig 8 only 11 to 23 of stations exhibited a significant trend in consecutive wet days cwd these trends were dependent on season and typically not of the same sign fig 9 in spring and winter we found a nearly equal number of stations with increasing or decreasing trends while only a fraction of all stations had a significant trend the pattern was more consistent in summer when the number of cwd significantly decreased at ten stations and in fall when it significantly increased at eight stations mean consecutive dry days cdd are greatest in autumn it is also the season with the highest number of stations 41 experiencing decreasing trends fig 10 a clear pattern of decreasing trends albeit at fewer stations also occurs in spring 18 of all stations and winter 20 of all stations by contrast cdd has changed less in summer four stations had increasing trends one had a decreasing trend while the summer decrease in cwd at ten stations conforms to some empirical and modeling results suggesting decreasing duration of rain events powell and keim 2015 giorgi et al 2011 our results in other seasons do not provide such evidence and in fact they are generally opposite to those suggesting longer stretches of dry days giorgi et al 2011 trenberth 2011 our results also differ from those of powell and keim 2015 who found an increase in dry spells in the carolinas our results for individual seasons show decreasing cdd trends in winter spring and fall with only a few stations showing an increase in summer we measured seasonal maximum 1 2 and 5 day precipitation values in order to account for time of observation differences and storms of different duration seasonal maxima for these intervals was greatest across the carolinas in summer and fall for 1 day maxima high values span across the entire area in fall and are more concentrated near the coast in summer at 2 days the highest values are typically near the coast during summer and fall at 5 days the highest values are spread uniformly across the region in summer and fall and more concentrated at higher elevation sites in winter and spring supplementary materials fig 3s 4s 5s few stations had a significant trend in 1 2 and 5 day seasonal maxima typically only 10 of stations had a significant increasing trend about 20 of the stations had a significant increasing trend in 5 day maxima during fall the most of any season and of the three aggregation periods fig 11 such trends have potential impacts on flood risk and for water supply management particularly for river basins where the practice of drawing down some reservoirs in fall could add additional flooding in the coastal plain a handful of stations exhibited decreasing trends mostly in summer or winter there also were very few stations that had significant trends in the 95th percentile of 1 day rainfall accumulation on wet days four stations had increasing trends in spring one in summer two in fall none of these trends was repeated for the same station across different seasons in winter five stations had significant decreasing trends none had a significant increasing trend 4 summary our analysis of century long precipitation records from forty four ushcn stations in the carolinas reveals relatively few consistent and statistically significant trends across the suite of etccdi measures of precipitation amount frequency and intensity for individual stations significant trends in a particular variable were not consistent across seasons and a significant trend found in one variable was often absent in another similar variable e g 95th percentile events vs annual 1 day maxima in addition most trends had little in common spatially one exception includes an increase in light precipitation in fall and winter which was positively correlated with number of wet days and negatively correlated with sdii this correlation presented in fig 8 was investigated using a pearson test with a 95 confidence level this analysis resulted in a statistically significant relationship across all stations with a test statistic of 56 0 confidence intervals 54 0 to 58 1 the same test confirmed statistically significant correlation between light rain and sdii fig 7 respectively we estimated a significant correlation of 83 confidence interval with α 0 05 from 81 4 to 83 3 during autumn between light rain and wet days and a correlation of 78 7 confidence interval from 77 5 to 79 8 between the same indices during winter the lack of trends in precipitation amount or intensity contrasts with previous work examining a broader swath of the southeastern united states that documents regional increases in precipitation intensity karl and knight 1998 easterling et al 2017 kunkel et al 2020b our findings do conform however to those studies that distinguish trends within the region and in particular suggest a more complicated and or less robust signal in the carolinas powell and keim 2015 brown et al 2019 skeeter et al 2018 brown et al 2020 kunkel et al 2020a amidst the subtle and mixed signals of precipitation trends in the carolinas a few conclusions emerge from our analysis first about one third of the stations examined show an increase in light rain this is correlated with an increasing number of wet days and decreasing precipitation intensity as measured by sdii an index that explicitly includes the number of wet days in its ratio while beyond the scope of this paper these findings may be related to changes in atmospheric circulation or aerosol concentration and composition affecting regional cloud processes and rain rates qian et al 2010 second all other measures of precipitation intensity suggest that only a small portion of stations in the carolinas typically 10 or fewer show any significant trend and a few of these are decreasing the most notable exception is an increasing trend in the 2 day 14 of all stations and 5 day 20 of all stations fall maxima precipitation this is also found in at least one other study janssen et al 2016 our detailed look at a relatively small portion of the seus allowed us to investigate a longer time frame more stations and a wider range of precipitation measures than many other studies of the region the long period of record includes a range of interannual and interdecadal variability this was evident in many of the etccdi measures investigated and made trend detection more difficult others have noted the complexity of the seus precipitation record guided by tropical ocean variability linked to the el niño southern oscillation ropelewski and halpert 1986 kiladis and diaz 1989 ropelewski and halpert 1989 internal variability associated with the north atlantic subtropical high sea surface temperatures and other drivers seager et al 2009 hoerling et al 2010 li et al 2012 diem 2013 kam et al 2014 park williams et al 2017 ferreira and rickenbach 2021 nieto ferreira and rickenbach 2020 as well as interdecadal modulations like the atlantic multidecadal oscillation enfield et al 2001 gregersen et al 2014 hodgkins et al 2017 given that some studies have shown trends in the region for shorter periods our results suggest that such trends could depend on record length future work could address this issue directly one limitation of the long time series is that data sparsity restricts thorough investigation into thermodynamic or dynamic drivers that might influence trends future analysis could investigate statistical relationships between precipitation variability and longer term indices of enso and the amo our analysis considering a longer time frame

7803,study region north and south carolina usa study focus intense precipitation poses risks to life and property its frequency can change in response to global scale drivers but its spatial expression can vary seasonally and regionally and be dependent on how it is measured and what analysis period is used we investigate forty four historical stations from the u s historical climatology network ushcn across north and south carolina to determine trends in the pluviometric regime defined by the expert team on climate change detection and indices etccdi new hydrological insights for the region most of the stations in this area do not display consistent statistically significant trends across the suite of etccdi measures of precipitation amount frequency and intensity in addition the direction spatial patterns and cross seasonal results are not consistent for the small number of stations that do show a trend in annual or seasonal precipitation totals a third of stations have a statistically significant increasing trend in the annual number of light rain days these generally match those with a statistically significant trend in wet days relatively few stations typically around 10 per cent have statistically significant trends in precipitation intensity measures notable exceptions include 2 and 5 day fall maximum precipitation values our findings contribute to a broader literature regarding trends in the southeastern united states seus and have significant relevance in adaptation planning that seeks to understand the relative contribution of multiple causes of natural hazards keywords climate change rainfall united states climatology 1 introduction increased precipitation intensity is one of many potential impacts of global climate change one that presents risks to life and property as well as challenges to infrastructure planning and risk disaster management ipcc 2012 as the planet warms atmospheric moisture holding capacity should increase following the clausius clapeyron equation c c at 7 per c trenberth et al 2003 recent research has documented connections between moisture availability and increases in observed precipitation intensity using the empirical record or model simulations at global continental and regional scales o gorman and schneider 2009 fischer and knutti 2015 forestieri et al 2018 huang et al 2017 grabowski 2019 kunkel et al 2020a b tabari 2020 in the southeastern united states seus moisture content controls on precipitation intensity have been generally consistent with the cc relationship easterling et al 2013 ivancic and shaw 2016 however as in other regions precipitation rates respond in a complex way dependent on moisture availability but also on stability changes storm dynamics and regional to local geography zhang et al 2017 seus storm systems vary seasonally and geographic features such as the proximity to warm water bodies and orography strongly influence heavy precipitation events in the cool season heavy precipitation is typically caused by mid latitude cyclones or associated fronts their frequency and magnitude is influenced by el niño southern oscillation enso phase ropelewski and halpert 1986 gershunov and barnett 1998 during the warm season intense precipitation events are typically driven by tropical systems or slow moving convective cells konrad 2001 shepherd et al 2007 knight and davis 2009 konrad and perry 2009 kunkel et al 2012 skeeter et al 2018 this complexity could lead to large spatial variations in precipitation scaling across the seus in addition to the complexity of causation the very measure of precipitation intensity presents challenges pendergrass 2018 while a variety of standards are recognized zhang et al 2011a alexander et al 2006 2019 only a few previous studies considered a wide suite of metrics across long time frames such as those documented here specifically the investigation presented herein is to our knowledge unprecedented in the seus with respect to record length number of stations and number of precipitation measures prior research documenting the nature of precipitation intensity changes in the seus reveals the challenges associated with its measurement and shows how choice of metric e g measures of precipitation frequency duration or intensity analysis period spatial extent and season can influence results bishop et al 2019 brown et al 2019 powell and keim 2015 skeeter et al 2018 kam et al 2014 diem 2013 several findings emerge from this work first in the post world war ii era precipitation intensity increased in many parts of the southeast for example powell and keim 2015 show 1948 2012 increases in several of the expert team on climate change detection and indices etccdi for precipitation intensity alexander et al 2006 kunkel et al 2020a document increases from 1949 to 2016 in 1 to 5 day accumulation for events with an estimated 1 to 5 year recurrence interval easterling et al 2017 show a 49 regional increase in the number of 5 year 2 day precipitation events and a 27 increase in 99th percentile events from 1958 to 2016 second the results for trends extending from the early 20th century are less definitive using 1901 2016 data easterling et al 2017 found a 16 increase in the 1 day precipitation maxima expected every five years and a 58 increase in the number of 5 year 2 day events by contrast kunkel et al 2012 found no increasing trend in daily extremes for 1 in 5 year events in the southeast using 1908 2009 data and subdividing trends by storm type similarly bonnin et al 2011 found that the magnitude of southeast precipitation intensity trends from 1908 2007 was small particularly as measured against interannual and interdecadal variability third results differ across seasons with the most pronounced increases observed in autumn easterling et al 2017 park williams et al 2017 skeeter et al 2018 fourth precipitation intensity trends vary spatially across the region in particular there are many stations in north and south carolina with no precipitation intensity trend or with smaller trends than stations further north or west or when compared against results aggregated across the seus powell and keim 2015 brown et al 2019 skeeter et al 2018 brown et al 2020 kunkel et al 2020a this study explores the carolinas anomaly expanding upon the best aspects of prior work by analyzing as many stations as possible across an extensive time period using a wide suite of metrics related to annual seasonal and monthly precipitation amounts frequency and intensity examining a smaller region allows us to take advantage of a longer record park williams et al 2017 and one that includes some of the geographic features e g orography and coastal proximity that influence heavy precipitation fig 1 in addition the use of a wide range of metrics allows us to explore inter relationships between variables 2 data and methods we used the historical climatology network ushcn daily data set the ushcn is derived predominantly from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa cooperative observer program coop network using sites selected for overall spatial coverage record length data completeness and historical stability noaa 2021 the ushcn is a high quality data set including basic meteorological variables from 1218 observing stations across the united states the period of record varies for each station but all ushcn stations must meet requirements regarding record length percent missing data number of station moves and other changes affecting data homogeneity menne et al 2006 before performing statistical and trend analyses the resulting dataset was subjected to a thorough quality check to identify outliers that could affect the trend analysis to this end the occurrence of record high precipitation in the dataset was carefully cross checked and validated only if the observation was confirmed by records at a nearby station and or relevant metadata e g local or national news daily records from 44 stations in north and south carolina were selected to maximize temporal and spatial coverage tables 1 and 2 each record starts in approximately 1900 two begin in the 1910s most extend to 2019 the earliest ends in 1999 since incomplete years affect trend estimates we filtered out years with more than 30 missing days i e including only those stations with less than 10 of missing daily records powell and keim 2015 tables 1 and 2 summarize period of record geographic coordinates and total number of observations for each station in the two regions our first analysis was designed to identify similarities in precipitation patterns in order to characterize subregions across the geography of the carolinas we selected seven reference stations spread geographically south to north and from the coast to the mountains and with relatively complete records asheville nc conway sc effingham sc hendersonville nc randleman nc walhalla sc and willard nc we applied a wilcoxon rank sum test to detect similarity in monthly seasonal and annual precipitation between these reference stations and all remaining stations each station with a p value of 0 05 95th confidence or higher was identified as having no statistically significant difference with the reference station this method yielded three logically organized regions representing coastal central and upstate portions of north and south carolina the main difference between these areas is a higher summer precipitation peak near the ocean a winter peak in the upstate and overall lower values in the central inner coastal plain and piedmont region for precipitation intensity duration and frequency we used the 10 etccdi core precipitation measures alexander et al 2007 zhang et al 2011b adding a few others following definitions specified below because changes in precipitation vary by season easterling et al 2017 we conduct our analysis seasonally using the following standard spring march 1 may 31 summer june 1 august 31 fall september 1 november 30 and winter december 1 february 28 29 we calculated each index as follows 2 0 1 rx1day seasonal maximum

rainfall frequency we employ the mann kendall trend test widely used in climatological analysis to detect trends wilks 2019 the magnitude of each time series trend was determined using sen s slope test atta ur and muhammad 2017 r package trend version 1 1 4 pohlert 2020 was used to perform mann kendall and sen s slope tests the version of the mann kendall test implemented in this package works only on complete time series i e without missing data which was ensured by the removal of the incomplete years as described above 3 results and discussion eight of forty four stations show a significant trend in total annual precipitation six of these show an increasing trend and are mostly located in the coastal region two with decreasing trends are found in the central region fig 2 likewise most stations show no trend in seasonal precipitation totals and in general there is no overlap between the detection of seasonal and annual trends fig 3 only three stations showed a trend in spring two decreasing one increasing five significant decreasing trends in summer were detected in the central region four significant decreasing trends were found in the upstate area during winter only five stations showed a significant increasing trend in autumn contrary to the autumn precipitation increases found by others investigating larger portions of the southeastern united states that excluded the carolinas bishop et al 2019 fifteen stations 34 show a significant increasing trend in the number of light rain 1 10 mm days they are scattered across the entire study area fig 4 four stations also widely scattered show a significant decreasing trend in light rain days the stations showing a significant trend in light rain nearly match the stations that show a significant trend in the number of wet days fig 5 these results echo those showing large spatial variability in observed precipitation intensity e g qian et al 2010 and suggesting compensation across the precipitation distribution at the global scale e g thackeray et al 2018 nine stations have a significant decrease in medium rain 10 20 mm events only clemson sc shows a significant increasing trend heavy rain events 20 50 mm significantly decreased at five stations in the coastal plain or piedmont two had an increasing trend days with rainfall amounts exceeding 50 mm very heavy rain increased significantly at four coastal and two central sites and decreased at two upstate sites this last result does not appear related to the frequency of tropical systems in the last two decades but is in agreement with brown et al 2020 who found similar patterns analyzing a broader region in the seus and suggested their potential relation with changes in the frequency of faster moving frontal events or to droughts impacting the area we conducted preliminary analysis for all stations from their initial year through 2000 and again using only 1950 2019 data to test sensitivity to time period both tests revealed only minor differences from the trends for the entire period of record all things being equal the lack of trends in seasonal or annual precipitation combined with a shift in light rain events would decrease flooding risks mean values of the simple precipitation intensity index sdii the ratio of daily precipitation amount on wet days to the number of wet days are typically highest in coastal regions during summer and fall and in the upstate during fall and winter supplementary materials fig 2s we found sdii trends in 23 to 39 of all stations examined depending on season fig 6 these trends are mixed in spring and fall but during summer and particularly winter there is a clear trend of decreasing precipitation intensity as measured by sdii as evidenced by the black circles enclosing the common clusters between the two different indices there is a strong correlation between those stations experiencing this decreased intensity and those that show an increasing trend in the number of light rain days a pattern most clearly seen in winter fig 7 in fall and winter we find a related correlation between increasing trends in wet days and increasing light rain days fig 8 only 11 to 23 of stations exhibited a significant trend in consecutive wet days cwd these trends were dependent on season and typically not of the same sign fig 9 in spring and winter we found a nearly equal number of stations with increasing or decreasing trends while only a fraction of all stations had a significant trend the pattern was more consistent in summer when the number of cwd significantly decreased at ten stations and in fall when it significantly increased at eight stations mean consecutive dry days cdd are greatest in autumn it is also the season with the highest number of stations 41 experiencing decreasing trends fig 10 a clear pattern of decreasing trends albeit at fewer stations also occurs in spring 18 of all stations and winter 20 of all stations by contrast cdd has changed less in summer four stations had increasing trends one had a decreasing trend while the summer decrease in cwd at ten stations conforms to some empirical and modeling results suggesting decreasing duration of rain events powell and keim 2015 giorgi et al 2011 our results in other seasons do not provide such evidence and in fact they are generally opposite to those suggesting longer stretches of dry days giorgi et al 2011 trenberth 2011 our results also differ from those of powell and keim 2015 who found an increase in dry spells in the carolinas our results for individual seasons show decreasing cdd trends in winter spring and fall with only a few stations showing an increase in summer we measured seasonal maximum 1 2 and 5 day precipitation values in order to account for time of observation differences and storms of different duration seasonal maxima for these intervals was greatest across the carolinas in summer and fall for 1 day maxima high values span across the entire area in fall and are more concentrated near the coast in summer at 2 days the highest values are typically near the coast during summer and fall at 5 days the highest values are spread uniformly across the region in summer and fall and more concentrated at higher elevation sites in winter and spring supplementary materials fig 3s 4s 5s few stations had a significant trend in 1 2 and 5 day seasonal maxima typically only 10 of stations had a significant increasing trend about 20 of the stations had a significant increasing trend in 5 day maxima during fall the most of any season and of the three aggregation periods fig 11 such trends have potential impacts on flood risk and for water supply management particularly for river basins where the practice of drawing down some reservoirs in fall could add additional flooding in the coastal plain a handful of stations exhibited decreasing trends mostly in summer or winter there also were very few stations that had significant trends in the 95th percentile of 1 day rainfall accumulation on wet days four stations had increasing trends in spring one in summer two in fall none of these trends was repeated for the same station across different seasons in winter five stations had significant decreasing trends none had a significant increasing trend 4 summary our analysis of century long precipitation records from forty four ushcn stations in the carolinas reveals relatively few consistent and statistically significant trends across the suite of etccdi measures of precipitation amount frequency and intensity for individual stations significant trends in a particular variable were not consistent across seasons and a significant trend found in one variable was often absent in another similar variable e g 95th percentile events vs annual 1 day maxima in addition most trends had little in common spatially one exception includes an increase in light precipitation in fall and winter which was positively correlated with number of wet days and negatively correlated with sdii this correlation presented in fig 8 was investigated using a pearson test with a 95 confidence level this analysis resulted in a statistically significant relationship across all stations with a test statistic of 56 0 confidence intervals 54 0 to 58 1 the same test confirmed statistically significant correlation between light rain and sdii fig 7 respectively we estimated a significant correlation of 83 confidence interval with α 0 05 from 81 4 to 83 3 during autumn between light rain and wet days and a correlation of 78 7 confidence interval from 77 5 to 79 8 between the same indices during winter the lack of trends in precipitation amount or intensity contrasts with previous work examining a broader swath of the southeastern united states that documents regional increases in precipitation intensity karl and knight 1998 easterling et al 2017 kunkel et al 2020b our findings do conform however to those studies that distinguish trends within the region and in particular suggest a more complicated and or less robust signal in the carolinas powell and keim 2015 brown et al 2019 skeeter et al 2018 brown et al 2020 kunkel et al 2020a amidst the subtle and mixed signals of precipitation trends in the carolinas a few conclusions emerge from our analysis first about one third of the stations examined show an increase in light rain this is correlated with an increasing number of wet days and decreasing precipitation intensity as measured by sdii an index that explicitly includes the number of wet days in its ratio while beyond the scope of this paper these findings may be related to changes in atmospheric circulation or aerosol concentration and composition affecting regional cloud processes and rain rates qian et al 2010 second all other measures of precipitation intensity suggest that only a small portion of stations in the carolinas typically 10 or fewer show any significant trend and a few of these are decreasing the most notable exception is an increasing trend in the 2 day 14 of all stations and 5 day 20 of all stations fall maxima precipitation this is also found in at least one other study janssen et al 2016 our detailed look at a relatively small portion of the seus allowed us to investigate a longer time frame more stations and a wider range of precipitation measures than many other studies of the region the long period of record includes a range of interannual and interdecadal variability this was evident in many of the etccdi measures investigated and made trend detection more difficult others have noted the complexity of the seus precipitation record guided by tropical ocean variability linked to the el niño southern oscillation ropelewski and halpert 1986 kiladis and diaz 1989 ropelewski and halpert 1989 internal variability associated with the north atlantic subtropical high sea surface temperatures and other drivers seager et al 2009 hoerling et al 2010 li et al 2012 diem 2013 kam et al 2014 park williams et al 2017 ferreira and rickenbach 2021 nieto ferreira and rickenbach 2020 as well as interdecadal modulations like the atlantic multidecadal oscillation enfield et al 2001 gregersen et al 2014 hodgkins et al 2017 given that some studies have shown trends in the region for shorter periods our results suggest that such trends could depend on record length future work could address this issue directly one limitation of the long time series is that data sparsity restricts thorough investigation into thermodynamic or dynamic drivers that might influence trends future analysis could investigate statistical relationships between precipitation variability and longer term indices of enso and the amo our analysis considering a longer time frame more stations and a wider range of measures contributes to a broader understanding of precipitation changes in the carolinas these findings provide a baseline for future climatological investigation but also have relevance for adaptation planning many communities in the carolinas have experienced increased flooding in recent years despite the fact that precipitation trends have been subtle since

7804,study region this study focuses on the upstream sesan river basin in the central highlands of vietnam study focus local land use policies and human activities can significantly affect hydrology and increase the magnitude of erosion and nutrients in downstream areas the effects in terrestrial regions on water quality of the target area were evaluated during the 2000 2018 period using the swat soil and water assessment tool with updated land use conditions following the local policy decisions and agricultural practices in different periods new hydrological insights for the regions this study indicates that the implementation of the local land use policies along with extensive anthropogenic activities has had significant effects on the downstream aquatic environment as compared with the period before the implementation of the land use policies higher annual sediment total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp loadings were found upstream from the poko watershed where range land predominated and in southern and southwestern dakbla watershed where arable land and permanent cropland predominated arable land had the highest proportion of sediment and nutrient loadings into the reach especially in the 2005 2009 period conducting afforestation agricultural expansion and urbanization and in the 2010 2014 period applying crop conversion policy involving a shift from mixed forests to rubber forests understanding the watershed characteristics along with the combination of spatial land use local land use policies and agricultural practices will support the implementation of regional land use and water resources management strategies more comprehensively graphical abstract ga1 keywords land use policies land use changes agricultural practices water resources management hilly areas data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction changes in anthropogenic processes in terrestrial regions could have remarkable effects on the aquatic environment which has diverse and important environmental functions to comprehensively control and reduce the significant effects impacting water quality policies are promulgated on the regional and local scales especially land use policies in asia land use underwent significant changes in a relatively short term period zhao et al 2006 even though land use occurs at the local level land use changes can damage economic environmental and ecological aspects on the local regional global scales if these changes occur indiscriminately zhao et al 2006 these policies require detailed information on the local scale the two most essential factors for land use policies are spatial land use and land use plans organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd 2017 local governments establish specific land use planning to adjust land use conversion under the guidance of the higher levels of government allowing more reasonable plans for the development of an entire region the whole nation organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd 2017 policies concerning water resources and agriculture aspects should be mentioned in the water policy framework with the consideration of all pollutants and polluters at the national and river basin scales mateo sagasta et al 2017 additionally their long term impacts should also be considered holden et al 2015 at present the aspect of long term watershed management has not yet been comprehensively considered in strategies when land use policies are updated it is necessary to have inter ministerial cooperation systems to ensure the coherence of policies mateo sagasta et al 2017 population growth leads to deforestation agricultural expansion and urbanization in recent years these human activities have affected landscapes and downstream water quality in southeast asia agricultural land expansion towards steep slope regions and deforestation for agricultural purposes satisfying the food and feed demand for human beings has led to increased vulnerability in these areas especially intensive farming areas pierret et al 2011 fullen et al 2011 frohlich et al 2013 lin et al 2016 intensive farming in agriculture is one of the better ways by which to achieve growth in the agriculture sector but its impact on water quality is significant holden et al 2015 zeng et al 2018 estimated that approximately 82 billion m2 of highland regions have been developed into croplands in southeast asian countries as a result of human induced changes on the watershed scale impacts on river discharge githui et al 2009 sediment and nutrients smarzyńska and miatkowski 2016 hanief and laursen 2017 have been observed the nutrients cumulating from non point sources of agricultural activities were found to be the primary factors increasing the nutrient loadings to watersheds leading to an accelerated extent of eutrophication in the aquatic environment carpenter et al 1998 somura et al 2012 more than 70 of the delivered nitrogen and phosphorus comes from different sources in agricultural processes to the watersheds yang et al 2018 the sediment yields in agricultural watersheds were much greater than those in areas with non anthropogenic activities with an approximately hundredfold value in hilly terrains stallard 1998 along with a high density of rainfall excess discharge contributes to accelerating surface erosion thereby increasing the sediment loading and nutrient loss deposited downstream especially during the rainy season sidle et al 2006 folliott et al 2013 shi et al 2021 controlling the pollutant discharges from point and non point sources will reduce the nutrient loadings in the watershed without a significant impact on crop productivity jha et al 2007 alexander et al 2008 even though it is undeniable that anthropogenic activities have a great influence on water quality downstream the magnitude of these impacts would be greatly increased if the crop conversion is unsuitable one of the challenges in mountainous areas is that the measured data and the information on pollution sources are limited to evaluating the pollution extent and the water quality monitoring network scattered on the watershed scale thus modeling approaches have been utilized to address these shortcomings and to consider the impacts of local land use policies and anthropogenic activities on water quality issues the soil and water assessment tool swat has been widely applied around the world to assess the impacts of river discharge sediment discharge and pollution loadings from the point and non point sources that impact the water environment in large watershed scales huang et al 2009 abbaspour et al 2015 hanief and laursen 2017 malagó et al 2017 keraga et al 2019 including the central highlands of vietnam vu et al 2012 khoi and thom 2015 the significant impacts of land use changes on hydrology githui et al 2009 li et al 2019 suspended sediment and nutrient loadings brito et al 2019 over a long period were also emphasized by using the single static land use input conditions which are normally applied to a modeling analysis however in the long term evaluation of water resources in a watershed in asian countries this ordinary method cannot comprehensively evaluate the impacts of land use changes occurring in a relatively short term period following local land use policies tram et al 2021 indicated that using multiple land use input conditions with linear interpolation in a simulation could follow the record of land use changes in a watershed and evaluate their impact on water resources better than utilizing the single static land use input conditions in addition to the multiple land use input conditions it is necessary to input information on detailed fertilization in agricultural cultivation the lack of information regarding both the quantity of fertilizer and cultivation timing affects the accuracy of the model s performance chu et al 2004 the impacts of land use policies and human activities on a watershed are dissimilar despite belonging to the same river basin because of differences in climate conditions morphological features and physical processes within each watershed tobin and bennett 2009 piniewski et al 2017 this means that it is necessary to update both the historical land use changes and detailed agricultural practices in a model to improve the accuracy of the model s performance adapted to the local situations in each period thus the main purposes of this study were 1 to evaluate the impacts of different land use policies and agricultural practices on discharge sediment total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp at the dakbla and poko watersheds in different periods on the basis of temporal and spatial distributions 2 to assess the influences of land use policies and anthropogenic activities in each period on the aquatic environment downstream and 3 to determine how to improve the erosion and water quality in the target river basin 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the sesan river basin is known as a transboundary basin of the mekong river the sesan river flows through the kon tum and gia lai provinces in vietnam the poko watershed pkw and dakbla watershed dbw are two main subbasins of the upstream sesan river basin with areas of 3210 km2 in the former and 3507 km2 in the latter as shown in fig 1 the lengths of the poko and dakbla rivers are 121 km and 152 km respectively from the upstream areas these rivers merge to a confluence before flowing to yaly lake downstream yaly lake plays an important role in the upstream sesan river basin it is mostly located in kon tum province occupying 44 5 km2 of the 64 5 km2 total area with an average depth of 48 2 m a length of 38 km and a width of 6 km at its widest point the reservoir capacity is about 1037 million m3 water quality observations started in the lake in 2015 from 2015 to 2019 the water quality of yaly lake was deemed to be completely suitable for tourism aquaculture fishing irrigation and hydropower purposes kon tum provincial department of natural resource and environment ktdonre 2016 2017 2019 with the characteristics of a tropical monsoon climate the rainy season may november and the dry season december april are the two main seasons in this area the average annual precipitation is 1778 mm and 2000 mm while the average annual temperature is 23 7 c and 23 6 c at the dak to and kon tum stations respectively forest areas occupy the highest proportion of the land 52 in the central highlands the water demand for agriculture encompassed 84 and 90 of the total water demand in kon tum and gia lai provinces respectively in 2015 2016 jica 2018 kon tum had the lowest share of agriculture in 2016 among the five provinces in this region because of its poorer soil quality and lower agricultural productivity an expansion of agricultural activities and a shift in cultivation toward the hillslope have been conducted in the target area since 2005 onwards tram et al 2021 according to the 2010 statistical yearbook there was an increasing tendency of agricultural land urban areas and forestry land with values of 39 9 56 6 and 1 7 respectively compared to 2005 from 2010 onward a crop conversion policy that encouraged a move from mixed forests to rubber forests was enacted tram et al 2021 rubber trees predominated accounting for 61 0 433 2 km2 of the total mixed forest area 709 6 km2 in kon tum province kon tum provincial people s committee 2016 rubber trees occupied 23 7 113 9 km2 of the total mixed forest area 479 4 km2 in gia lai province gia lai provincial people s council 2015 according to the 2015 statistical data there was a continuous increase in urban areas by 2 7 whereas the forestry land decreased by a value of 2 7 compared to 2010 due to some areas having inefficient rubber trees a local orchard conversion policy was enacted leading to an increasing number of orchard areas from 2015 onward rising by 5 4 and 19 5 in kon tum and gia lai provinces respectively until 2018 agricultural land and urban areas saw an increasing trend with increases of 28 5 and 1 5 respectively whereas forestland decreased continuously by approximately 4 0 in comparison to 2015 in this study the 2000 2018 period was categorized into four periods 2000 2004 2005 2009 2010 2014 and 2015 2018 on the basis of the changes in local land use policies the 2000 2004 period represented a base period in which no land use policies were applied the remaining periods illustrated the following changes in land use policies and anthropogenic activities 2005 2009 conducting for afforestation agricultural expansion and urbanization 2010 2014 crop conversion policy involving the move from mixed forests to rubber forests and 2015 2018 crop conversion policy involving the move from insufficient rubber forests to orchards 2 2 methods 2 2 1 hydrological modeling 2 2 1 1 swat description swat is a well known physical hydrological model used to predict the impact of land use changes and land management practices on river discharge hanief and laursen 2017 sediment shi and huang 2021 and nutrients epelde et al 2015 donmez et al 2020 over long periods on the river basin scale the hydrological cycle in swat is based on the water balance equation in which surface runoff is estimated through the scs curve number equation as follows 1 q surf r day i a 2 r day i a s where q surf is the accumulated runoff or rainfall excess mmh2o r day is the rainfall depth for the day mmh2o i a is the initial abstractions including surface storage interception and infiltration prior to runoff mmh2o and s is the retention parameter mmh2o sediment loadings are estimated using

considers five different pools of nitrogen with the two pools of nh4 and no3 being the inorganic forms the movement of nitrate occurs mainly in the organic n and nitrate forms the amount of nitrate removed during surface runoff is estimated as follows 3 no 3surf ß no3 conc no3 mobile q surf where no 3surf is the nitrate removed during surface runoff kg n ha ß no3 is the nitrate percolation

partitioning coefficient m3 mg 2 2 1 2 swat application the detailed input data of the model and other necessary local information are described and shown in text s1 and table s1 the watershed was delineated into 32 subbasins in the pkw the model was calibrated from 2000 to 2015 and validated from 2016 to 2018 for river discharge the calibration and validation periods for the remaining variables tn tp no3 n and nh4 n were from 2014 to 2015 and from 2016 and 2018 respectively in the dbw the model was calibrated from 2000 to 2015 and validated from 2016 to 2018 for river discharge and sediment the tn tp no3 n and nh4 n variables were calibrated and validated by the loads in this study after calibration and validation of the model parameter values the impacts on the aquatic environment downstream were evaluated one of the initial necessary processes is to determine the length of the warm up period so as to obtain an optimal state in the hydrological model the rainfall factor significantly affects the time required for the warm up period even if it depends on the structure of the model kim et al 2017 after achieving the optimal status the response of the model is suitable for the realistic conditions leading to the higher accuracy of the model performance the 10 year warm up period was identified as the best choice for our study dak mot station was utilized to calibrate and validate the river discharge and nutrients for the pkw whereas kon tum station was used to calibrate and validate the river discharge and sediment for the dbw a total of 28 sensitivity parameters for river discharge sediment and nutrients were chosen to improve the accuracy of model performance using the sufi 2 algorithm in the swat cup program as shown in table s2 the sensitivity analysis for the model simulation after updating the information regarding land use changes and agricultural practices is also described and illustrated in text s2 and fig s1 2 2 2 land use update module there have been dramatic land use changes in the central highlands especially in the study area in the last five years with the expansion of urbanization and agricultural areas along with deforestation jica 2018 model performance cannot be evaluated in depth when there is a lack of detailed land use changes and land management information zettam et al 2017 updating land use change information through different approaches is important when seeking to improve the accuracy of the model s performance moriasi et al 2019 wagner et al 2019 and aghsaei et al 2020 in this study a method confirmed by tram et al 2021 was used to track the frequent and complicated local land use policies by using r script for the analysis multiple land use maps were developed on the basis of local information and policies reflected by the local land use conditions 2005 2010 2015 and 2018 during the simulation periods as shown in fig 2 during a simulation of the 2000 2018 period three new land use conditions for 2010 2015 and 2018 were updated in the model from 2005 onwards for the 2005 2009 2010 2014 and 2015 2018 simulation periods this r script can support updating land use changes by the linear interpolation method at the chosen time 2 2 3 agricultural practice information information such as the amount of fertilizer per crop and its timing should be updated in the model along with the changes in land use policies because the significant impacts of agricultural practices on the hydrology crop yield and water quality processes have been emphasized arabi et al 2007 srinivasan et al 2010 donmez et al 2020 the agricultural practice information for the timing of planting fertilizing and harvesting was collected from the local government one of the most influential factors of agricultural practices on the environment is crop type and cultivation management along with climate conditions and soil characteristics epelde et al 2015 the three main crops in the target area are rice coffee plants and rubber trees rice is cultivated twice per year as permanent crops coffee beans and rubber latex are normally harvested after 4 years and 6 years of planting the annual fertilization loads for crops range from 8 3 to 73 6 kg n ha year and from 4 2 to 21 2 kg p ha year as described in table 1 coffee plants and rubber trees are the priority permanent crops in the target area because these crops are strategic commodity crop groups with high economic value and great export potential additionally these crops contribute to the greening of barren hills creating jobs reducing the poverty rate and improving the incomes of local people especially ethnic minorities phuc and nghi 2014 tien et al 2015 high quality rubber latex in kon tum and gia lai provinces is exported to many countries because of the significant difference in the net income obtained from annual and perennial crops a dramatic conversion from annual crops to perennial crops in the hillslope areas was conducted in this region jica 2018 2 2 4 model performance evaluation to assess the accuracy of the model s performance three statistical indices the coefficient of determination r 2 the nash sutcliffe index nsi and the percentage bias pbias were used the performance evaluation criteria of variables in the watershed scale were described by moriasi et al 2015 as shown in table s3 5 r 2

variables p i denotes the simulated variables p denotes the average simulated variables and n is the number of existing variables 2 2 5 nutrient load calculation the nutrient load was calculated on the basis of the concentration of water quality variables and the discharge as described in eq 8 8 l t 1 t t 86 4 q t c t where l is the nutrient load kg c t is the daily concentration of water quality variables mg l q t is the daily discharge m3 s and t is the time days 3 results reproducibility of river discharge sediment and nutrient loadings during the 2000 2018 period is described in detail in text s3 additionally the relationship between the observed and simulated daily river discharge sediment tn tp no3 n and nh4 n loadings for pkw and dbw is shown in figs s2 and s3 the statistical evaluations of the model performance using r 2 nsi and pbias are listed in table s4 3 1 the changes in river discharge sediment and nutrient loadings at the outlets pkw and dbw outlets 3 1 1 total annual river discharge sediment and nutrient loadings at the outlets the total annual river discharge sediment tn and tp loadings at the two outlets from 2000 to 2018 are shown in fig 3 additionally the summary of the highest and lowest values during the simulation periods is shown in table s5 the fluctuation of the total annual loadings at the two outlets was different in the four periods based on the changes in local land use policies and anthropogenic activities the highest total annual loadings were found in 2013 for river discharge sediment tn and tp the year 2013 belonged to the 2010 2014 period in which a crop conversion policy involving a move from mixed forests to rubber forests was applied and agricultural activities were changed in 2013 the total annual river discharge reached the maximum value of 2115 6 m3 s in the pkw which was 7 8 higher than in the dbw similar to the river discharge the total annual sediment loading in the pkw reached the highest value of 692 8 thousand tons in 2013 which was 24 0 lower than in the dbw in both watersheds the maximum values of tn were found in 2013 with a value of 33 1 thousand tons in the pkw which was 13 0 smaller than in the dbw in addition tp reached the highest value of 9 6 thousand tons in the pkw which was 6 7 lower than in the dbw even though the river discharge in the pkw was slightly higher than that in the dbw in 2013 the large number of agricultural practices conducted in the dbw led to the higher annual sediment tn and tp loadings from this watershed in comparison to the pkw 3 1 2 average monthly total river discharge sediment and nutrient loadings at the pkw and dbw outlets during the target period the average monthly total river discharge and sediment loadings were the highest in september in both watersheds fig 4 the highest river discharges were 326 7 m3 s for the pkw and 256 8 m3 s for the dbw additionally the highest sediment loadings were 102 8 and 94 9 thousand tons in the pkw and dbw respectively the river discharge and sediment values in the pkw were higher than in the dbw by 27 2 and 8 3 respectively the maximum tn values were reached in august at 4 7 and 4 1 thousand tons in the pkw and dbw similar to tn the highest tp values of the pkw and dbw were 1 5 and 1 1 thousand tons respectively it is clear that the tn and tp values in the pkw were higher than those in the dbw by 14 6 and 36 4 respectively 3 1 3 total cumulative sediment tn and tp loadings at the pkw and dbw outlets in the 2000 2004 period many agricultural practices were conducted in the pkw instead of in the dbw consequently the total cumulative values in the dbw were moderately lower than those in the pkw by 15 3 268 4 thousand tons for sediment 3 9 3 0 thousand tons for tn and 20 6 5 2 thousand tons for tp as shown in fig 5 in the 2005 2009 period the total cumulation in the dbw increased significantly as compared to the previous period these cumulative values in the dbw exceeded those in the pkw by 42 9 985 7 thousand tons for sediment 33 3 31 7 thousand tons for tn and 10 4 3 6 thousand tons for tp during the 2010 2014 period the total cumulative values in the pkw were lower by 12 8 15 9 and 7 4 for sediment tn and tp respectively as compared to those in the dbw in the remaining period from 2015 to 2018 the total cumulative sediment tn and tp values in the pkw were lower than those in the dbw by 105 0 97 2 and 30 4 respectively generally the two periods 2005 2009 and 2015 2018 showed drastic differences in the two watersheds during the whole target period 3 2 spatial distribution of annual sediment tn and tp loadings in each subbasin in the four periods the spatial distribution of annual sediment tn and tp loadings is illustrated in fig 6 to allow for a better understanding of their characteristics according to differences in land use soil and slope at the subbasin scale for sediment loading the annual value ranged from 41 4 tons km2 in subbasin 9 2010 2014 to 666 7 tons km2 in subbasin 23 2005 2009 in subbasin 23 arable land and permanent cropland predominated accounting for 74 0 of the total land and approximately 50 8 of this area had a slope greater than 15 compared with the 2005 2009 period the maximum annual values in the remaining three periods were lower by 75 2000 2004 19 7 2010 2014 and 4 2 2015 2018 in the 2005 2009 period the annual sediment loading was higher than in the eastern and southern areas in subbasin 32 arable land and permanent cropland predominated accounting for 50 of the total land and approximately 45 8 of this area had a slope greater than 15 the annual loading increased slightly in the northwestern southwestern and eastern directions whereas there was a dramatic decrease in the northeastern and southern areas in the 2010 2014 period in the 2015 2018 period the annual value exhibited a significant decline in the northwestern area while there was an increasing tendency in the northeastern and southern parts for the tn loading the lowest annual value was 1 4 tons km2 in subbasin 9 in the 2010 2014 period while the highest value was 22 7 tons km2 in subbasin 23 in the 2005 2009 period in the 2005 2009 period the maximum annual tn loadings were higher than those in the 2000 2004 2010 2014 and 2015 2018 periods by 35 5 14 6 and 7 8 respectively compared to that in the 2000 2004 period the annual tn loading increased moderately in the southern and northeastern areas whereas a dramatic decrease was seen in the northwestern and western areas in the 2005 2009 period there was a slight increase in the northwestern southwestern and eastern areas while a significant decrease was observed in the northeastern and southern areas from 2010 to 2014 moreover the tn loading increased in the southwestern area and slightly decreased in the northwestern area in the 2015 2018 period for the tp loading the annual value ranged from 1 1 tons km2 subbasin 9 for the 2010 2014 period to 4 1 tons km2 subbasin 23 for the 2005 2009 period compared with the 2005 2009 period the maximum annual tp loadings were lower than in the remaining three periods by 30 3 2000 2004 20 7 2010 2014 and 7 6 2015 2018 there was a similar tendency to sediment load during the whole period 3 3 the changes in sediment tn and tp loadings for each land use during the four periods forest represented the highest percentage of land use accounting for more than 52 of the study area across all four periods fig 7 permanent cropland had the lowest proportion of annual sediment loading and the smallest total area while the highest proportion of sediment loading was found in arable land despite its area ranging from 14 0 to 15 9 of the total during the four periods from 2005 2009 extensive agricultural activities took place as evidenced by the increase in arable land from 14 0 2000 2004 to 15 7 2005 2009 in this period the sediment loading from arable land accounted for 61 3 of the total a 7 6 increase compared to the previous period nevertheless the percentage of sediment loading in forestry land decreased by 2 2 because of the increase in forest area from 52 1 to 53 1 considering the 2010 2014 period the areas of arable land and permanent cropland occupied 24 3 of the total area the sediment loading from these areas reached 67 0 decreasing by 0 9 compared to the previous period between 2015 and 2018 the sediment loading tended to increase by 3 2 in the other land use types and by 0 7 in forestry land while there were decreasing trends of 3 4 in arable land and 0 5 in permanent cropland compared to the previous period the 2005 2009 period had the largest percentage of sediment loading in arable land and permanent cropland considering tn loading forest had the lowest proportion of annual tn loading while the highest percentage was recorded in arable land the 2005 2009 period had the highest proportion of tn loading in arable land and permanent cropland at 72 3 higher than other periods by 7 9 2000 2004 1 6 2010 2014 and 3 2 2015 2018 during the 2015 2018 period the tn loading of forestry land also reached the highest percentage of 9 3 increasing by 0 5 1 4 and 0 3 as compared to the 2000 2004 2005 2009 and 2010 2014 periods respectively for the other land use types the tn loadings occupied 26 8 19 8 20 3 and 21 6 in the four periods respectively similar to sediment permanent cropland exhibited the lowest percentage of annual tp loading while the highest proportion was observed in arable land arable land and permanent cropland accounted for 65 0 in the 2005 2009 period which is higher than the 2000 2004 2010 2014 and 2015 2018 periods by 9 2 2 5 and 5 0 respectively forestry land had the highest proportion of tp loading at 15 8 in the 2015 2018 period exhibiting 1 0 2 0 and 0 7 increases as compared to the three remaining periods respectively the highest percentage of other land use types was 29 4 in the first period followed by 24 2 2015 2018 22 4 2010 2014 and 21 2 2005 2009 3 4 the changes in total annual sediment tn and tp loadings at the inflow to the lake the influence of local land use policies and anthropogenic activities on downstream water quality was indicated by the increase in total annual sediment tn and tp loadings at the inflow to the lake after the enactment of land use policies as compared to before the enactment of land use policies the 2000 2004 period featured no changes in land use policies from 2005 onward changes in the local land use policies and anthropogenic activities were enacted the total annual loadings at the inflow to the lake were calculated by dividing the total annual sediment tn and tp for the whole target area by the total average annual rainfall of the whole target area changes in the total annual loadings at the inflow to the lake are illustrated in fig 8 and table s6 compared to that in the 2000 2004 period the total average annual rainfall in the 2005 2009 period was slightly higher by 3 2 59 4 mm the total annual sediment tn and tp loadings in the 2005 2009 period were significantly higher than those in the 2000 2004 period by 36 6 27 4 and 17 1 corresponding to 146 4 4 6 and 1 1 thousand tons period 103 mm respectively additionally the total average annual rainfall in the 2010 2014 period 1775 7 mm was lower than that in the 2000 2004 period 1868 7 mm by 5 2 however the total annual sediment tn and tp loadings in the 2010 2014 period were higher than those in the 2000 2004 period by 15 1 1 3 and 0 6 thousand tons period 103 mm corresponding to differences of 3 6 7 1 and 9 0 respectively the total average annual rainfall in the 2015 2018 period was also lower than that in the 2000 2004 period by 8 4 corresponding to 145 2 mm however the total annual loadings in the 2015 2018 period were higher than those in the 2000 2004 period by 1 9 7 6 thousand tons period 103 mm for sediment 1 6 0 3 thousand tons period 103 mm for tn and 4 8 0 3 thousand tons period 103 mm for tp as for the 2015 2018 period the total average rainfall was lower than in the 2010 2014 period by only 3 0 52 2 mm the total annual sediment loading in the 2015 2018 period was lower than in the 2010 2014 period by 1 9 equivalent to 7 6 thousand tons period 103 mm with a similar tendency to that of sediment the total annual tn and tp loadings in the former period were moderately lower than those in the latter period by 6 0 1 0 thousand tons period 103 mm and 4 6 0 3 thousand tons period 103 mm respectively additionally the changes in rainfall in the 2000 2004 and 2010 2014 periods 93 mm were smaller than those in the 2000 2004 and 2015 2018 periods 145 2 mm the changes in total annual sediment loading in the 2000 2004 and 2010 2014 periods 3 6 were slightly larger than those in the 2000 2004 and 2015 2018 periods 1 9 the annual tn and tp loadings in the 2000 2004 and 2010 2014 periods 7 1 and 9 0 were moderately higher than those in the 2000 2004 and 2015 2018 periods 1 6 and 4 8 the total annual loadings at the inflow to the lake in the 2005 2009 period were dramatically higher than those in the three remaining periods despite rainfall in the 2005 2009 period only being slightly higher compared to the 2000 2004 period there were higher total annual loadings in the 2010 2014 and 2015 2018 periods despite the rainfall in these periods being lower than that in the 2000 2004 period 4 discussion 4 1 impacts of different land use policies and agricultural practices on river discharge sediment and nutrients before 2005 although the total area of the dbw was larger than that of the pkw by 297 km2 equivalent to a difference of 9 3 it was observed that the river discharge sediment and nutrient loadings in this watershed were significantly lower than those in the pkw as shown in fig 5 from 2005 onward the total cumulative values in the dbw became higher than those in the pkw during the 2005 2009 period this increase in the river discharge sediment and nutrient loadings was due to implemented land use policies which influenced agricultural expansion and urbanization mainly in the dbw despite afforestation being conducted the rates of agricultural expansion and urbanization were faster than the rate of afforestation in recent years a higher migration rate especially in rural areas than urban areas in kon tum province has led to an increase in residential and agricultural areas which slowed the afforestation rate jica 2018 from 2010 onward crop conversion from mixed forests to rubber forests has been carried out the majority of which took place in the dbw conversion to rubber forests in low fertility areas was conducted despite these activities having the potential to destroy the biodiversity available in poorer forests hong et al 2013 rubber trees were planted instead of maintaining the mixed forests that had been exhausted and had not been able to provide timber products for a long time ministry of agriculture and rural development mard 2009 during the 2010 2014 period the total cumulative values in both watersheds showed almost no significant differences however these values in the dbw were still slightly higher than those in the pkw as can be seen the important role of protecting natural forests and afforesting policies in the upstream areas in the previous period enabled a reduction in the sediment and nutrient discharging downstream especially in the dbw from 2015 onward urbanization agricultural expansion and deforestation were conducted continuously along with these anthropogenic activities crop conversion from insufficient rubber forests to orchards was conducted by the local government the majority of these activities also took place mostly in the dbw thus the total cumulative sediment and nutrient loadings in this watershed were significantly higher than those in the pkw evidence revealed that the changes in local land use policies and human activities during different periods significantly impacted the hydrological processes and changed the magnitude of erosion and nutrient loadings in the target area understanding the characteristics of each watershed can support decision makers in implementing more effective short middle and long term land use and water resources management strategies during different periods 4 2 spatial changes in river discharge sediment and nutrient loadings during the different periods the sediment and tp loadings were higher in the northwestern pkw where range land predominated as well as in the western and southern dbw where arable land and permanent cropland predominated for tn loading the downstream of both watersheds and the southern upstream of the dbw exhibited higher values because of the occurrence of agricultural activities these locations should be considered from the agricultural perspective in policies aiming to minimize the sediment and nutrient loadings into the reaches despite the predominance of forestry land there were lower annual tn and tp loadings whereas arable land occupying a smaller area had the highest percentage of sediment loadings during all the periods as also indicated for a mountainous watershed in japan somura et al 2012 the main sources of nitrogen and phosphorus in the target area are agricultural activities agricultural land receives a significantly greater amount of fertilizer than forestry land rodríguez blanco et al 2015 nitrate and phosphorus exhibit an increasing tendency with the expansion of the upland area somura et al 2019 for arable land the 2005 2009 and 2010 2014 periods had a higher proportion of sediment tn and tp loadings moreover the conversion to rubber forests was represented by an increase in sediment tn and tp loadings in permanent cropland during the 2010 2014 period compared to the 2005 2009 period subsequently the conversion from rubber forests to orchards successfully reduced the proportion of these loadings during the 2015 2018 period khoi et al 2019 emphasized the important role of spatial land use strategies to manage local water resources management similar to their analysis some areas with efficient land use policies were found to reduce soil erosion and nutrient loadings into the reaches 4 3 impacts of different land use policies and agricultural practices on the downstream aquatic environment particularly yaly lake the impacts of applying local land use policies and agricultural practices on the downstream area were delineated by a comparison of the four different periods fig 8 compared to the 2000 2004 period baseline afforestation agricultural expansion and urbanization along with extensive anthropogenic activities significantly contributed to increasing erosion and affected the downstream water quality despite afforestation being conducted during the 2005 2009 period as for the 2010 2014 period crop conversion policy involving a move from mixed forests to rubber forests and human activities had a significant influence on downstream areas compared to the 2000 2004 period also the crop conversion policy involving a move from insufficient rubber forests to orchards during the 2015 2018 period was capable of minimizing the erosion and nutrient loadings to the lake despite the total annual loading during this period being higher than that in the 2000 2004 period comparing the 2010 2014 and 2015 2018 periods this also reinforces the point that crop conversion from mixed forests to rubber forests and anthropogenic practices during the 2010 2014 period were some of the main practices affecting soil loss and water quality in the study area this finding reveals that water quality was highly sensitive to local land use policy change and anthropogenic activities and their influence appeared on the water quality relatively in a short time in yaly lake water quality measurements started in 2015 the water quality in the rainy season of 2016 the second measurement in 2016 was poorer than that in the remaining years from 2015 to 2019 kon tum provincial department of natural resource and environment ktdonre 2019 the no3 n concentration was close to the a1 threshold while the nh4 n concentration was close to the b1 and b2 levels of the national standard furthermore the po4 p concentration nearly reached the b2 level in the middle of yaly lake and exceeded this threshold in the eastern area of the lake in the vietnamese national standard qcvn 08 2008 btnmt for surface water quality the a1 threshold is used for domestic water supply aquatic plants and animal conservation and other uses as the a2 b1 and b2 criteria mentioned the b1 threshold is used for irrigation water transportation and other uses as the b2 criterion mentioned the b2 threshold is applied for water transportation and other uses with low water quality requirements from 2017 onward the surface water quality in kon tum province tended to be better than that in 2016 especially in terms of tn and tp kon tum provincial people s committee 2018 due to the new national technical regulations on surface water quality qcvn 08 mt 2015 btnmt and crop conversion policy moving from insufficient rubber forests to orchards if the crop conversion to inefficient rubber forests during the 2010 2014 period had been continuously applied during the 2015 2018 period the water quality would have been worse water quality parameters are less sensitive to climate change than land use changes khoi et al 2019 most of these parameters are impacted by cultivation in upland areas somura et al 2019 it is difficult to reduce large nutrient loadings into the lake in a short period especially in rural areas yang et al 2016 because this requires the use of advanced technology in agricultural activities and capital investment in building infrastructure as well as changes in residents behavior additionally the limited data for water quality from these rivers were a noticeable issue when determining intra seasonal changes in water quality or recognizing specific pollution sources thus more frequent water quality monitoring should be conducted when considering water resources management at the regional and sub watershed scales somura et al 2018 nevertheless it is clear that promulgating reasonable changes in land use policies for particular local conditions will play a crucial role in tackling the water quality issues of yaly lake especially during the rainy season featuring excess discharge and high rainfall intensity 4 4 land use and crop conversion policies for the future in the central highlands of vietnam including the target watersheds from 2006 2020 three strategies of forestry were implemented in vietnam which can be categorized into the three periods of 2006 2010 2011 2015 and 2016 2020 ministry of agriculture and rural development mard 2019 in the 2006 2010 period the project of planting five million hectares of forest called program 661 was conducted prime minister 1998 afforestation planning in this period was conducted to reduce erosion and nutrient flow downstream especially in the northwestern and western areas of the whole watershed in the 2011 2015 period strategies for forest protection and development were implemented prime minister 2012 in 2014 an afforestation project was promulgated in the mountainous areas the necessary areas for afforestation activities were 2083 ha and 4460 ha in kon tum and gia lai provinces respectively ministry of agriculture and rural development mard 2014 in the 2016 2020 period the target program for sustainable forestry development program 886 was implemented in 2017 prime minister 2017 additionally strategies for sustainable forestry development in the central highlands for the 2021 2030 period were proposed in 2019 with priority given to the tasks that were not successfully completed in the 2016 2020 period including forest protection and development high tech forestry development community forest management livelihood improvement forest product development sustainable forest management and forest certification prime minister 2018 the role of forests in the central highlands is important in reducing the significant effects impacting aquatic biodiversity downstream these strategies also depend on differences in the climate conditions soil types land use types and hydrological characteristics of each province in the central highlands the forest area decreased by 416 994 ha from 2006 to 2019 as a result the forest cover rate decreased from 54 6 in 2006 to 45 9 in 2019 representing the largest decrease in the country the area of natural forest in this region decreased by 633 613 ha whereas the planted forest area increased by 216 619 ha from 2006 to 2019 the main reasons for forest clearance in this region were urbanization agricultural expansion and crop conversion planted forests accounted for 5 11 of the total forest area in 2006 and 14 4 of the total forest area in 2019 ministry of agriculture and rural development mard 2019 the forest cover rate is expected to increase to 49 2 by 2030 protection of the natural forest system in the upstream areas will be extremely important in order to maintain the natural forest cover by encouraging co management and community forest management systems as can be clearly seen the dbw and pkw belonging to the upstream sesan river basin play a key role in improving downstream water quality using these strategies expectations for finding possible long term solutions in the target area are necessary especially in watershed management the model approach combined with consideration of local policies and agricultural practices can contribute quantitative information for the identification of the impacts of terrestrial activities on the aquatic environment as well as for comparisons of the different characteristics of the two watersheds which can support local land use planning and water resources management policies toward the sustainable development of both the terrestrial and the aquatic environments in particular areas 5 limitation of the study the simulated results can be used to comprehensively assess the great changes in land use and anthropogenic activities in the target area additionally the multiple land use change approach should be applied to evaluate the impacts of land use change in the future instead of using a single static land use input condition or the delta approach which is evaluated according to the differences in simulated outputs between two periods although the improvement in the simulation results was confirmed by this study several limitations still exist that may affect the accuracy of our results such as 1 the reproducibility of river discharges in the upstream of the target area 2 the limited observation data for water quality from the rivers and yaly lake 3 the accuracy of the information regarding local agricultural practices 4 the sparse distribution of rain gauges and 5 the poor representation of the model in pollutant transport simulation the first thing is that the river discharges were observed by the two hydrological stations located downstream of the target watersheds this means upstream flow conditions may not be reproduced accurately leading to the appearance of biases affecting the simulation of hydrological processes secondly the amount of information on water quality from the rivers and yaly lake was limited because water quality observation began in 2014 and these data are reported four times per year this may not be sufficient to capture the local water quality conditions appropriately thirdly the agricultural practice information was collected from the local government and used in the model however the local practices such as the timing and amount of fertilizer may be slightly different among farmers this may affect the reproducibility of simulated outputs another reason is the lack of rainfall gauges in the central part of the area the spatial distribution of rainfall can also influence the spatiotemporal uncertainty of the model in hydrology and water quality simulations cho et al 2009 finally the simulation of pollutant transport in the river bed phase is one of the weaknesses of this model baffaut and benson 2009 however the calibrated outputs can be useful for different purposes especially for controlling agricultural management practices on the watershed scale even though there are several limitations in the observed information and the uncertainty of the model özcan et al 2017 6 conclusions the impacts of land use policies and anthropogenic activities on river discharge sediment and nutrient loadings were assessed in the upstream sesan river basin across different periods from 2000 to 2018 the multiple land use change conditions along with the local agricultural practice information were established in the original swat the main findings of the study are as follows the total cumulative river discharge sediment and nutrient loadings in the dbw were significantly lower than those in the pkw before 2005 despite the total area of the former being larger than the latter from 2005 onward these values were higher in the dbw where the majority of anthropogenic activities occurred especially in the 2005 2009 and 2010 2014 periods higher annual sediment and tp loadings were found upstream from the pkw where range land predominated and in southwestern and southern dbw where arable land and permanent cropland predominated the higher tn loadings were found upstream and downstream from the pkw as well as in southwestern and southern dbw arable land had the highest proportion of sediment tn and tp loadings across all four periods the 2005 2009 and 2010 2014 periods exhibited higher proportions of these loadings from arable land and permanent cropland into the reaches the important role of efficient land use policies and afforestation in reducing erosion and improving the downstream water quality in this area has been emphasized the crop conversion policy involving a shift from insufficient rubber forests to orchards applied in the 2015 2018 period seems to be efficient for the improvement of the water quality in the target area from this study it has been proved that our methodology and results can be used to quantitatively evaluate the influences of local land use policies on local water resources in the target river basin by using our approach future conditions of water resources also can be evaluated under future land use projections in terrestrial zones on the aquatic environment downstream the information will be useful for developing inter ministerial cooperation systems to ensure the coherence of policies however to consider and execute water resources management comprehensively several aspects need to be taken into account such as 1 the local water demand and its changes with the selection of suitable crop types and advanced technologies 2 the available water amount and its distribution over time under future climate conditions 3 the participation of stakeholders in discussion allowing them to share the conditions they consider to be ideal for the watershed and to prioritize necessary actions in the management of water resources and 4 the acquisition of understanding from local residents regarding water environment protection in addition to our results this information and the necessary activities will assist decision makers in determining appropriate water resources

7804,study region this study focuses on the upstream sesan river basin in the central highlands of vietnam study focus local land use policies and human activities can significantly affect hydrology and increase the magnitude of erosion and nutrients in downstream areas the effects in terrestrial regions on water quality of the target area were evaluated during the 2000 2018 period using the swat soil and water assessment tool with updated land use conditions following the local policy decisions and agricultural practices in different periods new hydrological insights for the regions this study indicates that the implementation of the local land use policies along with extensive anthropogenic activities has had significant effects on the downstream aquatic environment as compared with the period before the implementation of the land use policies higher annual sediment total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp loadings were found upstream from the poko watershed where range land predominated and in southern and southwestern dakbla watershed where arable land and permanent cropland predominated arable land had the highest proportion of sediment and nutrient loadings into the reach especially in the 2005 2009 period conducting afforestation agricultural expansion and urbanization and in the 2010 2014 period applying crop conversion policy involving a shift from mixed forests to rubber forests understanding the watershed characteristics along with the combination of spatial land use local land use policies and agricultural practices will support the implementation of regional land use and water resources management strategies more comprehensively graphical abstract ga1 keywords land use policies land use changes agricultural practices water resources management hilly areas data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction changes in anthropogenic processes in terrestrial regions could have remarkable effects on the aquatic environment which has diverse and important environmental functions to comprehensively control and reduce the significant effects impacting water quality policies are promulgated on the regional and local scales especially land use policies in asia land use underwent significant changes in a relatively short term period zhao et al 2006 even though land use occurs at the local level land use changes can damage economic environmental and ecological aspects on the local regional global scales if these changes occur indiscriminately zhao et al 2006 these policies require detailed information on the local scale the two most essential factors for land use policies are spatial land use and land use plans organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd 2017 local governments establish specific land use planning to adjust land use conversion under the guidance of the higher levels of government allowing more reasonable plans for the development of an entire region the whole nation organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd 2017 policies concerning water resources and agriculture aspects should be mentioned in the water policy framework with the consideration of all pollutants and polluters at the national and river basin scales mateo sagasta et al 2017 additionally their long term impacts should also be considered holden et al 2015 at present the aspect of long term watershed management has not yet been comprehensively considered in strategies when land use policies are updated it is necessary to have inter ministerial cooperation systems to ensure the coherence of policies mateo sagasta et al 2017 population growth leads to deforestation agricultural expansion and urbanization in recent years these human activities have affected landscapes and downstream water quality in southeast asia agricultural land expansion towards steep slope regions and deforestation for agricultural purposes satisfying the food and feed demand for human beings has led to increased vulnerability in these areas especially intensive farming areas pierret et al 2011 fullen et al 2011 frohlich et al 2013 lin et al 2016 intensive farming in agriculture is one of the better ways by which to achieve growth in the agriculture sector but its impact on water quality is significant holden et al 2015 zeng et al 2018 estimated that approximately 82 billion m2 of highland regions have been developed into croplands in southeast asian countries as a result of human induced changes on the watershed scale impacts on river discharge githui et al 2009 sediment and nutrients smarzyńska and miatkowski 2016 hanief and laursen 2017 have been observed the nutrients cumulating from non point sources of agricultural activities were found to be the primary factors increasing the nutrient loadings to watersheds leading to an accelerated extent of eutrophication in the aquatic environment carpenter et al 1998 somura et al 2012 more than 70 of the delivered nitrogen and phosphorus comes from different sources in agricultural processes to the watersheds yang et al 2018 the sediment yields in agricultural watersheds were much greater than those in areas with non anthropogenic activities with an approximately hundredfold value in hilly terrains stallard 1998 along with a high density of rainfall excess discharge contributes to accelerating surface erosion thereby increasing the sediment loading and nutrient loss deposited downstream especially during the rainy season sidle et al 2006 folliott et al 2013 shi et al 2021 controlling the pollutant discharges from point and non point sources will reduce the nutrient loadings in the watershed without a significant impact on crop productivity jha et al 2007 alexander et al 2008 even though it is undeniable that anthropogenic activities have a great influence on water quality downstream the magnitude of these impacts would be greatly increased if the crop conversion is unsuitable one of the challenges in mountainous areas is that the measured data and the information on pollution sources are limited to evaluating the pollution extent and the water quality monitoring network scattered on the watershed scale thus modeling approaches have been utilized to address these shortcomings and to consider the impacts of local land use policies and anthropogenic activities on water quality issues the soil and water assessment tool swat has been widely applied around the world to assess the impacts of river discharge sediment discharge and pollution loadings from the point and non point sources that impact the water environment in large watershed scales huang et al 2009 abbaspour et al 2015 hanief and laursen 2017 malagó et al 2017 keraga et al 2019 including the central highlands of vietnam vu et al 2012 khoi and thom 2015 the significant impacts of land use changes on hydrology githui et al 2009 li et al 2019 suspended sediment and nutrient loadings brito et al 2019 over a long period were also emphasized by using the single static land use input conditions which are normally applied to a modeling analysis however in the long term evaluation of water resources in a watershed in asian countries this ordinary method cannot comprehensively evaluate the impacts of land use changes occurring in a relatively short term period following local land use policies tram et al 2021 indicated that using multiple land use input conditions with linear interpolation in a simulation could follow the record of land use changes in a watershed and evaluate their impact on water resources better than utilizing the single static land use input conditions in addition to the multiple land use input conditions it is necessary to input information on detailed fertilization in agricultural cultivation the lack of information regarding both the quantity of fertilizer and cultivation timing affects the accuracy of the model s performance chu et al 2004 the impacts of land use policies and human activities on a watershed are dissimilar despite belonging to the same river basin because of differences in climate conditions morphological features and physical processes within each watershed tobin and bennett 2009 piniewski et al 2017 this means that it is necessary to update both the historical land use changes and detailed agricultural practices in a model to improve the accuracy of the model s performance adapted to the local situations in each period thus the main purposes of this study were 1 to evaluate the impacts of different land use policies and agricultural practices on discharge sediment total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp at the dakbla and poko watersheds in different periods on the basis of temporal and spatial distributions 2 to assess the influences of land use policies and anthropogenic activities in each period on the aquatic environment downstream and 3 to determine how to improve the erosion and water quality in the target river basin 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the sesan river basin is known as a transboundary basin of the mekong river the sesan river flows through the kon tum and gia lai provinces in vietnam the poko watershed pkw and dakbla watershed dbw are two main subbasins of the upstream sesan river basin with areas of 3210 km2 in the former and 3507 km2 in the latter as shown in fig 1 the lengths of the poko and dakbla rivers are 121 km and 152 km respectively from the upstream areas these rivers merge to a confluence before flowing to yaly lake downstream yaly lake plays an important role in the upstream sesan river basin it is mostly located in kon tum province occupying 44 5 km2 of the 64 5 km2 total area with an average depth of 48 2 m a length of 38 km and a width of 6 km at its widest point the reservoir capacity is about 1037 million m3 water quality observations started in the lake in 2015 from 2015 to 2019 the water quality of yaly lake was deemed to be completely suitable for tourism aquaculture fishing irrigation and hydropower purposes kon tum provincial department of natural resource and environment ktdonre 2016 2017 2019 with the characteristics of a tropical monsoon climate the rainy season may november and the dry season december april are the two main seasons in this area the average annual precipitation is 1778 mm and 2000 mm while the average annual temperature is 23 7 c and 23 6 c at the dak to and kon tum stations respectively forest areas occupy the highest proportion of the land 52 in the central highlands the water demand for agriculture encompassed 84 and 90 of the total water demand in kon tum and gia lai provinces respectively in 2015 2016 jica 2018 kon tum had the lowest share of agriculture in 2016 among the five provinces in this region because of its poorer soil quality and lower agricultural productivity an expansion of agricultural activities and a shift in cultivation toward the hillslope have been conducted in the target area since 2005 onwards tram et al 2021 according to the 2010 statistical yearbook there was an increasing tendency of agricultural land urban areas and forestry land with values of 39 9 56 6 and 1 7 respectively compared to 2005 from 2010 onward a crop conversion policy that encouraged a move from mixed forests to rubber forests was enacted tram et al 2021 rubber trees predominated accounting for 61 0 433 2 km2 of the total mixed forest area 709 6 km2 in kon tum province kon tum provincial people s committee 2016 rubber trees occupied 23 7 113 9 km2 of the total mixed forest area 479 4 km2 in gia lai province gia lai provincial people s council 2015 according to the 2015 statistical data there was a continuous increase in urban areas by 2 7 whereas the forestry land decreased by a value of 2 7 compared to 2010 due to some areas having inefficient rubber trees a local orchard conversion policy was enacted leading to an increasing number of orchard areas from 2015 onward rising by 5 4 and 19 5 in kon tum and gia lai provinces respectively until 2018 agricultural land and urban areas saw an increasing trend with increases of 28 5 and 1 5 respectively whereas forestland decreased continuously by approximately 4 0 in comparison to 2015 in this study the 2000 2018 period was categorized into four periods 2000 2004 2005 2009 2010 2014 and 2015 2018 on the basis of the changes in local land use policies the 2000 2004 period represented a base period in which no land use policies were applied the remaining periods illustrated the following changes in land use policies and anthropogenic activities 2005 2009 conducting for afforestation agricultural expansion and urbanization 2010 2014 crop conversion policy involving the move from mixed forests to rubber forests and 2015 2018 crop conversion policy involving the move from insufficient rubber forests to orchards 2 2 methods 2 2 1 hydrological modeling 2 2 1 1 swat description swat is a well known physical hydrological model used to predict the impact of land use changes and land management practices on river discharge hanief and laursen 2017 sediment shi and huang 2021 and nutrients epelde et al 2015 donmez et al 2020 over long periods on the river basin scale the hydrological cycle in swat is based on the water balance equation in which surface runoff is estimated through the scs curve number equation as follows 1 q surf r day i a 2 r day i a s where q surf is the accumulated runoff or rainfall excess mmh2o r day is the rainfall depth for the day mmh2o i a is the initial abstractions including surface storage interception and infiltration prior to runoff mmh2o and s is the retention parameter mmh2o sediment loadings are estimated using the modified universal soil loss equation musle as shown in eq 2 2 sed 11 8 q surf q peak area hru 0 56 k usle c usle p usle ls usle cfrg where sed is the sediment yield on a given day metric tons q

usle is the usle cover and management factor p usle is the usle support practice factor ls usle is the usle topographic factor and cfrg is the coarse fragment factor for the nitrogen simulation swat considers five different pools of nitrogen with the two pools of nh4 and no3 being the inorganic forms the movement of nitrate occurs mainly in the organic n and nitrate forms the amount of nitrate removed during surface runoff is estimated as follows 3 no 3surf ß no3 conc no3 mobile q surf where no 3surf is the nitrate removed during surface runoff kg n ha ß no3 is the nitrate percolation coefficient conc no3 mobile is the concentration of nitrate in the mobile water in the top 10 mm of soil kg n mmh2o and q surf is the surface runoff generated on a given day mmh2o for the phosphorus simulation the model monitors six pools of phosphorus in the soil of which three are inorganic forms phosphorus escapes from the soil through plant uptake and erosion soluble phosphorus and organic

partitioning coefficient m3 mg 2 2 1 2 swat application the detailed input data of the model and other necessary local information are described and shown in text s1 and table s1 the watershed was delineated into 32 subbasins in the pkw the model was calibrated from 2000 to 2015 and validated from 2016 to 2018 for river discharge the calibration and validation periods for the remaining variables tn tp no3 n and nh4 n were from 2014 to 2015 and from 2016 and 2018 respectively in the dbw the model was calibrated from 2000 to 2015 and validated from 2016 to 2018 for river discharge and sediment the tn tp no3 n and nh4 n variables were calibrated and validated by the loads in this study after calibration and validation of the model parameter values the impacts on the aquatic environment downstream were evaluated one of the initial necessary processes is to determine the length of the warm up period so as to obtain an optimal state in the hydrological model the rainfall factor significantly affects the time required for the warm up period even if it depends on the structure of the model kim et al 2017 after achieving the optimal status the response of the model is suitable for the realistic conditions leading to the higher accuracy of the model performance the 10 year warm up period was identified as the best choice for our study dak mot station was utilized to calibrate and validate the river discharge and nutrients for the pkw whereas kon tum station was used to calibrate and validate the river discharge and sediment for the dbw a total of 28 sensitivity parameters for river discharge sediment and nutrients were chosen to improve the accuracy of model performance using the sufi 2 algorithm in the swat cup program as shown in table s2 the sensitivity analysis for the model simulation after updating the information regarding land use changes and agricultural practices is also described and illustrated in text s2 and fig s1 2 2 2 land use update module there have been dramatic land use changes in the central highlands especially in the study area in the last five years with the expansion of urbanization and agricultural areas along with deforestation jica 2018 model performance cannot be evaluated in depth when there is a lack of detailed land use changes and land management information zettam et al 2017 updating land use change information through different approaches is important when seeking to improve the accuracy of the model s performance moriasi et al 2019 wagner et al 2019 and aghsaei et al 2020 in this study a method confirmed by tram et al 2021 was used to track the frequent and complicated local land use policies by using r script for the analysis multiple land use maps were developed on the basis of local information and policies reflected by the local land use conditions 2005 2010 2015 and 2018 during the simulation periods as shown in fig 2 during a simulation of the 2000 2018 period three new land use conditions for 2010 2015 and 2018 were updated in the model from 2005 onwards for the 2005 2009 2010 2014 and 2015 2018 simulation periods this r script can support updating land use changes by the linear interpolation method at the chosen time 2 2 3 agricultural practice information information such as the amount of fertilizer per crop and its timing should be updated in the model along with the changes in land use policies because the significant impacts of agricultural practices on the hydrology crop yield and water quality processes have been emphasized arabi et al 2007 srinivasan et al 2010 donmez et al 2020 the agricultural practice information for the timing of planting fertilizing and harvesting was collected from the local government one of the most influential factors of agricultural practices on the environment is crop type and cultivation management along with climate conditions and soil characteristics epelde et al 2015 the three main crops in the target area are rice coffee plants and rubber trees rice is cultivated twice per year as permanent crops coffee beans and rubber latex are normally harvested after 4 years and 6 years of planting the annual fertilization loads for crops range from 8 3 to 73 6 kg n ha year and from 4 2 to 21 2 kg p ha year as described in table 1 coffee plants and rubber trees are the priority permanent crops in the target area because these crops are strategic commodity crop groups with high economic value and great export potential additionally these crops contribute to the greening of barren hills creating jobs reducing the poverty rate and improving the incomes of local people especially ethnic minorities phuc and nghi 2014 tien et al 2015 high quality rubber latex in kon tum and gia lai provinces is exported to many countries because of the significant difference in the net income obtained from annual and perennial crops a dramatic conversion from annual crops to perennial crops in the hillslope areas was conducted in this region jica 2018 2 2 4 model performance evaluation to assess the accuracy of the model s performance three statistical indices the coefficient of determination r 2 the nash sutcliffe index nsi and the percentage bias pbias were used the performance evaluation criteria of variables in the watershed scale were described by moriasi et al 2015 as shown in table s3 5 r 2 i 1 n o i o p i p i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n p i p 2 2 6 n s i 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 7 p b i a s i 1 n o i p i i 1 n o i 100 where o i denotes the observed variables o denotes the average observed variables p i denotes the simulated variables p denotes the average simulated variables and n is the number of existing variables 2 2 5 nutrient load calculation the nutrient load was calculated on the basis of the concentration of water quality variables and the discharge as described in eq 8 8 l t 1 t t 86 4 q t c t where l is the nutrient load kg c t is the daily concentration of water quality variables mg l q t is the daily discharge m3 s and t is the time days 3 results reproducibility of river discharge sediment and nutrient loadings during the 2000 2018 period is described in detail in text s3 additionally the relationship between the observed and simulated daily river discharge sediment tn tp no3 n and nh4 n loadings for pkw and dbw is shown in figs s2 and s3 the statistical evaluations of the model performance using r 2 nsi and pbias are listed in table s4 3 1 the changes in river discharge sediment and nutrient loadings at the outlets pkw and dbw outlets 3 1 1 total annual river discharge sediment and nutrient loadings at the outlets the total annual river discharge sediment tn and tp loadings at the two outlets from 2000 to 2018 are shown in fig 3 additionally the summary of the highest and lowest values during the simulation periods is shown in table s5 the fluctuation of the total annual loadings at the two outlets was different in the four periods based on the changes in local land use policies and anthropogenic activities the highest total annual loadings were found in 2013 for river discharge sediment tn and tp the year 2013 belonged to the 2010 2014 period in which a crop conversion policy involving a move from mixed forests to rubber forests was applied and agricultural activities were changed in 2013 the total annual river discharge reached the maximum value of 2115 6 m3 s in the pkw which was 7 8 higher than in the dbw similar to the river discharge the total annual sediment loading in the pkw reached the highest value of 692 8 thousand tons in 2013 which was 24 0 lower than in the dbw in both watersheds the maximum values of tn were found in 2013 with a value of 33 1 thousand tons in the pkw which was 13 0 smaller than in the dbw in addition tp reached the highest value of 9 6 thousand tons in the pkw which was 6 7 lower than in the dbw even though the river discharge in the pkw was slightly higher than that in the dbw in 2013 the large number of agricultural practices conducted in the dbw led to the higher annual sediment tn and tp loadings from this watershed in comparison to the pkw 3 1 2 average monthly total river discharge sediment and nutrient loadings at the pkw and dbw outlets during the target period the average monthly total river discharge and sediment loadings were the highest in september in both watersheds fig 4 the highest river discharges were 326 7 m3 s for the pkw and 256 8 m3 s for the dbw additionally the highest sediment loadings were 102 8 and 94 9 thousand tons in the pkw and dbw respectively the river discharge and sediment values in the pkw were higher than in the dbw by 27 2 and 8 3 respectively the maximum tn values were reached in august at 4 7 and 4 1 thousand tons in the pkw and dbw similar to tn the highest tp values of the pkw and dbw were 1 5 and 1 1 thousand tons respectively it is clear that the tn and tp values in the pkw were higher than those in the dbw by 14 6 and 36 4 respectively 3 1 3 total cumulative sediment tn and tp loadings at the pkw and dbw outlets in the 2000 2004 period many agricultural practices were conducted in the pkw instead of in the dbw consequently the total cumulative values in the dbw were moderately lower than those in the pkw by 15 3 268 4 thousand tons for sediment 3 9 3 0 thousand tons for tn and 20 6 5 2 thousand tons for tp as shown in fig 5 in the 2005 2009 period the total cumulation in the dbw increased significantly as compared to the previous period these cumulative values in the dbw exceeded those in the pkw by 42 9 985 7 thousand tons for sediment 33 3 31 7 thousand tons for tn and 10 4 3 6 thousand tons for tp during the 2010 2014 period the total cumulative values in the pkw were lower by 12 8 15 9 and 7 4 for sediment tn and tp respectively as compared to those in the dbw in the remaining period from 2015 to 2018 the total cumulative sediment tn and tp values in the pkw were lower than those in the dbw by 105 0 97 2 and 30 4 respectively generally the two periods 2005 2009 and 2015 2018 showed drastic differences in the two watersheds during the whole target period 3 2 spatial distribution of annual sediment tn and tp loadings in each subbasin in the four periods the spatial distribution of annual sediment tn and tp loadings is illustrated in fig 6 to allow for a better understanding of their characteristics according to differences in land use soil and slope at the subbasin scale for sediment loading the annual value ranged from 41 4 tons km2 in subbasin 9 2010 2014 to 666 7 tons km2 in subbasin 23 2005 2009 in subbasin 23 arable land and permanent cropland predominated accounting for 74 0 of the total land and approximately 50 8 of this area had a slope greater than 15 compared with the 2005 2009 period the maximum annual values in the remaining three periods were lower by 75 2000 2004 19 7 2010 2014 and 4 2 2015 2018 in the 2005 2009 period the annual sediment loading was higher than in the eastern and southern areas in subbasin 32 arable land and permanent cropland predominated accounting for 50 of the total land and approximately 45 8 of this area had a slope greater than 15 the annual loading increased slightly in the northwestern southwestern and eastern directions whereas there was a dramatic decrease in the northeastern and southern areas in the 2010 2014 period in the 2015 2018 period the annual value exhibited a significant decline in the northwestern area while there was an increasing tendency in the northeastern and southern parts for the tn loading the lowest annual value was 1 4 tons km2 in subbasin 9 in the 2010 2014 period while the highest value was 22 7 tons km2 in subbasin 23 in the 2005 2009 period in the 2005 2009 period the maximum annual tn loadings were higher than those in the 2000 2004 2010 2014 and 2015 2018 periods by 35 5 14 6 and 7 8 respectively compared to that in the 2000 2004 period the annual tn loading increased moderately in the southern and northeastern areas whereas a dramatic decrease was seen in the northwestern and western areas in the 2005 2009 period there was a slight increase in the northwestern southwestern and eastern areas while a significant decrease was observed in the northeastern and southern areas from 2010 to 2014 moreover the tn loading increased in the southwestern area and slightly decreased in the northwestern area in the 2015 2018 period for the tp loading the annual value ranged from 1 1 tons km2 subbasin 9 for the 2010 2014 period to 4 1 tons km2 subbasin 23 for the 2005 2009 period compared with the 2005 2009 period the maximum annual tp loadings were lower than in the remaining three periods by 30 3 2000 2004 20 7 2010 2014 and 7 6 2015 2018 there was a similar tendency to sediment load during the whole period 3 3 the changes in sediment tn and tp loadings for each land use during the four periods forest represented the highest percentage of land use accounting for more than 52 of the study area across all four periods fig 7 permanent cropland had the lowest proportion of annual sediment loading and the smallest total area while the highest proportion of sediment loading was found in arable land despite its area ranging from 14 0 to 15 9 of the total during the four periods from 2005 2009 extensive agricultural activities took place as evidenced by the increase in arable land from 14 0 2000 2004 to 15 7 2005 2009 in this period the sediment loading from arable land accounted for 61 3 of the total a 7 6 increase compared to the previous period nevertheless the percentage of sediment loading in forestry land decreased by 2 2 because of the increase in forest area from 52 1 to 53 1 considering the 2010 2014 period the areas of arable land and permanent cropland occupied 24 3 of the total area the sediment loading from these areas reached 67 0 decreasing by 0 9 compared to the previous period between 2015 and 2018 the sediment loading tended to increase by 3 2 in the other land use types and by 0 7 in forestry land while there were decreasing trends of 3 4 in arable land and 0 5 in permanent cropland compared to the previous period the 2005 2009 period had the largest percentage of sediment loading in arable land and permanent cropland considering tn loading forest had the lowest proportion of annual tn loading while the highest percentage was recorded in arable land the 2005 2009 period had the highest proportion of tn loading in arable land and permanent cropland at 72 3 higher than other periods by 7 9 2000 2004 1 6 2010 2014 and 3 2 2015 2018 during the 2015 2018 period the tn loading of forestry land also reached the highest percentage of 9 3 increasing by 0 5 1 4 and 0 3 as compared to the 2000 2004 2005 2009 and 2010 2014 periods respectively for the other land use types the tn loadings occupied 26 8 19 8 20 3 and 21 6 in the four periods respectively similar to sediment permanent cropland exhibited the lowest percentage of annual tp loading while the highest proportion was observed in arable land arable land and permanent cropland accounted for 65 0 in the 2005 2009 period which is higher than the 2000 2004 2010 2014 and 2015 2018 periods by 9 2 2 5 and 5 0 respectively forestry land had the highest proportion of tp loading at 15 8 in the 2015 2018 period exhibiting 1 0 2 0 and 0 7 increases as compared to the three remaining periods respectively the highest percentage of other land use types was 29 4 in the first period followed by 24 2 2015 2018 22 4 2010 2014 and 21 2 2005 2009 3 4 the changes in total annual sediment tn and tp loadings at the inflow to the lake the influence of local land use policies and anthropogenic activities on downstream water quality was indicated by the increase in total annual sediment tn and tp loadings at the inflow to the lake after the enactment of land use policies as compared to before the enactment of land use policies the 2000 2004 period featured no changes in land use policies from 2005 onward changes in the local land use policies and anthropogenic activities were enacted the total annual loadings at the inflow to the lake were calculated by dividing the total annual sediment tn and tp for the whole target area by the total average annual rainfall of the whole target area changes in the total annual loadings at the inflow to the lake are illustrated in fig 8 and table s6 compared to that in the 2000 2004 period the total average annual rainfall in the 2005 2009 period was slightly higher by 3 2 59 4 mm the total annual sediment tn and tp loadings in the 2005 2009 period were significantly higher than those in the 2000 2004 period by 36 6 27 4 and 17 1 corresponding to 146 4 4 6 and 1 1 thousand tons period 103 mm respectively additionally the total average annual rainfall in the 2010 2014 period 1775 7 mm was lower than that in the 2000 2004 period 1868 7 mm by 5 2 however the total annual sediment tn and tp loadings in the 2010 2014 period were higher than those in the 2000 2004 period by 15 1 1 3 and 0 6 thousand tons period 103 mm corresponding to differences of 3 6 7 1 and 9 0 respectively the total average annual rainfall in the 2015 2018 period was also lower than that in the 2000 2004 period by 8 4 corresponding to 145 2 mm however the total annual loadings in the 2015 2018 period were higher than those in the 2000 2004 period by 1 9 7 6 thousand tons period 103 mm for sediment 1 6 0 3 thousand tons period 103 mm for tn and 4 8 0 3 thousand tons period 103 mm for tp as for the 2015 2018 period the total average rainfall was lower than in the 2010 2014 period by only 3 0 52 2 mm the total annual sediment loading in the 2015 2018 period was lower than in the 2010 2014 period by 1 9 equivalent to 7 6 thousand tons period 103 mm with a similar tendency to that of sediment the total annual tn and tp loadings in the former period were moderately lower than those in the latter period by 6 0 1 0 thousand tons period 103 mm and 4 6 0 3 thousand tons period 103 mm respectively additionally the changes in rainfall in the 2000 2004 and 2010 2014 periods 93 mm were smaller than those in the 2000 2004 and 2015 2018 periods 145 2 mm the changes in total annual sediment loading in the 2000 2004 and 2010 2014 periods 3 6 were slightly larger than those in the 2000 2004 and 2015 2018 periods 1 9 the annual tn and tp loadings in the 2000 2004 and 2010 2014 periods 7 1 and 9 0 were moderately higher than those in the 2000 2004 and 2015 2018 periods 1 6 and 4 8 the total annual loadings at the inflow to the lake in the 2005 2009 period were dramatically higher than those in the three remaining periods despite rainfall in the 2005 2009 period only being slightly higher compared to the 2000 2004 period there were higher total annual loadings in the 2010 2014 and 2015 2018 periods despite the rainfall in these periods being lower than that in the 2000 2004 period 4 discussion 4 1 impacts of different land use policies and agricultural practices on river discharge sediment and nutrients before 2005 although the total area of the dbw was larger than that of the pkw by 297 km2 equivalent to a difference of 9 3 it was observed that the river discharge sediment and nutrient loadings in this watershed were significantly lower than those in the pkw as shown in fig 5 from 2005 onward the total cumulative values in the dbw became higher than those in the pkw during the 2005 2009 period this increase in the river discharge sediment and nutrient loadings was due to implemented land use policies which influenced agricultural expansion and urbanization mainly in the dbw despite afforestation being conducted the rates of agricultural expansion and urbanization were faster than the rate of afforestation in recent years a higher migration rate especially in rural areas than urban areas in kon tum province has led to an increase in residential and agricultural areas which slowed the afforestation rate jica 2018 from 2010 onward crop conversion from mixed forests to rubber forests has been carried out the majority of which took place in the dbw conversion to rubber forests in low fertility areas was conducted despite these activities having the potential to destroy the biodiversity available in poorer forests hong et al 2013 rubber trees were planted instead of maintaining the mixed forests that had been exhausted and had not been able to provide timber products for a long time ministry of agriculture and rural development mard 2009 during the 2010 2014 period the total cumulative values in both watersheds showed almost no significant differences however these values in the dbw were still slightly higher than those in the pkw as can be seen the important role of protecting natural forests and afforesting policies in the upstream areas in the previous period enabled a reduction in the sediment and nutrient discharging downstream especially in the dbw from 2015 onward urbanization agricultural expansion and deforestation were conducted continuously along with these anthropogenic activities crop conversion from insufficient rubber forests to orchards was conducted by the local government the majority of these activities also took place mostly in the dbw thus the total cumulative sediment and nutrient loadings in this watershed were significantly higher than those in the pkw evidence revealed that the changes in local land use policies and human activities during different periods significantly impacted the hydrological processes and changed the magnitude of erosion and nutrient loadings in the target area understanding the characteristics of each watershed can support decision makers in implementing more effective short middle and long term land use and water resources management strategies during different periods 4 2 spatial changes in river discharge sediment and nutrient loadings during the different periods the sediment and tp loadings were higher in the northwestern pkw where range land predominated as well as in the western and southern dbw where arable land and permanent cropland predominated for tn loading the downstream of both watersheds and the southern upstream of the dbw exhibited higher values because of the occurrence of agricultural activities these locations should be considered from the agricultural perspective in policies aiming to minimize the sediment and nutrient loadings into the reaches despite the predominance of forestry land there were lower annual tn and tp loadings whereas arable land occupying a smaller area had the highest percentage of sediment loadings during all the periods as also indicated for a mountainous watershed in japan somura et al 2012 the main sources of nitrogen and phosphorus in the target area are agricultural activities agricultural land receives a significantly greater amount of fertilizer than forestry land rodríguez blanco et al 2015 nitrate and phosphorus exhibit an increasing tendency with the expansion of the upland area somura et al 2019 for arable land the 2005 2009 and 2010 2014 periods had a higher proportion of sediment tn and tp loadings moreover the conversion to rubber forests was represented by an increase in sediment tn and tp loadings in permanent cropland during the 2010 2014 period compared to the 2005 2009 period subsequently the conversion from rubber forests to orchards successfully reduced the proportion of these loadings during the 2015 2018 period khoi et al 2019 emphasized the important role of spatial land use strategies to manage local water resources management similar to their analysis some areas with efficient land use policies were found to reduce soil erosion and nutrient loadings into the reaches 4 3 impacts of different land use policies and agricultural practices on the downstream aquatic environment particularly yaly lake the impacts of applying local land use policies and agricultural practices on the downstream area were delineated by a comparison of the four different periods fig 8 compared to the 2000 2004 period baseline afforestation agricultural expansion and urbanization along with extensive anthropogenic activities significantly contributed to increasing erosion and affected the downstream water quality despite afforestation being conducted during the 2005 2009 period as for the 2010 2014 period crop conversion policy involving a move from mixed forests to rubber forests and human activities had a significant influence on downstream areas compared to the 2000 2004 period also the crop conversion policy involving a move from insufficient rubber forests to orchards during the 2015 2018 period was capable of minimizing the erosion and nutrient loadings to the lake despite the total annual loading during this period being higher than that in the 2000 2004 period comparing the 2010 2014 and 2015 2018 periods this also reinforces the point that crop conversion from mixed forests to rubber forests and anthropogenic practices during the 2010 2014 period were some of the main practices affecting soil loss and water quality in the study area this finding reveals that water quality was highly sensitive to local land use policy change and anthropogenic activities and their influence appeared on the water quality relatively in a short time in yaly lake water quality measurements started in 2015 the water quality in the rainy season of 2016 the second measurement in 2016 was poorer than that in the remaining years from 2015 to 2019 kon tum provincial department of natural resource and environment ktdonre 2019 the no3 n concentration was close to the a1 threshold while the nh4 n concentration was close to the b1 and b2 levels of the national standard furthermore the po4 p concentration nearly reached the b2 level in the middle of yaly lake and exceeded this threshold in the eastern area of the lake in the vietnamese national standard qcvn 08 2008 btnmt for surface water quality the a1 threshold is used for domestic water supply aquatic plants and animal conservation and other uses as the a2 b1 and b2 criteria mentioned the b1 threshold is used for irrigation water transportation and other uses as the b2 criterion mentioned the b2 threshold is applied for water transportation and other uses with low water quality requirements from 2017 onward the surface water quality in kon tum province tended to be better than that in 2016 especially in terms of tn and tp kon tum provincial people s committee 2018 due to the new national technical regulations on surface water quality qcvn 08 mt 2015 btnmt and crop conversion policy moving from insufficient rubber forests to orchards if the crop conversion to inefficient rubber forests during the 2010 2014 period had been continuously applied during the 2015 2018 period the water quality would have been worse water quality parameters are less sensitive to climate change than land use changes khoi et al 2019 most of these parameters are impacted by cultivation in upland areas somura et al 2019 it is difficult to reduce large nutrient loadings into the lake in a short period especially in rural areas yang et al 2016 because this requires the use of advanced technology in agricultural activities and capital investment in building infrastructure as well as changes in residents behavior additionally the limited data for water quality from these rivers were a noticeable issue when determining intra seasonal changes in water quality or recognizing specific pollution sources thus more frequent water quality monitoring should be conducted when considering water resources management at the regional and sub watershed scales somura et al 2018 nevertheless it is clear that promulgating reasonable changes in land use policies for particular local conditions will play a crucial role in tackling the water quality issues of yaly lake especially during the rainy season featuring excess discharge and high rainfall intensity 4 4 land use and crop conversion policies for the future in the central highlands of vietnam including the target watersheds from 2006 2020 three strategies of forestry were implemented in vietnam which can be categorized into the three periods of 2006 2010 2011 2015 and 2016 2020 ministry of agriculture and rural development mard 2019 in the 2006 2010 period the project of planting five million hectares of forest called program 661 was conducted prime minister 1998 afforestation planning in this period was conducted to reduce erosion and nutrient flow downstream especially in the northwestern and western areas of the whole watershed in the 2011 2015 period strategies for forest protection and development were implemented prime minister 2012 in 2014 an afforestation project was promulgated in the mountainous areas the necessary areas for afforestation activities were 2083 ha and 4460 ha in kon tum and gia lai provinces respectively ministry of agriculture and rural development mard 2014 in the 2016 2020 period the target program for sustainable forestry development program 886 was implemented in 2017 prime minister 2017 additionally strategies for sustainable forestry development in the central highlands for the 2021 2030 period were proposed in 2019 with priority given to the tasks that were not successfully completed in the 2016 2020 period including forest protection and development high tech forestry development community forest management livelihood improvement forest product development sustainable forest management and forest certification prime minister 2018 the role of forests in the central highlands is important in reducing the significant effects impacting aquatic biodiversity downstream these strategies also depend on differences in the climate conditions soil types land use types and hydrological characteristics of each province in the central highlands the forest area decreased by 416 994 ha from 2006 to 2019 as a result the forest cover rate decreased from 54 6 in 2006 to 45 9 in 2019 representing the largest decrease in the country the area of natural forest in this region decreased by 633 613 ha whereas the planted forest area increased by 216 619 ha from 2006 to 2019 the main reasons for forest clearance in this region were urbanization agricultural expansion and crop conversion planted forests accounted for 5 11 of the total forest area in 2006 and 14 4 of the total forest area in 2019 ministry of agriculture and rural development mard 2019 the forest cover rate is expected to increase to 49 2 by 2030 protection of the natural forest system in the upstream areas will be extremely important in order to maintain the natural forest cover by encouraging co management and community forest management systems as can be clearly seen the dbw and pkw belonging to the upstream sesan river basin play a key role in improving downstream water quality using these strategies expectations for finding possible long term solutions in the target area are necessary especially in watershed management the model approach combined with consideration of local policies and agricultural practices can contribute quantitative information for the identification of the impacts of terrestrial activities on the aquatic environment as well as for comparisons of the different characteristics of the two watersheds which can support local land use planning and water resources management policies toward the sustainable development of both the terrestrial and the aquatic environments in particular areas 5 limitation of the study the simulated results can be used to comprehensively assess the great changes in land use and anthropogenic activities in the target area additionally the multiple land use change approach should be applied to evaluate the impacts of land use change in the future instead of using a single static land use input condition or the delta approach which is evaluated according to the differences in simulated outputs between two periods although the improvement in the simulation results was confirmed by this study several limitations still exist that may affect the accuracy of our results such as 1 the reproducibility of river discharges in the upstream of the target area 2 the limited observation data for water quality from the rivers and yaly lake 3 the accuracy of the information regarding local agricultural practices 4 the sparse distribution of rain gauges and 5 the poor representation of the model in pollutant transport simulation the first thing is that the river discharges were observed by the two hydrological stations located downstream of the target watersheds this means upstream flow conditions may not be reproduced accurately leading to the appearance of biases affecting the simulation of hydrological processes secondly the amount of information on water quality from the rivers and yaly lake was limited because water quality observation began in 2014 and these data are reported four times per year this may not be sufficient to capture the local water quality conditions appropriately thirdly the agricultural practice information was collected from the local government and used in the model however the local practices such as the timing and amount of fertilizer may be slightly different among farmers this may affect the reproducibility of simulated outputs another reason is the lack of rainfall gauges in the central part of the area the spatial distribution of rainfall can also influence the spatiotemporal uncertainty of the model in hydrology and water quality simulations cho et al 2009 finally the simulation of pollutant transport in the river bed phase is one of the weaknesses of this model baffaut and benson 2009 however the calibrated outputs can be useful for different purposes especially for controlling agricultural management practices on the watershed scale even though there are several limitations in the observed information and the uncertainty of the model özcan et al 2017 6 conclusions the impacts of land use policies and anthropogenic activities on river discharge sediment and nutrient loadings were assessed in the upstream sesan river basin across different periods from 2000 to 2018 the multiple land use change conditions along with the local agricultural practice information were established in the original swat the main findings of the study are as follows the total cumulative river discharge sediment and nutrient loadings in the dbw were significantly lower than those in the pkw before 2005 despite the total area of the former being larger than the latter from 2005 onward these values were higher in the dbw where the majority of anthropogenic activities occurred especially in the 2005 2009 and 2010 2014 periods higher annual sediment and tp loadings were found upstream from the pkw where range land predominated and in southwestern and southern dbw where arable land and permanent cropland predominated the higher tn loadings were found upstream and downstream from the pkw as well as in southwestern and southern dbw arable land had the highest proportion of sediment tn and tp loadings across all four periods the 2005 2009 and 2010 2014 periods exhibited higher proportions of these loadings from arable land and permanent cropland into the reaches the important role of efficient land use policies and afforestation in reducing erosion and improving the downstream water quality in this area has been emphasized the crop conversion policy involving a shift from insufficient rubber forests to orchards applied in the 2015 2018 period seems to be efficient for the improvement of the water quality in the target area from this study it has been proved that our methodology and results can be used to quantitatively evaluate the influences of local land use policies on local water resources in the target river basin by using our approach future conditions of water resources also can be evaluated under future land use projections in terrestrial zones on the aquatic environment downstream the information will be useful for developing inter ministerial cooperation systems to ensure the coherence of policies however to consider and execute water resources management comprehensively several aspects need to be taken into account such as 1 the local water demand and its changes with the selection of suitable crop types and advanced technologies 2 the available water amount and its distribution over time under future climate conditions 3 the participation of stakeholders in discussion allowing them to share the conditions they consider to be ideal for the watershed and to prioritize necessary actions in the management of water resources and 4 the acquisition of understanding from local residents regarding water environment protection in addition to our results this information and the necessary activities will assist decision makers in determining appropriate water resources
