21575,in this paper a strouhal reynolds number evolution region for the pipe groups within the subcritical reynolds number range is established and a strouhal reynolds number relation curve in root mean square terms is yielded for the first time a strouhal reynolds number model for flow around flexible pipes under 180 sets of test is presented the least squares method is used to fit the strouhal numbers among the pipes within their flow velocity intervals isolated pipe is introduced as reference cases for examining how the strouhal numbers of the pipes vary with reynolds number the results indicate that when in tandem arrangement the strouhal number of the three pipe group showed a gradual reduction from upstream to downstream whereas both vortex shedding enhancement and suppression occurred in the five pipe group interferences contributed to the vortex shedding in the wake flow of the pipes in side by side arrangement it is also found that interferences significantly changed the vortex shedding frequencies on both rear sides of the pipes only 16 9 of the strouhal numbers of the three pipe and five pipe group fell within 0 185 0 20 which is largely different from conventional cognition of the strouhal number within the subcritical reynolds number range keywords strouhal number reynolds number pipe groups interference effect spacing incidence angle 1 introduction fluid flow around non streamlined bluff bodies plays a critical role in many aerodynamic and hydrodynamic applications such as submarine pipelines mooring systems aircraft trains chimneys and bridges when the fluid flows past a structure alternately shedding vortices are generated downstream of the structure leading to vortex induced vibration viv during this process the fluid flow velocity is controlled by reynolds number re re ul v where u is the outflow velocity l is the characteristic length e g hydrodynamic diameter and v is the fluid kinematic viscosity for these periodical nonsteady flows the vortex shedding frequency is generally presented in a dimensionless form namely strouhal number st st fl u and on this ground strouhal number is used to describe the similarity criterion for flow unsteadiness here f is the vortex discharge frequency over the past decades the st re variability has been widely studied for its fundamental and practical significances roshko 1954 williamson et al 1986a b ahlborn et al 2002 ponta 2006 radi et al 2013 han et al 2014 bot et al 2014 various parametric forms of st re relations have been developed based on observations of structures subjected to vortex streets strouhal number covers a wide area of research in aerospace application high lift devices generate asymmetric wakes that impact the aerodynamic and aeroacoustic performances of airplanes in the literature there is no consensus about whether the shear reduces or increases the strouhal number of vortex shedding gennaro et al 2013 analyzed the linear stability of asymmetric wake profiles and proved that the dominant strouhal number reduces with increasing asymmetry kang et al 2011 described how chordwise spanwise and isotropic flexibilities affect flapping generation and propulsion efficiency and established the relations between propulsion force and maximum relative wing tip deformation parameters in wind stability researches of bridges the valuation of strouhal number directly decides the accuracy of the predicted viv wind velocity over real bridges chen et al 1996 discovered that at low incidence angles reynolds number can make a greater difference as a result of flow reattachments liu et al 2010 also yielded a remarkable reynolds number effect on the strouhal number of a bridge section during maritime navigation as the mast is located at the highest point of a ship and therefore greatly affects the stealth of the ship it is very important to investigate the wind load distribution on typical closed integrated masts and examine how average pressure coefficient pulsating pressure coefficient and strouhal number vary with reynolds number shojaeefard et al 2018 developed a numerical approach for calculating the stability derivatives of autonomous underwater vehicle auv and observed how strouhal number affects these coefficients he discovered that dimensionless damping coefficient is largely dependent on strouhal number especially at high frequencies except longitudinal damping coefficient whereas changes in strouhal number do not make much difference to added mass coefficient marine animals whether tadpoles or whales each have their own strouhal numbers during swimming nudds et al 2014 villeger et al 2014 eloy 2012 chao et al 2018 rohr et al 2004 claimed that the relations between the swimming efficiencies of fish or whales and the cyclic frequency of strokes and between peak amplitude and average speed also satisfy the strouhal number relations with a strouhal number ranging from 0 20 to 0 40 in transportation higher reynolds numbers give rise to high turbulences in a high speed train containing numerous vortex structures on both the spatial and temporal scales hence a better understanding of the flow dynamics is fundamental to minimizing the potential negative impacts caused by the train side flow field li et al 2019 reviewed the existence of dual zones and confined the strouhal number of wake aerodynamics to 0 15 scarabino et al 2005 investigated the boom girder of a 100 m tall port crane and yielded the resistance coefficient values of low turbulences and turbulences characterized by atmospheric boundary laver wind in three wind directions and the strouhal number of an approximate trapezoid section for reynolds numbers 30000 180000 in a marine structure peng et al 2008 made an experimental investigation on the strouhal number of flow past a double triangular bluff body in a 50 mm diameter circular pipe and yielded the vortex shedding frequency by examining two side by side square column structures yen et al 2011 revealed that the highest strouhal number arised under single column arrangement and the lowest occurred under gap flow burattini et al 2013 calculated the flow around a pair of side by side square cylinders in a two dimensional passage for reynolds number 73 at spacing ratios 0 5 6 and discovered that relative coefficient changes largely while strouhal number is almost a constant that approximates 0 16 in marine engineering when the natural frequency of a pipe structure equals to the vortex shedding frequency resonance will arise leading to fatigue damage in the structure and consequently a shorter service life for the structure hence it is very important to investigate the strouhal number behavior for different flow conditions so far researches on strouhal number are virtually confined to isolated single pipe or double pipe models li and sumner 2009 used a power spectral density diagram to demonstrate how strouhal number on the surface of cylinders in a circular arrangement changes as a result of the side walls and free inflows gnanaskandan and mahesh 2016 observed that the strouhal number corresponding to vortex shedding reduces with the emergence of cavitating flow jiang and cheng 2017 proposed a deterministic method that improves the separation velocity and wake width making it possible to estimate the strouhal number of trails more accurately they also discovered that flow around dual pipes in tandem arrangement is highly dependent on spacing ratio s d and incidence angle α as s d or α varies great changes take place in the vortex shedding frequency and viv characteristics of each of the pipes sumner et al 2008 examined the strouhal numbers of two pipes under variable spacing ratios and angles they categorized the spacing of pipes as small medium and large spacings and yielded the peak strouhal number variation at α 9 in their investigation of a p d α figuration sumner et al 2003 and akosile et al 2003 also failed to discover a relatively regular strouhal number to indicate weakening or disappearing vortex shedding movement sumner assumed that in a simple vortex shedding region the strouhal number approximates a half of the strouhal number of a single circular cylinder in a skewed flow region two strouhal number values can be yielded at particular reynolds numbers and measuring positions in a vortex shedding region of double circular cylinders in tandem arrangement the strouhal number approximates that of a single circular cylinder nevertheless restricted by the limited experimental data available from previous studies we are yet not very clear about the variation of strouhal number and its sensitivity to incidence angle for example the internal and external peak lifts the position on the downstream circular cylinder corresponding to the maximum inward average lift determined by zdravkovich and pridden 1977 may correspond to strouhal number through investigation on flow patterns sumner et al 2000 indicated that strouhal number is possibly more closely related to single shear layers than it is to single pipes through hot wire measurement and laser induced fluorescence lif flow visualization zhou 2003 and xu 2004 experimented the strouhal number in the wake of two in line circular cylinders for re 800 4 2 104 and center to center distance l d 1 15 and proved that way in which strouhal number varies with l d is determined by flow state xu et al 2019 carried out a series of experimental studies on flow induced vibration fiv of two identical elastically mounted circular cylinders in tandem arrangement and found that when ur 12 the vibration of and the fluid force on the downstream cylinder are obviously influenced by the upstream cylinder for the spacing range tested the existing research does not propose a clear st re relation model for the pipe groups with coupled interference effects the dynamic evolution mechanism of the fluid strouhal number under the action of flexible pipe groups is rarely reported in this paper an experimental investigation is conducted on how the viv strouhal numbers of pipe groups in different arrangement forms respond to coupled wake interferences the inter pipe dynamic behaviors of a three pipe group in tandem side by side arrangement and a five pipe group in circular arrangement under variable spacing ratios and of a three pipe group in tandem arrangement and a five pipe group in side by side arrangement under variable incidence angles are observed by changing the external flow velocity u 0 1 0 6 m s in the subcritical reynolds region inter pipe spacing ratio s d and incidence angle α so as to explore the mechanisms behind strouhal number and vortex shedding a st re model for flow around flexible pipe groups is built it adds to the st re parametric relations for pipe groups subjected to coupled interferences 2 experimental set up 2 1 test apparatus the experiment was carried out in the hydrodynamics laboratory ocean university of china fig 1 shows the overall arrangement of the experiment the combined wave current water flume measures 1 0 m across with the maximum water depth of 1 0 m maximum flow velocity of 0 8 m s and maximum wave height of 0 3 m the flume was sided with toughened glass partitioned with steel columns and bottomed with steel plate which can be used for fixing the pipe support a number of bidirectional symmetric inclined supports were designed to prevent the supporting structure from oscillating with external flow the bottom of the supporting device was welded to the flume at a number of points using high tensile bolts at the center of the supporting device two crossbars were attached to the edge of the flume with g clamps to ensure stability of the entire system inside the supporting device three fluted aluminum alloy securing plates were installed such that they move freely with the help of the sbr sliding block and the sbr optical axis linear guide the upper and lower ends of the flexible pipes were connected to the lower and middle aluminum alloy plates with universal joints the universal joints are capable of transferring power at various angles allowing the pipe groups to oscillate freely in both the cross flow cf and in line il directions the upper and middle aluminum alloy plates were connected with a symmetric multiphase rigid bar so that it can effectively transfer the top tension applied for the experiment through the pulley system and guarantee equal tension on all pipe structures the top tension was accurately measured using an external axt s 100 digital tensionometer the force sensor having a sensitivity of 1 5 3 0 mv v fig 2 shows real arrangement of the experiment 2 2 pipe group model and testing method 2 2 1 pipe group model and parameter selection organic glass pipes with external diameter 18 0 mm wall thickness 1 0 mm and effective length 2 0 m were used as the pipe model making sure that the mechanic performances of the pipes were highly consistent this was achieved through pre experiment calibration and multiple sampling by the pipe manufacturer to ensure that the pipes qualified for the experiment during the experiment the pipe group system remained in a standing posture in which the upper 1 2 m 60 was in air and the lower 0 8 m 40 was in a uniform flow huera huarte et al 2011 chaplin et al 2005 huera huarte et al 2014 and liquid was injected into the pipe the universal joints connecting the upper and lower ends of the pipe structure were fabricated at a machining workshop according to the design plan with a specifically designed machine tool table 1 presents the detailed parameters of the pipe model 2 2 2 test method and working principle fiber bragg grating fbg technique was used in our experiment and the fbg sensor is a wavelength modulation type optical fiber sensor that obtains sensing information by modulating the optical fiber bragg wavelength by external physical parameters and is made by utilizing the photosensitivity of the optical fiber material in principle it belongs to a light reflecting type device and a fiber grating sensor the working principle is shown in fig 3 the fbg sensor is made of the photosensitivity of optical fiber material the continuous broadband light emitted by the light source through the optical fiber is coupled with the optical field so that the broadband light is selectively reflected back to a corresponding narrow band light and returned along the original transmission fiber the remaining broadband light is transmitted directly through the past when the temperature or strain used for the fiber grating changes the wavelength of the narrow band light center reflected back will change linearly according to the coupled mode theory only the light wave that satisfies the bragg condition can be reflected which is expressed as 1 λ b 2n eff λ where λ b is the center wavelength of the reflected light wave of the fbg n eff is the effective refractive index of the core and λ is the fiber grating period when the temperature and stress of the fiber grating change the core effective refractive index n eff or the grating period λ changes and the central reflection wavelength also changes accordingly which is expressed as 2 δ λ b 1 p ε δ ε λ b α f ξ δ t λ b where δλ b is the amount of change in the center wavelength of the reflected light wave p ε is the effective elastic coefficient of the fiber δ ε is the amount of strain change δ t is the amount of temperature change α f is the thermal expansion coefficient of the fiber and ξ is the thermo optic coefficient of the fiber equation 2 reflects that the amount of change in the center wavelength of the fiber grating is linearly related to the strain change amount or the temperature change amount and the corresponding strain or temperature variable can be obtained by inverse calculation by the above formula to prevent potential impact of added mass on the experimental result and protect the strain sensitivity of the fbg from being affected four groups of bare fibers were installed along the pipe axis at 90 intervals 24 measuring points were designed for measuring the cf and il vibrations of the pipe structures considering the large number of measuring points the locations of the measuring points were each accurately positioned and marked on the pipe structure before they were attached in place after that when the waterproof adhesive was strong enough a demodulator was attached to check that all measuring points are functional the fibers beyond the measuring section were sealed with armored optical cable the equivalent roughness height of the pipe k d is 0 0083 and the included angle corresponding to the circumferential surface area covered is 0 947 chang et al 2011a b fig 4 shows the pipe model the measuring points and their distribution 2 3 design of pipe group arrangement the external flow velocity used in our experiment was u 0 1 0 6 m s the external flow velocity was measured by a doppler current profiler the current profiler is designed for measurable flow velocity 0 4 m s accuracy 0 5 1 mm s sampling output frequency 1 200 hz sampling point to probe distance 0 05 m diameter 6 0 mm height 3 0 15 0 mm acoustic frequency 10 mhz and intensity 25 db the sampling frequency can be automatically adjusted to prescribed parameters during the experiment the current profiler and pipe model were placed along the length of the water flume to avoid potential impacts of the current profiler induced vortex discharge on the experiment the current profiler was mounted 2 0 m right in front of the pipe model fig 5 shows the detailed arrangement of the experiment a three pipe model and a five pipe model were established to investigate the vortex shedding from a three pipe group in tandem side by side arrangement and a five pipe group in circular arrangement under variable spacing ratios and a three pipe group in tandem arrangement and a five pipe group in side by side arrangement under variable incidence angles in any of these cases the pipe structures are of equal diameter taking 4d as the sensitive spacing ji et al 2018 xu et al 2018a a total of 17 scenarios were designed these include a three pipe group in side by side and tandem arrangements under 4 spacing ratios s d 4 0 5 0 6 0 8 0 where s is the center to center distance between adjacent pipes and d is the diameter of the pipe structure a five pipe group in circular arrangement under 2 spacing ratios s d 4 0 6 0 a three pipe group under variable incidence angles α 0 30 45 60 90 and a five pipe group in side by side and tandem arrangements at s d 4 fig 6 table 2 presents more details about the pipe arrangement forms 3 data analysis methods 3 1 the processing of strain signal the fbg sensor was used to measure the dynamic strain values in the cf and il directions and averages the strains at the two measuring points in the symmetrical position to obtain the bending strain of the pipe as shown in equations 3 and 4 3 ε c f t ε c f 1 t ε c f 2 t 2 4 ε i l t ε i l 1 t ε i l 2 t 2 where ε cf t ε il t are the cf and il direction bending strain of the pipe caused by viv ε cf 1 t ε cf 2 t corresponds to two cf directions the strain time history obtained by the sensor ε il 1 t ε il 2 t is the strain time history obtained by eliminating the initial bending strain corresponding to the two sensors in the il direction 3 2 the method of obtaining displacement frequency spectrum analysis represents a basic analysis method for signal processing the time domain signals obtained are subject to fourier conversion and frequency domain information is obtained the positive transformation equation is shown as follows 5 f ω f t e i ω t d t where ω 2πf f t means time domain data series and f ω means spectrum function series of frequency domain as fourier transformation is continuous in itself the fast fourier transformation fft was adopted for solution due to frequency resolution and limited length of time domain signals the fft analysis result may have the probability of leakage thus windowing measures were adopted for elimination then the modal analysis approach was adopted to obtain the time varying displacement according to measured strain data the response displacement could be expressed as a weighted sum of mode shapes as follows 6 y z t n 1 ω n t ϕ n z z 0 l where z is the axial coordinate l is the length of the pipe t is the time ϕ n z denotes the mode function ω n t is the modal weights n 1 2 3 n the mode shapes of displacement can be expressed as 7 ϕ n sin n π z l z 0 l therefore the displacement function can be expressed as 8 y z t n 1 ω n t sin n π z l z 0 l by solving the weight function corresponding to each mode ω n t the displacement time history of each point of the pipe can be calculated 4 results 4 1 strouhal number of isolated pipe fig 7 shows the displacement and envelope diagram of the isolated pipe in both cf and il directions at u 0 45 m s the first column represents the displacement time history curve from the top to the bottom of the six points the second column represents the amplification of the displacement within 23 25s and the third column represents the vibration pattern of the pipe every 0 5s in the cf direction the three point displacement time history curve at z l 0 575 0 725 and 0 875 appears as double peak and at the fourth measurement point it appears as a single peak fig 8 shows the root mean square rms value of the displacement of an isolated pipe at various flow velocities in the cf and il directions the rms displacement can reflect the amplitude of the viv response of the pipe and the vibration shape and fatigue damage of the pipe are reflected as a whole the maximum displacement of the pipe viv is the basis for structural instability caused by excessive deformation it is an important parameter for judging whether there is a collision between the pipe groups strouhal number st f s d u f dy f 1 ur represents an important parameter for the wake flow of flexible pipes here f 1 is the first order natural frequency of the structure which is measured by the free decay test of the pipe filled with liquid in still water the frequency corresponding to the peak power spectral density is the cf dominant frequency f dy at this flow velocity which theoretically approximates the vortex shedding frequency f s gao et al 2015a b han et al 2017 xu et al 2017 xu et al 2018a 2018b fig 9 shows how the cf and il dimensionless dominant frequencies of an isolated pipe varied with reduced velocity at f d f 1 1 the vortex frequency of the pipe was close to the natural frequency of the structure thus intensifying the vibration in the structure the variations of the cf and il data points f dy f 1 and f dx f 1 with reduced velocity were linearly fitted using the least squares method the resulting slopes which are the representative strouhal numbers are 0 185 and 0 370 the slope of the fitting line with the change of il dimensionless dominant frequency with the change of reduced velocity is defined as k then k 2st these values well agree with the rule that the vibration frequency from il resistance is twice the vibration frequency from cf lift huera huarte and bearman 2009 song et al 2011 huera huarte et al 2014 xu et al 2018a 4 2 strouhal numbers of pipe groups under variable spacings 4 2 1 strouhal numbers of three pipes in tandem arrangement fig 10 shows how the cf dimensionless dominant frequency f d f 1 of a three pipe group in tandem arrangement varied with reduced velocity under four spacing ratios s d 4 5 6 8 here st 1 st 3 st 4 st 6 st 7 st 9 and st 10 st 12 are the strouhal numbers of the three pipes under spacing ratios s d 4 6 5 and 8 respectively in order to reflect the vortex shedding law of the pipe group preferably the strouhal number of each pipe at each spacing ratio was measured in this test from figs 10 and 11 whatever the spacing ratio the strouhal number reduced from the upstream pipe to the downstream pipe the wake effect from the upstream pipe caused changes in the flow field of the midstream and downstream pipes wake field caused a depletion in the surface velocities of the midstream and downstream pipes reducing the lift and drag that acted on these pipes shielding caused the flows of the midstream and downstream pipes to separate and the actual inflow velocities of the midstream and downstream pipes were reduced velocities as a result the dominant frequency of pipe vibration namely the vortex shedding frequency reduced that explains why the strouhal number reduced from upstream to downstream vortex shedding from the midstream and downstream pipes made some feedback to the upstream pipe but this feedback was quite modest the strouhal number of the upstream pipe was closest to that of the isolated pipe under all spacing ratios the strouhal number reduced from upstream to downstream however as spacing ratio increased the strouhal number difference among the three pipes first increased and then reduced maximizing at s d 6 wake interference affected the vortex shedding frequency in the wake of the midstream and downstream pipes significantly at this spacing ratio as can be observed in fig 11 from upstream to downstream the power density spectral peak of the pipe group first reduced and then increased this suggests that wake flow can both suppress and enhance pipe vortex shedding and under interference effect the interactions among pipes are bidirectional fig 12 shows how the slopes of the cf and il dimensionless dominant frequency fitting lines of the three pipes in tandem arrangement varied with spacing ratio here st and k represent the slopes of the fitting lines of the ratios between the cf il dominant frequencies and the natural frequency of flexible pipes as a function of reduced velocity in an isolated pipe test k 2st from figs 10 and 12 the strouhal numbers of the three pipe group increased reduced and then increased with increasing spacing ratio in all cases the cf to il dimensionless dominant frequency ratio of the upstream pipe was 2 1 meaning that the vibration frequency induced by il drag was twice the vibration frequency induced by cf lift which approximated what was observed for the isolated pipe it is further verified that the feedback to the upstream pipe from the midstream or downstream pipe was lesser for the midstream and downstream pipes the il to cf dominant frequency ratio was nearly 1 1 meaning that the dominant frequencies in the two directions were almost the same the two pipes were located in the shielding effect area of the upstream pipe the shielding effect has a greater impact on the middle and downstream pipes 4 2 2 strouhal numbers of three pipes in side by side arrangement fig 13 shows how the cf dimensionless dominant frequency f d f 1 of the three pipes in side by side arrangement varied with reduced velocity u r under four spacing ratios s d 4 5 6 8 at s d 4 the strouhal numbers of the three pipes were 0 1864 0 1743 and 0 1865 at s d 5 they were 0 1790 0 1756 and 0 1827 we can observe that at s d 4 and 5 the strouhal numbers of both side pipes were smaller than that of the central pipe this is because at low spacing ratios the vortex shedding from the two side pipes disturbed the flow field of the central pipe preventing the vortices from shedding at the separation point it caused the vibration of the central pipe to reduce and its strouhal number was lower than both of the side pipes interestingly at s 6 0d the dominant frequencies of the three pipes were highly consistent with that of the isolated pipe this suggests that at this spacing ratio the inter pipe clearance flow did not affect the vortex shedding frequency in the wake of the pipe significantly the inter pipe interference effect did not reduce linearly with increasing spacing ratio at s d 6 the interference was the weakest at s d 8 0 strouhal numbers of the three pipes were high and the interference effect between the three pipes did not weaken at large spacing ratios the interference effect among three pipes in side by side arrangement is not ignorable fig 14 shows how the slopes of the cf and il dimensionless dominant frequency fitting lines of the three pipes in side by side arrangement varied with spacing ratio s d under variable spacing ratios the interference effect of clearance flow on the pipe k il is stronger than st cf for the two side pipes their cf to il dimensionless dominant frequency ratios approximated 2 1 both vortex shedding does not reflect certain symmetry and because of the influence of the clearance flow on both sides of the pipe the flow field of the pipe b has become an unstable flow field making its k value far from 0 37 at s d 4 0 5 0 and 8 0 in particular at s d 6 the slope k of the il fitting line reduced sharply the cf to il dimensionless dominant frequency ratio of the midstream pipe was no longer 2 1 4 2 3 strouhal numbers of five pipes in circular arrangement in order to take a closer look at how strouhal number would be affected by the number of flexible pipes and a more complicated arrangement form a further experiment was conducted on a five pipe group in circular arrangement under variable spacing ratios s d 4 6 fig 15 shows how the cf dimensionless dominant frequencies of the five pipes in circular arrangement vary with reduced velocity u r the detailed arrangement of the five pipes is illustrated in fig 6 c here a is the upstream pipe b and c are midstream pipes and d and e are downstream pipes pipes b and c are axially symmetric along the direction of inflow so do pipes d and e at s d 4 the strouhal numbers of the upstream pipe a midstream pipes b and c and downstream pipes d and e are 0 1722 0 1951 0 1820 0 1644 and 0 1586 at s d 6 their strouhal numbers are 0 1787 0 1916 0 1709 0 2082 and 0 1715 under both spacing ratios the midstream pipe b showed a higher strouhal number than pipe c and the downstream pipe d had a higher strouhal number than pipe e there was an apparent asymmetry between st 2 and st 3 and between st 4 and st 5 deflection of the wake flow of the upstream pipe caused the strouhal numbers of the midstream pipes namely pipes b and c to become asymmetric as the clearance flow between these two midstream pipes deflected to the two downstream pipes the doubly deflected incoming flow resulted in different near wake regions and different vortex shedding frequencies as well as different vortex shedding forms and peripheral flow configurations between these downstream pipes between the two spacing ratios the pipes displayed different trends when the spacing increased from 4d to 6d the strouhal number of the upstream pipe increased the strouhal numbers of the two midstream pipes both reduced and those of the downstream pipes were just the opposite at s d 4 the strouhal numbers of the upstream midstream and downstream pipes showed a weak strong weak profile whereas at s d 6 they displayed a strong weak strong profile this indicates the vortex shedding from the upstream pipe affected the downstream pipes both in the positive and negative directions this is because in the presence of water flow the wake vortex from the upstream pipe will act on the midstream and downstream pipes leading to a change in their vibration mode which became a superposition of the wake induced vibration from the front pipe with its own viv and this is not a simple linear superimposition different spacings and the presence of different degrees of interference effect will result in the vibration of flexible pipes being offset or enhanced reynolds number r e u d ν can be used to describe the flow status of fluids its relation with strouhal number s t f s d u satisfies the relation s t d 2 f s ν r e here ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid d is the hydraulic radius namely the external diameter of the flexible pipe in our experiment f s is the vortex shedding frequency which approximates the dominant vibration frequency f d of the structure this approximation theory agrees with what is described in the previous text hence we have s t d 2 f d ν r e fig 16 shows how the strouhal numbers of the pipes varied with reynolds number under variable spacings and the degree of dispersion of the data reflects the strength of the interference effect of each pipe under the corresponding reynolds number the more concentrated the data is near st 0 185 that is the closer the strouhal numbers of the isolated pipe is indicating that the smaller the degree of dispersion of the data the weaker the pipe will be subjected to interference effects in all cases of variable spacings the strouhal number of pipe c at side by side three pipe group is the largest at 8d with a value of 0 30 the strouhal number of downstream pipe at 6d of the tandem three pipe group is the smallest with a value of 0 091 the strouhal numbers of the five pipe groups are more concentrated than those of the three pipe groups the strouhal numbers of the three pipe groups became more dispersive with increasing spacing ratio the vortex shedding frequencies of five pipe groups are commonly higher than those of the five pipe groups the rms value of the strouhal number under the variable spacing test is 0 183 and the strouhal numbers are concentrated in 0 15 0 24 as shown in the gray area at lower reynolds number the dominant frequency is more sensitive to flow velocity interference smaller flow disturbances cause the strouhal number of the pipe group to fluctuate greatly at around re 4500 the strouhal numbers are concentrated on the order of 0 2 as shown in the orange area which is the closest to the strouhal number of an isolated pipe as reynolds number increases later the interference effect is relatively strong and the pipe viv is enhanced or suppressed to varying degrees resulting in a wider strouhal number distribution 4 3 strouhal numbers of pipes under variable incidence angles 4 3 1 strouhal numbers of three pipes arranged at variable incidence angles fig 17 shows how the cf dimensionless dominant frequencies of the three pipes varied with reduced velocity u r at spacing ratio s d 4 under five different incidence angles 0 30 45 60 90 here α 0 and α 90 correspond to the tandem and side by side arrangements of the three pipes here st 1 st 3 st 4 st 6 st 7 st 9 st 10 st 12 and st 13 st 15 are the strouhal numbers of pipes a b and c under these five incidence angles we can observe that as the incidence angle increased the strouhal numbers of the pipes first increased and then reduced the difference however is that pipe a reached its maximum strouhal number at α 45 for pipes b and c the incidence angle at which they reached their maximum strouhal numbers was α 60 this is because within the α 30 60 interval as the incidence angle increases the increase of the cf spacing between the pipes results in the decrease of the interference effect of the clearance flow and the impact of the vortex shedding from the upstream pipe on the downstream pipes gradually moves backward too except at α 0 when the strouhal number gradually reduced backward at all other angles the side pipes had a greater strouhal number than the midstream pipe this suggests that the vortex shedding of the pipe a and c disturbs the flow field of the inter pipe b resulting in a change in its vibration mode which generally reduces the vortex vibration frequency of the inter pipe it is further explained that in the presence of inference effects clearance flow and wake induced vibration act on vortex shedding in two ways they can enhance or suppress the vortex shedding frequency this concurs with our previous conclusion about the strouhal number of a three pipe group in tandem arrangement under variable spacing ratios furthermore for the absolute majority of flow velocities the pipes showed obvious cf and il dominant frequency characteristics nevertheless from the power spectral density diagram of pipe b at α 60 under flow velocity 0 6 m s fig 18 the cf dominant frequency characteristics were quite obvious whereas in the il direction the dominant frequency characteristic is not obvious the multi frequency feature manifests as a wider frequency distribution range and wake shielding and interference effect constitute key factors to the presence of multi frequency peaks in pipe power density spectra fig 19 shows how the slope of the cf and il dimensionless dominant frequency fitting line of the three pipes varied with incidence angle α except at α 0 when the slopes of pipes b and c were k 2 st 2 and k 3 st 3 in the overwhelming majority of the cases the slope ratio between the two directions was approximately 2 1 this suggests that the midstream and downstream pipes were more exposed to the interferences of the wake induced vibration from the upstream pipe resulting in considerably different lift and drag variations at α 30 45 and 60 the downstream pipe was in the skewed flow of the upstream pipe the gradual increase in the incidence angle caused the downstream pipe to gradually deflect from the wake region behind the upstream pipe the interferences between the adjacent pipes attenuated and the vortex shedding form changed as the incidence angle becomes larger the downstream gradually leaves the shielding effect region and the wake interference effect of the upstream pipe on the middle and downstream pipes becomes smaller 4 3 2 strouhal numbers of five pipes arranged at variable incidence angles fig 20 shows how the cf dimensionless dominant frequencies of the five pipes varied with reduced velocity u r at spacing ratio s d 4 under two incidence angles α 0 90 from top to bottom the pipes are numbered a b c d and e when in tandem arrangement namely at α 0 the strouhal numbers of the five pipe group showed a reduction and increase trend from top to bottom being st 1 0 1752 st 2 0 1668 st 3 0 1395 st 4 0 1471 and st 5 0 1665 the dimensionless dominant frequency of the upstream pipe showed a similar variation as that of an isolated pipe or the upstream pipe of the three pipe group in tandem arrangement its strouhal number was greater than that of the upstream pipe of the three pipe group at s d 4 and slightly smaller than that of the isolated pipe the wake induced vibration from the upstream pipe also suppressed the increase in the vortex shedding frequency so that the stroual numbers of the four pipes in the midstream and downstream were less than 0 185 of the isolated pipe for a five pipe group in side by side arrangement namely when α 90 the strouhal numbers of the pipes were st 6 0 2274 st 7 0 2465 st 8 0 2224 st 9 0 2262 st 10 0 2132 which are all greater than that of an isolated pipe as can be analyzed from fig 20 all dotted lines are located above the solid lines meaning that the strouhal numbers of the pipe group in side by side arrangement were greater than in tandem arrangement in all cases the strong interference effect among pipes subjected to clearance flow constitutes the key factor to increased vortex shedding frequencies and the shielding effect is more prominent in the five pipe group in tandem arrangement fig 21 shows how the il and cf dominant frequencies of a five pipe group varied with reduced velocity u r among the five pipes in tandem arrangement fig 21 a as with an isolated pipe the cross line to il dominant frequency ratios of the upstream pipes a and b were both 2 1 that of the midstream pipe c was close to 2 1 at u r 3 4 5 1 and fluctuated near 1 with increasing reduced velocity the dominant frequencies of the downstream pipes d and e were heavily unstable in both directions resulting in a very great variation in the dominant frequency ratio in fact at u r 5 89 pipe d had a greater dominant frequency in the cf direction than in the il direction at u r 1 68 5 05 pipe e showed a fairly unstable cf to il dominant frequency ratio which fluctuated near 1 with the further increase of reduced velocity comparatively for the five pipe group in side by side arrangement fig 21 b the cf to il dominant frequency ratios showed a more regular variation as shown in fig 21 when u r 5 05 7 58 this value was close to 2 1 when u r 1 68 4 20 and u r 8 42 10 10 the dominant frequencies in both directions were quite unstable as reduced velocity increased the ratio fluctuated near 1 ding et al 2013 this means that pipe c was subjected to a group of approximately equal reversed forces the dominant frequency ratio of pipe e althrough subjected to clearance flow from one side approximated that of pipe c the dominant frequency of pipe a however was seriously unstable at high reduced velocities the dominant frequency ratio was almost 4 and the cf dominant frequency was far smaller than the il dominant frequency no consistency in dominant frequency ratio was observed between pipe a and pipe e which were symmetrically positioned increasing the number of five pipe group results in more complex deflection and clearance flow and the superposition of interference effects is more significant fig 22 shows how the strouhal numbers of the pipes varied with reynolds number under variable incidence angles in all cases of variable angles the strouhal number of the most downstream pipe of the five pipe group in tandem is the largest with a value of 0 345 the strouhal number in the middle pipe c of the three pipe group in side by side is the smallest with a value of 0 096 under variable angles the three pipe group showed a more concentrated strouhal number distribution whereas the strouhal numbers of the five pipe group at α 90 are generally greater than at α 0 compared with section 4 2 it is found that the re 6400 corresponding to the most concentrated strouhal number when changing the incidence angle is significantly larger than the case with variable spacings re 4500 as shown in the orange area and under variable angles the rms strouhal number is 0 192 which is greater than 0 183 under variable spacing from figs 16 and 22 as reynolds number varied the strouhal numbers distribution first converged and then diverged although under different incidence angles strouhal numbers are concentrated at 0 17 0 23 as shown in the gray area in fig 22 the strouhal numbers of the pipes are more discretized than under different spacing ratios and the more scattered data points are reflected in the 0 arrangement the multiple shielding effect is vividly reflected on the pipe e which makes the strouhal number jumping strong which is also the key factor that the strouhal number distribution is more dispersed compared with the pipe group at variable spacings 5 discussion for an isolated pipe in the subcritical reynolds region that is when 300 re 3 105 the strouhal number stabilizes at around 0 20 in the critical reynolds region that is when 3 105 re 3 106 the level of the strouhal number is associated with the turbulence intensity of the flow the higher the turbulence intensity the greater the strouhal number the randomness of vortex shedding within this region makes it impossible to determine the strouhal number accurately enough in the supercritical reynolds region that is when re 3 106 the strouhal number stabilizes at approximately 0 27 braza et al 1986 roushan and wu 2005 studies have demonstrated that strouhal number stabilizes at around 0 20 in our experiment the strouhal number of an isolated pipe was 0 185 which is in the normal range gao y 2015 fig 23 shows the strouhal numbers in all tested cases under coupled interferences only 16 9 of the flexible pipes were within the st 0 185 0 2 interval which is considerably different from that of an isolated pipe most of the pipes have a strouhal number lower than st 0 185 in particular for a five pipe group in side by side arrangement in which case all pipes had a strouhal number greater than 0 20 correlation coefficient r as an important parameter for curve fitting can intuitively reflect the quality of the fitted value the greater the correlation coefficient r the closer the test value is to the fitted value and consequently the better the degree of curve fitting when r 0 8 1 0 the test value is very strongly correlated to the fitted value when r 0 6 0 8 the test value is strongly correlated to the fitted value when r 0 4 0 6 the test value is moderately correlated to the fitted value by comparing the corresponding dimensionless dominant frequencies in the line from least squares method with the original ones we yielded the correlation coefficients r from the linearly fitted correlation coefficients r in 17 different cases shown in fig 24 to determine the accuracy level of the fitting line as can be observed from fig 24 that 74 6 of the correlation coefficient r points fall within the 0 9 1 0 interval 18 6 of the points fall within the 0 8 0 9 interval only 6 8 fall below 0 8 overall the fitting degree is fairly good furthermore as can be observed from figs 23 and 24 the fitting quality of strouhal number makes little difference to the value of strouhal number itself for three pipes in tandem arrangement the strouhal numbers gradually reduced from top to bottom in all cases but at s d 4 the strouhal number of the upstream pipe gave a correlation coefficient of nearly 1 whereas those of the midstream and downstream pipes were both on the order of 0 8 at s d 5 all three pipes gave a correlation coefficient of nearly 1 at s d 6 the correlation coefficient first reduced and then increased at s d 8 the correlation coefficient gradually reduced for three pipes in side by side arrangement at s d 4 or 5 the midstream pipe had a smaller strouhal number than the side pipes in both cases as the spacing ratio increased the variation of strouhal number was no longer obvious with the correlation coefficients being close to 1 for all pipes for five pipes in circular arrangement at s d 4 or 6 the strouhal numbers showed an increase and reduction trend from top to bottom in all cases but the correlation coefficient r stayed within the 0 9 1 interval the fitting degree is quite good the correlation coefficient is the same when the three pipe groups are arranged at α 30 60 but the strouhal numbers are small in the middle and large on both sides for five pipes in tandem arrangement under variable incidence angles except the upstream pipe which had a strouhal number close to that of an isolated pipe all other pipes gave a smaller strouhal number than that of an isolated pipe however the upstream pipe showed a correlation coefficient r of only 0 67 and the other pipes had a strouhal number correlation coefficient within the 0 9 1 interval when in side by side arrangement all five pipes had a far greater strouhal number than an isolated pipe although three of them had a strouhal number correlation coefficient of merely around 0 8 fig 25 shows how strouhal number varies with reynolds number in all cases of variable spacings and angles obviously the strouhal numbers of the pipes are more concentrated at the intermediate flow velocity than at the low or high flow velocity showing a dumbbell distribution within the tested flow velocities the author performs regional integration on the data points in the figure takes the upper and lower limits of the strouhal numbers under each reynolds number and calculates the rms curves of st max and st min as the blue and black dotted lines in fig 25 the two curves are approximately parallel and gradually decrease with the increase of reynolds number the region enclosed by the two curves is the st re evolution region of under interference effect that is the effective interference region fig 26 shows the st re relation curves in rms terms s t 8 8 10 17 r e 4 2 4 e 10 12 r e 3 2 3 10 8 r e 2 0 0001 r e 0 37 in this st re model the effective interference region is divided into interference enhancement and suppression region it can serve as an empirical formula for coupled wake and clearance flow interferences to estimate the strouhal number within different reynolds numbers when the strouhal number falls in the orange area between the red solid line and the blue dotted line that is the strouhal number is greater than the rms curve it means that the strouhal number in this area exceeds the rms strouhal number in the pipe group with variable angle and spacing that is to say the strouhal number of the pipe group under the interference effect has a certain degree of enhancement significance this area is defined as the interference enhancement area on the contrary the strouhal number falls in the blue area between the solid red line and the black dotted line that is the strouhal number is less than the rms curve which indicates that the strouhal number in this area is lower than the rms strouhal number of the pipe group with variable angle and spacing that is to say the strouhal number of the pipe group under the interference effect has a certain degree of weaken significance this area is defined as the interference suppression area the fitted curve was basically smooth the good consistency between the interference enhancement and suppression regions in boundary variation points to a series of steady states for wake and clearance flows fig 27 shows the residual bar chart of the fourth order fitted rms strouhal number data points the fitting residual mode is δ 1 5074e 14 the probability of the standardized residual of the test points falling beyond the 2 2 interval is 0 which is far smaller than 0 05 hence this st re model provides a relatively high goodness of fit based on figs 25 and 26 it can be seen that the tandem arrangement significantly suppresses the interference and the strouhal number overall and has a greater impact on the downstream pipe in the three pipe group on the contrary when arranged side by side both interference and strouhal number are enhanced to varying degrees the effect of the change on the increase or decrease of the strouhal number is non linear and the three pipes arranged in tandem have the largest difference when s d 6 at this time the wake interference effect has a significant impact on the vortex shedding frequency of the middle and downstream pipes when the angle increases in variable angle arrangement the role of the gap flow gradually replaces the shielding effect to dominate and the interval where the strouhal number is located gradually shifts from the interference enhancement region to the interference suppression region in order to further analyze the st re relationship of the pipe group under coupled wake interference effect the strouhal number in the subcritical reynolds region involved in this paper is compared with the data of previous studies griffin 1978 king et al 1973 xu et al 2004 resvanis et al 2013 to obtain fig 28 and its reference conditions are listed in table 3 through comparison the absolute majority of strouhal number variations as a function of reynolds number fell within the st re evolution region established in this paper for both single and double pipes and these variations were quite similar with increasing reynolds number particularly both the points of griffin and king for single pipe fluctuated near the st re curve in rms terms in the st re evolution region the difference is that the strouhal number of the isolated pipe in the literature varies slightly with the reynolds number but the st re relationship curve fitted in this paper has a significant downward trend with the increase of the reynolds number resulting in the st re relationship curve at high reynolds number basically located near the strouhal number of the isolated pipe and slightly higher than the isolated pipe at low reynolds number it shows that the interference effect can increase the vortex shedding frequency to a certain extent at low reynolds number thereby increasing the strouhal number the strouhal numbers that change with the reynolds number in the reference are all within the st re effective area summarized by the author and most of them are concentrated near the st re relation curve indicating that the effective area of interference can better reflect the interference effects to strouhal number it is noted however that the st re evolution region established in this paper was based on the interference effect within pipe groups the rms relation curve was also one in rms terms that describes how strouhal number varies with reynolds number for all cases tested fitted the rms curves of st max and st min after integrating the regions of strouhal numbers at all data points for all cases tested as marked by the red lines in fig 28 this curve is of more engineering importance as it describes how strouhal number varies with reynolds number for a pipe group subjected to interference effect rather than for an isolated pipe 6 conclusions in this paper the responses of the strouhal numbers of a three pipe and a five pipe groups in different arrangements to coupled interferences are investigated under variable flow velocities inter pipe spacing ratios and incidence angles the following conclusions are drawn 1 for three pipes in tandem arrangement at variable spacings the strouhal numbers displayed a gradual reduction from top to bottom in all cases the cf to il dimensionless dominant frequency ratio of the upstream pipe was 2 1 in call cases as does that of an isolated pipe influenced by the shielding effect of upstream pipe midstream and downstream pipes displayed a ratio close to 1 1 for three pipes in side by side arrangement at variable spacings at a small spacing ratio the midstream pipe gave a smaller strouhal number than the side pipe as the spacing ratio increases the interference effect between pipes does not decrease linearly at large spacing ratios the interference effect among three pipes in side by side arrangement is not ignorable for five pipes in circular arrangement the strouhal numbers between symmetric locations were obviously asymmetric the strouhal number of the upstream pipe was close to that of the upstream pipe of a three pipe group under variable spacings whereas the strouhal numbers of the midstream and downstream pipes varied asymmetrically 2 for three pipes arranged at variable incidence angles the strouhal numbers of all pipes displayed an increase and reduction trend with increasing incidence angle however pipes b and c reached their maximum strouhal numbers at α 90 which is 15 later than pipe a at the intermediate reduced velocity the pipes stabilized at around 2 1 for five pipes arranged variable incidence angles α 0 90 when in the cf direction namely when α 0 the strouhal numbers of the five pipes displayed a reduction and increase trend from upstream to downstream the multiple shielding effects make the strouhal numbers jump more strongly and the strouhal numbers distribution of the pipe group with variable incidence angles is more dispersed than that of the pipe groups with variable spacings 3 interferences changed the vortex shedding frequencies on the sides of the pipes spacing ratio and incidence angle variations made a great difference to the strouhal numbers of both a three pipe and a five pipe group most of the pipes gave a smaller strouhal number than an isolated pipe only 16 9 of the pipes fell within the st 0 185 0 20 interval 4 the st re evolution region and segmentation criteria for flow around flexible pipe groups were established within the subcritical reynolds numbers a st re relation model in rms terms within this range was yielded the st re relation curve in rms terms is of more engineering importance as it describes how strouhal number varies with reynolds number for a pipe group subjected to interference effect rather than for an isolated pipe through a viv experiment on flexible pipes in group of three and five subjected in uniform flow under coupled interferences we revealed the dynamic evolution of strouhal number and developed a st re model for flow around flexible pipe groups our results can provide theoretical support for the design and arrangement of pipe groups and better guide engineering practices nevertheless there is still something we didn t address in our study the increase rate of spacing ratio and incidence angle was quite large more importantly only two arrangement forms were assumed for five pipes in circular arrangement and five pipes under variable incidence angles the next step would be to build a model for circular arrangement under more spacing ratios and for contingency type arrangement under more incidence angles so as to further modify the present dynamic

21575,in this paper a strouhal reynolds number evolution region for the pipe groups within the subcritical reynolds number range is established and a strouhal reynolds number relation curve in root mean square terms is yielded for the first time a strouhal reynolds number model for flow around flexible pipes under 180 sets of test is presented the least squares method is used to fit the strouhal numbers among the pipes within their flow velocity intervals isolated pipe is introduced as reference cases for examining how the strouhal numbers of the pipes vary with reynolds number the results indicate that when in tandem arrangement the strouhal number of the three pipe group showed a gradual reduction from upstream to downstream whereas both vortex shedding enhancement and suppression occurred in the five pipe group interferences contributed to the vortex shedding in the wake flow of the pipes in side by side arrangement it is also found that interferences significantly changed the vortex shedding frequencies on both rear sides of the pipes only 16 9 of the strouhal numbers of the three pipe and five pipe group fell within 0 185 0 20 which is largely different from conventional cognition of the strouhal number within the subcritical reynolds number range keywords strouhal number reynolds number pipe groups interference effect spacing incidence angle 1 introduction fluid flow around non streamlined bluff bodies plays a critical role in many aerodynamic and hydrodynamic applications such as submarine pipelines mooring systems aircraft trains chimneys and bridges when the fluid flows past a structure alternately shedding vortices are generated downstream of the structure leading to vortex induced vibration viv during this process the fluid flow velocity is controlled by reynolds number re re ul v where u is the outflow velocity l is the characteristic length e g hydrodynamic diameter and v is the fluid kinematic viscosity for these periodical nonsteady flows the vortex shedding frequency is generally presented in a dimensionless form namely strouhal number st st fl u and on this ground strouhal number is used to describe the similarity criterion for flow unsteadiness here f is the vortex discharge frequency over the past decades the st re variability has been widely studied for its fundamental and practical significances roshko 1954 williamson et al 1986a b ahlborn et al 2002 ponta 2006 radi et al 2013 han et al 2014 bot et al 2014 various parametric forms of st re relations have been developed based on observations of structures subjected to vortex streets strouhal number covers a wide area of research in aerospace application high lift devices generate asymmetric wakes that impact the aerodynamic and aeroacoustic performances of airplanes in the literature there is no consensus about whether the shear reduces or increases the strouhal number of vortex shedding gennaro et al 2013 analyzed the linear stability of asymmetric wake profiles and proved that the dominant strouhal number reduces with increasing asymmetry kang et al 2011 described how chordwise spanwise and isotropic flexibilities affect flapping generation and propulsion efficiency and established the relations between propulsion force and maximum relative wing tip deformation parameters in wind stability researches of bridges the valuation of strouhal number directly decides the accuracy of the predicted viv wind velocity over real bridges chen et al 1996 discovered that at low incidence angles reynolds number can make a greater difference as a result of flow reattachments liu et al 2010 also yielded a remarkable reynolds number effect on the strouhal number of a bridge section during maritime navigation as the mast is located at the highest point of a ship and therefore greatly affects the stealth of the ship it is very important to investigate the wind load distribution on typical closed integrated masts and examine how average pressure coefficient pulsating pressure coefficient and strouhal number vary with reynolds number shojaeefard et al 2018 developed a numerical approach for calculating the stability derivatives of autonomous underwater vehicle auv and observed how strouhal number affects these coefficients he discovered that dimensionless damping coefficient is largely dependent on strouhal number especially at high frequencies except longitudinal damping coefficient whereas changes in strouhal number do not make much difference to added mass coefficient marine animals whether tadpoles or whales each have their own strouhal numbers during swimming nudds et al 2014 villeger et al 2014 eloy 2012 chao et al 2018 rohr et al 2004 claimed that the relations between the swimming efficiencies of fish or whales and the cyclic frequency of strokes and between peak amplitude and average speed also satisfy the strouhal number relations with a strouhal number ranging from 0 20 to 0 40 in transportation higher reynolds numbers give rise to high turbulences in a high speed train containing numerous vortex structures on both the spatial and temporal scales hence a better understanding of the flow dynamics is fundamental to minimizing the potential negative impacts caused by the train side flow field li et al 2019 reviewed the existence of dual zones and confined the strouhal number of wake aerodynamics to 0 15 scarabino et al 2005 investigated the boom girder of a 100 m tall port crane and yielded the resistance coefficient values of low turbulences and turbulences characterized by atmospheric boundary laver wind in three wind directions and the strouhal number of an approximate trapezoid section for reynolds numbers 30000 180000 in a marine structure peng et al 2008 made an experimental investigation on the strouhal number of flow past a double triangular bluff body in a 50 mm diameter circular pipe and yielded the vortex shedding frequency by examining two side by side square column structures yen et al 2011 revealed that the highest strouhal number arised under single column arrangement and the lowest occurred under gap flow burattini et al 2013 calculated the flow around a pair of side by side square cylinders in a two dimensional passage for reynolds number 73 at spacing ratios 0 5 6 and discovered that relative coefficient changes largely while strouhal number is almost a constant that approximates 0 16 in marine engineering when the natural frequency of a pipe structure equals to the vortex shedding frequency resonance will arise leading to fatigue damage in the structure and consequently a shorter service life for the structure hence it is very important to investigate the strouhal number behavior for different flow conditions so far researches on strouhal number are virtually confined to isolated single pipe or double pipe models li and sumner 2009 used a power spectral density diagram to demonstrate how strouhal number on the surface of cylinders in a circular arrangement changes as a result of the side walls and free inflows gnanaskandan and mahesh 2016 observed that the strouhal number corresponding to vortex shedding reduces with the emergence of cavitating flow jiang and cheng 2017 proposed a deterministic method that improves the separation velocity and wake width making it possible to estimate the strouhal number of trails more accurately they also discovered that flow around dual pipes in tandem arrangement is highly dependent on spacing ratio s d and incidence angle α as s d or α varies great changes take place in the vortex shedding frequency and viv characteristics of each of the pipes sumner et al 2008 examined the strouhal numbers of two pipes under variable spacing ratios and angles they categorized the spacing of pipes as small medium and large spacings and yielded the peak strouhal number variation at α 9 in their investigation of a p d α figuration sumner et al 2003 and akosile et al 2003 also failed to discover a relatively regular strouhal number to indicate weakening or disappearing vortex shedding movement sumner assumed that in a simple vortex shedding region the strouhal number approximates a half of the strouhal number of a single circular cylinder in a skewed flow region two strouhal number values can be yielded at particular reynolds numbers and measuring positions in a vortex shedding region of double circular cylinders in tandem arrangement the strouhal number approximates that of a single circular cylinder nevertheless restricted by the limited experimental data available from previous studies we are yet not very clear about the variation of strouhal number and its sensitivity to incidence angle for example the internal and external peak lifts the position on the downstream circular cylinder corresponding to the maximum inward average lift determined by zdravkovich and pridden 1977 may correspond to strouhal number through investigation on flow patterns sumner et al 2000 indicated that strouhal number is possibly more closely related to single shear layers than it is to single pipes through hot wire measurement and laser induced fluorescence lif flow visualization zhou 2003 and xu 2004 experimented the strouhal number in the wake of two in line circular cylinders for re 800 4 2 104 and center to center distance l d 1 15 and proved that way in which strouhal number varies with l d is determined by flow state xu et al 2019 carried out a series of experimental studies on flow induced vibration fiv of two identical elastically mounted circular cylinders in tandem arrangement and found that when ur 12 the vibration of and the fluid force on the downstream cylinder are obviously influenced by the upstream cylinder for the spacing range tested the existing research does not propose a clear st re relation model for the pipe groups with coupled interference effects the dynamic evolution mechanism of the fluid strouhal number under the action of flexible pipe groups is rarely reported in this paper an experimental investigation is conducted on how the viv strouhal numbers of pipe groups in different arrangement forms respond to coupled wake interferences the inter pipe dynamic behaviors of a three pipe group in tandem side by side arrangement and a five pipe group in circular arrangement under variable spacing ratios and of a three pipe group in tandem arrangement and a five pipe group in side by side arrangement under variable incidence angles are observed by changing the external flow velocity u 0 1 0 6 m s in the subcritical reynolds region inter pipe spacing ratio s d and incidence angle α so as to explore the mechanisms behind strouhal number and vortex shedding a st re model for flow around flexible pipe groups is built it adds to the st re parametric relations for pipe groups subjected to coupled interferences 2 experimental set up 2 1 test apparatus the experiment was carried out in the hydrodynamics laboratory ocean university of china fig 1 shows the overall arrangement of the experiment the combined wave current water flume measures 1 0 m across with the maximum water depth of 1 0 m maximum flow velocity of 0 8 m s and maximum wave height of 0 3 m the flume was sided with toughened glass partitioned with steel columns and bottomed with steel plate which can be used for fixing the pipe support a number of bidirectional symmetric inclined supports were designed to prevent the supporting structure from oscillating with external flow the bottom of the supporting device was welded to the flume at a number of points using high tensile bolts at the center of the supporting device two crossbars were attached to the edge of the flume with g clamps to ensure stability of the entire system inside the supporting device three fluted aluminum alloy securing plates were installed such that they move freely with the help of the sbr sliding block and the sbr optical axis linear guide the upper and lower ends of the flexible pipes were connected to the lower and middle aluminum alloy plates with universal joints the universal joints are capable of transferring power at various angles allowing the pipe groups to oscillate freely in both the cross flow cf and in line il directions the upper and middle aluminum alloy plates were connected with a symmetric multiphase rigid bar so that it can effectively transfer the top tension applied for the experiment through the pulley system and guarantee equal tension on all pipe structures the top tension was accurately measured using an external axt s 100 digital tensionometer the force sensor having a sensitivity of 1 5 3 0 mv v fig 2 shows real arrangement of the experiment 2 2 pipe group model and testing method 2 2 1 pipe group model and parameter selection organic glass pipes with external diameter 18 0 mm wall thickness 1 0 mm and effective length 2 0 m were used as the pipe model making sure that the mechanic performances of the pipes were highly consistent this was achieved through pre experiment calibration and multiple sampling by the pipe manufacturer to ensure that the pipes qualified for the experiment during the experiment the pipe group system remained in a standing posture in which the upper 1 2 m 60 was in air and the lower 0 8 m 40 was in a uniform flow huera huarte et al 2011 chaplin et al 2005 huera huarte et al 2014 and liquid was injected into the pipe the universal joints connecting the upper and lower ends of the pipe structure were fabricated at a machining workshop according to the design plan with a specifically designed machine tool table 1 presents the detailed parameters of the pipe model 2 2 2 test method and working principle fiber bragg grating fbg technique was used in our experiment and the fbg sensor is a wavelength modulation type optical fiber sensor that obtains sensing information by modulating the optical fiber bragg wavelength by external physical parameters and is made by utilizing the photosensitivity of the optical fiber material in principle it belongs to a light reflecting type device and a fiber grating sensor the working principle is shown in fig 3 the fbg sensor is made of the photosensitivity of optical fiber material the continuous broadband light emitted by the light source through the optical fiber is coupled with the optical field so that the broadband light is selectively reflected back to a corresponding narrow band light and returned along the original transmission fiber the remaining broadband light is transmitted directly through the past when the temperature or strain used for the fiber grating changes the wavelength of the narrow band light center reflected back will change linearly according to the coupled mode theory only the light wave that satisfies the bragg condition can be reflected which is expressed as 1 λ b 2n eff λ where λ b is the center wavelength of the reflected light wave of the fbg n eff is the effective refractive index of the core and λ is the fiber grating period when the temperature and stress of the fiber grating change the core effective refractive index n eff or the grating period λ changes and the central reflection wavelength also changes accordingly which is expressed as 2 δ λ b 1 p ε δ ε λ b α f ξ δ t λ b where δλ b is the amount of change in the center wavelength of the reflected light wave p ε is the effective elastic coefficient of the fiber δ ε is the amount of strain change δ t is the amount of temperature change α f is the thermal expansion coefficient of the fiber and ξ is the thermo optic coefficient of the fiber equation 2 reflects that the amount of change in the center wavelength of the fiber grating is linearly related to the strain change amount or the temperature change amount and the corresponding strain or temperature variable can be obtained by inverse calculation by the above formula to prevent potential impact of added mass on the experimental result and protect the strain sensitivity of the fbg from being affected four groups of bare fibers were installed along the pipe axis at 90 intervals 24 measuring points were designed for measuring the cf and il vibrations of the pipe structures considering the large number of measuring points the locations of the measuring points were each accurately positioned and marked on the pipe structure before they were attached in place after that when the waterproof adhesive was strong enough a demodulator was attached to check that all measuring points are functional the fibers beyond the measuring section were sealed with armored optical cable the equivalent roughness height of the pipe k d is 0 0083 and the included angle corresponding to the circumferential surface area covered is 0 947 chang et al 2011a b fig 4 shows the pipe model the measuring points and their distribution 2 3 design of pipe group arrangement the external flow velocity

vortex discharge on the experiment the current profiler was mounted 2 0 m right in front of the pipe model fig 5 shows the detailed arrangement of the experiment a three pipe model and a five pipe model were established to investigate the vortex shedding from a three pipe group in tandem side by side arrangement and a five pipe group in circular arrangement under variable spacing ratios and a three pipe group in tandem arrangement and a five pipe group in side by side arrangement under variable incidence angles in any of these cases the pipe structures are of equal diameter taking 4d as the sensitive spacing ji et al 2018 xu et al 2018a a total of 17 scenarios were designed these include a three pipe group in side by side and tandem arrangements under 4 spacing ratios s d 4 0 5 0 6 0

pipe group under variable incidence angles α 0 30 45 60 90 and a five pipe group in side by side and tandem arrangements at s d 4 fig 6 table 2 presents more details about the pipe arrangement forms 3 data analysis methods 3 1 the processing of strain signal the fbg sensor was used to measure the dynamic strain values in the cf and il directions and averages the strains at the two measuring points in the symmetrical position to obtain the bending strain of the pipe as shown in equations 3 and 4 3 ε c f t ε c f 1 t ε c f 2 t 2 4 ε i l t ε i l 1 t ε i l 2 t 2 where ε cf t ε il t are the cf and il direction bending strain of the pipe caused by viv ε cf 1 t ε cf 2 t corresponds to two cf directions the strain time history obtained by the sensor ε il 1 t ε il 2 t is the strain time history obtained by eliminating the initial bending strain corresponding to the two sensors in the il direction 3 2 the method of obtaining displacement frequency spectrum analysis represents a basic analysis method for signal processing the time domain signals obtained are subject to fourier conversion and frequency domain information is obtained the positive transformation equation is shown as follows 5 f ω f t e i ω t d t where ω 2πf f t means time domain data series and f ω means spectrum function series of frequency domain as fourier transformation is continuous in itself the fast fourier transformation fft was adopted for solution due to frequency resolution and limited length of time domain signals the fft analysis result may have the probability of leakage thus windowing measures were adopted for elimination then the modal analysis approach was adopted to obtain the time varying displacement according to measured strain data the response displacement could be expressed as a weighted sum of mode shapes as follows 6 y z t n 1 ω n t ϕ n z z 0 l where z is the axial coordinate l is the length of the pipe t is the time ϕ n z denotes the mode function ω n t is the modal weights n 1 2 3 n the mode shapes of displacement can be expressed as 7 ϕ n sin n π z l z 0 l therefore the displacement function can be expressed as 8 y z t n 1 ω n t sin n π z l z 0 l by solving the weight function corresponding to each mode ω n t the displacement time history of each point of the pipe can be calculated 4 results 4 1 strouhal number of isolated pipe fig 7 shows the displacement and envelope diagram of the isolated pipe in both cf and il directions at u 0 45 m s the first column represents the displacement time history curve from the top to the bottom of the six points the second column represents the amplification of the displacement within 23 25s and the third column represents the vibration pattern of the pipe every 0 5s in the cf direction the three point displacement time history curve at z l 0 575 0 725 and 0 875 appears as double peak and at the fourth measurement point it appears as a single peak fig 8 shows the root mean square rms value of the displacement of an isolated pipe at various flow velocities in the cf and il directions the rms displacement can reflect the amplitude of the viv response of the pipe and the vibration shape and fatigue damage of the pipe are reflected as a whole the maximum displacement of the pipe viv is the basis for structural instability caused by excessive deformation it is an important parameter for judging whether there is a collision between the pipe groups strouhal number st f s d u f dy f 1 ur represents an important parameter for the wake flow of flexible pipes here f 1 is the first order natural frequency of the structure which is measured by the free decay test of the pipe filled with liquid in still water the frequency corresponding to the peak power spectral density is the cf dominant frequency f dy at this flow velocity which theoretically approximates the vortex shedding frequency f s gao et al 2015a b han et al 2017 xu et al 2017 xu et al 2018a 2018b fig 9 shows how the cf and il dimensionless dominant frequencies of an isolated pipe varied with reduced velocity at f d f 1 1 the vortex frequency of the pipe was close to the natural frequency of the structure thus intensifying the vibration in the structure the variations of the cf and il data points f dy f 1 and f dx f 1 with reduced velocity were linearly fitted using the least squares method the resulting slopes which are the representative strouhal numbers are 0 185 and 0 370 the slope of the fitting line with the change of il dimensionless dominant frequency with the change of reduced velocity is defined as k then k 2st these values well agree with the rule that the vibration frequency from il resistance is twice the vibration frequency from cf lift huera huarte and bearman 2009 song et al 2011 huera huarte et al 2014 xu et al 2018a 4 2 strouhal numbers of pipe groups under variable spacings 4 2 1 strouhal numbers of three pipes in tandem arrangement fig 10 shows how the cf dimensionless dominant frequency f d f 1 of a three pipe group in tandem arrangement varied with reduced velocity under four spacing ratios s d 4 5 6 8 here st 1 st 3 st 4 st 6 st 7 st 9 and st 10 st 12 are the strouhal numbers of the three pipes under spacing ratios s d 4 6 5 and 8 respectively in order to reflect the vortex shedding law of the pipe group preferably the strouhal number of each pipe at each spacing ratio was measured in this test from figs 10 and 11 whatever the spacing ratio the strouhal number reduced from the upstream pipe to the downstream pipe the wake effect from the upstream pipe caused changes in the flow field of the midstream and downstream pipes wake field caused a depletion in the surface velocities of the midstream and downstream pipes reducing the lift and drag that acted on these pipes shielding caused the flows of the midstream and downstream pipes to separate and the actual inflow velocities of the midstream and downstream pipes were reduced velocities as a result the dominant frequency of pipe vibration namely the vortex shedding frequency reduced that explains why the strouhal number reduced from upstream to downstream vortex shedding from the midstream and downstream pipes made some feedback to the upstream pipe but this feedback was quite modest the strouhal number of the upstream pipe was closest to that of the isolated pipe under all spacing ratios the strouhal number reduced from upstream to downstream however as spacing ratio increased the strouhal number difference among the three pipes first increased and then reduced maximizing at s d 6 wake interference affected the vortex shedding frequency in the wake of the midstream and downstream pipes significantly at this spacing ratio as can be observed in fig 11 from upstream to downstream the power density spectral peak of the pipe group first reduced and then increased this suggests that wake flow can both suppress and enhance pipe vortex shedding and under interference effect the interactions among pipes are bidirectional fig 12 shows how the slopes of the cf and il dimensionless dominant frequency fitting lines of the three pipes in tandem arrangement varied with spacing ratio here st and k represent the slopes of the fitting lines of the ratios between the cf il dominant frequencies and the natural frequency of flexible pipes as a function of reduced velocity in an isolated pipe test k 2st from figs 10 and 12 the strouhal numbers of the three pipe group increased reduced and then increased with increasing spacing ratio in all cases the cf to il dimensionless dominant frequency ratio of the upstream pipe was 2 1 meaning that the vibration frequency induced by il drag was twice the vibration frequency induced by cf lift which approximated what was observed for the isolated pipe it is further verified that the feedback to the upstream pipe from the midstream or downstream pipe was lesser for the midstream and downstream pipes the il to cf dominant frequency ratio was nearly 1 1 meaning that the dominant frequencies in the two directions were almost the same the two pipes were located in the shielding effect area of the upstream pipe the shielding effect has a greater impact on the middle and downstream pipes 4 2 2 strouhal numbers of three pipes in side by side arrangement fig 13 shows how the cf dimensionless dominant frequency f d f 1 of the three pipes in side by side arrangement varied with reduced velocity u r under four spacing ratios s d 4 5 6 8 at s d 4 the strouhal numbers of the three pipes were 0 1864 0 1743 and 0 1865 at s d 5 they were 0 1790 0 1756 and 0 1827 we can observe that at s d 4 and 5 the strouhal numbers of both side pipes were smaller than that of the central pipe this is because at low spacing ratios the vortex shedding from the two side pipes disturbed the flow field of the central pipe preventing the vortices from shedding at the separation point it caused the vibration of the central pipe to reduce and its strouhal number was lower than both of the side pipes interestingly at s 6 0d the dominant frequencies of the three pipes were highly consistent with that of the isolated pipe this suggests that at this spacing ratio the inter pipe clearance flow did not affect the vortex shedding frequency in the wake of the pipe significantly the inter pipe interference effect did not reduce linearly with increasing spacing ratio at s d 6 the interference was the weakest at s d 8 0 strouhal numbers of the three pipes were high and the interference effect between the three pipes did not weaken at large spacing ratios the interference effect among three pipes in side by side arrangement is not ignorable fig 14 shows how the slopes of the cf and il dimensionless dominant frequency fitting lines of the three pipes in side by side arrangement varied with spacing ratio s d under variable spacing ratios the interference effect of clearance flow on the pipe k il is stronger than st cf for the two side pipes their cf to il dimensionless dominant frequency ratios approximated 2 1 both vortex shedding does not reflect certain symmetry and because of the influence of the clearance flow on both sides of the pipe the flow field of the pipe b has become an unstable flow field making its k value far from 0 37 at s d 4 0 5 0 and 8 0 in particular at s d 6 the slope k of the il fitting line reduced sharply the cf to il dimensionless dominant frequency ratio of the midstream pipe was no longer 2 1 4 2 3 strouhal numbers of five pipes in circular arrangement in order to take a closer look at how strouhal number would be affected by the number of flexible pipes and a more complicated arrangement form a further experiment was conducted on a five pipe group in circular arrangement under variable spacing ratios s d 4 6 fig 15 shows how the cf dimensionless dominant frequencies of the five pipes in circular arrangement vary with reduced velocity u r the detailed arrangement of the five pipes is illustrated in fig 6 c here a is the upstream pipe b and c are midstream pipes and d and e are downstream pipes pipes b and c are axially symmetric along the direction of inflow so do pipes d and e at s d 4 the strouhal numbers of the upstream pipe a midstream pipes b and c and downstream pipes d and e are 0 1722 0 1951 0 1820 0 1644 and 0 1586 at s d 6 their strouhal numbers are 0 1787 0 1916 0 1709 0 2082 and 0 1715 under both spacing ratios the midstream pipe b showed a higher strouhal number than pipe c and the downstream pipe d had a higher strouhal number than pipe e there was an apparent asymmetry between st 2 and st 3 and between st 4 and st 5 deflection of the wake flow of the upstream pipe caused the strouhal numbers of the midstream pipes namely pipes b and c to become asymmetric as the clearance flow between these two midstream pipes deflected to the two downstream pipes the doubly deflected incoming flow resulted in different near wake regions and different vortex shedding frequencies as well as different vortex shedding forms and peripheral flow configurations between these downstream pipes between the two spacing ratios the pipes displayed different trends when the spacing increased from 4d to 6d the strouhal number of the upstream pipe increased the strouhal numbers of the two midstream pipes both reduced and those of the downstream pipes were just the opposite at s d 4 the strouhal numbers of the upstream midstream and downstream pipes showed a weak strong weak profile whereas at s d 6 they displayed a strong weak strong profile this indicates the vortex shedding from the upstream pipe affected the downstream pipes both in the positive and negative directions this is because in the presence of water flow the wake vortex from the upstream pipe will act on the midstream and downstream pipes leading to a change in their vibration mode which became a superposition of the wake induced vibration from the front pipe with its own viv and this is not a simple linear superimposition different spacings and the presence of different degrees of interference effect will result in the vibration of flexible pipes being offset or enhanced reynolds number r e u d ν can be used to describe the flow status of fluids its relation with strouhal number s t f s d u satisfies the relation s t d 2 f s ν r e here ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid d is the hydraulic radius namely the external diameter of the flexible pipe in our experiment f s is the vortex shedding frequency which approximates the dominant vibration frequency f d of the structure this approximation theory agrees with what is described in the previous text hence we have s t d 2 f d ν r e fig 16 shows how the strouhal numbers of the pipes varied with reynolds number under variable spacings and the degree of dispersion of the data reflects the strength of the interference effect of each pipe under the corresponding reynolds number the more concentrated the data is near st 0 185 that is the closer the strouhal numbers of the isolated pipe is indicating that the smaller the degree of dispersion of the data the weaker the pipe will be subjected to interference effects in all cases of variable spacings the strouhal number of pipe c at side by side three pipe group is the largest at 8d with a value of 0 30 the strouhal number of downstream pipe at 6d of the tandem three pipe group is the smallest with a value of 0 091 the strouhal numbers of the five pipe groups are more concentrated than those of the three pipe groups the strouhal numbers of the three pipe groups became more dispersive with increasing spacing ratio the vortex shedding frequencies of five pipe groups are commonly higher than those of the five pipe groups the rms value of the strouhal number under the variable spacing test is 0 183 and the strouhal numbers are concentrated in 0 15 0 24 as shown in the gray area at lower reynolds number the dominant frequency is more sensitive to flow velocity interference smaller flow disturbances cause the strouhal number of the pipe group to fluctuate greatly at around re 4500 the strouhal numbers are concentrated on the order of 0 2 as shown in the orange area which is the closest to the strouhal number of an isolated pipe as reynolds number increases later the interference effect is relatively strong and the pipe viv is enhanced or suppressed to varying degrees resulting in a wider strouhal number distribution 4 3 strouhal numbers of pipes under variable incidence angles 4 3 1 strouhal numbers of three pipes arranged at variable incidence angles fig 17 shows how the cf dimensionless dominant frequencies of the three pipes varied with reduced velocity u r at spacing ratio s d 4 under five different incidence angles 0 30 45 60 90 here α 0 and α 90 correspond to the tandem and side by side arrangements of the three pipes here st 1 st 3 st 4 st 6 st 7 st 9 st 10 st 12 and st 13 st 15 are the strouhal numbers of pipes a b and c under these five incidence angles we can observe that as the incidence angle increased the strouhal numbers of the pipes first increased and then reduced the difference however is that pipe a reached its maximum strouhal number at α 45 for pipes b and c the incidence angle at which they reached their maximum strouhal numbers was α 60 this is because within the α 30 60 interval as the incidence angle increases the increase of the cf spacing between the pipes results in the decrease of the interference effect of the clearance flow and the impact of the vortex shedding from the upstream pipe on the downstream pipes gradually moves backward too except at α 0 when the strouhal number gradually reduced backward at all other angles the side pipes had a greater strouhal number than the midstream pipe this suggests that the vortex shedding of the pipe a and c disturbs the flow field of the inter pipe b resulting in a change in its vibration mode which generally reduces the vortex vibration frequency of the inter pipe it is further explained that in the presence of inference effects clearance flow and wake induced vibration act on vortex shedding in two ways they can enhance or suppress the vortex shedding frequency this concurs with our previous conclusion about the strouhal number of a three pipe group in tandem arrangement under variable spacing ratios furthermore for the absolute majority of flow velocities the pipes showed obvious cf and il dominant frequency characteristics nevertheless from the power spectral density diagram of pipe b at α 60 under flow velocity 0 6 m s fig 18 the cf dominant frequency characteristics were quite obvious whereas in the il direction the dominant frequency characteristic is not obvious the multi frequency feature manifests as a wider frequency distribution range and wake shielding and interference effect constitute key factors to the presence of multi frequency peaks in pipe power density spectra fig 19 shows how the slope of the cf and il dimensionless dominant frequency fitting line of the three pipes varied with incidence angle α except at α 0 when the slopes of pipes b and c were k 2 st 2 and k 3 st 3 in the overwhelming majority of the cases the slope ratio between the two directions was approximately 2 1 this suggests that the midstream and downstream pipes were more exposed to the interferences of the wake induced vibration from the upstream pipe resulting in considerably different lift and drag variations at α 30 45 and 60 the downstream pipe was in the skewed flow of the upstream pipe the gradual increase in the incidence angle caused the downstream pipe to gradually deflect from the wake region behind the upstream pipe the interferences between the adjacent pipes attenuated and the vortex shedding form changed as the incidence angle becomes larger the downstream gradually leaves the shielding effect region and the wake interference effect of the upstream pipe on the middle and downstream pipes becomes smaller 4 3 2 strouhal numbers of five pipes arranged at variable incidence angles fig 20 shows how the cf dimensionless dominant frequencies of the five pipes varied with reduced velocity u r at spacing ratio s d 4 under two incidence angles α 0 90 from top to bottom the pipes are numbered a b c d and e when in tandem arrangement namely at α 0 the strouhal numbers of the five pipe group showed a reduction and increase trend from top to bottom being st 1 0 1752 st 2 0 1668 st 3 0 1395 st 4 0 1471 and st 5 0 1665 the dimensionless dominant frequency of the upstream pipe showed a similar variation as that of an isolated pipe or the upstream pipe of the three pipe group in tandem arrangement its strouhal number was greater than that of the upstream pipe of the three pipe group at s d 4 and slightly smaller than that of the isolated pipe the wake induced vibration from the upstream pipe also suppressed the increase in the vortex shedding frequency so that the stroual numbers of the four pipes in the midstream and downstream were less than 0 185 of the isolated pipe for a five pipe group in side by side arrangement namely when α 90 the strouhal numbers of the pipes were st 6 0 2274 st 7 0 2465 st 8 0 2224 st 9 0 2262 st 10 0 2132 which are all greater than that of an isolated pipe as can be analyzed from fig 20 all dotted lines are located above the solid lines meaning that the strouhal numbers of the pipe group in side by side arrangement were greater than in tandem arrangement in all cases the strong interference effect among pipes subjected to clearance flow constitutes the key factor to increased vortex shedding frequencies and the shielding effect is more prominent in the five pipe group in tandem arrangement fig 21 shows how the il and cf dominant frequencies of a five pipe group varied with reduced velocity u r among the five pipes in tandem arrangement fig 21 a as with an isolated pipe the cross line to il dominant frequency ratios of the upstream pipes a and b were both 2 1 that of the midstream pipe c was close to 2 1 at u r 3 4 5 1 and fluctuated near 1 with increasing reduced velocity the dominant frequencies of the downstream pipes d and e were heavily unstable in both directions resulting in a very great variation in the dominant frequency ratio in fact at u r 5 89 pipe d had a greater dominant frequency in the cf direction than in the il direction at u r 1 68 5 05 pipe e showed a fairly unstable cf to il dominant frequency ratio which fluctuated near 1 with the further increase of reduced velocity comparatively for the five pipe group in side by side arrangement fig 21 b the cf to il dominant frequency ratios showed a more regular variation as shown in fig 21 when u r 5 05 7 58 this value was close to 2 1 when u r 1 68 4 20 and u r 8 42 10 10 the dominant frequencies in both directions were quite unstable as reduced velocity increased the ratio fluctuated near 1 ding et al 2013 this means that pipe c was subjected to a group of approximately equal reversed forces the dominant frequency ratio of pipe e althrough subjected to clearance flow from one side approximated that of pipe c the dominant frequency of pipe a however was seriously unstable at high reduced velocities the dominant frequency ratio was almost 4 and the cf dominant frequency was far smaller than the il dominant frequency no consistency in dominant frequency ratio was observed between pipe a and pipe e which were symmetrically positioned increasing the number of five pipe group results in more complex deflection and clearance flow and the superposition of interference effects is more significant fig 22 shows how the strouhal numbers of the pipes varied with reynolds number under variable incidence angles in all cases of variable angles the strouhal number of the most downstream pipe of the five pipe group in tandem is the largest with a value of 0 345 the strouhal number in the middle pipe c of the three pipe group in side by side is the smallest with a value of 0 096 under variable angles the three pipe group showed a more concentrated strouhal number distribution whereas the strouhal numbers of the five pipe group at α 90 are generally greater than at α 0 compared with section 4 2 it is found that the re 6400 corresponding to the most concentrated strouhal number when changing the incidence angle is significantly larger than the case with variable spacings re 4500 as shown in the orange area and under variable angles the rms strouhal number is 0 192 which is greater than 0 183 under variable spacing from figs 16 and 22 as reynolds number varied the strouhal numbers distribution first converged and then diverged although under different incidence angles strouhal numbers are concentrated at 0 17 0 23 as shown in the gray area in fig 22 the strouhal numbers of the pipes are more discretized than under different spacing ratios and the more scattered data points are reflected in the 0 arrangement the multiple shielding effect is vividly reflected on the pipe e which makes the strouhal number jumping strong which is also the key factor that the strouhal number distribution is more dispersed compared with the pipe group at variable spacings 5 discussion for an isolated pipe in the subcritical reynolds region that is when 300 re 3 105 the strouhal number stabilizes at around 0 20 in the critical reynolds region that is when 3 105 re 3 106 the level of the strouhal number is associated with the turbulence intensity of the flow the higher the turbulence intensity the greater the strouhal number the randomness of vortex shedding within this region makes it impossible to determine the strouhal number accurately enough in the supercritical reynolds region that is when re 3 106 the strouhal number stabilizes at approximately 0 27 braza et al 1986 roushan and wu 2005 studies have demonstrated that strouhal number stabilizes at around 0 20 in our experiment the strouhal number of an isolated pipe was 0 185 which is in the normal range gao y 2015 fig 23 shows the strouhal numbers in all tested cases under coupled interferences only 16 9 of the flexible pipes were within the st 0 185 0 2 interval which is considerably different from that of an isolated pipe most of the pipes have a strouhal number lower than st 0 185 in particular for a five pipe group in side by side arrangement in which case all pipes had a strouhal number greater than 0 20 correlation coefficient r as an important parameter for curve fitting can intuitively reflect the quality of the fitted value the greater the correlation coefficient r the closer the test value is to the fitted value and consequently the better the degree of curve fitting when r 0 8 1 0 the test value is very strongly correlated to the fitted value when r 0 6 0 8 the test value is strongly correlated to the fitted value when r 0 4 0 6 the test value is moderately correlated to the fitted value by comparing the corresponding dimensionless dominant frequencies in the line from least squares method with the original ones we yielded the correlation coefficients r from the linearly fitted correlation coefficients r in 17 different cases shown in fig 24 to determine the accuracy level of the fitting line as can be observed from fig 24 that 74 6 of the correlation coefficient r points fall within the 0 9 1 0 interval 18 6 of the points fall within the 0 8 0 9 interval only 6 8 fall below 0 8 overall the fitting degree is fairly good furthermore as can be observed from figs 23 and 24 the fitting quality of strouhal number makes little difference to the value of strouhal number itself for three pipes in tandem arrangement the strouhal numbers gradually reduced from top to bottom in all cases but at s d 4 the strouhal number of the upstream pipe gave a correlation coefficient of nearly 1 whereas those of the midstream and downstream pipes were both on the order of 0 8 at s d 5 all three pipes gave a correlation coefficient of nearly 1 at s d 6 the correlation coefficient first reduced and then increased at s d 8 the correlation coefficient gradually reduced for three pipes in side by side arrangement at s d 4 or 5 the midstream pipe had a smaller strouhal number than the side pipes in both cases as the spacing ratio increased the variation of strouhal number was no longer obvious with the correlation coefficients being close to 1 for all pipes for five pipes in circular arrangement at s d 4 or 6 the strouhal numbers showed an increase and reduction trend from top to bottom in all cases but the correlation coefficient r stayed within the 0 9 1 interval the fitting degree is quite good the correlation coefficient is the same when the three pipe groups are arranged at α 30 60 but the strouhal numbers are small in the middle and large on both sides for five pipes in tandem arrangement under variable incidence angles except the upstream pipe which had a strouhal number close to that of an isolated pipe all other pipes gave a smaller strouhal number than that of an isolated pipe however the upstream pipe showed a correlation coefficient r of only 0 67 and the other pipes had a strouhal number correlation coefficient within the 0 9 1 interval when in side by side arrangement all five pipes had a far greater strouhal number than an isolated pipe although three of them had a strouhal number correlation coefficient of merely around 0 8 fig 25 shows how strouhal number varies with reynolds number in all cases of variable spacings and angles obviously the strouhal numbers of the pipes are more concentrated at the intermediate flow velocity than at the low or high flow velocity showing a dumbbell distribution within the tested flow velocities the author performs regional integration on the data points in the figure takes the upper and lower limits of the strouhal numbers under each reynolds number and calculates the rms curves of st max and st min as the blue and black dotted lines in fig 25 the two curves are approximately parallel and gradually decrease with the increase of reynolds number the region enclosed by the two curves is the st re evolution region of under interference effect that is the effective interference region fig 26 shows the st re relation curves in rms terms s t 8 8 10 17 r e 4 2 4 e 10 12 r e 3 2 3 10 8 r e 2 0 0001 r e 0 37 in this st re model the effective interference region is divided into interference enhancement and suppression region it can serve as an empirical formula for coupled wake and clearance flow interferences to estimate the strouhal number within different reynolds numbers when the strouhal number falls in the orange area between the red solid line and the blue dotted line that is the strouhal number is greater than the rms curve it means that the strouhal number in this area exceeds the rms strouhal number in the pipe group with variable angle and spacing that is to say the strouhal number of the pipe group under the interference effect has a certain degree of enhancement significance this area is defined as the interference enhancement area on the contrary the strouhal number falls in the blue area between the solid red line and the black dotted line that is the strouhal number is less than the rms curve which indicates that the strouhal number in this area is lower than the rms strouhal number of the pipe group with variable angle and spacing that is to say the strouhal number of the pipe group under the interference effect has a certain degree of weaken significance this area is defined as the interference suppression area the fitted curve was basically smooth the good consistency between the interference enhancement and suppression regions in boundary variation points to a series of steady states for wake and clearance flows fig 27 shows the residual bar chart of the fourth order fitted rms strouhal number data points the fitting residual mode is δ 1 5074e 14 the probability of the standardized residual of the test points falling beyond the 2 2 interval is 0 which is far smaller than 0 05 hence this st re model provides a relatively high goodness of fit based on figs 25 and 26 it can be seen that the tandem arrangement significantly suppresses the interference and the strouhal number overall and has a greater impact on the downstream pipe in the three pipe group on the contrary when arranged side by side both interference and strouhal number are enhanced to varying degrees the effect of the change on the increase or decrease of the strouhal number is non linear and the three pipes arranged in tandem have the largest difference when s d 6 at this time the wake interference effect has a significant impact on the vortex shedding frequency of the middle and downstream pipes when the angle increases in variable angle arrangement the role of the gap flow gradually replaces the shielding effect to dominate and the interval where the strouhal number is located gradually shifts from the interference enhancement region to the interference suppression region in order to further analyze the st re relationship of the pipe group under coupled wake interference effect the strouhal number in the subcritical reynolds region involved in this paper is compared with the data of previous studies griffin 1978 king et al 1973 xu et al 2004 resvanis et al 2013 to obtain fig 28 and its reference conditions are listed in table 3 through comparison the absolute majority of strouhal number variations as a function of reynolds number fell within the st re evolution region established in this paper for both single and double pipes and these variations were quite similar with increasing reynolds number particularly both the points of griffin and king for single pipe fluctuated near the st re curve in rms terms in the st re evolution region the difference is that the strouhal number of the isolated pipe in the literature varies slightly with the reynolds number but the st re relationship curve fitted in this paper has a significant downward trend with the increase of the reynolds number resulting in the st re relationship curve at high reynolds number basically located near the strouhal number of the isolated pipe and slightly higher than the isolated pipe at low reynolds number it shows that the interference effect can increase the vortex shedding frequency to a certain extent at low reynolds number thereby increasing the strouhal number the strouhal numbers that change with the reynolds number in the reference are all within the st re effective area summarized by the author and most of them are concentrated near the st re relation curve indicating that the effective area of interference can better reflect the interference effects to strouhal number it is noted however that the st re evolution region established in this paper was based on the interference effect within pipe groups the rms relation curve was also one in rms terms that describes how strouhal number varies with reynolds number for all cases tested fitted the rms curves of st max and st min after integrating the regions of strouhal numbers at all data points for all cases tested as marked by the red lines in fig 28 this curve is of more engineering importance as it describes how strouhal number varies with reynolds number for a pipe group subjected to interference effect rather than for an isolated pipe 6 conclusions in this paper the responses of the strouhal numbers of a three pipe and a five pipe groups in different arrangements to coupled interferences are investigated under variable flow velocities inter pipe spacing ratios and incidence angles the following conclusions are drawn 1 for three pipes in tandem arrangement at variable spacings the strouhal numbers displayed a gradual reduction from top to bottom in all cases the cf to il dimensionless dominant frequency ratio of the upstream pipe was 2 1 in call cases as does that of an isolated pipe influenced by the shielding effect of upstream pipe midstream and downstream pipes displayed a ratio close to 1 1 for three pipes in side by side arrangement at variable spacings at a small spacing ratio the midstream pipe gave a smaller strouhal number than the side pipe as the spacing ratio increases the interference effect between pipes does not decrease linearly at large spacing ratios the interference effect among three pipes in side by side arrangement is not ignorable for five pipes in circular arrangement the strouhal numbers between symmetric locations were obviously asymmetric the strouhal number of the upstream pipe was close to that of the upstream pipe of a three pipe group under variable spacings whereas the strouhal numbers of the midstream and downstream pipes varied asymmetrically 2 for three pipes arranged at variable incidence angles the strouhal numbers of all pipes displayed an increase and reduction trend with increasing incidence angle however pipes b and c reached their maximum strouhal numbers at α 90 which is 15 later than pipe a at the intermediate reduced velocity the pipes stabilized at around 2 1 for five pipes arranged variable incidence angles α 0 90 when in the cf direction namely when α 0 the strouhal numbers of the five pipes displayed a reduction and increase trend from upstream to downstream the multiple shielding effects make the strouhal numbers jump more strongly and the strouhal numbers distribution of the pipe group with variable incidence angles is more dispersed than that of the pipe groups with variable spacings 3 interferences changed the vortex shedding frequencies on the sides of the pipes spacing ratio and incidence angle variations made a great difference to the strouhal numbers of both a three pipe and a five pipe group most of the pipes gave a smaller strouhal number than an isolated pipe only 16 9 of the pipes fell within the st 0 185 0 20 interval 4 the st re evolution region and segmentation criteria for flow around flexible pipe groups were established within the subcritical reynolds numbers a st re relation model in rms terms within this range was yielded the st re relation curve in rms terms is of more engineering importance as it describes how strouhal number varies with reynolds number for a pipe group subjected to interference effect rather than for an isolated pipe through a viv experiment on flexible pipes in group of three and five subjected in uniform flow under coupled interferences we revealed the dynamic evolution of strouhal number and developed a st re model for flow around flexible pipe groups our results can provide theoretical support for the design and arrangement of pipe groups and better guide engineering practices nevertheless there is still something we didn t address in our study the increase rate of spacing ratio and incidence angle was quite large more importantly only two arrangement forms were assumed for five pipes in circular arrangement and five pipes under variable incidence angles the next step would be to build a model for circular arrangement under more spacing ratios and for contingency type arrangement under more incidence angles so as to further modify the present dynamic evolution model of fluid s strouhal number in flow around flexible pipe groups author contributions section peng li conception conceptualization methodology participating in the test writing lihua liu

21576,oil debris distinguishing and detection is to characterize the wear position rate and degree of mechanical system by detecting the properties count and size of debris in the oil which contributes to the health status monitoring and fault diagnosis of marine machinery to improve the sensitivity of inductive detection method especially for the detection of non ferromagnetic particles a double wire solenoid coil and an inductance resistance detection method are presented in the paper the frequency characteristics of inductance and resistance detection are discussed which shows that the first method is sensitive to ferromagnetic metal particles and the second method is sensitive to non ferromagnetic metal particles we demonstrated that the double wire solenoid coil sensor can detect iron particles with diameter of 20 μm onwards and copper particles with diameter of 60 μm onwards with inductance resistance detection method graphical abstract image 1 keywords oil debris distinguishing and detection inductance detection resistance detection 1 introduction the health monitoring of marine machinery is an important guarantee for the safety of ship navigation and operation recently the emerging technology of intelligent ship and unmanned ship has put forward the practical demand for the intelligent monitoring evaluation and early warning of marine machinery in operation as the blood of the marine machinery the oil has the functions of transmitting power lubrication cooling etc and carries the wear particles at the same time containing rich information which can characterize the wear rate and degree of mechanical equipment shen et al 2016 data show that more than 75 of hydraulic system failures about 35 of diesel engine operation failures 38 5 of gear failures and 40 of rolling bearing failures are caused by oil particles flanagan et al 1988 miller and kitaljevich 2000 yin et al 2003 during normal machine operation wear debris in oil are typically in the range of 1 20 μm while wear debris in the range of 50 100 μm or even more usually indicates abnormal wear for machinery fan et al 2017 du et al 2010a 2010b henneberg et al 2015 in addition to reduce the contact friction non ferrous materials are always used as the coating on friction pairs which enables wear position and failure of mechanical components to be determined by the nature of wear debris in oil therefore the ability to detect and distinguish ferrous and non ferrous debris in oil is an effective method to evaluate the health status of marine machinery by estimating the nature size and quantity of wear particles in oil to date many previous studies have reported oil particle detection sensors based on optics massaro et al 2011 wong and wong 2015 acoustics wang et al 2017 du and zhe 2013 capacitance demori et al 2010 zubair and tang 2014 and inductance hong et al 2018 cao et al 2018 li et al 2017 liu and zuo 2017 each sensor has its own advantages and disadvantages the optical sensor based on light particle shielding can easily detect particles below 5 μm but cannot identify the nature of particles and the oil transparency in oil will affect the detection accuracy the acoustic sensor based on acoustic scattering can detect the wear debris from the bubbles in oil but it is easy to be affected by oil viscosity flow rate and mechanical vibration and cannot distinguish between the nature of metal particles the capacitance sensor can distinguish the metal particles and bubbles in oil according to the different dielectric permittivity but cannot distinguish ferrous and non ferrous debris in oil at the same time this method is easy to cause oil deterioration which results in a decrease in detection accuracy over time compared with the above methods the inductive sensor can detect and distinguish ferrous and non ferrous debris in oil furthermore it has strong robustness in oil quality and environment therefore a lot of researches on inductive sensor and its sensitivity improvement have been performed to improve the sensitivity of inductance detection various inductive sensors including single coil dual coil and triple coil were proposed whittington et al 1992 used a single coil as a resonant inductance to form an oscillator which can detect ferromagnetic and non ferromagnetic particles according to the direction of frequency change fan et al 2010 designed an inductance sensor with double coil structure based on the principle of inductance balance which can detect 500 μm copper particles and 100 μm iron particles hong et al wei et al 2013 discussed a radial inductive sensor to improve sensitivity by adding a driving coil which can effectively detect 20 μm thick ferromagnetic debris se diameter 290 μm in a 20 mm diameter pipe but the ability of the sensor to detect non ferromagnetic particles is not analyzed xiao et al 2019 proposed an inductive sensor composed of a cylindrical core two l shaped magnetic poles an excitation coil and an induction coil the excitation coil sleeved on the iron core is to generate a high gradient magnetic field in the sensing area which helps the sensor detect 25 μm ferromagnetic particles but the detection ability of non ferromagnetic particles is not also mentioned in the paper ren et al 2018 added a signal processing circuit to the triple coil inductive sensor to compensate for the asymmetry of two excitation coils this type of sensor can detect 120 μm ferrous and 210 μm nonferrous particles as reducing the diameter of channel can improve the sensitivity of inductive sensor the microfluidic chip technology was introduced into the design of inductive sensors zhe et al du and zhe 2011 designed a microfluidic inductive sensor using two layer planar coil with dense coil turns which can detect 50 μm iron particles and 105 μm copper particles in a 1 mm glass tube after they raised two solutions to improve the sensitivity of the inductive sensor one is to add a pair of ferrite cores into two planar coils making the magnetic field in the detection area denser and more uniform which is proved to be capable of detecting 11 μm iron particles under a static test environment but the ability to detect non ferromagnetic metal particles has not been mentioned and reported zhu et al 2017 the other is to adopt a parallel lc resonance method which can amplify the impedance signal caused by a debris particle under the resonance frequency and make it able to detect a 20 μm iron particle and a 55 μm copper particle du et al 2013a on this basis a multi channel synchronous detection method was proposed to effectively improve the throughput du et al 2013b but the under sampling process is difficult to accurately reflect the whole morphology of the impedance signals caused by particles which is easy to cause the loss of particle count zhang et al 2009 developed a fabrication method of microchannel which can effectively reduce the distance between wear particles and the inner wall of coil thus improving the detection sensitivity based on this method zeng et al 2018 improved the detection sensitivity of two solenoid coils by optimizing the number and structure of silicon steel sheets which can detect iron particles with diameter of 18 μm onwards and copper particles with diameter of 75 μm onwards bai et al 2020 and liu et al 2019 applied magnetics nanoparticles to the outside and inside of the coil respectively which improved the detection sensitivity of ferrous particles but made limited contribution to the nonferrous particles in addition shi et al 2019 and ma et al 2019 designed an annual microchannel and a flat microchannel to improve the throughput without sacrificing the sensitivity nevertheless much effort has been made to further improve the sensitivity of inductive sensor it needs the help of external circuit or ferromagnetic material which makes the fabrication of coil and microchannel relatively complex meanwhile the sensitivity of metal particle differential detection still needs to be further improved especially for non ferrous particles detecting smaller non ferrous particles remains the challenge for wear debris analysis to solve the above problems a microfluidic sensor using a double wire solenoid coil is proposed in the paper the mutual inductance produced by double wire solenoid coil and the microchannel placed on the inner wall of coil help to improve the detection sensitivity the introduction of resistance detection can effectively make up for the defect of low detection ability of inductance sensor to non ferrous magnetic particles we demonstrated that the double wire solenoid coil sensor can detect iron particles with diameter of 20 μm onwards and copper particles with diameter of 60 μm onwards with inductance resistance detection method in following paragraphs the structure and detection principle of the sensor with double wire solenoid coil are presented firstly next we present the sensor fabrication method and the experimental rig setup and then the optimal excitation frequency and detection floor level of the sensor with inductance resistance method are determined and discussed by the experiments finally the conclusions are presented 2 sensor design and detection principle 2 1 sensor design the overall design of senor is shown in fig 1 the sensor includes a straight microchannel and a double wire solenoid coil the diameter of microchannel d1 was 500 μm although the more turns of the coil the greater the magnetic field intensity in the detection area because of the small size of the microchannel too many turns of the outer coil contribute less to the magnetic field in the detection area and the more turns the greater the noise which is not conducive to obtain a better snr signal to noise ratio the snr is the amplitude divided by interference noise therefore we use a double wire solenoid coil the number of turns is 200 and the diameter of the coil inner hole is 900 μm to increase the variation of coil impedance caused by particles through the mutual inductance produced by double wire solenoid coil in series the double wire solenoid coil is wound by a 70 μm enameled wire the magnetic field inside solenoid coil is not uniform in radial direction and the magnetic field distribution at the edge of the coil inner hole is larger than the center so we place the microchannel on the inner wall of coil to make the detection area in the region with the greatest magnetic field intensity 2 2 detection principle when a coil is applied with an alternating current the alternating magnetic field will be generated inside the coil the impedance of coil can be expressed as 1 z r j w l where r and l are the resistance and inductance of coil respectively j is an imaginary unit and w is the angular frequency of alternating current when the metal debris passes through the detection area the change in coil resistance and inductance can be obtained by an lcr meter as shown in fig 2 the inductance of coil will decrease when a non ferromagnetic metal particle is guided into the sensing area this is due to that eddy current generated inside the metal particle would oppose the original magnetic field leading to a decrease in the total magnetic flux of coil the inductance of coil will increase when a ferromagnetic metal particle is introduced into the sensing area this is because that the relative permeability of ferromagnetic metal particle is significantly higher than that of oil which makes the magnetization effect greater than eddy current effect in competing ways as a result the original magnetic field would be enhanced and the total magnetic flux of coil is increased therefore ferromagnetic metal particles and non ferromagnetic metal particles can be differentiated by the inductive signal pulse direction and the particle size can be determined by the pulse height due to the eddy currents generated in the metal particles including ferromagnetic and non ferromagnetic metal particles consume energy from the coil the resistance of coil will be increased and the height of resistance signal pulse is also positively correlated with the particle size the coil resistance induced by metal particles passing through the sensitive area has the same polarity it is impossible to distinguish ferromagnetic metal particles and non ferromagnetic metal particles since the lcr can capture coil resistance and inductance at the same time we can combine the inductance and resistance of coil to comprehensively judge the type and size of particles especially when detecting small particles for the designed double wire solenoid coil it can be regarded as the series connection of two identical coils according to kirchhoff s law the equivalent inductance and resistance shall be 2 δ l e δ l 1 δ l 2 2 δ m 3 δ r e δ r 1 δ r 2 where l 1 r 1 l 2 r 2 are the inductance and resistance of the two coils respectively m is the mutual inductance m k l 1 l 2 k is the mutual inductance coefficient which is between 0 and 1 when two coils are fully coupled k 1 when two coils are completely uncoupled k 0 it can be seen that the impedance change of double wire solenoid coil caused by metal particles is increased compared with the single solenoid coil in addition the microchannel is placed in the inner wall of coil with strong magnetic field so as to improve the detection sensitivity 3 sensor fabrication and experimental rig 3 1 sensor fabrication the fabrication of sensor is a three step process first the double wire solenoid coil with the above parameters was wound by a winding machine srdz23 1b zhongshan shili wire winder equipment co ltd zhongshan china a copper rod with diameter of 500 μm used as the straight micro channel model was inserted into double wire solenoid coil according to the design position the double wire solenoid coil and the copper rod were fixed on a glass substrate to form a basic mold next the prepared polydimethylsiloxane pdms a kind of polymer organosilicon compound which is used to make the transparent microchannel for easy observation was casted on the basic mold and the mold was cured in a vacuum heating oven dzf 6020a bangxi instrument technology co ltd shanghai china with the temperature of 80 c for 1 h finally the copper rod was extracted from the mold and then the double wire solenoid coil sensor was completed 3 2 experimental rig the oil debris detection system built in the paper was shown in fig 3 it consisted of a micro injection pump harvard apparatus b 85259 harvard apparatus holliston ma usa a microscope nikon az100 nikon tokyo japan a lcr meter keysight e4980a agilent technologiesinc bayan lepas malaysia a labview data acquisition unit and the double wire solenoid coil sensor the micro injection pump can control the flow of oil sample entering the flat channel of the sensor the lcr meter not only provides ac excitation for the detection sensor but also inputs detection data to the labview data acquisition unit in real time the microscope could be used to help determine whether the detection signal was caused by debris since the size of the micro channel is known the actual size of particles can be determined by measuring the diameter of particles with the microscope and comparing it with the size of the micro channel 4 experimental results and discussion the iron and copper particles are selected as representative particles for experiments the preparation procedures of oil samples containing different sizes of iron particles and copper particles are detailed in our previous reports shen et al 2016 du et al 2013a according to the above theoretical analysis the excitation frequency is an important factor affecting the sensor detection sensitivity therefore the optimal excitation frequency of the sensor is determined by experiment and then the lower limit level of inductance and resistance detection is explored and discussed to ensure that particles pass through the sensing area of sensor one by one the flow rate of micro injection pump is set to 30 μl min in the experiments 4 1 determination of optimal excitation frequency different excitation frequencies will affect the inductance and resistance detection signals the impedance parameters are measured using an agilent e4980a lcr meter which has an upper frequency limit of 2 mhz to obtain the frequency characteristics of inductance and resistance detection and to determine the optimal excitation frequency we set the excitation voltage to 2v and conducted experiments at different excitation frequencies 0 4 2 0 mhz using 120 125 μm iron particles and 150 155 μm copper particles respectively based on the experimental results the inductance amplitude resistance amplitude inductance snr and resistance snr detected by iron particles and copper particles are statistically analyzed as shown in fig 4 for the detection of iron particles in fig 4 a the amplitude and snr of inductance detection and resistance detection decrease with the increase of frequency the decrease rate of amplitude and snr of resistance detection is greater than that of inductance detection in the frequency range the resistance decreases from 3 38 ω to 0 83 ω while the inductance decreases from 16 63 nh to 15 69 nh meanwhile at the same frequency the amplitude and signal to noise ratio of inductance detection are higher than that of resistance detection which shows that for iron particles the sensitivity of inductance detection is higher than that of resistance detection for the detection of iron particles in fig 4 b the amplitude and snr of inductance detection and resistance detection increase with the increase of frequency the increase rate of amplitude and snr of resistance detection is greater than that of inductance detection at the 0 4 mhz the inductance signals of copper particles have been submerged in the background noise at other frequencies the amplitude and signal to noise ratio of resistance detection are also higher than that of inductance detection which indicates that the sensitivity of copper particle inductance detection is less than that of resistance detection in conclusion we choose 2 mhz as the excitation frequency to compensate the ability of the inductive sensor to detect the non ferromagnetic metal particles 4 2 detection floor level to explore the floor levels of double wire solenoid coil sensor iron particles with diameters below 120 μm and copper particles with diameters below 150 μm were used in the experiments as shown in fig 5 a when detecting 30 35 μm iron particles the resistance pulse signal is weak while the inductance pulse signal is relatively obvious at this time the amplitude and snr of resistance detection are 0 19 ω and 1 56 respectively and the amplitude and snr of inductance detection are 0 82 nh and 2 75 respectively as shown in fig 5 b when the size of iron particles are reduced to 20 25 μm the resistance pulse signal has been submerged by noise and the inductance pulse signal is also weak at this time the amplitude and snr of inductance detection are 0 49 nh and 2 26 respectively as shown in fig 5 c for the detection of 90 95 μm copper particles although the inductance signals have negative pulses and the resistance signals have positive pulses the inductance pulse signals are weak and the resistance signals are obvious at this time the amplitude and snr of inductance detection are 0 36 nh and 1 22 respectively while the amplitude and snr of resistance detection are 0 017ω and 4 49 respectively as shown in fig 6 d when the size of copper particles are reduced to 60 65 μm there are no inductance pulse signals but there are still resistance pulse signals at this time the amplitude and snr of resistance detection are 0 0031ω and 1 48 respectively therefore the addition of resistance detection can effectively increase the ability of sensor to detect copper particles 4 3 discussion and comparison according to the above experimental results the sensitivity of inductance and resistance detection is different the inductance method can detect smaller iron particles and the resistance method can detect smaller copper particles because the inductance signals and resistance signals of the same iron particle or copper particle can be obtained at the same time the properties of particles can be identified by combining the inductance and resistance as shown in fig 6 from fig 6 we can see that when the inductance signal has a positive pulse and the resistance signal is submerged by noise the particle is an iron particle and the particle size is 20 30 μm when both the inductance signal and the resistance signal have positive pulses the particle is an iron particle larger than 30 μm and the specific particle size is positively related to the pulse height when there is no pulse in the inductance signal and a positive pulse in the resistance signal the particle is a copper particle and the particle size is 60 90 μm the specific particle size is positively related to the pulse height when a negative pulse appears in the inductance signal and a positive pulse appears in the resistance signal the particle is a copper particle larger than 90 μm whose specific size is positively related to the inductance and resistance pulse height therefore the double wire solenoid coil sensor can detect and distinguish iron particle with diameter of 20 μm onwards and copper particles with diameter of 60 μm onwards in oil compared with the other high sensitivity micro inductive sensor the sensitivity of designed sensor is further improved without the assistance of ferromagnetic material or lc resonance method especially the detection sensitivity of non ferromagnetic particles in combination with the annual microchannel and flat microchannel we proposed before the throughput will be higher which is promising for application of discrimination detection of wear debris in oil for marine machinery 5 conclusion we presented a micro inductive sensor with double wire solenoid coil to distinguish ferromagnetic and non magnetic metal particles in the paper and proposed a combined inductance and resistance detection method to improve the sensitivity of inductive sensor especially the detection ability of non ferromagnetic metal particles the frequency characteristics of double wire solenoid coil sensor were explored through experiments and the optimal detection frequency is 2 0 mhz we demonstrated that the double wire solenoid coil sensor can detect 20 μm onwards iron particles and 60 μm onwards copper particles with inductance resistance detection method which has not been achieved before compared with the multi coil and iron core coil sensors the designed sensor has simple structure and the proposed method is maneuverable as the sensitivity of inductive sensor is not only influenced by its own structure and magnetic field strength but also inevitably limited by environmental interference the next step is to optimize the shielding design and signal processing it is expected that the sensor can provide technical support for health monitoring and fault diagnosis of marine machinery credit authorship contribution statement laihao ma formal

effect greater than eddy current effect in competing ways as a result the original magnetic field would be enhanced and the total magnetic flux of coil is increased therefore ferromagnetic metal particles and non ferromagnetic metal particles can be differentiated by the inductive signal pulse direction and the particle size can be determined by the pulse height due to the eddy currents generated in the metal particles including ferromagnetic and non ferromagnetic metal particles consume energy from the coil the resistance of coil will be increased and the height of resistance signal pulse is also positively correlated with the particle size the coil resistance induced by metal particles passing through the sensitive area has the same polarity it is impossible to distinguish ferromagnetic metal particles and non ferromagnetic metal particles since the lcr can capture coil resistance and inductance at the same time we can combine the inductance and resistance of coil to comprehensively judge the type and size of particles especially when detecting small particles for the designed double wire solenoid coil it can be regarded as the series connection of two identical coils according to kirchhoff s law the equivalent inductance and resistance shall be 2 δ l e δ l 1 δ l 2 2 δ m 3 δ r e δ r 1 δ r 2 where l 1 r 1 l 2 r 2 are the inductance and resistance of the two coils respectively m is the mutual inductance m k l 1 l 2 k is the mutual inductance coefficient which is between 0 and 1 when two coils are fully coupled k 1 when two coils are completely uncoupled k 0 it can be seen that the impedance change of double wire solenoid coil caused by metal particles is increased compared with the single solenoid coil in addition the microchannel is placed in the inner wall of coil with strong magnetic field so as to improve the detection sensitivity 3 sensor fabrication and experimental rig 3 1 sensor fabrication the fabrication of sensor is a three step process first the double wire solenoid coil with the above parameters was wound by a winding machine srdz23 1b zhongshan shili wire winder equipment co ltd zhongshan china a copper rod with diameter of 500 μm used as the straight micro channel model was inserted into double wire solenoid coil according to the design position the double wire solenoid coil and the copper rod were fixed on a glass substrate to form a basic mold next the prepared polydimethylsiloxane pdms a kind of polymer organosilicon compound which is used to make the transparent microchannel for easy observation was casted on the basic mold and the mold was cured in a vacuum heating oven dzf 6020a bangxi instrument technology co ltd shanghai china with the temperature of 80 c for 1 h finally the copper rod was extracted from the mold and then the double wire solenoid coil sensor was completed 3 2 experimental rig the oil debris detection system built in the paper was shown in fig 3 it consisted of a micro injection pump harvard apparatus b 85259 harvard apparatus holliston ma usa a microscope nikon az100 nikon tokyo japan a lcr meter keysight e4980a agilent technologiesinc bayan lepas malaysia a labview data acquisition unit and the double wire solenoid coil sensor the micro injection pump can control the flow of oil sample entering the flat channel of the sensor the lcr meter not only provides ac excitation for the detection sensor but also inputs detection data to the labview data acquisition unit in real time the microscope could be used to help determine whether the detection signal was caused by debris since the size of the micro channel is known the actual size of particles can be determined by measuring the diameter of particles with the microscope and comparing it with the size of the micro channel 4 experimental results and discussion the iron and copper particles are selected as representative particles for experiments the preparation procedures of oil samples containing different sizes of iron particles and copper particles are detailed in our previous reports shen et al 2016 du et al 2013a according to the above theoretical analysis the excitation frequency is an important factor affecting the sensor detection sensitivity therefore the optimal excitation frequency of the sensor is determined by experiment and then the lower limit level of inductance and resistance detection is explored and discussed to ensure that particles pass through the sensing area of sensor one by one the flow rate of micro injection pump is set to 30 μl min in the experiments 4 1 determination of optimal excitation frequency different excitation frequencies will affect the inductance and resistance detection signals the impedance parameters are measured using an agilent e4980a lcr meter which has an upper frequency limit of 2 mhz to obtain the frequency characteristics of inductance and resistance detection and to determine the optimal excitation frequency we set the excitation voltage to 2v and conducted experiments at different excitation frequencies 0 4 2 0 mhz using 120 125 μm iron particles and 150 155 μm copper particles respectively based on the experimental results the inductance amplitude resistance amplitude inductance snr and resistance snr detected by iron particles and copper particles are statistically analyzed as shown in fig 4 for the detection of iron particles in fig 4 a the amplitude and snr of inductance detection and resistance detection decrease with the increase of frequency the decrease rate of amplitude and snr of resistance detection is greater than that of inductance detection in the frequency range the resistance decreases from 3 38 ω to 0 83 ω while the inductance decreases from 16 63 nh to 15 69 nh meanwhile at the same frequency the amplitude and signal to noise ratio of inductance detection are higher than that of resistance detection which shows that for iron particles the sensitivity of inductance detection is higher than that of resistance detection for the detection of iron particles in fig 4 b the amplitude and snr of inductance detection and resistance detection increase with the increase of frequency the increase rate of amplitude and snr of resistance detection is greater than that of inductance detection at the 0 4 mhz the inductance signals of copper particles have been submerged in the background noise at other frequencies the amplitude and signal to noise ratio of resistance detection are also higher than that of inductance detection which indicates that the sensitivity of copper particle inductance detection is less than that of resistance detection in conclusion we choose 2 mhz as the excitation frequency to compensate the ability of the inductive sensor to detect the non ferromagnetic metal particles 4 2 detection floor level to explore the floor levels of double wire solenoid coil sensor iron particles with diameters below 120 μm and copper particles with diameters below 150 μm were used in the experiments as shown in fig 5 a when detecting 30 35 μm iron particles the resistance pulse signal is weak while the inductance pulse signal is relatively obvious at this time the amplitude and snr of resistance detection are 0 19 ω and 1 56 respectively and the amplitude and snr of inductance detection are 0 82 nh and 2 75 respectively as shown in fig 5 b when the size of iron particles are reduced to 20 25 μm the resistance pulse signal has been submerged by noise and the inductance pulse signal is also weak at this time the amplitude and snr of inductance detection are 0 49 nh and 2 26 respectively as shown in fig 5 c for the detection of 90 95 μm copper particles although the inductance signals have negative pulses and the resistance signals have positive pulses the inductance pulse signals are weak and the resistance signals are obvious at this time the amplitude and snr of inductance detection are 0 36 nh and 1 22 respectively while the amplitude and snr of resistance detection are 0 017ω and 4 49 respectively as shown in fig 6 d when the size of copper particles are reduced to 60 65 μm there are no inductance pulse signals but there are still resistance pulse signals at this time the amplitude and snr of resistance detection are 0 0031ω and 1 48 respectively therefore the addition of resistance detection can effectively increase the ability of sensor to detect copper particles 4 3 discussion and comparison according to the above experimental results the sensitivity of inductance and resistance detection is different the inductance method can detect smaller iron particles and the resistance method can detect smaller copper particles because the inductance signals and resistance signals of the same iron particle or copper particle can be obtained at the same time the properties of particles can be identified by combining the inductance and resistance as shown in fig 6 from fig 6 we can see that when the inductance signal has a positive pulse and the resistance signal is submerged by noise the particle is an iron particle and the particle size is 20 30 μm when both the inductance signal and the resistance signal have positive pulses the particle is an iron particle larger than 30 μm and the specific particle size is positively related to the pulse height when there is no pulse in the inductance signal and a positive pulse in the resistance signal the particle is a copper particle and the particle size is 60 90 μm the specific particle size is positively related to the pulse height when a negative pulse appears in the inductance signal and a positive pulse appears in the resistance signal the particle is a copper particle larger than 90 μm whose specific size is positively related to the inductance and resistance pulse height therefore the double wire solenoid coil sensor can detect and distinguish iron particle with diameter of 20 μm onwards and copper particles with diameter of 60 μm onwards in oil compared with the other high sensitivity micro inductive sensor the sensitivity of designed sensor is further improved without the assistance of ferromagnetic material or lc resonance method especially the detection sensitivity of non ferromagnetic particles in combination with the annual microchannel and flat microchannel we proposed before the throughput will be higher which is promising for application of discrimination detection of wear debris in oil for marine machinery 5 conclusion we presented a micro inductive sensor with double wire solenoid coil to distinguish ferromagnetic and non magnetic metal particles in the paper and proposed a combined inductance and resistance detection method to improve the sensitivity of inductive sensor especially the detection ability of non ferromagnetic metal particles the frequency characteristics of double wire solenoid coil sensor were explored through experiments and the optimal detection frequency is 2 0 mhz we demonstrated that the double wire solenoid coil sensor can detect 20 μm onwards iron particles and 60 μm onwards copper particles with inductance resistance detection method which has not been achieved before compared with the multi coil and iron core coil sensors the designed sensor has simple structure and the proposed method is maneuverable as the sensitivity of inductive sensor is not only influenced by its own structure and magnetic field strength but also inevitably limited by environmental interference the next step is to optimize the shielding design and signal processing it is expected that the sensor can provide technical support for health monitoring and fault diagnosis of marine machinery credit authorship contribution statement laihao ma formal

21577,existing design codes for coastal defense structures built on coral reefs are scarce compared to those for traditional sandy or muddy beaches a three dimensional numerical wave flume is developed to investigate monochromatic wave interaction with a vertical seawall located on the reef flat the navier stokes equations for two phase incompressible flow combining with methods of large eddy simulation les for turbulence closure and volume of fluid vof for tracking the free surface are solved a set of large scale laboratory experiments are performed to validate the adopted model in terms of free surface velocity dynamic pressure as well as overtopping discharge around the seawall the model is first applied to examine the cross shore evolution of waves and flows associated with breaking wave interaction with the seawall subsequently a series of numerical simulations are implemented to study the impacts of different hydrodynamic incident wave height incident wave period and reef flat wave level as well as reef and seawall morphological factors fore reef slope seawall position and seawall crest width on the overtopping discharge over the seawall as well as the cross shore wave impact force acting on the seawall finally new empirical formulas are proposed respectively to predict the overtopping discharge and the wave force keywords monochromatic wave overtopping discharge wave force seawall coral reef 1 introduction with the coastlines fronted by coral reefs often being low lying these coastal regions are recognized as being especially vulnerable to coastal flooding in the face of sea level rise and extreme storms e g hoeke et al 2013 merrifield et al 2014 storlazzi et al 2018 in order to protect reef coastlines a number of mitigation and adaptation strategies are being developed and applied ranging from hard engineering approaches to use nature based features coastal structures such as breakwaters and seawalls are the most commonly engineering measures to defend the landscape and the coastal facilities against extreme waves critical design parameters for breakwaters seawalls include distance from the shoreline length of each structure length of gaps between structures and freeboard or distance from top to water level nordstrom 2014 fig 1 shows two examples on the atolls namely majuro reef in the republic of the marshall islands and yongshu reef in the south china sea in order to increase the land use on such atolls coastal defense structures sometimes are constructed on the outer reef flat which means they are more likely exposed to large swell wave events over decades the interactions between regular irregular waves and breakwaters or seawalls have been extensively investigated by scholars and researchers a large group of the studies focus on wave overtopping over such coastal structures wave overtopping rate must be below the design standard to guarantee the safety of land people and property behind the structures goda 2009 therefore wave overtopping prediction is an essential step during structure design and safety assessment early work on this topic can be found in ahrens et al 1977 seelig and ahrens 1981 and well as ward and ahrens 1992 who investigated wave reflection energy dissipation wave run up and rundown as well as wave overtopping based on different laboratory experiments a major improvement in understanding the process of overtopping was the clash project de rouck et al 2009 van der meer et al 2009 which provides a wave overtopping database consisting of more than 10 000 cases analyses of dataset in this database have produced different formulas such as those of eurotop pullen et al 2007 and goda 2009 subsequently studies have dedicated to further improve these formulas e g van der meer and bruce 2014 etemad shahidi et al 2016 however a typical reef profile is featured by a steep fore reef slope normally steeper than 1 20 and a horizontal reef flat gourlay 1996 which is significantly different from sandy or muddy beaches zheng et al 2014 thus more energetic wave breaking is excited around the reef edge zhang et al 2017 the applicability of above overtopping formulas developed for beaches to the coastal defense structures built on the reef flats is questionable and this issue needs to be further investigated as for coral reefs in absence of coastal structures while a large number of studies rogers et al 2015 lowe et al 2005 2009 monismith et al 2013 symonds et al 2011 pomeroy et al 2012 and many others have reported the field observations of waves dynamics over coral reefs laboratory observations on wave interaction with reef profiles are relatively fewer most existing experimental measurements focused on the cross shore wave dynamics over reef profiles such as breaking wave properties in the reef surf zone e g gourlay 1994 yao et al 2013 2019a wave transformation including infragravity wave motions across the reef buckley et al 2018 nwogu and demirbilek et al 2010 yao et al 2019b wave induced setup and wave driven current on the reef flat e g buckley et al 2015 gourlay 1996 yao et al 2017 2018a and solitary wave propagation and run up over reef profiles quiroga and cheung 2013 roeber and cheung 2012 yao et al 2018b however none of above studies has investigated the interaction between waves and man made coastal structures constructed on the reefs to the authors knowledge we are only aware in the literature that wen et al 2018 study the wave transformation over a coral reef profile with a seawall using both laboratory tests and smoothed particle hydrodynamic sph modeling however their work focuses on the effects of seawall on such wave dynamics as wave height and spectrum evolution wave setup wave driven flow as well as wave run up over the reef profile the engineering concerns such as wave overtopping over the seawall and wave force acting on the seawall were not investigated in their study over decades numerical models also serve as alternative tools to interpret wave dynamics over coral reefs modeling wave interaction with coral reefs or similar coastal structures have been studied extensively by many researchers in the past for laboratory scale problems the boussinesq type models e g roeber and cheung 2012 su et al 2015 yao et al 2012 2018b 2019b and the non hydrostatic models e g shi et al 2018 ma et al 2014 ai et al 2019 are the most popular although these models are computationally efficient and phased resolving they still face a great challenge due to their incapability of inherently capture the energetic wave breaking on steep reefs indeed wave interaction with the breakwater or seawall on the reef flat is a highly non linear process local but strong turbulence in the vicinity of the structure need to be resolved the advanced navier stokes equation based approaches such as the cfd computational fluid dynamics tools although less computationally efficient are more appropriate in solving the irrotational flow in such problems they have begun to be used in the field of coral reef hydrodynamics in the last decade for example franklin et al 2013 performed horizontally one dimensional wave reef simulations by solving the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations the impacts of reef surface roughness on wave height wave setup infragravity waves and mean flows were examined in their study subsequently osorio cano et al 2018 conducted the large eddy simulation les to reproduce the process of wave energy dissipation due to both wave breaking and bottom friction over a reef site at tesoro island in the colombian caribbean sea more recently yao et al 2019c simulated the solitary wave breaking bore prorogation and run up over fringing reefs through a les model however none of these numerical studies has addressed the issue of wave structure interaction on the reef flat therefore to improve the current understanding in the processes of wave impact on and overtopping over a vertical seawall located on a fringing reef flat we follow yao et al 2019c s approach and develop a three dimensional 3d numerical wave flume based on the widely used cfd tool openfoam the navier stokes equations are solved using the techniques of les for turbulence closure and volume of fluid vof for free surface tracking in this study we first conduct large scale laboratory measurements of the waves and flows in the vicinity of the seawall the dynamic pressures around the seawall as well as the wave overtopping discharge over the seawall to validate the numerical model we then apply the model to examine the wave and flow evolutions around the seawall as well as the effects of both hydrodynamic and morphological factors on the overtopping discharge and the wave impact force the rest of the article is written as follows the governing equations and the numerical setup are introduced in section 2 model validation by comparing the numerical results with the laboratory measurements is described in section 3 model applications are reported in section 4 main conclusions drawn in this study are presented in section 5 2 numerical methods 2 1 governing equations the les approach is designed to resolve a large portion of the turbulent flow while parameterize the unresolved subgrid motions in the domain so that it can achieve an affordable computational cost the filtered navier stokes equations is obtained by separate the velocity field that contains the large scale components leonard 1975 the filtered velocity in the i th spatial coordinate is given by 1 u i x g x x u i x d x where the filter kernel g x x is a localized function the eddy sizes are defined using a characteristic length scale δ expressed as 2 δ δ x δ y δ z 1 3 where δ x δ y δ z are the grid sizes in streamwise spanwise and vertical directions respectively eddies larger than δ are directly solved and those smaller than δ are considered as small eddies the filtered continuity and momentum equations for incompressible flow are 3 u i x i 0 4 ρ u i t ρ u i u j x i p x i ρ g i 2 μ s i j x j τ i j r x j where μ is the dynamic viscosity ρ is the fluid

described by the sub grid scale sgs models τ i j r is calculated by a linear dependent on the rate of strain tensor according to the boussinesq hypothesis the one equation eddy viscosity model yoshizawa and horiuti 1985 is employed in this study because it is better than the well known smagorinsky model to solve the highly complex flow and shear flow menon et al 1996 τ i j r in the one equation model is defined as 6 τ i j r 2 3 k s δ i j 2 v t s i j 1 3 s k k δ i j where δ i j is the kronecker delta the sgs eddy viscosity ν t can be written as 7 ν t c k δ k s and the sgs kinetic

interface between water and air is tracked by the widely used vof method hirt and nichols 1981 a volume fraction α is introduced and it is solved by an additional advection equation as follows 9 α t α u i α 1 α u i r 0 where α is the volume fraction of water contained in a grid cell the last term on the left side is an artificial compression term with the new introduced u i r to compress the interface it functions to avoid the excessive numerical diffusion and the interface smearing with the computed α the general expression of fluid density ρ can be estimated by 10 ρ α ρ 1 1 α ρ 2 where ρ 1 1000 k g m 3 is the density of water ρ 2 1 k g m 3 is the density of air in the solver the algorithm pimple which is a mixture of the piso pressure implicit with splitting of operators and simple semi implicit method for pressure linked equations algorithms is employed to solve the coupled velocity and pressure fields details of the solver can be found in openfoam user guide 2013 2 2 boundary

jacobsen et al 2012 and ihfoam higuera et al 2013a 2013b are the most pervasive in the literature for wave generation and absorption in this study ihfoam is selected because it provides an active wave absorbing boundary and does not need a relaxation zone as required by the waves2foam the stokes 1st order linear wave theory is adopted to generate the designed waves which is realized by imposing

shift 3 model validation 3 1 experimental setup in order to validate our numerical model laboratory experiments are carried out in a large wave flume with 456 m long 5 m wide and 12 m deep at tianjin research institute for water transport engineering china p r as shown in fig 2 a a fore reef with a composite slope starting from 330 m away from the piston type wavemaker is constructed and it is followed by a horizontal reef flat with 15 m in length and 5 m above the flume bottom fig 2b further inshore the reef flat is attached to a 1 1 back reef slope a vertical seawall model fig 2c is installed on the reef flat with its front face located at a distance d from the reef edge the detailed configuration of the seawall is given by fig 2d both widths of the reef profile and the seawall match the flume width this is a relatively large scale laboratory model because it is designed according to the froude similarity law with a geometric scale factor of 1 15 based on a prototype there are spatially uneven distribution of coral communities on the field reef flat in front of the seawall but such kind of reef roughness is not considered in present physical model surface which is made by iron plates thus the results obtained in this study are relatively conservative for a seawall design as also indicated in fig 2a waves are measured at 9 cross shore locations g1 g9 using the capacitance type gauges boming co ltd china g1 and g2 are placed on the offshore side of fore reef slope to separate the incident waves from the reflected waves g3 g9 are equally spaced on the reef flat seaward of the seawall with an interval of 1 m flow velocities at two water depths v1 and v2 which are 0 2 and 0 1 m from the bottom respectively at g4 are sampled by the electromagnetic flow meters kenek co ltd japan the dynamic pressures associated with wave impacting on the seawall are recorded by 7 pressure sensors kistler co ltd japan placed around the seaside surface of seawall fig 2d all above instruments are sampled with a frequency of 50 hz the total volume of wave overtopping is collected by a water tank which is connected to the seawall crest by an artificial trench with 15 cm in width fig 2c therefore the overtopping rate per unit width can be estimated from the total collected water volume divided by both the trench width and the duration of overtopped waves the test scenarios consist of monochromatic wave conditions which are a combination of six incident wave heights h i ranging from 0 3 to 0 8 m four incident wave periods t 3 s 3 5 s 4 s and 4 5 s three reef flat water depths h 0 m 0 1 m 0 2 m and four seawall positions d 5 m 10 m 15 m 20 m each scenario is only run for 50 wave cycles after the start of the wavemaker to guarantee that the measurements are not affected by the secondary wave reflection from the wavemaker 3 2 numerical setup the numerical computational domain is established to reproduce the experimental setup fig 3 a except for the wave flume seaside of the reef profile which is truncated at 80 m from the fore reef slope toe to save the computational cost the aforementioned wave generation and active wave absorbing boundary is set at the domain inlet while another wave absorbing boundary is imposed at its outlet the conditions for other domain boundaries are free to the atmosphere at the top empty boundary for the two side faces and no slip wall boundary on the flume bottom as well as on the reef and seawall surfaces the computational domain is discretized by structured grids the grid sizes keep constant in both spanwise direction δ y 0 02 m and vertical direction δ z 0 02 m but it varies in streamwise direction to minimize the total number of cells from the domain inlet to the fore reef slope toe the grid size δ x reduces slowly from 0 08 m to 0 02 m fig 3b and c the core area covering from the fore reef slope toe to the back reef slope toe maintains a constant grid size of δ x 0 02 m to better capture the wave runup and overtop over the seawall grid refinement around the structure crest is performed by further reducing the grid size to δ x δ z 0 01 m fig 3d the total computational mesh consists of 1 05 million cells since the cross shore length of numerical wave flume is significantly truncated compared to its laboratory counterpart a simulation duration of 34 wave cycles is sufficient to reproduce the 50 wave cycles tested in the experiments the time step is automatically adjusted during the model run with a constant courant number of 0 5 it costs about 13 h to complete the simulation through parallel computing on a cluster server with 100 cpus intel xeon platinum 8173m 2 0 ghz via our pilot test no visible improvement on the results can be found when the grid sizes around the seawall are further refined to δ x δ z 0 005 m 3 3 comparison between numerical simulations and laboratory measurements a typical test scenario h i 0 7 m t 3 5 s h r 0 2 m and d 10 m in the laboratory experiments is selected for the model validation purpose fig 4 shows the comparisons of wave records η at representative wave gauge locations g2 g4 g6 and g9 between numerical simulations and experimental measurements the numerical model reproduces the offshore waves g2 very well wave breaking occurs near the reef edge the incipient breaking point is located at 0 5 m shoreward of the reef edge based on the simulations and the surfzone process extends on the reef flat all the way to the seawall thus the saw tooth shaped wave profiles measured at those sampling locations g4 g6 and g9 are not very stable due to air bubble entrainment in the surf zone however the model still captures the breaking wave evolutions reasonably well for those reef flat locations as for the model predictions at the flow measurement locations fig 5 satisfactory agreements can be observed for the streamwise velocity u at both sampling positions and the prediction is generally better at the lower position v2 than at the upper position v1 because the latter is more affected by the surface air bubbles travelling with the breaking waves we subsequently examine the simulated instantaneous overtopping discharge per unit width q t which is estimated by an integral of the instantaneous flowrate u t along the water depth on the leeside edge of the seawall crest q t shows substantial variability among different wave cycles fig 6 meanwhile the predicted time averaged q t over 10 overtopped wave cycles from 60 s to 95 s in fig 6 gives 0 024 m 2 s while the measured counterpart is 0 013 m 2 s such degree of mismatch is acceptable by considering the uncertainties in both numerical simulations and laboratory measurements to deal with the unorganized turbulence flow and the random splash up of water associated with wave overtopping finally the dynamic pressure p around the seawall surface is explored fig 7 p is generally larger on the seaside face p1 p3 and p5 than that on the crest p7 the model also reasonably captures the pressure variations at all sampling locations except for some spikes due to the effects of aforementioned air water mixtures around the seawall a slightly consistent under prediction of pressure can be detected which may be due to the fact that the horizontally one dimensional simulation only one layer of the grid in spanwise direction may not fully represent the measurement area of the laboratory pressure sensors who have circular probes of 5 mm in diameter overall satisfactory model performances in predicting waves flows and dynamic pressures indicate the robustness of the adopted model to address the hydrodynamics associated with wave interaction with a vertical seawall located on the reef flat 4 model applications 4 1 the evolution of wave and flow fields around the seawall in this section wave and vorticity fields around the seawall subjected to a monochromatic wave interaction are analyzed based on the aforementioned scenario h i 0 7 m t 3 5 s h r 0 2 m and d 10 m four representative stages including a wave run up b onset of overtopping c peak overtopping and d cease of overtopping are selected fig 8 in stage a incident breaking wave impinges the seawall and rushes up on its front face it eventually generates a splash up of water with strong air entrainment at stage b and the forward flow associated with the splashes begins to overtop over the seawall crest the maximum overtopping rate occurs at stage c when a large amount of overtopped water rushes down to the leeside of the seawall at stage d a reverse flow forms on the crest indicates the completion of overtopping process meanwhile the wave driven flow around the sewall is also examined in fig 8 via the vorticity field special attention is paid to the instant of peak flowrate over the crest i e stage c where pairs of eddies with counter rotating vorticity could be found in front of the seawall particularly at the seaside toe such vortex motions even matain their intensity at stage d when the ovetopping actually terminates suggesting that there is a large possibility of local scouring occurring at this place 4 2 overtopping discharge as illustrated in fig 9 a series of hydrodynamic and morphological factors that are not fully considered in our laboratory experiments are investigated via our model simulations the test values for those factors are listed in table 1 during the simulations we replace the composite fore reef slope in the laboratory setup by a plane slope and change the realistic vertical seawall profile to an idealized rectangle one in this way the morphological effects of both fore reef slope and seawall are easier to be parametrized each test is run by changing only one parameter at one time while keeping others the same as the default scenario h 0 0 6 m t 3 5 s h r 0 2 m s 1 10 d 10 m and w 0 15 m where u t z is the instantaneous flowrate at wader depth z on the leeside edge of the seawall crest variations of the overtopping rate with the examined parameters in table 1 are shown in fig 10 q increases with both increasing incident wave height and wave period fig 10a and b this is anticipated since the incident wave power denoted by h i 2 t increases fig 10c shows that q is insensitive to the change of reef flat water level seawall freeboard when it is relatively small because wave could not run over the seawall crest at these wave levels after h r increases to a threshold around h r 0 3 m when waves can overtop over the crest q increases notably with h r meanwhile q decreases with the decreasing fore reef slope fig 10d in that steeper slope causes the onset of incipient wave breaking further shoreward gourlay 1996 thus less wave energy is dissipated in the surf zone before waves impact on the seawall for the effect of seawall position fig 10e indicates that q drops dramatically when the distance between the reef edge and the seawall increases from 0 to 10 m due to the fact that the surfzone process thus the energy damping increases with the increasing distance however q approaches to a constant when the seawall moves further shoreward in that the surf zone ends before the seawall in such circumstance finally q appears to decrease slowly with increase of seawall crest width fig 10f which is supposed to be due to the fact that wider crest tends to maintain more shallow turbulent flows thus less wave energy is left to drive the overtopping flow most existing empirical formulas to predict the overtopping rate are proposed for wave interaction with seawall on the sloping beaches it is well established that wave overtopping discharge q over various coastal structures generally decreases exponentially as the increase of crest freeboard r c in the form of 15 q g h i 3 a exp b r c h where a and b are the empirical parameters see eurotop pullen et al 2007 for their value ranges for the seawall siting on the reef flat r c equals to a subtraction of h r from the seawall height which is 0 6 m in this study by considering the effects of all test parameters in table 1 eq 15 is examined in which the values of a 0 07 and b 5 29 are determined with the coefficient of determination r 2 0 73 by a regression analysis of all the simulated scenarios in fig 10 the predicted overtopping discharges based on eq 15 are plotted against their numerical counterparts in fig 11 a the agreements are generally not satisfactory to improve eq 15 we propose the following empirical formula to account for the overtopping rate over a rectangular seawall located on an idealized reef profile 16 q g h i 3 0 15 exp 6 03 r c h i h i g t 2 1 07 d w 1 13 s 0 73 again all the values of the coefficients in eq 16 are obtained by a regression analysis which has r 2 0 99 the predicted overtopping discharges based on eq 16 together with their numerical counterparts are plotted in fig 11b very good match indicates the robustness of using eq 16 to reproduce the monochromatic wave overtopping rate over the vertical seawall on a reef flat 4 3 wave force in this study the total wave force acting on the seawall is obtained by integrating the computed dynamic pressures around the seawall surface the maximum cross shore wave force per unit width on the seawall f x is found to occur at the instant when wave impinges on the seaward face of the seawall i e wave pressures at p1 p6 see fig 7 reached their peaks f x increases with both the increasing incident wave height and wave period fig 12 a and b this is again due to the increased incident wave power h i 2 t it also increases rapidly with the increase of reef flat water level fig 12c in that higher water level on the reef flat i e smaller seawall freeboard allows less energy damping by wave breaking around the reef edge and more transmitted wave energy acting on the seawall similar to the q in section 4 2 f x decreases with the decrease of fore reef slope because of the aforementioned reduction of breaking wave energy dissipation with steeper slopes fig 12d also in analogy to q fig 12e shows that f x drops significantly when the distance between the reef edge and the seawall increases from 0 to 10 m after that it approaches to a constant as the seawall moves further inland finally the increase of seawall crest width only causes slight decline of f x within the test range fig 12f which can be explained again by the fact that wider crest results in slightly more turbulence dissipation when wave overtops over the seawall following the same procedure as the previous analysis of overtopping rate we propose the following empirical formula for predicting f x based on the influential factors in table 1 via a regression analysis 17 f x ρ g h i 2 0 10 h r h i 0 81 h i g t 2 0 50 d w 0 02 s 0 13 which has r 2 0 94 fig 13 compares the predicted f x from eq 17 to the simulated f x in fig 12 good agreement demonstrates the robustness of eq 17 in predicting the cross shore maximum wave force acting on the rectangular seawall located on an idealized fringing reef profile we finally remark that both eqs 16 and 17 proposed in the study are only valid for our test ranges of the parameters listed in table 1 when they are applied to a prototype seawall in addition to those factors explicitly considered seawall configuration surface roughness and permeability wave incident angle etc may also affect the values of the empirical coefficients in these formulas 5 conclusions in this study a 3d numerical wave flume based on openfoam is established to model the interaction between the monochromatic wave and a vertical seawall located on a coral reef flat the navier stokes equations are solved for the two phase incompressible flow and the methods of les and vof are used for the turbulence closure and tracking the free surface respectively large scale laboratory experiments are also performed to validate the model results show that the developed model is robust to capture the main aspects of wave dynamics around the seawall in terms of the free surface the velocity the dynamic pressure and the overtopping discharge the validated model is then applied to analyze the evolution of waves and flows around the seawall the overtopping rate over the seawall and the cross shore wave impact force acting on the seawall the enhanced vortex motions are observed at the seaside toe of the seawall associated with the overtopped flow the overtopping discharge and the wave force are found to increase with both the increasing incident wave height and incident wave period larger water depth on the reef flat i e smaller seawall freeboard causes larger overtopping discharge and wave force particularly at high water levels both the overtopping discharge and the wave force decline with the decrease of fore reef slope and they also drop dramatically when the seawall moves further inland within the surf zone the effects of cross shore seawall crest width on both the overtopping discharge and the wave force appear to be less significant new empirical equations accounting for the overtopping discharge and the wave force are proposed respectively by taking the examined hydrodynamic and morphological factors into consideration realistic waves at the field sites are more complex than the monochromatic waves reef and seawall configuration surface roughness and permeability wave incident angle etc might affect the hydrodynamic responses of the seawall to a more or less degree nevertheless the present study provides a fundamental step to explore more sophisticated problems such as the stability of the seawall and the local scouring around the seawall during extreme wave events credit authorship contribution statement songgui chen methodology investigation writing

21577,existing design codes for coastal defense structures built on coral reefs are scarce compared to those for traditional sandy or muddy beaches a three dimensional numerical wave flume is developed to investigate monochromatic wave interaction with a vertical seawall located on the reef flat the navier stokes equations for two phase incompressible flow combining with methods of large eddy simulation les for turbulence closure and volume of fluid vof for tracking the free surface are solved a set of large scale laboratory experiments are performed to validate the adopted model in terms of free surface velocity dynamic pressure as well as overtopping discharge around the seawall the model is first applied to examine the cross shore evolution of waves and flows associated with breaking wave interaction with the seawall subsequently a series of numerical simulations are implemented to study the impacts of different hydrodynamic incident wave height incident wave period and reef flat wave level as well as reef and seawall morphological factors fore reef slope seawall position and seawall crest width on the overtopping discharge over the seawall as well as the cross shore wave impact force acting on the seawall finally new empirical formulas are proposed respectively to predict the overtopping discharge and the wave force keywords monochromatic wave overtopping discharge wave force seawall coral reef 1 introduction with the coastlines fronted by coral reefs often being low lying these coastal regions are recognized as being especially vulnerable to coastal flooding in the face of sea level rise and extreme storms e g hoeke et al 2013 merrifield et al 2014 storlazzi et al 2018 in order to protect reef coastlines a number of mitigation and adaptation strategies are being developed and applied ranging from hard engineering approaches to use nature based features coastal structures such as breakwaters and seawalls are the most commonly engineering measures to defend the landscape and the coastal facilities against extreme waves critical design parameters for breakwaters seawalls include distance from the shoreline length of each structure length of gaps between structures and freeboard or distance from top to water level nordstrom 2014 fig 1 shows two examples on the atolls namely majuro reef in the republic of the marshall islands and yongshu reef in the south china sea in order to increase the land use on such atolls coastal defense structures sometimes are constructed on the outer reef flat which means they are more likely exposed to large swell wave events over decades the interactions between regular irregular waves and breakwaters or seawalls have been extensively investigated by scholars and researchers a large group of the studies focus on wave overtopping over such coastal structures wave overtopping rate must be below the design standard to guarantee the safety of land people and property behind the structures goda 2009 therefore wave overtopping prediction is an essential step during structure design and safety assessment early work on this topic can be found in ahrens et al 1977 seelig and ahrens 1981 and well as ward and ahrens 1992 who investigated wave reflection energy dissipation wave run up and rundown as well as wave overtopping based on different laboratory experiments a major improvement in understanding the process of overtopping was the clash project de rouck et al 2009 van der meer et al 2009 which provides a wave overtopping database consisting of more than 10 000 cases analyses of dataset in this database have produced different formulas such as those of eurotop pullen et al 2007 and goda 2009 subsequently studies have dedicated to further improve these formulas e g van der meer and bruce 2014 etemad shahidi et al 2016 however a typical reef profile is featured by a steep fore reef slope normally steeper than 1 20 and a horizontal reef flat gourlay 1996 which is significantly different from sandy or muddy beaches zheng et al 2014 thus more energetic wave breaking is excited around the reef edge zhang et al 2017 the applicability of above overtopping formulas developed for beaches to the coastal defense structures built on the reef flats is questionable and this issue needs to be further investigated as for coral reefs in absence of coastal structures while a large number of studies rogers et al 2015 lowe et al 2005 2009 monismith et al 2013 symonds et al 2011 pomeroy et al 2012 and many others have reported the field observations of waves dynamics over coral reefs laboratory observations on wave interaction with reef profiles are relatively fewer most existing experimental measurements focused on the cross shore wave dynamics over reef profiles such as breaking wave properties in the reef surf zone e g gourlay 1994 yao et al 2013 2019a wave transformation including infragravity wave motions across the reef buckley et al 2018 nwogu and demirbilek et al 2010 yao et al 2019b wave induced setup and wave driven current on the reef flat e g buckley et al 2015 gourlay 1996 yao et al 2017 2018a and solitary wave propagation and run up over reef profiles quiroga and cheung 2013 roeber and cheung 2012 yao et al 2018b however none of above studies has investigated the interaction between waves and man made coastal structures constructed on the reefs to the authors knowledge we are only aware in the literature that wen et al 2018 study the wave transformation over a coral reef profile with a seawall using both laboratory tests and smoothed particle hydrodynamic sph modeling however their work focuses on the effects of seawall on such wave dynamics as wave height and spectrum evolution wave setup wave driven flow as well as wave run up over the reef profile the engineering concerns such as wave overtopping over the seawall and wave force acting on the seawall were not investigated in their study over decades numerical models also serve as alternative tools to interpret wave dynamics over coral reefs modeling wave interaction with coral reefs or similar coastal structures have been studied extensively by many researchers in the past for laboratory scale problems the boussinesq type models e g roeber and cheung 2012 su et al 2015 yao et al 2012 2018b 2019b and the non hydrostatic models e g shi et al 2018 ma et al 2014 ai et al 2019 are the most popular although these models are computationally efficient and phased resolving they still face a great challenge due to their incapability of inherently capture the energetic wave breaking on steep reefs indeed wave interaction with the breakwater or seawall on the reef flat is a highly non linear process local but strong turbulence in the vicinity of the structure need to be resolved the advanced navier stokes equation based approaches such as the cfd computational fluid dynamics tools although less computationally efficient are more appropriate in solving the irrotational flow in such problems they have begun to be used in the field of coral reef hydrodynamics in the last decade for example franklin et al 2013 performed horizontally one dimensional wave reef simulations by solving the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations the impacts of reef surface roughness on wave height wave setup infragravity waves and mean flows were examined in their study subsequently osorio cano et al 2018 conducted the large eddy simulation les to reproduce the process of wave energy dissipation due to both wave breaking and bottom friction over a reef site at tesoro island in the colombian caribbean sea more recently yao et al 2019c simulated the solitary wave breaking bore prorogation and run up over fringing reefs through a les model however none of these numerical studies has addressed the issue of wave structure interaction on the reef flat therefore to improve the current understanding in the processes of wave impact on and overtopping over a vertical seawall located on a fringing reef flat we follow yao et al 2019c s approach and develop a three dimensional 3d numerical wave flume based on the widely used cfd tool openfoam the navier stokes equations are solved using the techniques of les for turbulence closure and volume of fluid vof for free surface tracking in this study we first conduct large scale laboratory measurements of the waves and flows in the vicinity of the seawall the dynamic pressures around the seawall as well as the wave overtopping discharge over the seawall to validate the numerical model we then apply the model to examine the wave and flow evolutions around the seawall as well as the effects of both hydrodynamic and morphological factors on the overtopping discharge and the wave impact force the rest of the article is written as follows the governing equations and the numerical setup are introduced in section 2 model validation by comparing the numerical results with the laboratory measurements is described in section 3 model applications are reported in section 4 main conclusions drawn in this study are presented in section 5 2 numerical methods 2 1 governing equations the les approach is designed to resolve a large portion of the turbulent flow while parameterize the unresolved subgrid motions in the domain so that it can achieve an affordable computational cost the filtered navier stokes equations is obtained by separate the velocity field that contains the large scale components leonard 1975 the filtered velocity in the i th spatial coordinate is given by 1 u i x g x x u i x d x where the filter kernel g x x is a localized function the eddy sizes are defined using a characteristic length scale δ expressed as 2 δ δ x δ y δ z 1 3 where δ x δ y δ z are the grid sizes in streamwise spanwise and vertical directions respectively eddies larger than δ are directly solved and those smaller than δ are considered as small eddies the filtered continuity and momentum equations for incompressible flow are 3 u i x i 0 4 ρ u i t ρ u i u j x i p x i ρ g i 2 μ s i j x j τ i j r x j where μ is the dynamic viscosity ρ is the fluid density g is the gravity acceleration p is the filtered pressure s i j is the strain rate of large scale motions which is defined as 5 s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i and τ i j r is the residual stress described by the sub grid scale sgs models τ i j r is calculated by a linear dependent on the rate of strain tensor according to the boussinesq hypothesis the one equation eddy viscosity model yoshizawa and horiuti 1985 is employed in this study because it is better than the well known smagorinsky model to solve the highly complex flow and shear flow menon et al 1996 τ i j r in the one equation model is defined as 6 τ i j r 2 3 k s δ i j 2 v t s i j 1 3 s k k δ i j where δ i j is the kronecker delta the sgs eddy viscosity ν t can be written as 7 ν t c k δ k s and the sgs kinetic

interface between water and air is tracked by the widely used vof method hirt and nichols 1981 a volume fraction α is introduced and it is solved by an additional advection equation as follows 9 α t α u i α 1 α u i r 0 where α is the volume fraction of water contained in a grid cell the last term on the left side is an artificial compression term with the new introduced u i r to compress the interface it functions to avoid the excessive numerical diffusion and the interface smearing with the computed α the general expression of fluid density ρ can be estimated by 10 ρ α ρ 1 1 α ρ 2 where ρ 1 1000 k g m 3 is the density of water ρ 2 1 k g m 3 is the density of air in the solver the algorithm pimple which is a mixture of the piso pressure implicit with splitting of operators and simple semi implicit method for pressure linked equations algorithms is employed to solve the coupled velocity and pressure fields details of the solver can be found in openfoam user guide 2013 2 2 boundary conditions a no slip wall condition is set on the solid boundary by forcing the velocity near the solid surface to satisfy the logarithmic law of wall two third party modules namely waves2foam jacobsen et al 2012 and ihfoam higuera et al 2013a 2013b are the most pervasive in the literature for wave generation and absorption in this study ihfoam is selected because it provides an active wave absorbing boundary and does not need a relaxation zone as required by the waves2foam the stokes 1st order linear wave theory is adopted to generate the designed waves which is realized by imposing both free surface elevation and velocity components at the inlet boundary 11 η h 2 cos k x ω t ψ 12 u h 2 ω c o s h k z s i n h k h c o s k x ω t ψ 13 w h 2 ω s i n h k z s i n h k h s i n k x ω t ψ

shift 3 model validation 3 1 experimental setup in order to validate our numerical model laboratory experiments are carried out in a large wave flume with 456 m long 5 m wide and 12 m deep at tianjin research institute for water transport engineering china p r as shown in fig 2 a a fore reef with a composite slope starting from 330 m away from the piston type wavemaker is constructed and it is followed by a horizontal reef flat with 15 m in length and 5 m above the flume bottom fig 2b further inshore the reef flat is attached to a 1 1 back reef slope a vertical seawall model fig 2c is installed on the reef flat with its front face located at a distance d from the reef edge the detailed configuration of the seawall is given by fig 2d both widths of the reef profile and the seawall match the flume width this is a relatively large scale laboratory model because it is designed according to the froude similarity law with a geometric scale factor of 1 15 based on a prototype there are spatially uneven distribution of coral communities on the field reef flat in front of the seawall but such kind of reef roughness is not considered in present physical model surface which is made by iron plates thus the results obtained in this study are relatively conservative for a seawall design as also indicated in fig 2a waves are measured at 9 cross shore locations g1 g9 using the capacitance type gauges boming co ltd china g1 and g2 are placed on the offshore side of fore reef slope to separate the incident waves from the reflected waves g3 g9 are equally spaced on the reef flat seaward of the seawall with an interval of 1 m flow velocities at two water depths v1 and v2 which are 0 2 and 0 1 m from the bottom respectively at g4 are sampled by the electromagnetic flow meters kenek co ltd japan the dynamic pressures associated with wave impacting on the seawall are recorded by 7 pressure sensors kistler co ltd japan placed around the seaside surface of seawall fig 2d all above instruments are sampled with a frequency of 50 hz the total volume of wave overtopping is collected by a water tank which is connected to the seawall crest by an artificial trench with 15 cm in width fig 2c therefore the overtopping rate per unit width can be estimated from the total collected water volume divided by both the trench width and the duration of overtopped waves the test scenarios consist of monochromatic wave conditions which are a combination of six incident wave heights h i ranging from 0 3 to 0 8 m four incident wave periods t 3 s 3 5 s 4 s and 4 5 s three reef flat water depths h 0 m 0 1 m 0 2 m and four seawall positions d 5 m 10 m 15 m 20 m each scenario is only run for 50 wave cycles after the start of the wavemaker to guarantee that the measurements are not affected by the secondary wave reflection from the wavemaker 3 2 numerical setup the numerical computational domain is established to reproduce the experimental setup fig 3 a except for the wave flume seaside of the reef profile which is truncated at 80 m from the fore reef slope toe to save the computational cost the aforementioned wave generation and active wave absorbing boundary is set at the domain inlet while another wave absorbing boundary is imposed at its outlet the conditions for other domain boundaries are free to the atmosphere at the top empty boundary for the two side faces and no slip wall boundary on the flume bottom as well as on the reef and seawall surfaces the computational domain is discretized by structured grids the grid sizes keep constant in both spanwise direction δ y 0 02 m and vertical direction δ z 0 02 m but it varies in streamwise direction to minimize the total number of cells from the domain inlet to the fore reef slope toe the grid size δ x reduces slowly from 0 08 m to 0 02 m fig 3b and c the core area covering from the fore reef slope toe to the back reef slope toe maintains a constant grid size of δ x 0 02 m to better capture the wave runup and overtop over the seawall grid refinement around the structure crest is performed by further reducing the grid size to δ x δ z 0 01 m fig 3d the total computational mesh consists of 1 05 million cells since the cross shore length of numerical wave flume is significantly truncated compared to its laboratory counterpart a simulation duration of 34 wave cycles is sufficient to reproduce the 50 wave cycles tested in the experiments the time step is automatically adjusted during the model run with a constant courant number of 0 5 it costs about 13 h to complete the simulation through parallel computing on a cluster server with 100 cpus intel xeon platinum 8173m 2 0 ghz via our pilot test no visible improvement on the results can be found when the grid sizes around the seawall are further refined to δ x δ z 0 005 m 3 3 comparison between numerical simulations and laboratory measurements a typical test scenario h i 0 7 m t 3 5 s h r 0 2 m and d 10 m in the laboratory experiments is selected for the model validation purpose fig 4 shows the comparisons of wave records η at representative wave gauge locations g2 g4 g6 and g9 between numerical simulations and experimental measurements the numerical model reproduces the offshore waves g2 very well wave breaking occurs near the reef edge the incipient breaking point is located at 0 5 m shoreward of the reef edge based on the simulations and the surfzone process extends on the reef flat all the way to the seawall thus the saw tooth shaped wave profiles measured at those sampling locations g4 g6 and g9 are not very stable due to air bubble entrainment in the surf zone however the model still captures the breaking wave evolutions reasonably well for those reef flat locations as for the model predictions at the flow measurement locations fig 5 satisfactory agreements can be observed for the streamwise velocity u at both sampling positions and the prediction is generally better at the lower position v2 than at the upper position v1 because the latter is more affected by the surface air bubbles travelling with the breaking waves we subsequently examine the simulated instantaneous overtopping discharge per unit width q t which is estimated by an integral of the instantaneous flowrate u t along the water depth on the leeside edge of the seawall crest q t shows substantial variability among different wave cycles fig 6 meanwhile the predicted time averaged q t over 10 overtopped wave cycles from 60 s to 95 s in fig 6 gives 0 024 m 2 s while the measured counterpart is 0 013 m 2 s such degree of mismatch is acceptable by considering the uncertainties in both numerical simulations and laboratory measurements to deal with the unorganized turbulence flow and the random splash up of water associated with wave overtopping finally the dynamic pressure p around the seawall surface is explored fig 7 p is generally larger on the seaside face p1 p3 and p5 than that on the crest p7 the model also reasonably captures the pressure variations at all sampling locations except for some spikes due to the effects of aforementioned air water mixtures around the seawall a slightly consistent under prediction of pressure can be detected which may be due to the fact that the horizontally one dimensional simulation only one layer of the grid in spanwise direction may not fully represent the measurement area of the laboratory pressure sensors who have circular probes of 5 mm in diameter overall satisfactory model performances in predicting waves flows and dynamic pressures indicate the robustness of the adopted model to address the hydrodynamics associated with wave interaction with a vertical seawall located on the reef flat 4 model applications 4 1 the evolution of wave and flow fields around the seawall in this section wave and vorticity fields around the seawall subjected to a monochromatic wave interaction are analyzed based on the aforementioned scenario h i 0 7 m t 3 5 s h r 0 2 m and d 10 m four representative stages including a wave run up b onset of overtopping c peak overtopping and d cease of overtopping are selected fig 8 in stage a incident breaking wave impinges the seawall and rushes up on its front face it eventually generates a splash up of water with strong air entrainment at stage b and the forward flow associated with the splashes begins to overtop over the seawall crest the maximum overtopping rate occurs at stage c when a large amount of overtopped water rushes down to the leeside of the seawall at stage d a reverse flow forms on the crest indicates the completion of overtopping process meanwhile the wave driven flow around the sewall is also examined in fig 8 via the vorticity field special attention is paid to the instant of peak flowrate over the crest i e stage c where pairs of eddies with counter rotating vorticity could be found in front of the seawall particularly at the seaside toe such vortex motions even matain their intensity at stage d when the ovetopping actually terminates suggesting that there is a large possibility of local scouring occurring at this place 4 2 overtopping discharge as illustrated in fig 9 a series of hydrodynamic and morphological factors that are not fully considered in our laboratory experiments are investigated via our model simulations the test values for those factors are listed in table 1 during the simulations we replace the composite fore reef slope in the laboratory setup by a plane slope and change the realistic vertical seawall profile to an idealized rectangle one in this way the morphological effects of both fore reef slope and seawall are easier to be parametrized each test is run by changing only one parameter at one time while keeping others the same as the default scenario h 0 0 6 m t 3 5 s h r 0 2 m s 1 10 d 10 m and w 0 15 m where u t z is the instantaneous flowrate at wader depth z on the leeside edge of the seawall crest variations of the overtopping rate with the examined parameters in table 1 are shown in fig 10 q increases with both increasing incident wave height and wave period fig 10a and b this is anticipated since the incident wave power denoted by h i 2 t increases fig 10c shows that q is insensitive to the change of reef flat water level seawall freeboard when it is relatively small because wave could not run over the seawall crest at these wave levels after h r increases to a threshold around h r 0 3 m when waves can overtop over the crest q increases notably with h r meanwhile q decreases with the decreasing fore reef slope fig 10d in that steeper slope causes the onset of incipient wave breaking further shoreward gourlay 1996 thus less wave energy is dissipated in the surf zone before waves impact on the seawall for the effect of seawall position fig 10e indicates that q drops dramatically when the distance between the reef edge and the seawall increases from 0 to 10 m due to the fact that the surfzone process thus the energy damping increases with the increasing distance however q approaches to a constant when the seawall moves further shoreward in that the surf zone ends before the seawall in such circumstance finally q appears to decrease slowly with increase of seawall crest width fig 10f which is supposed to be due to the fact that wider crest tends to maintain more shallow turbulent flows thus less wave energy is left to drive the overtopping flow most existing empirical formulas to predict the overtopping rate are proposed for wave interaction with seawall on the sloping beaches it is well established that wave overtopping discharge q over various coastal structures generally decreases exponentially as the increase of crest freeboard r c in the form of 15 q g h i 3 a exp b r c h where a and b are the empirical parameters see eurotop pullen et al 2007 for their value ranges for the seawall siting on the reef flat r c equals to a subtraction of h r from the seawall height which is 0 6 m in this study by considering the effects of all test parameters in table 1 eq 15 is examined in which the values of a 0 07 and b 5 29 are determined with the coefficient of determination r 2 0 73 by a regression analysis of all the simulated scenarios in fig 10 the predicted overtopping discharges based on eq 15 are plotted against their numerical counterparts in fig 11 a the agreements are generally not satisfactory to improve eq 15 we propose the following empirical formula to account for the overtopping rate over a rectangular seawall located on an idealized reef profile 16 q g h i 3 0 15 exp 6 03 r c h i h i g t 2 1 07 d w 1 13 s 0 73 again all the values of the coefficients in eq 16 are obtained by a regression analysis which has r 2 0 99 the predicted overtopping discharges based on eq 16 together with their numerical counterparts are plotted in fig 11b very good match indicates the robustness of using eq 16 to reproduce the monochromatic wave overtopping rate over the vertical seawall on a reef flat 4 3 wave force in this study the total wave force acting on the seawall is obtained by integrating the computed dynamic pressures around the seawall surface the maximum cross shore wave force per unit width on the seawall f x is found to occur at the instant when wave impinges on the seaward face of the seawall i e wave pressures at p1 p6 see fig 7 reached their peaks f x increases with both the increasing incident wave height and wave period fig 12 a and b this is again due to the increased incident wave power h i 2 t it also increases rapidly with the increase of reef flat water level fig 12c in that higher water level on the reef flat i e smaller seawall freeboard allows less energy damping by wave breaking around the reef edge and more transmitted wave energy acting on the seawall similar to the q in section 4 2 f x decreases with the decrease of fore reef slope because of the aforementioned reduction of breaking wave energy dissipation with steeper slopes fig 12d also in analogy to q fig 12e shows that f x drops significantly when the distance between the reef edge and the seawall increases from 0 to 10 m after that it approaches to a constant as the seawall moves further inland finally the increase of seawall crest width only causes slight decline of f x within the test range fig 12f which can be explained again by the fact that wider crest results in slightly more turbulence dissipation when wave overtops over the seawall following the same procedure as the previous analysis of overtopping rate we propose the following empirical formula for predicting f x based on the influential factors in table 1 via a regression analysis 17 f x ρ g h i 2 0 10 h r h i 0 81 h i g t 2 0 50 d w 0 02 s 0 13 which has r 2 0 94 fig 13 compares the predicted f x from eq 17 to the simulated f x in fig 12 good agreement demonstrates the robustness of eq 17 in predicting the cross shore maximum wave force acting on the rectangular seawall located on an idealized fringing reef profile we finally remark that both eqs 16 and 17 proposed in the study are only valid for our test ranges of the parameters listed in table 1 when they are applied to a prototype seawall in addition to those factors explicitly considered seawall configuration surface roughness and permeability wave incident angle etc may also affect the values of the empirical coefficients in these formulas 5 conclusions in this study a 3d numerical wave flume based on openfoam is established to model the interaction between the monochromatic wave and a vertical seawall located on a coral reef flat the navier stokes equations are solved for the two phase incompressible flow and the methods of les and vof are used for the turbulence closure and tracking the free surface respectively large scale laboratory experiments are also performed to validate the model results show that the developed model is robust to capture the main aspects of wave dynamics around the seawall in terms of the free surface the velocity the dynamic pressure and the overtopping discharge the validated model is then applied to analyze the evolution of waves and flows around the seawall the overtopping rate over the seawall and the cross shore wave impact force acting on the seawall the enhanced vortex motions are observed at the seaside toe of the seawall associated with the overtopped flow the overtopping discharge and the wave force are found to increase with both the increasing incident wave height and incident wave period larger water depth on the reef flat i e smaller seawall freeboard causes larger overtopping discharge and wave force particularly at high water levels both the overtopping discharge and the wave force decline with the decrease of fore reef slope and they also drop dramatically when the seawall moves further inland within the surf zone the effects of cross shore seawall crest width on both the overtopping discharge and the wave force appear to be less significant new empirical equations accounting for the overtopping discharge and the wave force are proposed respectively by taking the examined hydrodynamic and morphological factors into consideration realistic waves at the field sites are more complex than the monochromatic waves reef and seawall configuration surface roughness and permeability wave incident angle etc might affect the hydrodynamic responses of the seawall to a more or less degree nevertheless the present study provides a fundamental step to explore more sophisticated problems such as the stability of the seawall and the local scouring around the seawall during extreme wave events credit authorship contribution statement songgui chen methodology investigation writing

21578,internal waves are widespread in oceans and play an important role in mixing in this study we observed some oscillations of pycnoclines that are thought to be caused by internal waves by analyzing the vertical and temporal variations of current speed and density during ebbs of the neap tides in the south channel of the yangtze river changjiang estuary these oscillations have an amplitude of 1 2 m and a duration of 2 3 h to explore the mechanism of this phenomenon topographic features of the seabed were recorded and a huge sandbar was observed at the place where the oscillations occurred therefore we infer the oscillations in the south channel were caused by the process that the stratified water flowed over the sandbar which induced internal hydraulics and led to the excitation of internal waves froude number was calculated according to the internal hydraulics equations and the results verified our hypothesis that it was the interactions between the stratified water and rapidly changing topography that triggered internal hydraulics internal waves caused upward directed water movement which influenced the vertical transport of sediment and the vertical distribution of the suspended sediment internal waves also increased the mass diffusivity coefficient kz at the interface of internal waves keywords internal waves internal hydraulics topography froude number mixing vertical transport 1 introduction estuaries are transition zones between rivers and oceans savenije 2006 the interactions between river flow and tides are highly dynamic in estuaries due to the complex hydrologic drivers and geomorphic constraints du et al 2018 hoitink and jay 2016 hoitink et al 2017 one of the most important characteristics of estuaries is stratification stratification occurs when freshwater flows into saline embayment the stratification varies temporally and spatially in different estuarine environments because of the interactions of river discharge exchange flow and mixing geyer and maccready 2014 maccready et al 2018 wang et al 2017 the highly stratified condition may occur due to abundant freshwater inflow and weak tidal mixing stratification influences the vertical mixing of the estuaries wang and geyer 2018 which greatly affects the physics and the vertical distributions of chemicals and biota therefore the study of dynamic processes within stratified estuaries is crucial for understanding the estuarine dynamics and sediment transport internal waves are one kind of gravity wave in stratified fluids that have attracted attention for many reasons in the oceans internal waves are considered to be an important driving force for mixing armi 1979 munk and wunsch 1998 munk 1966 internal waves can cause sediment resuspension and transport in shoaling processes ribbe and holloway 2001 southard et al 1971 tian et al 2019 wright et al 1986 and large scale resuspension can erode seafloor sediment and form marine nepheloid layers masunaga et al 2015 reeder et al 2011 internal waves can also shape the slope morphology and impact the sedimentary landscape of the seabed cacchione et al 2002 puig et al 2004 disturbances caused by the interactions between tidal flow and topographic features on the seabed density stratification and atmospheric forcing are some of the causes to excite internal waves in the oceans lighthill 1978 thorpe 1992 in this study we focus our research on the south channel of the yangtze river changjiang estuary yangtze river is one of the largest rivers all over the world which transports a huge amount of sediment to the ocean every year 3 68 108 t yr recorded from 1951 to 2015 at the datong station the south channel is one of the major channel of the estuary and a large number of ships travel cross the channel every day for fishery or transportation so understanding the hydrodynamics in the channel is critical for the implementation of effective management the internal waves in the yangtze river estuary may significantly influence the mixing and sediment transport therefore plays a great role in controlling the hydrodynamics and sediment transport in the estuary we investigated the vertical structures of velocity density and oscillations in the south channel of the yangtze river estuary from december 16 2018 to january 16 2019 aiming at investigating whether internal waves exist in the estuary and the possible mechanisms of them based on the data analysis we confirmed the existence of internal hydraulics and the features and possible mechanisms for their excitation as well as the impacts they brought to sediment transport in the estuary were further discussed 2 study area the yangtze river estuary located near the coastal area of the east china sea is one of the largest estuaries all over the world as shown in fig 1 the interactions between river flow and tides dominate the hydrodynamics of the yangtze river estuary cai et al 2016 the tidal range is up to 4 6 m with its mean value of 2 7 m in the estuary the duration of averaged ebb tides is 7 5 h 2 5 h longer than that of averaged flood tides indicating an irregular semidiurnal characteristic zhang et al 2012 the yangtze river discharges fluctuate following a wet dry cycle due to the seasonal variations of precipitation in the upstream with the maximum river discharges occurring in july and the minimum discharges occurring in january the maximum difference in annual discharge is around 38 000 m3 s cai et al 2016 the yangtze river bifurcates into four channels at the river mouth among which the south channel carries most of the water and sediment discharges 56 of the total water discharge and 65 of the total sediment discharges xie et al 2015 the total length of the south channel is around 86 km and several sandbars were detected in the channel 3 methods 3 1 data collection we deployed bottom mounted tripods at the station n2 fig 1b during the periods from december 16 2018 to january 16 2019 and thus the hydrographic data were collected during both neap and spring tides were collected one tripod was equipped with two acoustic doppler velocimeters adv 6 mhz nortek vector measuring 3 dimensional 3d current velocities at 0 25 m and 0 75 m above the seabed the adv collected data in burst mode at 10 min intervals and the sampling frequency within each burst was 16 hz recording 8192 samples in total additionally time series of turbidity temperature and salinity were obtained at two depths 0 25 m 0 75 m above the seabed using two nephelometers obs 3a d a instrument co apart from the near bed tripod measurements a boat was anchored to collect the vertical hydrodynamic and sediment data throughout the water column vertical velocity profiles and acoustic images from 0 8 m below the surface to depth near the seabed were obtained using a downward looking acoustic doppler current profiler tdri adcp 1200 khz every 2s with a vertical resolution of 0 2 m each bin size the data of vertical temperature and salinity profiles were collected for the whole water column using a seabird 25 ctd hourly from 6 a m to 0 a m of the next day and every two hours from 0 a m to 6 a m the vertical profiles of suspended sediment concentration ssc were collected simultaneously with in situ water sample calibrated obs turbidities turbulence dissipation rates in the water column the rates at which turbulence kinetic energy is converted into thermal internal energy were calculated using the data of nortek ad2cp 16 hz every 20 min we also collected topographic data by multibeam from the stations n1 to n3 and n4 to n5 fig 1b respectively more details on the instruments we used the observed variables the location and the time intervals are shown in table 1 and fig 1 3 2 richardson number calculation the parameterization of the condition that determines estuarine stratification is one of the most crucial aspects of estuarine dynamics brunt väisälä frequency n2 and richardson number ri are commonly used parameters to reflect the status of stratification and stability geyer and ralston 2011 they are expressed as 1 n 2 g ρ d ρ d z 2 r i n 2 d u z d z 2 in which u z is the velocity m s at the depth of z m g is the gravitational acceleration m s2 and ρ is the density of the water kg m3 n2 is an intrinsic frequency related to static stability the frequency of the oscillation relies on the static stability the more stratified the water column the higher the static stability and the higher the n2 ri is a non dimensional parameter used to express the trade off between stratification and mixing if ri 0 25 the stratification is strong and the velocity shear is small if ri 0 25 the stratification is weak and the velocity shear is large which is favorable to vertical mixing 3 3 the internal hydraulics equations internal hydraulic in highly stratified estuaries is typically studied by dividing the estuary into upper and lower layers separated by the pycnocline this approach is based on the assumption that exchanges between the upper and the lower layer are slow compared to advective processes within each layer schijf and schönfled 1953 stommel and farmer 1952 following wang et al 2015 a schematic of the bilayer structure is shown in fig 2 and the baroclinic momentum equation for the neap tide could be written as 3 1 g 2 h 1 x u 1 u 2 g t 1 g b u 1 h 1 u 2 h 2 q 2 x f 2 2 h x f 2 2 c d u 1 2 u 2 2 g b b x t d t v d t d d t f d t w d t where h1 x indicates the slope of the interface g2 is defined as composite froude number g2 f1 2 f2 2 and z h1 represents the vertical position of the interface as shown in fig 2 the terms on the right hand side rhs of eq 3 are abbreviated as a time dependent term tdt a volume dependent term vdt a depth dependent term ddt a friction dependent term fdt and a width dependent term wdt tdt is correlated to the time variations of vertical velocity shear vdt corresponds to the longitudinal variations of the volume flux of the lower layer ddt is correlated to the bottom slope fdt is associated with the bottom friction and wdt is caused by the longitudinal variations of the estuary flow over sills in fjords is one of the practical applications of two layer hydraulics geyer and ralston 2011 because the slope of the seabed hb x is much larger than cd at the station n2 0 0045 vs 0 0025 the bottom topography plays a more important role than friction thus fdt is ignored in our analysis considering a steady flow with increasing width like the yangtze river estuary the rhs of eq 3 can be reduced to ddt and wdt geyer and ralston 2011 due to the lack of data to calculate term b we estimated the values of wdt and ddt to obtain the signal of the left side of the eq 3 in this study although we have no direct evidence it is reasonable to assume that b x is positive as b increases downstream along the channel 4 result 4 1 topography topographic features on the seabed are considered to be one of the main reasons for the excitation of internal waves and huge sandbars were observed in the middle of the southern channel as shown in fig 1b c and 1d the steepest slope is at n2 station where the river mouth sandbar is located the water depth above the sand bar varies from 2 m to 8 m in a longitudinal distance of 1 3 km so the slope hb x at the station n2 is around 0 0045 hb is the elevation of the seabed which is much higher compared to the averaged value of 0 0003 in the south channel as a result the sandbar behaves as a natural barrier for water flowing over it the area from n1 to n2 is within the southern channel and the area from n2 to n3 is located outside of the river mouth the water depth h decreases from n1 to n2 and increases from n2 to n3 4 2 vertical profiles of hydrodynamic properties two events of pycnocline oscillations occurred at n2 station during the observation one month the first event was on december 30 and the second was on january 15 both of which occurred during neap tides during each event the oscillations occurred more than one time and the correlated data were analyzed for three tidal cycles as shown in fig 3 the data on december 23 and 24 when there were no oscillations were used for comparison fig 4 as shown in fig 3 the maximum current speeds were around 1 3 m s and 1 4 m s for flood tides and ebb tides respectively during the first period of oscillation from december 30 to 31 2018 fig 3a and around 1 2 m s and 1 1 m s for flood tides and ebb tides respectively during the second period of oscillation from january 15 to 16 2019 fig 3b the maximum current speeds were around 1 6 m s and 1 4 m s for flood tides and ebb tides from december 23 to 24 2018 when no oscillation occurred fig 4a the vertical density profiles as shown in fig 3c d and 4b were calculated based upon temperature and salinity the vertical distributions of density varied within tidal cycles during high water of the first period of oscillations the density reached up to 1015 5 kg m3 at the bottom and was around 1006 0 kg m3 at the surface as shown in fig 3c for low water the density was low throughout the entire water column 1003 0 kg m3 at the bottom and 1000 5 kg m3 at the surface as shown in fig 3c similarly in the second period of oscillations the density reached up to 1013 0 kg m3 at the bottom and was 1009 0 kg m3 at the surface for the high water period as shown in fig 3d and the density changed to be more uniform during the low water period around 1006 5 kg m3 at the bottom and around 1005 0 kg m3 at the surface from december 23 to 24 2018 the density was vertically uniform both during the flood and the ebb the maximum density was around 1013 0 kg m3 during the ebb and around 1005 0 kg m3 during the flood as shown in fig 4b the high density gradient in fig 3c and d clearly showed the stratified condition with two different density layers divided by the pycnocline on the other hand the vertical uniform density profile in fig 4b showed a low stratified condition the time series of pycnoclines in fig 3c and d showed oscillations of the interface between the upper and the lower layers as shown in black rectangles no oscillations were detected in fig 4b in fig 3c oscillations were found during the following periods 15 00 to 22 00 on december 30 2018 and 6 00 to 15 00 on december 31 2018 in fig 3d oscillations were found during the following periods 6 00 to 9 00 19 00 to 23 00 on january 15 and 8 00 to 13 00 on january 16 2019 these oscillations had amplitudes of 1 2 m and a duration of 2 3 h most of which occurred during ebb tides at the intervals between the high water and the low water as these oscillations happened close to the huge sandbar we proposed a hypothesis that these oscillations were caused by internal hydraulics when stratified water flowed over the abruptly changing seabed farmer and armi 1999 to test this hypothesis the froude number was calculated using the internal hydraulics equation see section 4 3 brunt väisälä frequency n2 was calculated to show the stratification status of the water column as shown in fig 3e and f high values of n2 0 02 s 2 were found at the interface during the ebb tides as shown in black rectangles the high values of n2 indicated highly stratified conditions at the interface in fig 4c the values of n2 were less than 0 001 throughout the profile during the whole time period indicating low stratification of the water column the impacts of the internal waves on the velocity shear du dz 2 were shown in figs 7b 9b and 11b as shown in the black rectangles in figs 7b and 9b the values of du dz 2 increased at the interface when internal waves happened 0 2 s 2 in fig 7b and 0 04 s 2 in fig 9b on the other hand during the time period when no internal waves were detected fig 11b showed the values of du dz 2 were low in the middle of the water and high at the surface and the bottom about 0 s 2 in the middle of the water and 0 05 s 2 at the surface and bottom therefore when internal waves occurred the significant differences in currents between the upper and lower layer caused high velocity shear at the interface richardson number ri was calculated to show the stability of the water column the log10 ri was used instead of ri because the values of ri reached very high at the interface as shown in fig 3g and h high values of log10 ri exceeding 0 6 which means the values of ri to be larger than 0 25 were found at the interface indicating the stable condition of the interface as shown in black rectangles however during the time periods when internal waves happened the values of log10 ri dropped to around 0 6 at the interface as shown in red rectangles in fig 3g and h it indicates that internal waves weakened the stability of the water at the interface in fig 4d when no internal waves were detected the values of log10 ri were low throughout the profile 4 3 mechanism of pycnocline oscillations according to eq 3 the right side can be simplified to ddt and wdt in the south channel of the yangtze river estuary the width of the estuary b increases downstream water depth reduces downstream due to the sandbar thus h x is negative and ddt is positive further b x is positive and the average velocity of the upper layer u1 is either higher than the lower layer u2 or the same so wdt is either positive or close to 0 therefore the right side wdt ddt is always positive indicating that the left side of the equation is positive the left side of the equation is determined by h 1 x and 1 g2 g2 is defined as composite froude number and the term h 1 x reflects the trend of pycnocline at the interface when g2 1 1 g2 is negative h 1 x should be negative on the other hand when g2 1 h 1 x is positive when h 1 x is negative the pycnocline goes upwards and vice versa when the horizontal gradient h 1 x varies between positive and negative values the pycnocline fluctuates in the water column triggering the internal hydraulics and exciting internal waves by examining the variations of g2 we can predict the occurrence of internal hydraulics the log10 g2 is used instead of g2 for a better presentation from 19 00 to 20 00 on december 30 2018 and 8 00 to 9 00 on december 31 2018 as shown in fig 5 a the values of log10 g2 were below 0 which means the values of g2 were smaller than 1 similarly during the periods 7 00 19 00 on january 15 and 8 00 to 9 00 on january 16 the calculated low values of g2 1 as shown in fig 5b were found the fluctuation of the values of g2 confirms our hypothesis that it was the stratified water flowing over the sandbar that triggered internal hydraulics and exciting internal waves as the two events of internal hydraulics were observed within one month it is inferred that internal waves occur occasionally in the south channel of the yangtze river estuary due to water stratification and the huge sandbar 5 discussion internal waves are considered to be an important driving force for mixing in oceans armi 1979 munk and wunsch 1998 munk 1966 in estuaries internal waves are important as they also affect suspended sediment concentration ssc and sediment transport by influencing mixing besides as sediment particles carry organic and inorganic matters interval waves also influence the transport of organic and inorganic matters in estuaries the vertical ssc profiles are shown in fig 6 a from december 30 to 31 2018 fig 6b from january 15 to 16 2019 and fig 6c from december 23 to 24 2018 the ssc changed within tidal cycles in the first period of oscillations the values of ssc reached up to 1 8 g l at the bottom and were close to 0 g l at the surface during periods of high water or low water the values of ssc were low for the entire water column 0 6 g l at the bottom and close to 0 g l at the surface fig 6a similarly in the second period of oscillation the values of ssc reached up to 0 34 g l at the bottom and were around 0 02 g l at the surface fig 6b respectively in fig 6c the values of ssc reached up to 1 3 g l at the bottom and were around 0 1 g l at the surface fig 6a and b show the highly stratified condition of the ssc and fig 6c indicates low stratification of the ssc as shown in fig 6c during the period without internal waves the variations of ssc were controlled by tidal currents and no oscillation of ssc was observed in contrast during the period with internal waves the vertical ssc profiles show oscillations simultaneously as shown in red rectangles in fig 6a b and fig 3c d the similar oscillations of ssc to that of the pycnocline indicates that the internal waves influenced the vertical distributions of the suspended sediment when internal waves were at their crests the oscillations of the ssc were at their crests too and vice versa mass diffusivity coefficient kz is an important parameter in the dynamics of suspended sediment which shows the status of sediment diffusion in estuarine environments where the water is stratified the kz could be calculated as mehta 1989 ross 1988 4 kz kn 1 α ri β where kn is the neutral diffusivity in order to account for the influences of tidal current we use the von kármán expression κ 0 408 for kn which applies to turbulent open channel flows mehta 1989 α and β are empirical coefficients and according to mehta 1989 α 10 and β 1 ri is the richardson number shown in eq 2 but here ρ in eq 1 is considered the density of the water and sediment ρm ρm could be calculated as guan et al 2005 5 ρ m c ρ w ρ s ρ s c where c is the ssc kg m3 ρ w is the density of seawater kg m3 ρ s is the density of the dry sediment 2650 kg m3 we calculated the values of kz during three time periods december 30 2018 january 15 2019 and december 23 2018 the results are shown in figs 7 9 and 11 in fig 7 when internal waves happened on december 31 8 00 11 00 and 14 00 the values of du dz 2 increased at the interface causing the values of kz increasing at the same time as shown in the black rectangles in fig 7a and b fig 8 showed the vertical distributions of the kz and du dz 2 at these three points of time the values of kz and du dz 2 increased at the same heights similarly in fig 9 when internal waves occurred at the time points january 15 8 00 19 00 21 00 23 00 and january 16 8 00 both the values of du dz 2 and kz increased at the interface simultaneously as shown in black rectangles in fig 9a and b fig 10 showed the vertical distributions of kz and du dz 2 at the five points of time with the same increasing trend at the interface as the other period on the other hand when no internal waves were detected both the values of the du dz 2 and kz were low at the middle of the water fig 11 in conclusion the internal waves increased du dz 2 at the interface which then leads to a high mass diffusivity coefficient kz simultaneously at the same location vertical distributions of vertical velocity w during december 31 6 00 to 15 00 january 15 17 00 to january 16 3 00 december 23 23 00 to december 24 9 00 were analyzed and shown in fig 12 a b c respectively to evaluate the impacts of internal waves on w and the vertical transport of suspended sediment the vertical profile covered the water column from 1 m above the seabed to the water surface the upward directed flow was observed simultaneously with the appearance of internal waves the upward directed flow occurred below the interface of internal waves or throughout the whole water column as shown in black rectangles in fig 12a and b carrying sediments up calculations of vertical sediment transport showed that around 17 3 t and 28 8 t sediment moved upwards at 1 m height during the first period december 31 12 00 to 14 00 and the second period january 15 20 00 to 24 00 respectively the turbulence dissipation rate ε is the rate at which turbulence kinetic energy is converted into thermal internal energy which is relevant to turbulence energy the values of turbulence dissipation rate increase when internal waves break we calculated ε with the method of pwelch monin et al 1985 vassilicos 2015 and the results are presented in fig 13 similar trends of the turbulence dissipation rate were found during the periods with and without internal waves fig 13a vs fig 13b demonstrating that the turbulence dissipation rate had no correlations with the occurrence of internal waves it means we didn t observe the breaking of internal waves at this place these internal waves might spread and break elsewhere internal waves are widely investigated in stratified coastal oceans and have been tested to play an important role in enhancing turbulent mixing and transport of sediments and biochemically important materials hosegood and van haren 2004 omand et al 2011 most internal waves are triggered by stratified water flowing over topography such as banks and sills the observations in the south channel of the yangtze river estuary demonstrated that because of the sandbars at the channel topography can be a cause of internal waves the internal waves in the yangtze river estuary occurred during ebb tides between the interval of high water and low water which was temporally consistent with former studies in estuaries farmer and armi 1999 geyer and farmer 1989 held et al 2019 in some other estuaries the breaking of internal waves can weaken stratification and induce vertical mixing of sediment birch and sundermeyer 2011 held et al 2019 leichter et al 2005 leading to the diffusion of sediment into the upper water layer and significantly increased sediment transport in this study we didn t observe the breaking of the internal waves because the observed data were limited to one station therefore the impacts of the breaking of internal waves in the yangtze river estuary on the stratification and vertical mixing were not analyzed moreover the important characteristics of internal waves propagation and the spread of these oscillations was not observed due to the limitation of one station data therefore further researches with spatial varied dataset are needed to a deep understanding of internal waves dynamics in the yangtze river estuary 6 conclusion based on the analyses of the one month observed data from december 18 2018 to january 17 2019 it is confirmed that internal waves existed during the ebb of neap tides at the south channel of the yangtze river estuary during neap tides the water flow became stratified and suitable for the excitation of internal waves these internal waves were triggered by stratified water flowing over the sandbars which created internal hydraulics vertical distributions of suspended sediment concentration ssc showed similar oscillation patterns as the internal waves which indicates that the internal waves influenced the vertical distribution of the sediment the results of the mass diffusivity coefficient kz analysis showed that the internal waves increased kz at the interface internal waves caused upward directed flow w leading to the vertical transport of sediment further researches on internal waves are needed as they would be affected by climate changes and human activities floods can intensify the stratification of water in estuaries and increase the occurrence of internal waves human activities such as sand excavating in estuaries may cause internal waves to move upstream enclosing tideland for cultivation may also affect internal waves credit author statement the contributions made by each of the authors are listed as follows 1 ya ping wang put forward the

21578,internal waves are widespread in oceans and play an important role in mixing in this study we observed some oscillations of pycnoclines that are thought to be caused by internal waves by analyzing the vertical and temporal variations of current speed and density during ebbs of the neap tides in the south channel of the yangtze river changjiang estuary these oscillations have an amplitude of 1 2 m and a duration of 2 3 h to explore the mechanism of this phenomenon topographic features of the seabed were recorded and a huge sandbar was observed at the place where the oscillations occurred therefore we infer the oscillations in the south channel were caused by the process that the stratified water flowed over the sandbar which induced internal hydraulics and led to the excitation of internal waves froude number was calculated according to the internal hydraulics equations and the results verified our hypothesis that it was the interactions between the stratified

estuaries due to the complex hydrologic drivers and geomorphic constraints du et al 2018 hoitink and jay 2016 hoitink et al 2017 one of the most important characteristics of estuaries is stratification stratification occurs when freshwater flows into saline embayment the stratification varies temporally and spatially in different estuarine environments because of the interactions of river discharge exchange flow and mixing geyer and maccready 2014 maccready et al 2018 wang et al 2017 the highly stratified condition may occur due to abundant freshwater inflow and weak tidal mixing stratification influences the vertical mixing of the estuaries wang and geyer 2018 which greatly affects the physics and the vertical distributions of chemicals and biota therefore the study of

transports a huge amount of sediment to the ocean every year 3 68 108 t yr recorded from 1951 to 2015 at the datong station the south channel is one of the major channel of the estuary and a large

whether internal waves exist in the estuary and the possible mechanisms of them based on the data analysis we confirmed the existence of internal hydraulics and the features and possible mechanisms for their excitation as well as the impacts they brought to sediment transport in the estuary were further discussed 2 study area the yangtze river estuary located near the coastal area of the east china sea is one of the largest estuaries all over the world as shown in fig 1 the interactions between river flow and tides dominate the hydrodynamics of the yangtze river estuary cai et al 2016 the tidal range is up to 4 6 m with its mean value of 2 7 m in the estuary the duration of averaged ebb tides is 7 5 h 2 5 h longer than that of averaged flood tides indicating an irregular semidiurnal characteristic zhang et al 2012 the yangtze river discharges fluctuate following a wet dry cycle due to the seasonal variations of precipitation in the upstream with the maximum river discharges occurring in july and the minimum discharges occurring in january the maximum difference in annual discharge is around 38 000 m3 s cai et al 2016 the yangtze river bifurcates into four channels at the river mouth among which the south channel carries most of the water and sediment discharges 56 of the total water discharge and 65 of the total sediment discharges xie et al 2015 the total length of the south channel is around 86 km and several sandbars were detected in the channel 3 methods 3 1 data collection we deployed bottom mounted tripods at the station n2 fig 1b during the periods from december 16 2018 to january 16 2019 and thus the hydrographic data were collected during both neap and spring tides were collected one tripod was equipped with two acoustic doppler velocimeters adv 6 mhz nortek vector measuring 3 dimensional 3d current velocities at 0 25 m and 0 75 m above the seabed the adv collected data in burst mode at 10 min intervals and the sampling frequency within each burst was 16 hz recording 8192 samples in total additionally time series of turbidity temperature and salinity were obtained at two depths 0 25 m 0 75 m above the seabed using two nephelometers obs 3a d a instrument co apart from the near bed tripod measurements a boat was anchored to collect the vertical hydrodynamic and sediment data throughout the water column vertical velocity profiles and acoustic images from 0 8 m below the surface to depth near the seabed were obtained using a downward looking acoustic doppler current profiler tdri adcp 1200 khz every 2s with a vertical resolution of 0 2 m each bin size the data of vertical temperature and salinity profiles were collected for the whole water column using a seabird 25 ctd hourly from 6 a m to 0 a m of the next day and every two hours from 0 a m to 6 a m the vertical profiles of suspended sediment concentration ssc were collected simultaneously with in situ water sample calibrated obs turbidities turbulence dissipation rates in the water column the rates at which turbulence kinetic energy is converted into thermal internal energy were calculated using the data of nortek ad2cp 16 hz every 20 min we also collected topographic data by multibeam from the stations n1 to n3 and n4 to n5 fig 1b respectively more details on the instruments we used the observed variables the location and the time intervals are shown in table 1 and fig 1 3 2 richardson number calculation the parameterization of the condition that determines estuarine stratification is one of the most crucial aspects of estuarine dynamics brunt väisälä frequency n2 and richardson number ri are commonly used parameters to reflect the status of stratification and stability geyer and ralston 2011 they are expressed as 1 n 2 g ρ d ρ d z 2 r i n 2 d u z d z 2 in which u z is the velocity m s at the depth of z m g is the gravitational acceleration m s2 and ρ is the density of the water kg m3 n2 is an intrinsic frequency related to static stability the frequency of the oscillation relies on the static stability the more stratified the water column the higher the static stability and the higher the n2 ri is a non dimensional parameter used to express the trade off between stratification and mixing if ri 0 25 the stratification is strong and the velocity shear is small if ri 0 25 the stratification is weak and the velocity shear is large which is favorable to vertical mixing 3 3 the internal hydraulics equations internal hydraulic in highly stratified estuaries is typically studied by dividing the estuary into upper and lower layers separated by the pycnocline this approach is based on the assumption that exchanges between the upper and the lower layer are slow compared to advective processes within each layer schijf and schönfled 1953 stommel and farmer 1952 following wang et al 2015 a schematic of the bilayer structure is shown in fig 2 and the baroclinic momentum equation for the neap tide could be written as 3 1 g 2 h 1 x u 1 u 2 g t 1 g b u 1 h 1 u 2 h 2 q 2 x f 2 2 h x f 2 2 c d u 1 2 u 2 2 g b b x t d t v d t d d t f d t w d t where h1 x indicates the slope of the interface g2 is defined as composite froude number g2 f1 2 f2 2 and z h1 represents the vertical position of the interface as shown in fig 2 the terms on the right hand side rhs of eq 3 are abbreviated as a time dependent term tdt a volume dependent term vdt a depth dependent term ddt a friction dependent term fdt and a width dependent term wdt tdt is correlated to the time variations of vertical velocity shear vdt corresponds to the longitudinal variations of the volume flux of the lower layer ddt is correlated to the bottom slope fdt is associated with the bottom friction and wdt is caused by the longitudinal variations of the estuary flow over sills in fjords is one of the practical applications of two layer hydraulics geyer and ralston 2011 because the slope of the seabed hb x is much larger than cd at the station n2 0 0045 vs 0 0025 the bottom topography plays a more important role than friction thus fdt is ignored in our analysis considering a steady flow with increasing width like the yangtze river estuary the rhs of eq 3 can be reduced to ddt and wdt geyer and ralston 2011 due to the lack of data to calculate term b we estimated the values of wdt and ddt to obtain the signal of the left side of the eq 3 in this study although we have no direct evidence it is reasonable to assume that b x is positive as b increases downstream along the channel 4 result 4 1 topography topographic features on the seabed are considered to be one of the main reasons for the excitation of internal waves and huge sandbars were observed in the middle of the southern channel as shown in fig 1b c and 1d the steepest slope is at n2 station where the river mouth sandbar is located the water depth above the sand bar varies from 2 m to 8 m in a longitudinal distance of 1 3 km so the slope hb x at the station n2 is around 0 0045 hb is the elevation of the seabed which is much higher compared to the averaged value of 0 0003 in the south channel as a result the sandbar behaves as a natural barrier for water flowing over it the area from n1 to n2 is within the southern channel and the area from n2 to n3 is located outside of the river mouth the water depth h decreases from n1 to n2 and increases from n2 to n3 4 2 vertical profiles of hydrodynamic properties two events of pycnocline oscillations occurred at n2 station during the observation one month the first event was on december 30 and the second was on january 15 both of which occurred during neap tides during each event the oscillations occurred more than one time and the correlated data were analyzed for three tidal cycles as shown in fig 3 the data on december 23 and 24 when there were no oscillations were used for comparison fig 4 as shown in fig 3 the maximum current speeds were around 1 3 m s and 1 4 m s for flood tides and ebb tides respectively during the first period of oscillation from december 30 to 31 2018 fig 3a and around 1 2 m s and 1 1 m s for flood tides and ebb tides respectively during the second period of oscillation from january 15 to 16 2019 fig 3b the maximum current speeds were around 1 6 m s and 1 4 m s for flood tides and ebb tides from december 23 to 24 2018 when no oscillation occurred fig 4a the vertical density profiles as shown in fig 3c d and 4b were calculated based upon temperature and salinity the vertical distributions of density varied within tidal cycles during high water of the first period of oscillations the density reached up to 1015 5 kg m3 at the bottom and was around 1006 0 kg m3 at the surface as shown in fig 3c for low water the density was low throughout the entire water column 1003 0 kg m3 at the bottom and 1000 5 kg m3 at the surface as shown in fig 3c similarly in the second period of oscillations the density reached up to 1013 0 kg m3 at the bottom and was 1009 0 kg m3 at the surface for the high water period as shown in fig 3d and the density changed to be more uniform during the low water period around 1006 5 kg m3 at the bottom and around 1005 0 kg m3 at the surface from december 23 to 24 2018 the density was vertically uniform both during the flood and the ebb the maximum density was around 1013 0 kg m3 during the ebb and around 1005 0 kg m3 during the flood as shown in fig 4b the high density gradient in fig 3c and d clearly showed the stratified condition with two different density layers divided by the pycnocline on the other hand the vertical uniform density profile in fig 4b showed a low stratified condition the time series of pycnoclines in fig 3c and d showed oscillations of the interface between the upper and the lower layers as shown in black rectangles no oscillations were detected in fig 4b in fig 3c oscillations were found during the following periods 15 00 to 22 00 on december 30 2018 and 6 00 to 15 00 on december 31 2018 in fig 3d oscillations were found during the following periods 6 00 to 9 00 19 00 to 23 00 on january 15 and 8 00 to 13 00 on january 16 2019 these oscillations had amplitudes of 1 2 m and a duration of 2 3 h most of which occurred during ebb tides at the intervals between the high water and the low water as these oscillations happened close to the huge sandbar we proposed a hypothesis that these oscillations were caused by internal hydraulics when stratified water flowed over the abruptly changing seabed farmer and armi 1999 to test this hypothesis the froude number was calculated using the internal hydraulics equation see section 4 3 brunt väisälä frequency n2 was calculated to show the stratification status of the water column as shown in fig 3e and f high values of n2 0 02 s 2 were found at the interface during the ebb tides as shown in black rectangles the high values of n2 indicated highly stratified conditions at the interface in fig 4c the values of n2 were less than 0 001 throughout the profile during the whole time period indicating low stratification of the water column the impacts of the internal waves on the velocity shear du dz 2 were shown in figs 7b 9b and 11b as shown in the black rectangles in figs 7b and 9b the values of du dz 2 increased at the interface when internal waves happened 0 2 s 2 in fig 7b and 0 04 s 2 in fig 9b on the other hand during the time period when no internal waves were detected fig 11b showed the values of du dz 2 were low in the middle of the water and high at the surface and the bottom about 0 s 2 in the middle of the water and 0 05 s 2 at the surface and bottom therefore when internal waves occurred the significant differences in currents between the upper and lower layer caused high velocity shear at the interface richardson number ri was calculated to show the stability of the water column the log10 ri was used instead of ri because the values of ri reached very high at the interface as shown in fig 3g and h high values of log10 ri exceeding 0 6 which means the values of ri to be larger than 0 25 were found at the interface indicating the stable condition of the interface as shown in black rectangles however during the time periods when internal waves happened the values of log10 ri dropped to around 0 6 at the interface as shown in red rectangles in fig 3g and h it indicates that internal waves weakened the stability of the water at the interface in fig 4d when no internal waves were detected the values of log10 ri were low throughout the profile 4 3 mechanism of pycnocline oscillations according to eq 3 the right side can be simplified to ddt and wdt in the south channel of the yangtze river estuary the width of the estuary b increases downstream water depth reduces downstream due to the sandbar thus h x is negative and ddt is positive further b x is positive and the average velocity of the upper layer u1 is either higher than the lower layer u2 or the same so wdt is either positive or close to 0 therefore the right side wdt ddt is always positive indicating that the left side of the equation is positive the left side of the equation is determined by h 1 x and 1 g2 g2 is defined as composite froude number and the term h 1 x reflects the trend of pycnocline at the interface when g2 1 1 g2 is negative h 1 x should be negative on the other hand when g2 1 h 1 x is positive when h 1 x is negative the pycnocline goes upwards and vice versa when the horizontal gradient h 1 x varies between positive and negative values the pycnocline fluctuates in the water column triggering the internal hydraulics and exciting internal waves by examining the variations of g2 we can predict the occurrence of internal hydraulics the log10 g2 is used instead of g2 for a better presentation from 19 00 to 20 00 on december 30 2018 and 8 00 to 9 00 on december 31 2018 as shown in fig 5 a the values of log10 g2 were below 0 which means the values of g2 were smaller than 1 similarly during the periods 7 00 19 00 on january 15 and 8 00 to 9 00 on january 16 the calculated low values of g2 1 as shown in fig 5b were found the fluctuation of the values of g2 confirms our hypothesis that it was the stratified water flowing over the sandbar that triggered internal hydraulics and exciting internal waves as the two events of internal hydraulics were observed within one month it is inferred that internal waves occur occasionally in the south channel of the yangtze river estuary due to water stratification and the huge sandbar 5 discussion internal waves are considered to be an important driving force for mixing in oceans armi 1979 munk and wunsch 1998 munk 1966 in estuaries internal waves are important as they also affect suspended sediment concentration ssc and sediment transport by influencing mixing besides as sediment particles carry organic and inorganic matters interval waves also influence the transport of organic and inorganic matters in estuaries the vertical ssc profiles are shown in fig 6 a from december 30 to 31 2018 fig 6b from january 15 to 16 2019 and fig 6c from december 23 to 24 2018 the ssc changed within tidal cycles in the first period of oscillations the values of ssc reached up to 1 8 g l at the bottom and were close to 0 g l at the surface during periods of high water or low water the values of ssc were low for the entire water column 0 6 g l at the bottom and close to 0 g l at the surface fig 6a similarly in the second period of oscillation the values of ssc reached up to 0 34 g l at the bottom and were around 0 02 g l at the surface fig 6b respectively in fig 6c the values of ssc reached up to 1 3 g l at the bottom and were around 0 1 g l at the surface fig 6a and b show the highly stratified condition of the ssc and fig 6c indicates low stratification of the ssc as shown in fig 6c during the period without internal waves the variations of ssc were controlled by tidal currents and no oscillation of ssc was observed in contrast during the period with internal waves the vertical ssc profiles show oscillations simultaneously as shown in red rectangles in fig 6a b and fig 3c d the similar oscillations of ssc to that of the pycnocline indicates that the internal waves influenced the vertical distributions of the suspended sediment when internal waves were at their crests the oscillations of the ssc were at their crests too and vice versa mass diffusivity coefficient kz is an important parameter in the dynamics of suspended sediment which shows the status of sediment diffusion in estuarine environments where the water is stratified the kz could be calculated as mehta 1989 ross 1988 4 kz kn 1 α ri β where kn is the neutral diffusivity in order to account for the influences of tidal current we use the von kármán expression κ 0 408 for kn which applies to turbulent open channel flows mehta 1989 α and β are empirical coefficients and according to mehta 1989 α 10 and β 1 ri is the richardson number shown in eq 2 but here ρ in eq 1 is considered the density of the water and sediment ρm ρm could be calculated as guan et al 2005 5 ρ m c ρ w ρ s ρ s c where c is the ssc kg m3 ρ w is the density of seawater kg m3 ρ s is the density of the dry sediment 2650 kg m3 we calculated the values of kz during three time periods december 30 2018 january 15 2019 and december 23 2018 the results are shown in figs 7 9 and 11 in fig 7 when internal waves happened on december 31 8 00 11 00 and 14 00 the values of du dz 2 increased at the interface causing the values of kz increasing at the same time as shown in the black rectangles in fig 7a and b fig 8 showed the vertical distributions of the kz and du dz 2 at these three points of time the values of kz and du dz 2 increased at the same heights similarly in fig 9 when internal waves occurred at the time points january 15 8 00 19 00 21 00 23 00 and january 16 8 00 both the values of du dz 2 and kz increased at the interface simultaneously as shown in black rectangles in fig 9a and b fig 10 showed the vertical distributions of kz and du dz 2 at the five points of time with the same increasing trend at the interface as the other period on the other hand when no internal waves were detected both the values of the du dz 2 and kz were low at the middle of the water fig 11 in conclusion the internal waves increased du dz 2 at the interface which then leads to a high mass diffusivity coefficient kz simultaneously at the same location vertical distributions of vertical velocity w during december 31 6 00 to 15 00 january 15 17 00 to january 16 3 00 december 23 23 00 to december 24 9 00 were analyzed and shown in fig 12 a b c respectively to evaluate the impacts of internal waves on w and the vertical transport of suspended sediment the vertical profile covered the water column from 1 m above the seabed to the water surface the upward directed flow was observed simultaneously with the appearance of internal waves the upward directed flow occurred below the interface of internal waves or throughout the whole water column as shown in black rectangles in fig 12a and b carrying sediments up calculations of vertical sediment transport showed that around 17 3 t and 28 8 t sediment moved upwards at 1 m height during the first period december 31 12 00 to 14 00 and the second period january 15 20 00 to 24 00 respectively the turbulence dissipation rate ε is the rate at which turbulence kinetic energy is converted into thermal internal energy which is relevant to turbulence energy the values of turbulence dissipation rate increase when internal waves break we calculated ε with the method of pwelch monin et al 1985 vassilicos 2015 and the results are presented in fig 13 similar trends of the turbulence dissipation rate were found during the periods with and without internal waves fig 13a vs fig 13b demonstrating that the turbulence dissipation rate had no correlations with the occurrence of internal waves it means we didn t observe the breaking of internal waves at this place these internal waves might spread and break elsewhere internal waves are widely investigated in stratified coastal oceans and have been tested to play an important role in enhancing turbulent mixing and transport of sediments and biochemically important materials hosegood and van haren 2004 omand et al 2011 most internal waves are triggered by stratified water flowing over topography such as banks and sills the observations in the south channel of the yangtze river estuary demonstrated that because of the sandbars at the channel topography can be a cause of internal waves the internal waves in the yangtze river estuary occurred during ebb tides between the interval of high water and low water which was temporally consistent with former studies in estuaries farmer and armi 1999 geyer and farmer 1989 held et al 2019 in some other estuaries the breaking of internal waves can weaken stratification and induce vertical mixing of sediment birch and sundermeyer 2011 held et al 2019 leichter et al 2005 leading to the diffusion of sediment into the upper water layer and significantly increased sediment transport in this study we didn t observe the breaking of the internal waves because the observed data were limited to one station therefore the impacts of the breaking of internal waves in the yangtze river estuary on the stratification and vertical mixing were not analyzed moreover the important characteristics of internal waves propagation and the spread of these oscillations was not observed due to the limitation of one station data therefore further researches with spatial varied dataset are needed to a deep understanding of internal waves dynamics in the yangtze river estuary 6 conclusion based on the analyses of the one month observed data from december 18 2018 to january 17 2019 it is confirmed that internal waves existed during the ebb of neap tides at the south channel of the yangtze river estuary during neap tides the water flow became stratified and suitable for the excitation of internal waves these internal waves were triggered by stratified water flowing over the sandbars which created internal hydraulics vertical distributions of suspended sediment concentration ssc showed similar oscillation patterns as the internal waves which indicates that the internal waves influenced the vertical distribution of the sediment the results of the mass diffusivity coefficient kz analysis showed that the internal waves increased kz at the interface internal waves caused upward directed flow w leading to the vertical transport of sediment further researches on internal waves are needed as they would be affected by climate changes and human activities floods can intensify the stratification of water in estuaries and increase the occurrence of internal waves human activities such as sand excavating in estuaries may cause internal waves to move upstream enclosing tideland for cultivation may also affect internal waves credit author statement the contributions made by each of the authors are listed as follows 1 ya ping wang put forward the

21579,axial dynamics of risers is one of challenges in offshore oil and gas engineering axial hydrodynamic loads on a riser system are often ignored in traditional analysis methods to accurately analyze the axial dynamic response of risers an improved axial dynamic analysis method of risers is proposed based on finite element method and data driven models finite element method is introduced to analyze the structural response of risers while data driven models are trained for the calculation of hydrodynamic loads through bp neural network finally a comprehensive analysis algorithm is proposed for the axial dynamic analysis of risers by combining finite element method and data driven models the proposed method is demonstrated by its application to a case it turns out that the hydrodynamic loads on key components have an obvious influence on axial dynamics of risers especially the lower marine riser package lmrp the vibration amplitude of risers increases obviously and the vibration phase of risers presents a little lag with consideration of hydrodynamic loads the detailed influence of hydrodynamic loads on axial dynamics of risers under different amplitudes and periods of platform motion and riser configurations is also studied based on the proposed method keywords risers dynamic analysis computational fluid dynamics bp neural network finite element method 1 introduction drilling risers are key equipment for connecting drilling platform with subsea wellhead in offshore oil and gas engineering chen et al 2013 chang et al 2019 liu et al 2019 nie et al 2019 normally drilling risers connect drilling platform with subsea wellhead to form an integrated drilling channel however the connected risers should disconnect in the bottom to guarantee the safety of the whole drilling riser system under dangerous conditions such as typhoon and the loss of dynamic positioning system li et al 2016 fan et al 2017 the disconnected risers are often hanged on the drilling platform and vibrate axially under the excitation of the heave motion of drilling platform zhang et al 2019 risers are in a state of high failure risk due to axial dynamics of risers with large self weight in hang off state some risers were broken due to severe axial vibration of risers in hang off state in the south china sea liu et al 2013 therefore it is of great significance to study axial dynamics of hang off risers hang off modes of risers can be divided into soft hang off mode and hard hang off mode risers are hanged on the drilling platform via tensioners in the soft hang off mode while risers are hanged on the drilling platform directly in the hard hang off mode axial dynamics of risers in the two hang off modes has been studied for many years ambrose et al 2001 and gao et al 2014 conducted axial dynamic analysis of risers in two hang off modes and then compared riser response with each other the results showed that risers in the soft hang off mode experience little axial vibration compared to the hard hang off mode sun et al 2009 analyzed axial dynamic of ultra deepwater drilling risers the results showed that the coverage of buoyancy elements had an obvious influence on axial dynamics of risers zhang and gao 2010 studied axial dynamic response of risers in the hard hang off mode the results revealed that the axial response of risers was affected by the weight of risers ju et al 2012 investigated on the axial dynamic characteristics of risers in two hang off modes it turned out that the operation envelope of risers in the soft hang off mode was wider than that in the hard hang off mode sheng et al 2015 analyzed axial dynamics of risers in the two hang off modes the results demonstrated that risers in the soft hang off mode experience little axial section stress compared to the hard hang off mode liu et al 2017 conducted axial dynamic response of risers in different hang off modes with different lengths the results showed that weak points of risers in the hard hang off mode and soft hang off mode are riser stress and displacement of risers near moonpool respectively yang et al 2018 investigated on axial vibrations of risers in the hard hang off mode the results showed that axial vibrations of risers in the hard hang off mode increase with seawater depth and the length of risers in the aforementioned investigations it shows that risers in the soft hang off mode are safer than in the hard hang off mode due to the compensation effect of tensioners therefore the hard hang off risers are selected as the research subject to analyze axial dynamics of risers besides axial hydrodynamic loads on a riser system which may have non negligible effect on axial dynamics of risers are ignored in traditional analysis methods it is necessary to take into account axial hydrodynamic loads to analyze axial dynamics of risers more accurately the axial hydrodynamic loads on a riser system can be acquired through hydrodynamic experiments and computational fluid dynamics cfd simulation as an alternative to experimental methods cfd method has become widely popular with the advent of high performance computing and the development of robust numerical methods darvishzadeh and sari 2015 bakhtiari and ghassemi 2020 it is also feasible to conduct the hydrodynamic analysis of risers with large engineering dimensions based on cfd therefore problems ranging from structural mechanics to hydrodynamics of risers will be addressed in this study the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents basic models of risers including physical model and mechanical model section 3 introduces hydrodynamic loads on a riser system based on cfd section 4 describes data driven models based on bp network section 5 presents an analysis method for solving dynamic analysis models section 6 shows the axial dynamic analysis of risers considering hydrodynamic loads section 7 provides the conclusions 2 basic models 2 1 physical model fig 1 shows deepwater drilling platform riser system in the hard hang off mode the drilling riser system is composed of lower marine riser package lmrp and a series of riser joints including buoyancy joints and slick joints the top part of the riser system is connected with drilling platform rigidly the bottom part of the riser system is connected with blowout preventer bop and subsea wellhead via lmrp in normal condition and disconnected under dangerous scenarios the lmrp and risers are hanged on platform after the disconnection the whole riser system vibrates axially due to the excitation of platform heave movement the surrounding seawater generates hydrodynamic loads on lmrp and risers during the axial vibration it is a complex problem combing structural dynamics of risers and hydrodynamics of seawater 2 2 mechanical model a mechanical model of risers in the hard hang off mode is established based on finite element method zhang and gao 2010 wang et al 2014 as shown in fig 2 fig 2 a presents analysis model of risers fig 2 b illustrates a short element model of risers the axial vibration equation of a short element can be written as 1 t d t t f f m g

axial forces t can be shown as 2 t σ a e a u x t x where e is material modulus of risers σ is the section stress of risers a is the cross sectional area the dynamic axial forces t dt can be written as 3 t d t e a u x t x x e a u x t x d x the structural damping force f can be expressed as 4 f c u x t t d x where c is linear damping coefficient of risers then eqs 2 4 are substituted into eq 1 to get

established to calculate hydrodynamic loads including lmrp buoyancy joints slick joints buoyancy connectors and slick connectors shown in fig 1 dimension parameters of key components are listed in table 1 cfd models of key components are established in fluent based on dimension parameters listed in table 1 as shown in fig 3 the lengths of cfd models shown in fig 3 a 3 f are 5 5 m 0 5 m 0 5 m 0 5 m 1 868 m and 4 468 m respectively the calculation domain of cfd model of lmrp and inflow model of risers is bounded by four boundaries inlet boundary outlet boundary symmetrical boundary and wall the calculation domain of outflow model of slick joints outflow model of buoyancy joints outflow model of slick connectors and outflow model of buoyancy connectors is defined by three boundaries inlet boundary outlet boundary and wall the inlet boundary and outlet boundary represent velocity inlet and pressure outlet respectively the velocity inlet of the cfd model defines the relative velocity between key components of risers and their surrounding water the platform heave movement is regarded as a sinusoidal motion therefore the velocity of fluid can be written as 12 v fluid 2 π a t cos 2 π t t where a is the amplitude of heave motion and t is the period of heave motion the dimensionless distance in cfd models y should be determined to improve calculation accuracy y can be calculated by eq 13 van driest 1951 wang 2004 cebeci and cousteix 2005 malizia et al 2019 berni and fontanesi 2020 13 y δ y ρ u τ μ δ y ν τ w ρ where δy is the distance from the wall ν ν μ ρ is the kinematic viscosity τ w is the wall shear stress and u τ is the friction velocity which can be written as 14 u τ τ w ρ 1 2 then the thickness of the first grid can be expressed as zhu and qi 2019 15 y y ν u τ reynolds number is defined as follows wilson 2003 mao et al 2019 16 re v c d ν where v c is the mean velocity of flow and d is the characteristic length the original results of hydrodynamic loads in cfd simulation are dimensionless drag coefficients the dimensionless drag coefficients should be transformed to drag force to obtain hydrodynamic loads on each key component the transformation equation can be written as 17 f 1 2 ρ α v α 2 a α c d where c d is the dimensionless drag coefficient ρ α v α and a α are the density velocity and area in reference values respectively 3 3 model verification cfd models with different mesh numbers and time step sizes are analyzed to verify cfd results are mesh and time step independent the cfd model of lmrp shown in fig 3 a is firstly chosen for mesh and time step independent analysis cfd models with five different mesh numbers including 1 268 408 mesh 1 1 620 294 mesh 2 2 355 893 mesh 3 3 161 418 mesh 4 and 5 248 013 mesh 5 are established in mesh independent analysis cfd models with five different time step sizes including 0 01s time 1 0 03s time 2 0 05s time 3 0 07s time 4 and 0 09s time 5 are analyzed in time independent analysis fig 4 a and b show hydrodynamic loads of lmrp in mesh independent analysis and time step independent analysis respectively the results show that the maximum and amplitude of hydrodynamic loads of lmrp tend to be stable in mesh 3 mesh 4 and mesh 5 therefore mesh 3 whose total mesh cell number is 2 355 893 is chosen for hydrodynamic analysis considering its computational efficiency and accuracy mesh numbers of other five cfd models shown in fig 3 are also determined in the same way mesh numbers of inflow model of risers outflow model of slick joints outflow model of buoyancy joints outflow model of slick connectors and outflow model of buoyancy connectors are recommend to be 25 240 626 999 1 386 451 1 573 215 and 2 162 445 respectively time step independent analysis results shown in fig 4 b shows that the time step with 0 05s can meet the requirements for efficiency and stability besides stahl et al 2011 conducted similar research on vertical hydrodynamic loads of lmrp bop the heave motion velocity is a sinusoidal curve in which the amplitude and period are 0 762 m s and 5s respectively therefore a similar cfd model of lmrp bop is established to examine the correctness of method dealing with cfd models as shown in figs 5 and 6 the result shows that the change law of hydrodynamic loads on lmrp bop based on the established cfd model is nearly same with that of stahl et al 2011 while specific values of hydrodynamic loads are a little different the main reason is that stahl et al 2011 did not provide detailed structural parameters of lmrp bop there is some different in structural dimension between the established cfd model and that of stahl et al 2011 3 4 cfd results cfd simulations under different amplitudes and periods of heave motion are conducted based on established cfd models analysis results with varied amplitudes when the period is 10s and data with varied periods when the amplitude is 1 m are extracted to display hydrodynamic loads on key components 3 4 1 hydrodynamic loads on lmrp figs 7 a and 8 show hydrodynamic loads and flow field on lmrp with varied motion amplitudes and a fixed motion period of 10s respectively it can be seen that hydrodynamic loads velocity and pressure of fluid around lmrp increase correspondingly as motion amplitude increases besides variation curves of hydrodynamic loads are close to cosine curves while the heave motion of platform is a sine curve as shown in eq 12 there is a phase lag behind between hydrodynamic loads and platform motion the main reason is that hydrodynamic loads mainly include viscous force and inertial force which are related to velocity and acceleration of lmrp respectively the velocity and acceleration of lmrp are not in line with motion position which lead into a phase difference between hydrodynamic loads and platform motion figs 7 b and 9 show hydrodynamic loads and flow field on lmrp with varied motion frequencies and a fixed motion amplitude of 1 m respectively it is shown that the amplitude of hydrodynamic loads velocity and pressure of fluid around lmrp increase with motion frequency the main reason is that hydrodynamic loads on lmrp is mainly determined by differential pressure between different surfaces of lmrp the differential pressure increases with flow velocity which is determined by motion amplitude and motion frequency as shown in eq 12 a large motion amplitude and frequency increase flow velocity and pressure which leads to great hydrodynamic loads on lmrp 3 4 2 internal hydrodynamic loads on risers internal hydrodynamic loads on risers can be simulated based on the inflow model shown in fig 3 b internal hydrodynamic loads on risers is viscous force on internal riser wall in essence the internal viscous force increases with motion amplitude and frequency and it is opposite to motion direction as shown in fig 10 the large motion amplitude and frequency lead into great flow velocity and internal hydrodynamic loads 3 4 3 external hydrodynamic loads on risers external hydrodynamic loads on risers can be calculated based on outflow models shown in fig 3 c 3 f figs 11 and 12 show external hydrodynamic loads on slick joints and buoyancy joints respectively the external hydrodynamic loads on riser joints is viscous force on external riser wall and opposite to motion direction as well just like internal hydrodynamic loads on risers hydrodynamic loads on buoyancy joints is larger than that on slick joints since the external surface of buoyancy joints is large figs 13 and 14 show external hydrodynamic loads on slick connectors and buoyancy connectors respectively the external hydrodynamic loads on riser connectors are viscous force and inertial force just like hydrodynamic loads on lmrp hydrodynamic loads on slick connectors is larger than that on buoyancy connectors since the effective area of slick connectors in the motion direction is large the external hydrodynamic loads increases with motion amplitude and motion frequency as shown in figs 11 14 a large motion amplitude and frequency lead into great flow velocity and external hydrodynamic loads hydrodynamic loads on key components including lmrp slick joints buoyancy joints slick connectors and buoyancy connectors can be calculated based on cfd models hydrodynamic loads on a whole riser system is the sum of the product of each key component s hydrodynamic loads and its number however the database of hydrodynamic loads calculated based on cfd models with specified motion amplitudes and periods is discrete hydrodynamic loads under arbitrary motion amplitudes and periods is required in axial dynamic analysis of risers it is necessary to extend the discrete hydrodynamic database to a continuous hydrodynamic loads model 4 data driven models 4 1 data driven models data driven models have a powerful ability to recognize accurately the complex inherent nonlinear relationships between dependent and independent variables back propagation bp neural network is a well known training approach in the training of data driven models shi et al 2018 zendehboudi et al 2019 therefore bp neural network is introduced to train a continuous model of hydrodynamic loads from a discrete database fig 15 a shows a typical structure of bp network and fig 15 b illustrates a bp neuron model li et al 2018 a basic form of bp neural network is composed of three layers the input layer is used to get prediction from input data while the output layer is set for giving the final results the hidden layer whose number and structure can be modified depending on the needs of the modeling is to bridge between inputs and outputs bourdeau et al 2019 the output of hidden layer node i e neuron can be written as 18 z k f 1 i 0 n v k i x i k 1 2 q the output of output layer nodes can be expressed as 19 y j f 2 k 0 q w j k z k j 1 2 m where f 1 is the transfer function of hidden layer f 2 is the transfer function of output layer n q m is the node number in input layer hidden layer and output layer respectively besides v is the weight between input layer and hidden layer w is the weight between hidden layer and output layer for this study the inputs are the amplitude period and time of platform heave motion and the output is the hydrodynamic loads on a riser system therefore there are 3 neurons in the input layer and 1 neuron in the output layer as shown in fig 16 there exists a large order of magnitude difference between the input and output data which can lead to imprecise data driven models consequently it is necessary to normalize the input data before inputting the data to network the normalized data interval is 1 1 and the normalized method can be shown as liang et al 2008 li et al 2020 20 x 2 x x min x max x min 1 where x is the normalized data x is the input data x min and x max are the minimum and maximum values of the input data respectively other key parameters such as the number of hidden layers and the neuron number of each hidden layer should be analyzed further to determine the appropriate value then a bp neural network is established in matlab levenberg marquardt is selected as the training algorithm and the initialization parameters are set as follows the number of training is 5000 the learning rate and the convergence error are 0 1 and 0 0000001 respectively the database established in section 3 3 is divided into the training data and test data with a ratio of 4 1 the training data is used to train data driven models while the test data is set for the verification of trained data driven models 4 2 training results in a training process it is important to select the optimum numbers of hidden layers and neurons in each layer though more hidden layers and neuron units are beneficial to improve modeling results the risk of over fitting and low generalization is also increasing wong and kim 2018 nevertheless there is no proven method for selecting the numbers and sizes of hidden layers these numbers are flexible and dependent on the complexity of the problem therefore it is a trial and error process to determining the optimum structure of bp neural network du and swamy 2006 zendehboudi et al 2019 in this section the data driven model of hydrodynamic loads on lmrp is taken as an example the number of neurons corresponding to different hidden layers is set in a certain range considering the calculation efficiency and accuracy as listed in table 2 figs 17 18 show the prediction mean deviation and standard deviation of hydrodynamic loads in bp neural network with 1 and 2 hidden layers it turns out that the number of neurons has an obvious influence on the mean deviation and standard deviation of bp neural networks the mean deviation and standard deviation are large when the number of neurons is small and fluctuate as the number of neurons increases it is important that the average deviation and standard deviation vary with the number of neurons basically in the same rule therefore the optimal number of neurons can be determined according to average deviation or standard deviation it can be seen that the mean deviation and standard deviation are bigger than 0 1 when the number of hidden layer is 1 when the number of hidden layers is 2 there exists a lot of data points with mean deviation under 0 05 that can meet the accuracy requirement the optimum neurons numbers of 1st layer and 2nd layer are 21 and 20 respectively a random two cases are chosen for data driven model verification the heave motion amplitude and period in case i are 1 8 m and 10s respectively the heave amplitude motion and period in case ii are 2 1 m and 6 5s respectively hydrodynamic loads are calculated based on the established data driven model and compared with results based on cfd models as shown in fig 19 the results show that hydrodynamic loads based on the data driven model are nearly same as that based on cfd models besides it only needs less than 1 s to calculate the hydrodynamic loads based on the established data driven model the calculation efficiency of the trained data driven model is high therefore the data driven model based on bp neural network can be used for the calculation of hydrodynamic loads during the axial dynamic analysis of risers 5 analysis method mechanical model for axial dynamic analysis of risers has been established in section 2 2 finite element method is chosen for axial dynamic analysis of risers in the hard hang off mode then the structural dynamic motion equation of risers can be written as ahmad and datta 1992 ni et al 2019 21 m δ c δ k δ f where m is the mass matrix of risers c is the damping matrix k is the stiffness matrix δ is the acceleration vector δ is the velocity vector and δ is the displacement vector f is the load vector which consists of the axial hydrodynamic loads on a riser system newmark β and wilson θ are two commonly used methods for dynamic analysis fan et al 2017 the newmark β method is chosen to calculate the dynamic equation for its accuracy and efficiency the solution progress can be shown as follows wu et al 2014 liu et al 2018 the initial parameters of risers are calculated as follows 1 the stiffness matrix k mass matrix m and the damping matrix c are established 2 the initial values of acceleration vector δ velocity vector δ and displacement vector δ are defined 3 time step δt and parameters α β are selected integral constants are calculated as follows 22 a 0 1 β δ t 2 a 1 α β δ t a 2 1 β δ t a 3 1 2 β 1 a 4 α 2 β 1 a 5 δ t 2 α β 2 a 6 δ t 1 α a 7 α δ t where the equation of α and β can be shown as 23 α 0 5 β 0 25 0 5 α 2 4 the effective stiffness matrix k ˆ is formed as 24 k ˆ k a 0 m a 1 c the calculation process of each time step can be expressed as 1 the effective load vector f ˆ t δ t at the time t δt is shown as follows 25 f ˆ t δ t f t δ t m a 0 δ t a 2 δ t a 3 δ t c a 1 δ t a 4 δ t a 5 δ t 2 the displacement at the time t δt is calculated as follows 26 k ˆ δ t δ t f ˆ t δ t 3 the acceleration vector and velocity vector at the time t δt is solved as follows 27 δ t δ t a 0 δ t δ t δ t a 2 δ t a 3 δ t δ t δ t δ t a 6 δ t a 7 δ t δ t a finite element analysis program for the axial dynamic analysis of risers is developed in matlab as shown in fig 20 basic parameters of a riser system are firstly defined then the riser system is divided into a series of finite elements and structural analysis models including mass matrix stiffness matrix and damping matrix are generated data driven models for hydrodynamic loads trained in section 4 are imported for the calculation of load vector finally the axial dynamic analysis of risers can be conducted based on established structural analysis models and hydrodynamic analysis models besides structural models and hydrodynamic models needs to be updated timely based on analysis results of last step 6 dynamic analysis some engineering cases are selected for the axial dynamic analysis of risers a deepwater semi submersible platform in the south china sea is selected to analyze the axial dynamic characteristics of risers in the hard hang off mode the riser system is consisted of lmrp and a series of buoyancy joints and slick joints buoyancy joints are often installed in the upper part of the riser system while slick joints are often set in the lower part as shown in fig 1 the dimension parameters of key components are listed in table 1 the wet weight and dry weight of slick joints are 9715 kg and 11 167 kg respectively the wet weight and dry weight of buoyancy joints are 1731 kg and 19 724 kg respectively the wet weight and dry weight of lmrp are 104 331 kg and 120 000 kg respectively 6 1 axial dynamic analysis a riser system which is consisted of 49 buoyancy joints 5 slick joints and 1 lmrp is chosen for the axial dynamic analysis the total length of the riser system is 992 m the heave motion amplitude and period of platform are 1 m and 10s respectively the axial dynamic analysis program developed in matlab should be verified before axial dynamic analysis abaqus which is a powerful finite element software and has been widely used for riser analysis is chosen for analysis verification dai et al 2009 wang et al 2012 liu et al 2013 liao et al 2018 the axial dynamic analysis of risers ignoring hydrodynamic loads is compared between the developed program and abaqus since present riser analysis software including abaqus can t take into account axial hydrodynamic loads of a riser system fig 21 a and b show the dynamic section stress of risers in water depth 50 m and 700 m respectively section stress of risers can be calculated according to eq 2 based on riser dynamic analysis results in the hang off mode the section stress of risers is positively correlated with the weight of risers below the section thus the section stress in water depth 50 m is larger than that in water depth 700 m the comparison results show that the distributions of section stress simulated in the developed program and abaqus are nearly the same then the developed analysis program based on matlab can be used for improved axial dynamic analysis of risers with consideration of hydrodynamic loads the influence of the hydrodynamic loads of each key component on axial dynamics of risers are analyzed based on the developed program fig 22 a and b show the dynamic section stress of risers in water depth 50 m and 700 m respectively fig 23 a shows the amplitude of section stress in different water depths fig 23 b shows the exact occupancies of each hydrodynamic load in the whole amplitude of section stress the results show that the hydrodynamic loads h d loads on lmrp have great impact on the section stress of risers compared with analysis results without consideration of hydrodynamic loads the amplitude of section stress increases by 10 15 and 29 01 at water depth of 50 m and 700 m respectively under the influence of hydrodynamic loads on lmrp besides the amplitude of section stress at the depth of 50 m and 700 m increases by 10 31 and 31 24 respectively under the influence of combined hydrodynamic loads hydrodynamic loads shown in section 3 is mostly opposite to motion direction of risers the reactive hydrodynamic force can increase the section stress of risers the section stress variation of risers in the lower part is mainly affected by hydrodynamic loads while the section stress variation of risers in the upper part is determined by combined inertial and hydrodynamic loads therefore the effect of hydrodynamic loads is relatively smaller in the upper part of risers however the amplitude of section stress due to hydrodynamic loads which is the difference between section stress considering hydrodynamic loads and that ignoring hydrodynamic loads is basically not changed as shown in fig 23 besides there is a phase lag behind between the section stress considering hydrodynamic loads and that ignoring hydrodynamic loads as shown in fig 22 the reason is that the inertial force of risers is in line with motion acceleration while hydrodynamic loads on risers are not in line with motion velocity and acceleration as shown in section 3 in summary hydrodynamic loads increase the section stress of rises and delay the phase of section stress which improve the fracture risk and fatigue failure risk of risers the hydrodynamic loads of each key components can t be ignored in the axial dynamic analysis of risers 6 2 analysis of influencing factors in actual operation scenario risers in the hard hang off mode may experience platform motion with different amplitudes and frequencies besides the configuration of risers may also vary with different water depths therefore it is necessary to study the influence of hydrodynamic loads on axial dynamics of risers under different amplitudes and periods of platform motion and riser configurations the riser configuration of axial dynamic analysis with different amplitudes and frequencies is same as that in section 6 1 6 2 1 motion amplitude fig 24 shows the section stress of risers in depth of 50 m in varied motion amplitudes when the motion period is 10s it is shown that the amplitude of section stress increases gradually as the motion amplitude increases as the motion amplitude increase the velocity and acceleration of motion increase the increased motion velocity and acceleration lead into the increase of hydrodynamic loads and the amplitude of section stress as shown in figs 7 10 14 fig 25 illustrates the amplitude of section stress along risers due to hydrodynamic loads in varied motion amplitudes the results show that the amplitude of section stress due to hydrodynamic loads increases with motion amplitudes linearly while it doesn t change with water depth which is in line with results shown in fig 23 a 6 2 2 motion frequencies fig 26 shows the amplitude of section stress due to hydrodynamic loads in varied motion frequencies when the motion amplitude is 1 m it is shown that the stress amplitude due to hydrodynamic loads increases with motion frequency while it almost do not change as water depth increases the increased motion frequency can bring great hydrodynamic loads as shown in figs 7 10 14 therefore the stress amplitude due to hydrodynamic loads increases with motion frequency 6 2 3 riser configurations the axial dynamics of risers with different depth is analyzed to explore the influence of hydrodynamic loads on risers with different riser configurations riser configurations with different water depths are listed in table 3 fig 27 shows the amplitude of section stress in varied configuration lengths with a fixed motion amplitude of 1 m and a fixed motion period of 10s the selected section is in the depth of 50 m it can be seen that the stress amplitude increases with the total length of riser configurations besides the stress amplitude due to hydrodynamic loads increases as the total length of riser configurations increases the main reason is that the accumulative hydrodynamic loads on risers increase with the total length of riser configurations therefore the stress amplitude due to hydrodynamic loads increases as well 7 conclusions in this paper a challenge problem has been addressed the influence of hydrodynamic loads on axial dynamics of risers in the hard hang off mode finite element method is introduced to analyze the structural response of risers data driven models are trained for the calculation of hydrodynamic loads through bp neural network a comprehensive analysis

in the existing literature cfd is introduced to conduct hydrodynamic analysis of risers cfd models of key components including lmrp buoyancy joints slick joints buoyancy connectors and slick connectors are established for the calculation of hydrodynamic loads in the hang off mode bp neural network is then introduced to train a continuous data driven model of hydrodynamic loads based on a discrete database test results show that the trained data driven model can predict hydrodynamic loads accurately and efficiently a dynamic analysis model for drilling risers in the hard hang off mode is established the dynamic model is solved by finite element method in combination with newmark β method a comprehensive analysis algorithm is proposed for the axial dynamic analysis of risers by combining finite element method and data driven models an improved axial dynamic analysis program for risers is also developed in matlab the developed program is used for the axial dynamic analysis of risers in the hard hang off mode it turns out that the hydrodynamic loads of key components have an obvious influence on axial dynamics of risers especially lmrp the hydrodynamic loads of each key components can t be ignored in the axial dynamic analysis of risers besides the influence of hydrodynamic loads on axial dynamics of risers increases with motion amplitude motion frequency and

21579,axial dynamics of risers is one of challenges in offshore oil and gas engineering axial hydrodynamic loads on a riser system are often ignored in traditional analysis methods to accurately analyze the axial dynamic response of risers an improved axial dynamic analysis method of risers is proposed based on finite element method and data driven models finite element method is introduced to analyze the structural response of risers while data driven models are trained for the calculation of hydrodynamic loads through bp neural network finally a comprehensive analysis algorithm is proposed for the axial dynamic analysis of risers by combining finite element method and data driven models the proposed method is demonstrated by its application to a case it turns out that the hydrodynamic loads on key components have an obvious influence on axial dynamics of risers especially the lower marine riser package lmrp the vibration amplitude of risers increases obviously and the vibration phase of risers presents a little lag with consideration of hydrodynamic loads the detailed influence of hydrodynamic loads on axial dynamics of risers under different amplitudes and periods of platform motion and riser configurations is also studied based on the proposed method keywords risers dynamic analysis computational fluid dynamics bp neural network finite element method 1 introduction drilling risers are key equipment for connecting drilling platform with subsea wellhead in offshore oil and gas engineering chen et al 2013 chang et al 2019 liu et al 2019 nie et al 2019 normally drilling risers connect drilling platform with subsea wellhead to form an integrated drilling channel however the connected risers should disconnect in the bottom to guarantee the safety of the whole drilling riser system under dangerous conditions such as typhoon and the loss of dynamic positioning system li et al 2016 fan et al 2017 the disconnected risers are often hanged on the drilling platform and vibrate axially under the excitation of the heave motion of drilling platform zhang et al 2019 risers are in a state of high failure risk due to axial dynamics of risers with large self weight in hang off state some risers were broken due to severe axial vibration of risers in hang off state in the south china sea liu et al 2013 therefore it is of great significance to study axial dynamics of hang off risers hang off modes of risers can be divided into soft hang off mode and hard hang off mode risers are hanged on the drilling platform via tensioners in the soft hang off mode while risers are hanged on the drilling platform directly in the hard hang off mode axial dynamics of risers in the two hang off modes has been studied for many years ambrose et al 2001 and gao et al 2014 conducted axial dynamic analysis of risers in two hang off modes and then compared riser response with each other the results showed that risers in the soft hang off mode experience little axial vibration compared to the hard hang off mode sun et al 2009 analyzed axial dynamic of ultra deepwater drilling risers the results showed that the coverage of buoyancy elements had an obvious influence on axial dynamics of risers zhang and gao 2010 studied axial dynamic response of risers in the hard hang off mode the results revealed that the axial response of risers was affected by the weight of risers ju et al 2012 investigated on the axial dynamic characteristics of risers in two hang off modes it turned out that the operation envelope of risers in the soft hang off mode was wider than that in the hard hang off mode sheng et al 2015 analyzed axial dynamics of risers in the two hang off modes the results demonstrated that risers in the soft hang off mode experience little axial section stress compared to the hard hang off mode liu et al 2017 conducted axial dynamic response of risers in different hang off modes with different lengths the results showed that weak points of risers in the hard hang off mode and soft hang off mode are riser stress and displacement of risers near moonpool respectively yang et al 2018 investigated on axial vibrations of risers in the hard hang off mode the results showed that axial vibrations of risers in the hard hang off mode increase with seawater depth and the length of risers in the aforementioned investigations it shows that risers in the soft hang off mode are safer than in the hard hang off mode due to the compensation effect of tensioners therefore the hard hang off risers are selected as the research subject to analyze axial dynamics of risers besides axial hydrodynamic loads on a riser system which may have non negligible effect on axial dynamics of risers are ignored in traditional analysis methods it is necessary to take into account axial hydrodynamic loads to analyze axial dynamics of risers more accurately the axial hydrodynamic loads on a riser system can be acquired through hydrodynamic experiments and computational fluid dynamics cfd simulation as an alternative to experimental methods cfd method has become widely popular with the advent of high performance computing and the development of robust numerical methods darvishzadeh and sari 2015 bakhtiari and ghassemi 2020 it is also feasible to conduct the hydrodynamic analysis of risers with large engineering dimensions based on cfd therefore problems ranging from structural mechanics to hydrodynamics of risers will be addressed in this study the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents basic models of risers including physical model and mechanical model section 3 introduces hydrodynamic loads on a riser system based on cfd section 4 describes data driven models based on bp network section 5 presents an analysis method for solving dynamic analysis models section 6 shows the axial dynamic analysis of risers considering hydrodynamic loads section 7 provides the conclusions 2 basic models 2 1 physical model fig 1 shows deepwater drilling platform riser system in the hard hang off mode the drilling riser system is composed of lower marine riser package lmrp and a series of riser joints including buoyancy joints and slick joints the top part of the riser system is connected with drilling platform rigidly the bottom part of the riser system is connected with blowout preventer bop and subsea wellhead via lmrp in normal condition and disconnected under dangerous scenarios the lmrp and risers are hanged on platform after the disconnection the whole riser system vibrates axially due to the excitation of platform heave movement the surrounding seawater generates hydrodynamic loads on lmrp and risers during the axial vibration it is a complex problem combing structural dynamics of risers and hydrodynamics of seawater 2 2 mechanical model a mechanical model of risers in the hard hang off mode is established based on finite element method zhang and gao 2010 wang et al 2014 as shown in fig 2 fig 2 a presents analysis model of risers fig 2 b illustrates a short element model of risers the axial vibration equation of a short element can be written as 1 t d t t f f m g

a short element in the position x dx f is the structural damping force f is the axial hydrodynamic loads on a short element the hydrodynamic loads will be calculated in sections 3 and 4 the dynamic axial forces t can be shown as 2 t σ a e a u x t x where e is material modulus of risers σ is the section stress of risers a is the cross sectional area the dynamic axial forces t dt can be written as 3 t d t e a u x t x x e a u x t x d x the structural damping force f can be expressed as 4 f c u x t t d x where c is linear damping coefficient of risers then eqs 2 4 are substituted into eq 1 to get

established to calculate hydrodynamic loads including lmrp buoyancy joints slick joints buoyancy connectors and slick connectors shown in fig 1 dimension parameters of key components are listed in table 1 cfd models of key components are established in fluent based on dimension parameters listed in table 1 as shown in fig 3 the lengths of cfd models shown in fig 3 a 3 f are 5 5 m 0 5 m 0 5 m 0 5 m 1 868 m and 4 468 m respectively the calculation domain of cfd model of lmrp and inflow model of risers is bounded by four boundaries inlet boundary outlet boundary symmetrical boundary and wall the calculation domain of outflow model of slick joints outflow model of buoyancy joints outflow model of slick connectors and outflow model of buoyancy connectors is defined by three boundaries inlet boundary outlet boundary and wall the inlet boundary and outlet boundary represent velocity inlet and pressure outlet respectively the velocity inlet of the cfd model defines the relative velocity between key components of risers and their surrounding water the platform heave movement is regarded as a sinusoidal motion therefore the velocity of fluid can be written as 12 v fluid 2 π a t cos 2 π t t where a is the amplitude of heave motion and t is the period of heave motion the dimensionless distance in cfd models y should be determined to improve calculation accuracy y can be calculated by eq 13 van driest 1951 wang 2004 cebeci and cousteix 2005 malizia et al 2019 berni and fontanesi 2020 13 y δ y ρ u τ μ δ y ν τ w ρ where δy is the distance from the wall ν ν μ ρ is the kinematic viscosity τ w is the wall shear stress and u τ is the friction velocity which can be written as 14 u τ τ w ρ 1 2 then the thickness of the first grid can be expressed as zhu and qi 2019 15 y y ν u τ reynolds number is defined as follows wilson 2003 mao et al 2019 16 re v c d ν where v c is the mean velocity of flow and d is the characteristic length the original results of hydrodynamic loads in cfd simulation are dimensionless drag coefficients the dimensionless drag coefficients should be transformed to drag force to obtain hydrodynamic loads on each key component the transformation equation can be written as 17 f 1 2 ρ α v α 2 a α c d where c d is the dimensionless drag coefficient ρ α v α and a α are the density velocity and area in reference values respectively 3 3 model verification cfd models with different mesh numbers and time step sizes are analyzed to verify cfd results are mesh and time step independent the cfd model of lmrp shown in fig 3 a is firstly chosen for mesh and time step independent analysis cfd models with five different mesh numbers including 1 268 408 mesh 1 1 620 294 mesh 2 2 355 893 mesh 3 3 161 418 mesh 4 and 5 248 013 mesh 5 are established in mesh independent analysis cfd models with five different time step sizes including 0 01s time 1 0 03s time 2 0 05s time 3 0 07s time 4 and 0 09s time 5 are analyzed in time independent analysis fig 4 a and b show hydrodynamic loads of lmrp in mesh independent analysis and time step independent analysis respectively the results show that the maximum and amplitude of hydrodynamic loads of lmrp tend to be stable in mesh 3 mesh 4 and mesh 5 therefore mesh 3 whose total mesh cell number is 2 355 893 is chosen for hydrodynamic analysis considering its computational efficiency and accuracy mesh numbers of other five cfd models shown in fig 3 are also determined in the same way mesh numbers of inflow model of risers outflow model of slick joints outflow model of buoyancy joints outflow model of slick connectors and outflow model of buoyancy connectors are recommend to be 25 240 626 999 1 386 451 1 573 215 and 2 162 445 respectively time step independent analysis results shown in fig 4 b shows that the time step with 0 05s can meet the requirements for efficiency and stability besides stahl et al 2011 conducted similar research on vertical hydrodynamic loads of lmrp bop the heave motion velocity is a sinusoidal curve in which the amplitude and period are 0 762 m s and 5s respectively therefore a similar cfd model of lmrp bop is established to examine the correctness of method dealing with cfd models as shown in figs 5 and 6 the result shows that the change law of hydrodynamic loads on lmrp bop based on the established cfd model is nearly same with that of stahl et al 2011 while specific values of hydrodynamic loads are a little different the main reason is that stahl et al 2011 did not provide detailed structural parameters of lmrp bop there is some different in structural dimension between the established cfd model and that of stahl et al 2011 3 4 cfd results cfd simulations under different amplitudes and periods of heave motion are conducted based on established cfd models analysis results with varied amplitudes when the period is 10s and data with varied periods when the amplitude is 1 m are extracted to display hydrodynamic loads on key components 3 4 1 hydrodynamic loads on lmrp figs 7 a and 8 show hydrodynamic loads and flow field on lmrp with varied motion amplitudes and a fixed motion period of 10s respectively it can be seen that hydrodynamic loads velocity and pressure of fluid around lmrp increase correspondingly as motion amplitude increases besides variation curves of hydrodynamic loads are close to cosine curves while the heave motion of platform is a sine curve as shown in eq 12 there is a phase lag behind between hydrodynamic loads and platform motion the main reason is that hydrodynamic loads mainly include viscous force and inertial force which are related to velocity and acceleration of lmrp respectively the velocity and acceleration of lmrp are not in line with motion position which lead into a phase difference between hydrodynamic loads and platform motion figs 7 b and 9 show hydrodynamic loads and flow field on lmrp with varied motion frequencies and a fixed motion amplitude of 1 m respectively it is shown that the amplitude of hydrodynamic loads velocity and pressure of fluid around lmrp increase with motion frequency the main reason is that hydrodynamic loads on lmrp is mainly determined by differential pressure between different surfaces of lmrp the differential pressure increases with flow velocity which is determined by motion amplitude and motion frequency as shown in eq 12 a large motion amplitude and frequency increase flow velocity and pressure which leads to great hydrodynamic loads on lmrp 3 4 2 internal hydrodynamic loads on risers internal hydrodynamic loads on risers can be simulated based on the inflow model shown in fig 3 b internal hydrodynamic loads on risers is viscous force on internal riser wall in essence the internal viscous force increases with motion amplitude and frequency and it is opposite to motion direction as shown in fig 10 the large motion amplitude and frequency lead into great flow velocity and internal hydrodynamic loads 3 4 3 external hydrodynamic loads on risers external hydrodynamic loads on risers can be calculated based on outflow models shown in fig 3 c 3 f figs 11 and 12 show external hydrodynamic loads on slick joints and buoyancy joints respectively the external hydrodynamic loads on riser joints is viscous force on external riser wall and opposite to motion direction as well just like internal hydrodynamic loads on risers hydrodynamic loads on buoyancy joints is larger than that on slick joints since the external surface of buoyancy joints is large figs 13 and 14 show external hydrodynamic loads on slick connectors and buoyancy connectors respectively the external hydrodynamic loads on riser connectors are viscous force and inertial force just like hydrodynamic loads on lmrp hydrodynamic loads on slick connectors is larger than that on buoyancy connectors since the effective area of slick connectors in the motion direction is large the external hydrodynamic loads increases with motion amplitude and motion frequency as shown in figs 11 14 a large motion amplitude and frequency lead into great flow velocity and external hydrodynamic loads hydrodynamic loads on key components including lmrp slick joints buoyancy joints slick connectors and buoyancy connectors can be calculated based on cfd models hydrodynamic loads on a whole riser system is the sum of the product of each key component s hydrodynamic loads and its number however the database of hydrodynamic loads calculated based on cfd models with specified motion amplitudes and periods is discrete hydrodynamic loads under arbitrary motion amplitudes and periods is required in axial dynamic analysis of risers it is necessary to extend the discrete hydrodynamic database to a continuous hydrodynamic loads model 4 data driven models 4 1 data driven models data driven models have a powerful ability to recognize accurately the complex inherent nonlinear relationships between dependent and independent variables back propagation bp neural network is a well known training approach in the training of data driven models shi et al 2018 zendehboudi et al 2019 therefore bp neural network is introduced to train a continuous model of hydrodynamic loads from a discrete database fig 15 a shows a typical structure of bp network and fig 15 b illustrates a bp neuron model li et al 2018 a basic form of bp neural network is composed of three layers the input layer is used to get prediction from input data while the output layer is set for giving the final results the hidden layer whose number and structure can be modified depending on the needs of the modeling is to bridge between inputs and outputs bourdeau et al 2019 the output of hidden layer node i e neuron can be written as 18 z k f 1 i 0 n v k i x i k 1 2 q the output of output layer nodes can be expressed as 19 y j f 2 k 0 q w j k z k j 1 2 m where f 1 is the transfer function of hidden layer f 2 is the transfer function of output layer n q m is the node number in input layer hidden layer and output layer respectively besides v is the weight between input layer and hidden layer w is the weight between hidden layer and output layer for this study the inputs are the amplitude period and time of platform heave motion and the output is the hydrodynamic loads on a riser system therefore there are 3 neurons in the input layer and 1 neuron in the output layer as shown in fig 16 there exists a large order of magnitude difference between the input and output data which can lead to imprecise data driven models consequently it is necessary to normalize the input data before inputting the data to network the normalized data interval is 1 1 and the normalized method can be shown as liang et al 2008 li et al 2020 20 x 2 x x min x max x min 1 where x is the normalized data x is the input data x min and x max are the minimum and maximum values of the input data respectively other key parameters such as the number of hidden layers and the neuron number of each hidden layer should be analyzed further to determine the appropriate value then a bp neural network is established in matlab levenberg marquardt is selected as the training algorithm and the initialization parameters are set as follows the number of training is 5000 the learning rate and the convergence error are 0 1 and 0 0000001 respectively the database established in section 3 3 is divided into the training data and test data with a ratio of 4 1 the training data is used to train data driven models while the test data is set for the verification of trained data driven models 4 2 training results in a training process it is important to select the optimum numbers of hidden layers and neurons in each layer though more hidden layers and neuron units are beneficial to improve modeling results the risk of over fitting and low generalization is also increasing wong and kim 2018 nevertheless there is no proven method for selecting the numbers and sizes of hidden layers these numbers are flexible and dependent on the complexity of the problem therefore it is a trial and error process to determining the optimum structure of bp neural network du and swamy 2006 zendehboudi et al 2019 in this section the data driven model of hydrodynamic loads on lmrp is taken as an example the number of neurons corresponding to different hidden layers is set in a certain range considering the calculation efficiency and accuracy as listed in table 2 figs 17 18 show the prediction mean deviation and standard deviation of hydrodynamic loads in bp neural network with 1 and 2 hidden layers it turns out that the number of neurons has an obvious influence on the mean deviation and standard deviation of bp neural networks the mean deviation and standard deviation are large when the number of neurons is small and fluctuate as the number of neurons increases it is important that the average deviation and standard deviation vary with the number of neurons basically in the same rule therefore the optimal number of neurons can be determined according to average deviation or standard deviation it can be seen that the mean deviation and standard deviation are bigger than 0 1 when the number of hidden layer is 1 when the number of hidden layers is 2 there exists a lot of data points with mean deviation under 0 05 that can meet the accuracy requirement the optimum neurons numbers of 1st layer and 2nd layer are 21 and 20 respectively a random two cases are chosen for data driven model verification the heave motion amplitude and period in case i are 1 8 m and 10s respectively the heave amplitude motion and period in case ii are 2 1 m and 6 5s respectively hydrodynamic loads are calculated based on the established data driven model and compared with results based on cfd models as shown in fig 19 the results show that hydrodynamic loads based on the data driven model are nearly same as that based on cfd models besides it only needs less than 1 s to calculate the hydrodynamic loads based on the established data driven model the calculation efficiency of the trained data driven model is high therefore the data driven model based on bp neural network can be used for the calculation of hydrodynamic loads during the axial dynamic analysis of risers 5 analysis method mechanical model for axial dynamic analysis of risers has been established in section 2 2 finite element method is chosen for axial dynamic analysis of risers in the hard hang off mode then the structural dynamic motion equation of risers can be written as ahmad and datta 1992 ni et al 2019 21 m δ c δ k δ f where m is the mass matrix of risers c is the damping matrix k is the stiffness matrix δ is the acceleration vector δ is the velocity vector and δ is the displacement vector f is the load vector which consists of the axial hydrodynamic loads on a riser system newmark β and wilson θ are two commonly used methods for dynamic analysis fan et al 2017 the newmark β method is chosen to calculate the dynamic equation for its accuracy and efficiency the solution progress can be shown as follows wu et al 2014 liu et al 2018 the initial parameters of risers are calculated as follows 1 the stiffness matrix k mass matrix m and the damping matrix c are established 2 the initial values of acceleration vector δ velocity vector δ and displacement vector δ are defined 3 time step δt and parameters α β are selected integral constants are calculated as follows 22 a 0 1 β δ t 2 a 1 α β δ t a 2 1 β δ t a 3 1 2 β 1 a 4 α 2 β 1 a 5 δ t 2 α β 2 a 6 δ t 1 α a 7 α δ t where the equation of α and β can be shown as 23 α 0 5 β 0 25 0 5 α 2 4 the effective stiffness matrix k ˆ is formed as 24 k ˆ k a 0 m a 1 c the calculation process of each time step can be expressed as 1 the effective load vector f ˆ t δ t at the time t δt is shown as follows 25 f ˆ t δ t f t δ t m a 0 δ t a 2 δ t a 3 δ t c a 1 δ t a 4 δ t a 5 δ t 2 the displacement at the time t δt is calculated as follows 26 k ˆ δ t δ t f ˆ t δ t 3 the acceleration vector and velocity vector at the time t δt is solved as follows 27 δ t δ t a 0 δ t δ t δ t a 2 δ t a 3 δ t δ t δ t δ t a 6 δ t a 7 δ t δ t a finite element analysis program for the axial dynamic analysis of risers is developed in matlab as shown in fig 20 basic parameters of a riser system are firstly defined then the riser system is divided into a series of finite elements and structural analysis models including mass matrix stiffness matrix and damping matrix are generated data driven models for hydrodynamic loads trained in section 4 are imported for the calculation of load vector finally the axial dynamic analysis of risers can be conducted based on established structural analysis models and hydrodynamic analysis models besides structural models and hydrodynamic models needs to be updated timely based on analysis results of last step 6 dynamic analysis some engineering cases are selected for the axial dynamic analysis of risers a deepwater semi submersible platform in the south china sea is selected to analyze the axial dynamic characteristics of risers in the hard hang off mode the riser system is consisted of lmrp and a series of buoyancy joints and slick joints buoyancy joints are often installed in the upper part of the riser system while slick joints are often set in the lower part as shown in fig 1 the dimension parameters of key components are listed in table 1 the wet weight and dry weight of slick joints are 9715 kg and 11 167 kg respectively the wet weight and dry weight of buoyancy joints are 1731 kg and 19 724 kg respectively the wet weight and dry weight of lmrp are 104 331 kg and 120 000 kg respectively 6 1 axial dynamic analysis a riser system which is consisted of 49 buoyancy joints 5 slick joints and 1 lmrp is chosen for the axial dynamic analysis the total length of the riser system is 992 m the heave motion amplitude and period of platform are 1 m and 10s respectively the axial dynamic analysis program developed in matlab should be verified before axial dynamic analysis abaqus which is a powerful finite element software and has been widely used for riser analysis is chosen for analysis verification dai et al 2009 wang et al 2012 liu et al 2013 liao et al 2018 the axial dynamic analysis of risers ignoring hydrodynamic loads is compared between the developed program and abaqus since present riser analysis software including abaqus can t take into account axial hydrodynamic loads of a riser system fig 21 a and b show the dynamic section stress of risers in water depth 50 m and 700 m respectively section stress of risers can be calculated according to eq 2 based on riser dynamic analysis results in the hang off mode the section stress of risers is positively correlated with the weight of risers below the section thus the section stress in water depth 50 m is larger than that in water depth 700 m the comparison results show that the distributions of section stress simulated in the developed program and abaqus are nearly the same then the developed analysis program based on matlab can be used for improved axial dynamic analysis of risers with consideration of hydrodynamic loads the influence of the hydrodynamic loads of each key component on axial dynamics of risers are analyzed based on the developed program fig 22 a and b show the dynamic section stress of risers in water depth 50 m and 700 m respectively fig 23 a shows the amplitude of section stress in different water depths fig 23 b shows the exact occupancies of each hydrodynamic load in the whole amplitude of section stress the results show that the hydrodynamic loads h d loads on lmrp have great impact on the section stress of risers compared with analysis results without consideration of hydrodynamic loads the amplitude of section stress increases by 10 15 and 29 01 at water depth of 50 m and 700 m respectively under the influence of hydrodynamic loads on lmrp besides the amplitude of section stress at the depth of 50 m and 700 m increases by 10 31 and 31 24 respectively under the influence of combined hydrodynamic loads hydrodynamic loads shown in section 3 is mostly opposite to motion direction of risers the reactive hydrodynamic force can increase the section stress of risers the section stress variation of risers in the lower part is mainly affected by hydrodynamic loads while the section stress variation of risers in the upper part is determined by combined inertial and hydrodynamic loads therefore the effect of hydrodynamic loads is relatively smaller in the upper part of risers however the amplitude of section stress due to hydrodynamic loads which is the difference between section stress considering hydrodynamic loads and that ignoring hydrodynamic loads is basically not changed as shown in fig 23 besides there is a phase lag behind between the section stress considering hydrodynamic loads and that ignoring hydrodynamic loads as shown in fig 22 the reason is that the inertial force of risers is in line with motion acceleration while hydrodynamic loads on risers are not in line with motion velocity and acceleration as shown in section 3 in summary hydrodynamic loads increase the section stress of rises and delay the phase of section stress which improve the fracture risk and fatigue failure risk of risers the hydrodynamic loads of each key components can t be ignored in the axial dynamic analysis of risers 6 2 analysis of influencing factors in actual operation scenario risers in the hard hang off mode may experience platform motion with different amplitudes and frequencies besides the configuration of risers may also vary with different water depths therefore it is necessary to study the influence of hydrodynamic loads on axial dynamics of risers under different amplitudes and periods of platform motion and riser configurations the riser configuration of axial dynamic analysis with different amplitudes and frequencies is same as that in section 6 1 6 2 1 motion amplitude fig 24 shows the section stress of risers in depth of 50 m in varied motion amplitudes when the motion period is 10s it is shown that the amplitude of section stress increases gradually as the motion amplitude increases as the motion amplitude increase the velocity and acceleration of motion increase the increased motion velocity and acceleration lead into the increase of hydrodynamic loads and the amplitude of section stress as shown in figs 7 10 14 fig 25 illustrates the amplitude of section stress along risers due to hydrodynamic loads in varied motion amplitudes the results show that the amplitude of section stress due to hydrodynamic loads increases with motion amplitudes linearly while it doesn t change with water depth which is in line with results shown in fig 23 a 6 2 2 motion frequencies fig 26 shows the amplitude of section stress due to hydrodynamic loads in varied motion frequencies when the motion amplitude is 1 m it is shown that the stress amplitude due to hydrodynamic loads increases with motion frequency while it almost do not change as water depth increases the increased motion frequency can bring great hydrodynamic loads as shown in figs 7 10 14 therefore the stress amplitude due to hydrodynamic loads increases with motion frequency 6 2 3 riser configurations the axial dynamics of risers with different depth is analyzed to explore the influence of hydrodynamic loads on risers with different riser configurations riser configurations with different water depths are listed in table 3 fig 27 shows the amplitude of section stress in varied configuration lengths with a fixed motion amplitude of 1 m and a fixed motion period of 10s the selected section is in the depth of 50 m it can be seen that the stress amplitude increases with the total length of riser configurations besides the stress amplitude due to hydrodynamic loads increases as the total length of riser configurations increases the main reason is that the accumulative hydrodynamic loads on risers increase with the total length of riser configurations therefore the stress amplitude due to hydrodynamic loads increases as well 7 conclusions in this paper a challenge problem has been addressed the influence of hydrodynamic loads on axial dynamics of risers in the hard hang off mode finite element method is introduced to analyze the structural response of risers data driven models are trained for the calculation of hydrodynamic loads through bp neural network a comprehensive analysis

in the existing literature cfd is introduced to conduct hydrodynamic analysis of risers cfd models of key components including lmrp buoyancy joints slick joints buoyancy connectors and slick connectors are established for the calculation of hydrodynamic loads in the hang off mode bp neural network is then introduced to train a continuous data driven model of hydrodynamic loads based on a discrete database test results show that the trained data driven model can predict hydrodynamic loads accurately and efficiently a dynamic analysis model for drilling risers in the hard hang off mode is established the dynamic model is solved by finite element method in combination with newmark β method a comprehensive analysis algorithm is proposed for the axial dynamic analysis of risers by combining finite element method and data driven models an improved axial dynamic analysis program for risers is also developed in matlab the developed program is used for the axial dynamic analysis of risers in the hard hang off mode it turns out that the hydrodynamic loads of key components have an obvious influence on axial dynamics of risers especially lmrp the hydrodynamic loads of each key components can t be ignored in the axial dynamic analysis of risers besides the influence of hydrodynamic loads on axial dynamics of risers increases with motion amplitude motion frequency and
