7805,study region the study region is the kamadhiya catchment 1150 km2 located in the saurashtra region of the western state of gujarat india the region has seen intensive development of check dams cds for groundwater recharge with an estimated 27 000 cds constructed up until 2018 study focus the impact of cds on groundwater storage food production and resilience are assessed for kamadhiya catchment by estimating and comparing changes across periods of low and high cd development in potential recharge from cds rainfall trends and irrigation demand the analysis is carried out for the period from 1983 to 2015 new hydrological insights for the region groundwater storage gains observed following cd development can partly be attributed to an increase in high rainfall years after several drought years groundwater demand for irrigation has increased substantially outweighing increase in groundwater recharge from cds this deficit in supply relative to demand is greatest in dry years and when considered together with the low inter annual carry over storage of the region s hardrock aquifers means that cds capacity to enhance groundwater storage and mitigate the negative impacts of drought remains limited findings suggest that a standalone focus on mar unless complemented by greater emphasis on management of water demand and groundwater resources more broadly may not be sufficient to achieve the long term goals of sustainable groundwater and concurrently expanding agricultural crop production keywords groundwater managed aquifer recharge check dams irrigation drought data availability all data generated or analysed during this study are included or referenced in this published article and its supplementary information files 1 introduction reliable and adequate availability of freshwater for irrigation is critical for global food security with climate change and increasing climate variability leading to more extremes in water availability expressed as droughts and floods united nations 2019 ipcc in press irrigation is more important than ever smit and skinner 2002 ignaciuk and mason d croz 2014 groundwater being more reliable and more widely available than surface water and largely protected from evaporation losses plays a critical role in providing irrigation water especially in semi arid areas wwap united nations world water assessment programme un water 2022 and supplies 38 of irrigated areas globally siebert et al 2010 however in many parts of the world overdependence on groundwater irrigation has led to unsustainable use and depletion of groundwater resources d√∂ll et al 2012 bierkens and wada 2019 to mitigate groundwater depletion and enhance groundwater security for irrigation one strategy that is increasingly applied is managed aquifer recharge mar zhang et al 2020 alam and pavelic 2020 zheng et al 2021 mar involves strategically recharging aquifers with excess surface water through infrastructure such as check dams or recharge wells dillon et al 2019 alam and pavelic 2020 the benefits of mar in these cases include enhanced groundwater storage in dry seasons and drought periods supporting continuous irrigation and or mitigating depletion alam et al 2020 dillon et al 2019 prathapar et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 mar is contingent on the availability of harvestable source water for augmenting recharge and storage like flood waters or treated wastewater which may be seasonally or perennially available respectively india as the largest user of groundwater globally is promoting mar to mitigate negative impacts of extensive groundwater use through multiple central cgwb 2020 and state government programs and policies verma and shah 2019 cgwb 2020 one notable example is gujarat where more than 90 000 mar structures in the form of check dams have been constructed since the year 2000 with the financial support subsidies of government and non government organizations under the government participatory scheme sardar patel sahbhagi jal sanchay yojana sardar patel participatory water conservation program shah et al 2009 nwrws 2018 verma and shah 2019 patel et al 2020 an extended drought in 1999 2002 during which the average rainfall was about 35 less than normal pai et al 2014 greatly accelerated the development of check dams facilitated by government support fig 1c patel 2007 patel et al 2020 increased mar implementation as a result has been widely reported as having a positive impact on groundwater storage in the region shah et al 2009 jain 2012 patel et al 2020 while a number of studies have analyzed the increasing groundwater storage in gujarat shah et al 2009 jain 2012 bhanja et al 2017 kumar and perry 2018 patel et al 2020 they disagree on the underlying explanation improved groundwater storage has been attributed to a number of factors increased rainfall shah et al 2009 kumar and perry 2018 reduced groundwater abstraction brought about by rationing schemes enabled by separating agriculture and non agriculture electricity feeders shah et al 2009 bhanja et al 2017 inter basin transfer of water kumar and perry 2018 and enhanced recharge from mar mostly through check dams shah et al 2009 jain 2012 patel et al 2020 the diverging explanations among the studies demonstrate the lack of clarity in attributing the increase in groundwater storage including the role of mar this is because any change in groundwater storage is a result of numerous factors associated with the short and long term dynamics of supply e g rainfall amount and intensity performance of mar and demand factors e g changing cropping patterns irrigated areas irrigation practices previous studies have not systematically accounted for these complexities the main limitations associated with the previous studies include 1 focusing on recharge enhancement while not accounting for increased groundwater irrigation demand for agriculture bhanja et al 2017 kumar and perry 2018 patel et al 2020 2 neglecting the long term change in rainfall and inter annual variability in rainfall shah et al 2009 bhanja et al 2017 3 focusing on small scale assessments of mar structures or micro catchments patel et al 2002 sharda et al 2006 leading to high uncertainty when attempting to extrapolate results to large scale and 4 focusing on state level impacts shah et al 2009 bhanja et al 2017 and thus discounting spatial variability and heterogeneity in biophysical factors hydrogeology soil water demand kumar and perry 2018 and the interconnectedness of mar structures within a hydrologic unit mozzi et al 2021 with the progressive priority and increased investment being made in mar in gujarat and other states in india verma and shah 2019 there is clear and urgent need to assess the effectiveness of mar at an appropriate intermediary scale and for relevant contexts this requires a long term integrated analysis accounting for the dynamics of both supply and demand on a catchment scale which this study aims to carry out in this study we analyze the dynamics of groundwater storage in conjunction with changes in rainfall irrigation demand and increase in supply through mar in gujarat with this we aim to establish the contribution of mar to groundwater storage and agricultural production relative to other key factors 2 study area the analysis is carried out for kamadhiya catchment 1150 km2 located in the saurashtra region 6600 km2 of the western state of gujarat india fig 1 kamadhiya catchment is an upstream catchment of the bhadar basin one of the larger river basins in the region kamadhiya catchment drains to bhadar dam 240 million cubic meters mcm fig 1 the largest dam supplying both irrigation and drinking water in the bhadar basin nwrws 2010 while the catchment scale considered here provides a closed hydrologic unit for assessment and accounts for the limitation of the small spatial scales of earlier studies focusing on specific mar structures or micro watersheds it still falls short of a basin scale assessment as it represents only 17 of the entire basin area therefore attempts to extrapolate these findings to the basin scale would require further investigation saurashtra region has been the focus of development of mar in india mostly in the form of check dams hereafter referred to as cd shah et al 2009 patel et al 2020 an estimated 27 000 cds were constructed across saurashtra before 2018 nwrws 2018 within bhadar basin the number of cds increased from 484 24 0 mcm storage in 1999 to 4385 103 3 mcm storage by the end of 2010 fig 1c kamboj et al 2011 with more than 90 of cds constructed after 2000 primarily during 2001 2002 in response to the extended 2000 2002 drought patel 2007 patel et al 2020 in the kamadhiya catchment the total number of cds in 2006 was estimated to be 576 with total storage capacity of 12 7 mcm patel 2007 with lack of time series data for kamadhiya catchment we assume the same development curve as in bhadar basin with 90 of cds at the end of 2006 constructed post 2000 during 2001 2002 also we further assume that the rate of development of new cds post 2006 will be approximately matched by the rate of attrition of existing cds as they lose functionality from lack of maintenance e g siltation collapse kumar and perry 2018 mozzi et al 2021 thus based on the density of cds in the catchment we term the period until 2002 as pre cd during which cd density was relatively low 10 of cds in 2006 58 cds 1 cd per 20 km2 and the period after 2002 as post cd during which cd density had increased ten fold 100 of cds in 2006 576 cds 10 cds per 20 km2 2 1 climate the climate of the kamadhiya catchment is semi arid with an average annual rainfall of 638 mm yr 1 1983 2015 pai et al 2014 more than 90 of the rainfall is concentrated in the four monsoon months from june to september rainfall is also associated with high inter annual variability with a coefficient of variation of 46 estimated for the period 1983 2015 from the india meteorological department imd gridded rainfall dataset pai et al 2014 average annual mean temperature is 27·µíc with minimum temperature observed in january with a mean of 20 6·µíc and the maximum temperature observed in may with a mean of 30 7·µíc srivastava et al 2009 2 2 agriculture and irrigation agriculture and irrigation data were available only on an administrative level thus we report and use data from rajkot district and absolute values for the catchment are derived using the proportion of catchment area which lies within the district 86 the kharif monsoon is the main cropping season where groundnut and cotton are the main crops occupying 48 and 41 of total sown area respectively doa gujarat 2021 other minor crops in the kharif season include bajra pearl millet and sesame rabi post monsoon season has limited cropping area which is reflected by low annual cropping intensity of 113 does gujarat 2018 wheat is the main rabi crop doa gujarat 2021 of the total net cropped and gross cropped area 39 and 42 is equipped for irrigation respectively does gujarat 2018 during the kharif season cotton requires supplemental irrigation whereas groundnut is rainfed rabi crops rely entirely on irrigation doa gujarat 2021 groundwater is the main source of irrigation in the district accounting for 82 of the irrigated area does gujarat 2018 the main source of surface water in the district is from aji and bhadar dams ggrc 2015 irrigation and domestic water supply represent about 95 and 5 of the overall water demand respectively ggrc 2015 2 3 hydrogeology the groundwater in the saurashtra region is found at shallow depths under unconfined conditions in aquifers characterized by parent basalt rock of the deccan trap formation with little primary porosity mohapatra 2013 patel 2007 in the region deccan trap basalt has weathered upper parts to a depth of 20 30 m forming good aquifers which are tapped for irrigation mostly by large diameter open dugwells fig 2a mohapatra 2013 mowr rd and gr 2017a the groundwater well yields are seasonally variable and highest after monsoonal recharge pavelic et al 2012 the weathered aquifer is underlain by consolidated basalt rocks generally forms a poor aquifer with groundwater present in fractured and vesicular zones secondary porosity in successive basalt flows and tapped by deeper borewells of depth 150 m mohapatra 2013 patel et al 2020 mowr rd and gr 2017a 3 methods and data the analysis is carried out for the period from 1983 to 2015 33 years this period is divided into the pre cd 1983 2002 and post cd 2003 2015 period where the post cd period indicates the period after the 2000 2002 extended drought and after 90 of the cds were constructed we assess the impact of cds by estimating and comparing changes from the pre cd to the post cd period Œ¥ post cd pre cd specifically in groundwater recharge Œ¥gwr and groundwater abstraction Œ¥gwa since both groundwater recharge and groundwater abstraction for irrigation depend on rainfall which is associated with high inter annual variability we only compare pre cd and post cd periods in similar rainfall years classified using standard precipitation index spi wmo and gwp 2016 we define a year in terms of the hydrological year june to may and classify years as either dry normal or wet years reported in the subsequent analysis refer to the hydrological year e g the year 2001 covers nune 2001 to may 2002 we assume that positive difference in groundwater recharge Œ¥gwr between pre cd and post cd periods for years under the same spi classification will primarily come from increase in groundwater recharge from new cds i e Œ¥gwr Œ¥gwrcd balance of Œ¥gwrcd section 3 1 and Œ¥gwa section 3 2 between the pre cd and post cd periods is used to estimate the change in groundwater storage Œ¥gwse between the two periods eq 1 1 Œ¥ gw s e spi Œ¥ gw r cd spi Œ¥ gw a spi Œ¥gwse where e stands for estimated will be positive if the increase in groundwater abstraction Œ¥gwa is less than the increase in recharge Œ¥gwrcd and vice versa estimated Œ¥gwse is compared with observed groundwater storage change Œ¥gwso section 3 3 subscript spi denotes classified years of dry spi 0 49 normal 0 49 spi 0 49 and wet years spi 0 49 3 1 change in groundwater abstraction Œ¥gwa to estimate change in groundwater abstraction from pre cd to post cd we focus our analysis on two main irrigated crops of the region cotton and wheat cotton is supplementarily irrigated during the kharif season and wheat is fully irrigated during the rabi season we assume the irrigation water volume derived from groundwater is proportional to the fraction of groundwater irrigated area in the area groundwater irrigated area data was taken from annual agricultural statistics as reported by the government does gujarat 2018 icrisat 2021 and was assumed to be the same for both crops in the absence of crop specific information also we disregard groundwater abstraction for non irrigation purposes which is less than 5 in the district cgwb 2019 fig 3 gives the conceptual flow diagram showing the approach taken to arrive at groundwater abstraction gwa to estimate groundwater abstraction for hydrological year i we first estimate the annual net irrigation water applied irrigation for crops in the case of cotton applied irrigation volume mm is estimated as the difference between actual evapotranspiration aet of rainfed aetrainfed and irrigated aetirrigated cotton eq 2a for wheat grown with 100 cultivated area under irrigation we assume all crop water demand is met through irrigation and irrigation volume mm is equal to aetirrigated eq 2b we neglect any post monsoon rainfall during the wheat growing season as for the period 1983 2015 this averaged only 5 mm aetrainfed and aetirrigated is calculated using fao crop yield response to water eqs 3a and 3b steduto et al 2012 2a irrigation c i ae t irrigated c i ae t rainfed c i for cotton 2b

stage s crop coefficient approach allen et al 1998 and eto is reference evaporation estimated using hargreaves method hargreaves and samani 1985 the hargreaves method was chosen due to its simplicity reliability and minimal data requirements as it requires only monthly average minimum and maximum temperature along with solar radiation data kc s is the crop coefficient for stage s yieldrainfed c and yieldirrigated c is the observed rainfed and irrigated crop yield and yieldpotential c is the potential achievable yield yieldpotential c is estimated as the five year moving average of observed irrigated yield observed annual yield data used to estimate rainfed yieldrainfed c and irrigatedyieldirrigated c yield pertains to rajkot district and were taken from annually reported government statistics doa 2021 icrisat 2021 ky c is the crop yield response factor representing the effect of a reduction in water use relative to potential demand on yield losses steduto et al 2012 values of ky for cotton 0 85 and wheat 1 15 were taken from the literature and are based on extensive analysis of data on crop yield water relationships and deficit irrigation doorenbos and kassam 1979 steduto et al 2012 data on overall yield average of rainfed and irrigated yield for cotton was available for the whole time 1983 2015 whereas segregated data on rainfed and irrigated yield were only available starting 1995 thus for the time period of 1983 1994 segregated rainfed and irrigated cotton yield was derived based on the developed relationship between the ratio of overall yield to irrigated yield and irrigated area to the overall area r2 of 0 79 see figure a1 in the 1995 2015 period derived irrigation volume is multiplied with annual groundwater irrigated area of a crop eq 5 to get a volumetric estimate million cubic meter mcm of groundwater abstraction gwac annual groundwater irrigated area was taken from annually reported government statistics does gujarat 2018 icrisat 2021 crop potential evapotranspiration demand etc is multiplied by annual crop area taken from annually reported government statistics does gujarat 2018 icrisat 2021 to get a volumetric estimate mcm of total crop water requirement cwr eq 6 5 gw a c i irrigation c i annual groundwater irrigated area 6 cwr c i e t c i annual crop area values for duration and crop coefficient for each crop stage were taken for indian conditions kar et al 2014 allen et al 1998 table a1 the sowing dates for cotton and wheat were taken as 15th june and 15th november respectively doa gujarat 2020 thereafter change in groundwater abstraction Œ¥gwac between the pre and post cd periods is estimated for years in the same spi class by determining the mean gwac of each class for pre cd and post cd and taking the difference eq 7 7 gwa c spi 1 n postcd spi i 1 n postcd spi gw a c i 1 n precd spi i 1 n precd spi gw a c i where spi denotes the spi class dry normal and wet and npre cd spi and npostcd spi is the number of years in each spi class in pre cd and post cd periods respectively 3 1 1 potential groundwater demand met we also estimate how much of crop annual potential groundwater demand gwapot could be met through groundwater abstraction gwac met gwa gw a pot 100 for cotton gwapot is estimated as the difference between crop potential evapotranspiration demand etc and aetrainfed multiplied with cotton groundwater irrigated area eq 8 as wheat is completely irrigated wheat gwapot estimated is equal to the crop potential evapotranspiration demand etc multiplied with wheat groundwater irrigated area eq 9 8 gw a pot c e t c ae t ra inf e d c groundwater irrigated area for cotton 9 gw a pot c e t c groundwater irrigated area for wheat thereafter the change in potential groundwater demand Œ¥gwapot is estimated for each spi class by obtaining the mean of gwapot of each spi category for pre cd and post cd period and taking the difference eq 10 10 gw a pot c spi 1 n postcd sp i i 1 n postcd spi gw a pot c i 1 n precd spi i 1 n precd spi gw a pot c i where spi denotes the spi classification dry normal and wet and nprecd spi and npostcd spi is the number of years under each spi classification in pre cd and post cd respectively 3 2 change in recharge from check dams Œ¥gwrcd groundwater recharge from cds gwrcd is simulated using an analytical dynamic tool mozzi et al 2021 the tool integrates a daily water balance of individual cds with a set of analytical infiltration equations bouwer 1969 2002 giving daily dynamics of storage infiltration and evaporation the tool was previously applied to four structures in the bhadar basin and validated at sites in rajasthan where more extensive data were available mozzi et al 2021 application of the tool has shown good performance with validation results giving an average r2 of 0 93 between the simulated and measured water levels in individual cds the tool requires input data on cd geometrical parameters catchment area hydrogeology characteristics daily inflow to cd and potential evaporation representative values of cds in kamadhiya catchment were applied table a2 to estimate gwrcd the tool is used to simulate recharge from a representative cd gwrcd r with a storage capacity vcd r of 21 486 m3 table a2 a simulation is carried out for the pre cd period 1983 2002 where runoff is assumed to be representing the baseline conditions with low cd development annual recharge values are then averaged for each spi class thereafter to get relative cd recharge for pre cd and post cd periods at the catchment scale gwrcd for each spi classified year the ratio of representative cd recharge gwrcd r to its storage capacity vcd r is multiplied with catchment cumulative cd storage capacity vcd pre 1 3 mcm and vcd post 11 4 mcm eqs 11a and 11b 11a gw r cd spi pre gw r cd r spi v cd r v cd pre 11b gw r cd spi post gw r cd r spi v cd r v cd post thereafter change in groundwater recharge Œ¥gwrcd is estimated for each spi class from the mean gwrcd of each spi category for pre cd and post cd and taking the difference eq 12 12 Œ¥ gwr cd spi 1 n postcd spi i 1 n postcd spi gw r cd post i 1 n precd spi i 1 n precd spi gw r cd pre i where spi denotes the spi classification dry normal and wet and n precd spi and n postcd spi is the number of years under each spi classification in pre cd and post cd periods respectively all gwr figures are calculated on daily time scales and thereafter aggregated to annual scale we assume that all cds are functioning behave similarly and do not interact 3 3 observed change in groundwater storage Œ¥gwso the observed change in groundwater storage is the annual net balance of groundwater recharge and abstraction in the catchment this is estimated using the water table fluctuation method mowr rd gr 2017b pavelic et al 2012 the water table fluctuation method has been used extensively and found suitable for climatic and hydrogeological conditions of unconfined weathered hardrock aquifers pavelic et al 2012 dewandel et al 2010 machiwal et al 2017 the water table fluctuation method derives groundwater storage change gwso from the rise in monsoonal groundwater levels gwlr estimated as the difference between pre gwlprm and post monsoon gwlpm groundwater levels eqs 14 15 14 gws o i gwl r i s y catchment area 15 gwl r i gwl pm i gwl prm i 1 where gwl pm i is the post monsoon of gwl of hydrological year i taken in november gwl prm i 1 is the pre monsoon gwl of previous hydrological year i taken in may hence pre monsoon gwl of previous hydrological year is the groundwater level storage at the start of year i sy is the specific yield which is taken as 0 02 as the recommended value for the region mowr rd gr 2017b patel et al 2020 annual catchment averaged pre gwlprm and post monsoon gwlpm groundwater levels are derived using observed data from monitored wells for the time period 1983 2015 from the central groundwater board cgwb 2015 a total of 15 observation wells located within the catchment and up to a 10 km distance beyond the catchment boundary were used for the analysis the data were filtered for outliers using interquartile range method with data outside an interquartile range of 1 5 removed only monitoring wells with observation records containing more than 2 3 of the years of pre and post gwl data points were used gwlpm and gwlprm for each year were then derived from spatially interpolating observation wells using inverse distance weighing li and heap 2008 thereafter gwlr is calculated according to eq 15 finally the change in groundwater storage Œ¥gwro is estimated for each spi classified category by getting mean of gwso of each spi category for pre cd and post cd and taking the difference eq 16 16 Œ¥ gw s o spi 1 n postcd spi i 1 n postcd spi gw s o i 1 n precd i i 1 n precd i gw s o i where spi denotes the spi classification dry normal and wet and n precd spi and n postcd spi is the number of years under each spi classification in pre cd and post cd respectively we compared observed Œ¥gwso eq 16 with estimated Œ¥gwse eq 1 change in groundwater storage to validate our results storage change derived from the water table fluctuation method incorporates all sources and sinks including diffuse rainfall recharge recharge from cds subsurface irrigation returns flows groundwater evaporation and any net lateral groundwater flow pavelic et al 2012 mowr rd gr 2017b it is assumed that net groundwater inflow outflow is negligible as hardrock areas have limited lateral subsurface hydraulic connectivity at the regional scale bouma et al 2011 dewandel et al 2010 pavelic et al 2012 table 1 summarizes the datasets used in the analysis 4 results 4 1 rainfall fig 4 shows the annual rainfall time series with individual years categorized as either wet normal or dry based on spi for the overall period average rainfall is 638 6 mm yr 1 average post cd rainfall 809 8 mm yr 1 is 27 higher than the overall average whilst the pre cd rainfall 511 9 mm yr 1 is 25 lower than the average also there is a high inter annual variability characterized by a high coefficient of variation of 45 across the whole time series wet rainfall years are concentrated in the post cd 8 in post cd vs 3 in pre cd whereas dry years are disproportionately occurring in the pre cd period 8 in pre cd vs 1 in post cd table 2 4 2 groundwater abstraction gwa 4 2 1 cotton area under cotton cultivation has steeply risen especially during the post cd fig 4b the average post cd cotton area 30 670 ha is 124 higher than the pre cd period 13 670 ha table 2 at the same time average irrigated cotton area has increased in post cd to an average of 85 4 of cropped area compared to 64 2 in pre cd fig 4b and table 2 results show that this increase in area and irrigation from pre to post cd is consistent for all spi classified years table 2 increase in cotton area fig 4b translates to more than two fold increase in crop water requirement cwr in post cd for both overall and spi classified years table 2 with 85 of crop area irrigated with groundwater this translates into an increase in potential groundwater demand gwapot of 96 4 mcm increase of 188 62 9 mcm increase of 168 and 56 6 mcm increase of 203 in dry normal and wet years respectively table 2 in normal and wet years with practically all gwapot being met met between 86 2 and 100 table 2 gwa increases by 40 1 mcm increase of 125 and 54 6 mcm increase of 200 respectively however for dry years most of gwapot remains unmet in post cd met 30 reflecting that irrigation in dry years is limited by available groundwater storage thus gwa increases by only 9 8 mcm in dry years between the two periods table 2 4 2 2 wheat the wheat area in post cd period 7770 ha is 112 higher than in the pre cd 3660 ha table 2 in contrast to cotton there is no or limited change in wheat area when compared across similar spi classified years table 2 with area increasing only in wet years 21 however across spi years wheat shows a large increase from dry 700 1000 ha to wet 8500 10 300 ha years this shows that large overall increase 118 in wheat area in post cd is largely due to higher number of wet years table 2 wheat is completely irrigated 99 area under irrigation in both periods for all years fig 4c and table 2 wheat cwr and gwa similar to wheat area show an increase of 115 for overall period in post cd relative to pre cd table 2 however across spi classified years there is no or limited change in cwr and gwa only wet years show moderate increase in gwa by 7 8 mcm 26 increase wheat yield does not show decrease across spi years reflecting that 100 of demand is met gwapot gwa summing up cotton and wheat irrigation overall gwapot and gwa post cd increases by 67 5 mcm 124 and 63 4 mcm 162 as compared to pre cd 4 3 change in recharge from check dams Œ¥gwrcd the average recharge from cds gwrcd increases from 2 4 mcm in pre cd to 34 0 mcm in post cd table 3 overall this means a 14 fold increase in recharge from cds Œ¥gwrcd also gwrcd increases from dry to wet years with Œ¥gwrcd post cd pre cd increasing from dry 10 7 mcm to normal 21 2 mcm to wet years 37 2 mcm table 3 monthly recharge estimates table a3 show that on average highest recharge takes place in july and august when sufficient runoff is available and groundwater tables are deeper table 3 shows that gwrcd is constrained by inflow capture of the cds calculated as the difference between flow entering and leaving a check dam which decreases from dry to wet years on average 67 of inflow is captured by cd with highest capture in dry years 94 followed by normal years 85 and wet years 55 besides rainfall recharge and inflow capture are sensitive to cd geometry catchment area mozzi et al 2021 and results reflect the first order average potential recharge from existing cd storage in the catchment table a3 4 4 observed change in groundwater storage Œ¥gwso gwls show no statistically significant long term declining or rising trend over the whole study period p 0 05 but high inter annual variability fig 5 averaged over pre cd and post cd post monsoon groundwater level gwlpm below ground level bgl and average annual groundwater storage increase gwso are higher gwls closer to ground level during the post cd period gwlpm 6 8 m bgl gwlprm 11 4 m bgl and gwso 107 0 mcm than in the pre cd period gwlpm 8 7 m bgl gwlprm 11 8 m bgl and gwso 70 4 mcm table 3 however when compared across similar spi classified years to account for the influence of rainfall gwls and gwso are lower in post cd as compared to pre cd table 3 for example gwso in post cd decreases by 2 5 mcm pre cd 17 7 mcm and post cd 15 2 mcm 19 4 mcm pre cd 83 9 mcm and post cd 64 5 mcm and 31 1 mcm pre cd 170 8 mcm and post cd 139 7 mcm for dry normal and wet years respectively this shows that overall higher gwls and gwso in post cd is the result of disproportionally higher number of wet years in post cd period table 3 and not due to the increased number of mar interventions dynamics of gwls show that gwlpm are sensitive to the magnitude of monsoon seasonal rainfall with average gwlpm highest during wet years 5 m bgl and much deeper in dry years 11 m bgl on the other hand pre monsoon groundwater levels gwlprm are relatively less sensitive to monsoonal rainfall with average gwlprm fluctuating from 9 4 10 5 m bgl in wet years to 12 6 13 5 m bgl in dry years fig 5 and table 3 this reflects the properties of low storage aquifer systems where storage is filled during monsoon months to an extent depending on rainfall and storage capacity of the aquifer and irrigation leads to desaturation at the end of hydrological year pavelic et al 2012 the lower gwlprm and their low sensitivity to annual rainfall shows that there is limited inter annual groundwater storage carry over from the dry season to the wet season in the catchment 5 discussion 5 1 dynamics of groundwater balance changes table 4 compares changes in observed Œ¥gwso and estimated Œ¥gwse groundwater storage increase in recharge Œ¥gwrcd changes in potential groundwater demand Œ¥gwapot and actual groundwater abstraction Œ¥gwa for the kamadhiya catchment between pre and post cd periods the latter two are aggregated sums of cotton and wheat table 2 results show that both Œ¥gwapot and supply via increased recharge Œ¥gwrcd has increased in post cd but the increase in gwapot has outpaced the increase in gwrcd additionally the increase is not uniform across the spi classified years Œ¥gwrcd is highest in the wet years whereas Œ¥gwapot is highest in the dry years and vice versa thus the deficit demand supply is highest for dry years followed by normal and wet years with Œ¥gwrcd representing only 11 of the increased groundwater demand Œ¥gwapot for dry years with limited natural recharge in dry years combined with low groundwater storage at the start of the year i e gwlprm of previous year fig 5 table 3 and low additional cd recharge Œ¥gwrcd table 4 only 30 of cotton gwapot is met in the post cd period whereas wheat cultivated area is significantly reduced 10 of average wheat area in post cd table 2 limited abstraction and recharge also mean that there is very limited change in estimated groundwater storage Œ¥gwse 2 5 mcm from pre cd to post cd table 4 this matches with limited change observed in groundwater storage Œ¥gwso 2 4 mcm this shows that groundwater storage remains low in dry years for both periods table 3 and is unable to meet irrigation demands the high unmet demand reflects the limited efficacy of cds in semi arid regions with low storage aquifers for mitigating impact of droughts which supports the findings of earlier studies boisson et al 2015 enfors and gordon 2008 kumar et al 2008 kumar and perry 2018 ogilvie et al 2016 2019 for example ogilvie et al 2016 2019 in assessing rainwater storage structures in tunisia showed that their low storage capacity limits their ability to recharge groundwater sufficiently thus having a limited impact on farmers drought coping capacity a similar conclusion was reached by enfors and gordon 2008 assessing mar in tanzania locally termed ndiva system thus the hypothesis that sufficient runoff is available and remains available for planning recharge interventions may not hold in semi arid areas especially in dry years boisson et al 2014 2015 for normal and wet years the deficit is less pronounced relative to dry years table 4 however Œ¥gwrcd can only meet 34 and 58 of increased groundwater demand Œ¥gwapot in normal and wet years respectively table 4 in normal and wet years in contrast to dry years groundwater storage is recharged by rainfall fig 5 gwlr in table 3 and meets the irrigation demand in excess of increased recharge from cds Œ¥gwrcd this is reflected in the results indicating that most of the potential groundwater demand is met in normal and wet years for both major crops table 2 thus higher groundwater abstraction translates to decrease in Œ¥gwse in post period table 4 for both normal 17 7 mcm and wet years 25 2 mcm this matches well with Œ¥gwso of 19 3 mcm and 31 1 mcm in normal and wet years respectively this implies that increase in recharge by cds can only partly support increased kharif irrigation and positive impact of gwrcd on groundwater storage is overshadowed by the increase in demand the findings from this study related to no long term increase in groundwater storage are contrary to findings of other studies patel et al 2020 shah et al 2009 bhanja et al 2017 and we find that higher overall average storage in the post cd period is primarily due to an increased number of wet years the divergence between the findings could be attributed to differences in the temporal period considered and or the spatial scale of analysis for example shah et al 2009 only compared two distinct years 2000 and 2008 but did not fully account for the variability of rainfall similarly both asoka et al 2017 and bhanja et al 2017 have a different temporal period for analysis with data starting from 1996 thus having very limited data for the pre cd period which may accentuate low groundwater levels during the 2000 2002 drought relative to post cd period their analysis was also focused at the national scale thus discerning regional differences is more difficult while patel et al 2020 do account for longer time series starting from 1975 they only compare wet year periods during the pre cd 1975 1984 and post cd 2004 2009 and the analysis focuses on the larger spatial region whole of saurashtra thus again making a direct comparison difficult it is important to note that none of the above studies accounted for changes in water demand without which dynamics of groundwater storage cannot be reliably derived 5 2 implication of mar on kharif and rabi season cropping overall our findings of increased cropping and irrigation water demand of mainly kharif cotton and additional recharge from cds partly support the hypothesis of shah et al 2009 that kharif production has increased with gwrcd making good rainfall years i e normal and wet years better however even in normal and wet years increased recharge can only partially meet increased demand table 4 translating to lower groundwater storage in post cd when compared with pre cd across similar spi years tables 3 and 4 this further builds on the argument that cds can only provide supplemental irrigation during good normal or wet rainfall years and cannot be expected to sustain intensive irrigation in dry years as also evidenced in other regions e g ogilvie et al 2016 2019 our results do not show any consistent and significant increase in wheat area which was also hypothesized by shah et al 2009 except in wet years table 2 in this respect our findings also contrast with findings by garg et al 2020 carried out in bundelkhand region of uttar pradesh state of india their results show that the impact of recharge interventions in terms of increasing area and production was more tangible during the rabi season the low impact on rabi area and production in our study could be attributed to extensive irrigated cotton area in the study catchment table 2 which utilizes much of recharge during the monsoon season thus leaving limited storage for rabi cultivation dependent on irrigation this is supported by the observation that post monsoon gwls gwlpm have been similar or slightly lower in post cd relative to pre cd fig 4 and table 3 with no increases in groundwater storage at the end of the monsoon indicated by gwlpm there is limited increase in wheat area table 2 as it is highly dependent on gwlpm signified by good correlation r2 of 0 64 of wheat area and gwlpm fig 6a this also suggests that farmers across the catchment consistently plan their wheat crop areas cognizant of the irrigation demand that the post monsoon storage can support the correlation of pre monsoon levels with cotton area is much less pronounced r2 of 0 01 fig 6b this could be attributed to kharif cropping dependence on expected monsoon rainfall the increase in wheat area for wet years 21 increase in post cd couldn t be explained just from dynamics of gwls as gwlpm are high and similar in both periods table 3 thus further research is needed to ascertain whether the increase in wheat area in wet years is a result of cd recharge or other dynamics 5 3 inter annual groundwater storage a commonly stated benefit of recharge interventions is that they create storage for dry years by recharging in years of good rainfall alam et al 2020 garg et al 2020 megdal et al 2014 singh et al 2021 this may happen in situations where structures have larger storage capacity and are thus able to capture more and recharge over longer durations ogilvie et al 2016 2019 or in areas where there is low demand due to low cropping and irrigation intensity thus recharged water in wet years is in excess to demand and remains available for irrigation in dry years garg et al 2020 singh et al 2021 the study catchment underlain by hardrock aquifers low porosity limited thickness with limited aquifer storage capacity shows no clear evidence of this as compared to post monsoon gwls gwlpm pre monsoon gwls gwlprm representing end of year storage are much less sensitive to yearly rainfall and is in the range of 10 12 m for all years section 4 4 and table 3 we hypothesize that because of the wheat area s post monsoon crop strong dependence on gwlpm fig 5a and limited post monsoon storage due to high demand by the monsoon cotton crop limited storage is available by the end of hydrological year fig 5 very low wheat cultivated area in years with gwlpm lower than 10 m bgl fig 6a suggests that groundwater storage below 10 m bgl offers limited utility to support irrigation due to the low porosity and limited thickness of the underlying hardrock aquifers direct evidence of limited impact of carry over storage is indicated by the severe impact on crop area and production in the drought year of 2012 which followed a wet year of 2011 figure a2 during 2011 wheat sown area was very high resulting in limited storage at the end of the season gwl of 11 8 m bgl fig 4 thus without significant carry over storage and low rainfall thus low recharge and high demand the impact of drought was severe in the catchment with cotton and wheat production in 2012 being only 27 and 6 of their respective production in 2011 5 4 vulnerability versus benefits and tradeoffs of mar supply demand dynamics in the catchment points to the case of jevons paradox alcott 2005 where increased water demand from increased production outweighs water savings scott et al 2014 glendenning et al 2012 in this case the increased recharge from cds in the absence of any policy or quota on irrigation irrigation expansion and higher irrigation efficiency can aggravate scarcity and reduce resilience scott et al 2014 however more research is required to ascertain if the increase in demand increased crop area and irrigation water use is resulting from perceived increase in supply through gwrcd increase in rainfall years or other market related factors a counter argument to this is that these small storage aquifers are self regulating because they cannot be continuously depleted over many years taylor et al 2019 the silver lining to this is that the system will likely not collapse and whenever there is a good rainfall the aquifers will be filled up in turn irrigated areas will not expand continuously and likely they will vary more in tune with rainfall but exhaust the groundwater storage every year the argument can be made that this increase in demand outpacing supply has increased agricultural vulnerability to drought in the catchment for example the percent of demand met was only 30 in dry years for the post cd period whereas this was 54 in pre cd period dry years table 2 this is evident in the 2012 drought where reduction in cotton production is much higher relative decrease of 300 in post cd compared to 2000 in pre cd relative decrease of 61 figure a2 this reiterates that cds are not effective in a catchment with very low rainfall in dry years little runoff to capture and low storage aquifers meaning limited carry over storage however on the other hand an argument can be made that increased production in normal and wet years supported by cds outweighs the losses in dry years this suggest that rather than looking at productivity in individual years the benefits of cds or recharge interventions in the area should be assessed by combining good years with bad years good rainfall years allow farmers to make higher profits from increased capture of rainfall and address tide over losses from dry years which remain as bad or worse as the pre mar situation more research and analysis are needed to ascertain these aspects the narrative also points towards the need for better understanding the benefits and tradeoffs of mar in these environments our results suggests that though cd came up in response to a drought they are not necessarily efficient in drought proofing 5 5 uncertainties in this analysis and future research needs the simple method applied in this study with clearly defined assumptions and accounting for major factors is able to progress the assessment of the impact of high density cd development on climate resilience of agriculture in saurashtra with implications for similar regions elsewhere there are two major sources of uncertainty in the analysis a reliability and inherent errors in the data used and b methodological assumptions and simplifications made agricultural data crop area irrigated area and irrigation source in gujarat and in india more broadly is primarily derived from government reported annual agricultural statistics which are collected bottom up from the village scale and then aggregated to higher administrative levels through random sample surveys of 20 of the villages during each crop season in a state and is then further cross checked through random sampling ministry of statistics and programme implementation 2018 planning commission 2001 similarly crop yield data are collected through crop cutting experiments in randomly selected fields and then cross checked however being a manual survey process errors can result from 1 non reporting of crops sown predominant error 2 incorrect area entered for the crop or 3 non reporting of the crop actually sown in the field ministry of statistics and programme implementation 2018 data for 2015 16 at the national scale in india shows that the error mismatch of information identified in cross checking was 9 25 in different seasons for crop area 9 for irrigation data annual and 5 10 for yields cotton and groundnut ministry of statistics and programme implementation 2018 despite these errors the absence of other annually available and long term collected data makes this the primary source of data used extensively in agricultural and water resources research sidhu et al 2022 and contributes to data for many global datasets e g siebert et al 2010 similarly data on groundwater levels is collected by the central ground water board cgwb four times each year january may august and november by field personnel covering an extensive national monitoring well network cgwb 2015 the cgwb data has again been used extensively by researchers over many years as this represents the main source of groundwater data in india e g hora et al 2019 asoka et al 2017 bhanja et al 2017 however this data has gaps and outliers and is often sparse these issues are usually addressed by removing outliers and monitoring wells with missing data above a threshold as was done in this study asoka et al 2017 bhanja et al 2017 however hora et al 2019 found that this may lead to bias so called survivor bias where dried wells often missing data may lead to better picture of the aquifer than is actually the case other sources of data such as grace satellite data couldn t be used due to the small spatial scale of the catchment daily rainfall is taken from imd gridded datasets and again has been used extensively asoka et al 2017 kumar singh et al 2019 imd gridded data is derived from using records of 7000 rain gauge stations pai et al 2014 multiple studies evaluating the performance of available rainfall products have shown that the imd data performs satisfactorily over indian monsoon conditions pai et al 2014 kumar singh et al 2019 thus while we have used the best available data in some cases the only source and published data sources table 1 which have been used extensively they come with inherent uncertainties which have a bearing on the results this analysis required making certain methodological assumptions and simplifications as have been documented in section 3 one limitation is that the method applied assumes that changes in annual yields primarily results from changes in ground water availability whereas moving average of yields captures changes resulting from improvement in inputs e g better seeds fertilizers better wells and pumps etc however the other factors e g heat waves cold waves pest attacks can still add to yield variability and couldn t be accounted for also we donot consider irrigation efficiency with the assumption that irrigation return flows are completely recyclable additionally while we have considered potential recharge by check dams there is a need for further research to ascertain plausible upstream downstream tradeoffs due to the same as effects of flows captured in upstream areas potentially negatively impacts downstream communities calder et al 2008 ribeiro neto et al 2022 nune et al 2014 similarly lumped catchment assessment ignores the distribution both spatial and social of impacts and there is a need to assess how socially equitable the benefits have been for example there are concerns that cd impacts are concentrated near structures in low lying areas shah et al 2021 and that farmers with more financial and social capital benefit the most bouma et al 2011 calder et al 2008 this requires setting up more comprehensive hydrological assessments capturing catchment water balance and more explicit inclusion of surface groundwater dynamics along with socioeconomic field data the latter is also critical to determine the drivers and impacts of increase in demand further research is also needed to assess how these structures will work under the realities of climate change where extreme events are expected to increase mukherjee et al 2018 6 conclusions managed aquifer recharge mar through various interventions including cds is increasingly being promoted and adopted for sustainable groundwater use and resilience building to dry periods and droughts our study analyzed the case of high density cd development in the saurashtra region of gujarat india results considering rainfall variability and crop irrigation water demand show that counter to assumptions of cds being a strong measure to alleviate the impacts of droughts their capability is highly restricted in dry years and especially under scenarios of possibly accompanying increasing water demand this is because there is limited runoff to capture and recharge and the underlying aquifer has low storage capacity that is replenished and depleted annually with limited carry over storage the study shows that irrigation water demand has increased significantly and outstripped the increase in recharge from cds thus with limited runoff in dry years low groundwater storage and increasing demand these interventions may not be very effective in securing irrigation water supplies and may not necessarily lead to long term climate resilience for good rainfall years increased recharge via cds does increase supply but can only partially compensate for the increased demand of the kharif season indicating that overall reduction of irrigated areas and flexible annual adjustment to rainfall in the wet season and adjustment to groundwater storage in the dry season are required these findings suggest that mar unless complemented by greater emphasis on water demand management and groundwater governance may not suffice as a standalone solution to achieving sustainable groundwater and concurrently expanding food production in hydrogeological and climatic settings like in gujarat india additionally irrigated agriculture needs to be flexible and adaptable to prevailing climate and groundwater storage conditions there is a need for clear communication and realistic assessment and expectation of the potential benefits of recharge interventions in regions with limited aquifer storage and highly variable runoff while also ensuring that basic water needs are not sacrificed in the quest for increased food production funding this research was made possible

7805,study region the study region is the kamadhiya catchment 1150 km2 located in the saurashtra region of the western state of gujarat india the region has seen intensive development of check dams cds for groundwater recharge with an estimated 27 000 cds constructed up until 2018 study focus the impact of cds on groundwater storage food production and resilience are assessed for kamadhiya catchment by estimating and comparing changes across periods of low and high cd development in potential recharge from cds rainfall trends and irrigation demand the analysis is carried out for the period from 1983 to 2015 new hydrological insights for the region groundwater storage gains observed following cd development can partly be attributed to an increase in high rainfall years after several drought years groundwater demand for irrigation has increased substantially outweighing increase in groundwater recharge from cds this deficit in supply relative to demand is greatest in dry years and when considered together with the low inter annual carry over storage of the region s hardrock aquifers means that cds capacity to enhance groundwater storage and mitigate the negative impacts of drought remains limited findings suggest that a standalone focus on mar unless complemented by greater emphasis on management of water demand and groundwater resources more broadly may not be sufficient to achieve the long term goals of sustainable groundwater and concurrently expanding agricultural crop production keywords groundwater managed aquifer recharge check dams irrigation drought data availability all data generated or analysed during this study are included or referenced in this published article and its supplementary information files 1 introduction reliable and adequate availability of freshwater for irrigation is critical for global food security with climate change and increasing climate variability leading to more extremes in water availability expressed as droughts and floods united nations 2019 ipcc in press irrigation is more important than ever smit and skinner 2002 ignaciuk and mason d croz 2014 groundwater being more reliable and more widely available than surface water and largely protected from evaporation losses plays a critical role in providing irrigation water especially in semi arid areas wwap united nations world water assessment programme un water 2022 and supplies 38 of irrigated areas globally siebert et al 2010 however in many parts of the world overdependence on groundwater irrigation has led to unsustainable use and depletion of groundwater resources d√∂ll et al 2012 bierkens and wada 2019 to mitigate groundwater depletion and enhance groundwater security for irrigation one strategy that is increasingly applied is managed aquifer recharge mar zhang et al 2020 alam and pavelic 2020 zheng et al 2021 mar involves strategically recharging aquifers with excess surface water through infrastructure such as check dams or recharge wells dillon et al 2019 alam and pavelic 2020 the benefits of mar in these cases include enhanced groundwater storage in dry seasons and drought periods supporting continuous irrigation and or mitigating depletion alam et al 2020 dillon et al 2019 prathapar et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 mar is contingent on the availability of harvestable source water for augmenting recharge and storage like flood waters or treated wastewater which may be seasonally or perennially available respectively india as the largest user of groundwater globally is promoting mar to mitigate negative impacts of extensive groundwater use through multiple central cgwb 2020 and state government programs and policies verma and shah 2019 cgwb 2020 one notable example is gujarat where more than 90 000 mar structures in the form of check dams have been constructed since the year 2000 with the financial support subsidies of government and non government organizations under the government participatory scheme sardar patel sahbhagi jal sanchay yojana sardar patel participatory water conservation program shah et al 2009 nwrws 2018 verma and shah 2019 patel et al 2020 an extended drought in 1999 2002 during which the average rainfall was about 35 less than normal pai et al 2014 greatly accelerated the development of check dams facilitated by government support fig 1c patel 2007 patel et al 2020 increased mar implementation as a result has been widely reported as having a positive impact on groundwater storage in the region shah et al 2009 jain 2012 patel et al 2020 while a number of studies have analyzed the increasing groundwater storage in gujarat shah et al 2009 jain 2012 bhanja et al 2017 kumar and perry 2018 patel et al 2020 they disagree on the underlying explanation improved groundwater storage has been attributed to a number of factors increased rainfall shah et al 2009 kumar and perry 2018 reduced groundwater abstraction brought about by rationing schemes enabled by separating agriculture and non agriculture electricity feeders shah et al 2009 bhanja et al 2017 inter basin transfer of water kumar and perry 2018 and enhanced recharge from mar mostly through check dams shah et al 2009 jain 2012 patel et al 2020 the diverging explanations among the studies demonstrate the lack of clarity in attributing the increase in groundwater storage including the role of mar this is because any change in groundwater storage is a result of numerous factors associated with the short and long term dynamics of supply e g rainfall amount and intensity performance of mar and demand factors e g changing cropping patterns irrigated areas irrigation practices previous studies have not systematically accounted for these complexities the main limitations associated with the previous studies include 1 focusing on recharge enhancement while not accounting for increased groundwater irrigation demand for agriculture bhanja et al 2017 kumar and perry 2018 patel et al 2020 2 neglecting the long term change in rainfall and inter annual variability in rainfall shah et al 2009 bhanja et al 2017 3 focusing on small scale assessments of mar structures or micro catchments patel et al 2002 sharda et al 2006 leading to high uncertainty when attempting to extrapolate results to large scale and 4 focusing on state level impacts shah et al 2009 bhanja et al 2017 and thus discounting spatial variability and heterogeneity in biophysical factors hydrogeology soil water demand kumar and perry 2018 and the interconnectedness of mar structures within a hydrologic unit mozzi et al 2021 with the progressive priority and increased investment being made in mar in gujarat and other states in india verma and shah 2019 there is clear and urgent need to assess the effectiveness of mar at an appropriate intermediary scale and for relevant contexts this requires a long term integrated analysis accounting for the dynamics of both supply and demand on a catchment scale which this study aims to carry out in this study we analyze the dynamics of groundwater storage in conjunction with changes in rainfall irrigation demand and increase in supply through mar in gujarat with this we aim to establish the contribution of mar to groundwater storage and agricultural production relative to other key factors 2 study area the analysis is carried out for kamadhiya catchment 1150 km2 located in the saurashtra region 6600 km2 of the western state of gujarat india fig 1 kamadhiya catchment is an upstream catchment of the bhadar basin one of the larger river basins in the region kamadhiya catchment drains to bhadar dam 240 million cubic meters mcm fig 1 the largest dam supplying both irrigation and drinking water in the bhadar basin nwrws 2010 while the catchment scale considered here provides a closed hydrologic unit for assessment and accounts for the limitation of the small spatial scales of earlier studies focusing on specific mar structures or micro watersheds it still falls short of a basin scale assessment as it represents only 17 of the entire basin area therefore attempts to extrapolate these findings to the basin scale would require further investigation saurashtra region has been the focus of development of mar in india mostly in the form of check dams hereafter referred to as cd shah et al 2009 patel et al 2020 an estimated 27 000 cds were constructed across saurashtra before 2018 nwrws 2018 within bhadar basin the number of cds increased from 484 24 0 mcm storage in 1999 to 4385 103 3 mcm storage by the end of 2010 fig 1c kamboj et al 2011 with more than 90 of cds constructed after 2000 primarily during 2001 2002 in response to the extended 2000 2002 drought patel 2007 patel et al 2020 in the kamadhiya catchment the total number of cds in 2006 was estimated to be 576 with total storage capacity of 12 7 mcm patel 2007 with lack of time series data for kamadhiya catchment we assume the same development curve as in bhadar basin with 90 of cds at the end of 2006 constructed post 2000 during 2001 2002 also we further assume that the rate of development of new cds post 2006 will be approximately matched by the rate of attrition of existing cds as they lose functionality from lack of maintenance e g siltation collapse kumar and perry 2018 mozzi et al 2021 thus based on the density of cds in the catchment we term the period until 2002 as pre cd during which cd density was relatively low 10 of cds in 2006 58 cds 1 cd per 20 km2 and the period after 2002 as post cd during which cd density had increased ten fold 100 of cds in 2006 576 cds 10 cds per 20 km2 2 1 climate the climate of the kamadhiya catchment is semi arid with an average annual rainfall of 638 mm yr 1 1983 2015 pai et al 2014 more than 90 of the rainfall is concentrated in the four monsoon months from june to september rainfall is also associated with high inter annual variability with a coefficient of variation of 46 estimated for the period 1983 2015 from the india meteorological department imd gridded rainfall dataset pai et al 2014 average annual mean temperature is 27·µíc with minimum temperature observed in january with a mean of 20 6·µíc and the maximum temperature observed in may with a mean of 30 7·µíc srivastava et al 2009 2 2 agriculture and irrigation agriculture and irrigation data were available only on an administrative level thus we report and use data from rajkot district and absolute values for the catchment are derived using the proportion of catchment area which lies within the district 86 the kharif monsoon is the main cropping season where groundnut and cotton are the main crops occupying 48 and 41 of total sown area respectively doa gujarat 2021 other minor crops in the kharif season include bajra pearl millet and sesame rabi post monsoon season has limited cropping area which is reflected by low annual cropping intensity of 113 does gujarat 2018 wheat is the main rabi crop doa gujarat 2021 of the total net cropped and gross cropped area 39 and 42 is equipped for irrigation respectively does gujarat 2018 during the kharif season cotton requires supplemental irrigation whereas groundnut is rainfed rabi crops rely entirely on irrigation doa gujarat 2021 groundwater is the main source of irrigation in the district accounting for 82 of the irrigated area does gujarat 2018 the main source of surface water in the district is from aji and bhadar dams ggrc 2015 irrigation and domestic water supply represent about 95 and 5 of the overall water demand respectively ggrc 2015 2 3 hydrogeology the groundwater in the saurashtra region is found at shallow depths under unconfined conditions in aquifers characterized by parent basalt rock of the deccan trap formation with little primary porosity mohapatra 2013 patel 2007 in the region deccan trap basalt has weathered upper parts to a depth of 20 30 m forming good aquifers which are tapped for irrigation mostly by large diameter open dugwells fig 2a mohapatra 2013 mowr rd and gr 2017a the groundwater well yields are seasonally variable and highest after monsoonal recharge pavelic et al 2012 the weathered aquifer is underlain by consolidated basalt rocks generally forms a poor aquifer with groundwater present in fractured and vesicular zones secondary porosity in successive basalt flows and tapped by deeper borewells of depth 150 m mohapatra 2013 patel et al 2020 mowr rd and gr 2017a 3 methods and data the analysis is carried out for the period from 1983 to 2015 33 years this period is divided into the pre cd 1983 2002 and post cd 2003 2015 period where the post cd period indicates the period after the 2000 2002 extended drought and after 90 of the cds were constructed we assess the impact of cds by estimating and comparing changes from the pre cd to the post cd period Œ¥ post cd pre cd specifically in groundwater recharge Œ¥gwr and groundwater abstraction Œ¥gwa since both groundwater recharge and groundwater abstraction for irrigation depend on rainfall which is associated with high inter annual variability we only compare pre cd and post cd periods in similar rainfall years classified using standard

focus our analysis on two main irrigated crops of the region cotton and wheat cotton is supplementarily irrigated during the kharif season and wheat is fully irrigated during the rabi season we assume the irrigation water volume derived from groundwater is proportional to the fraction of groundwater irrigated area in the area groundwater irrigated area data was taken from annual agricultural statistics as reported by the government does gujarat 2018 icrisat 2021 and was assumed to be the same for both crops in the absence of crop specific information also we disregard groundwater abstraction for non irrigation purposes which is less than 5 in the district cgwb 2019 fig 3 gives the conceptual flow diagram showing the approach taken to arrive at groundwater abstraction gwa to estimate groundwater abstraction for hydrological year i we first estimate the annual net irrigation water applied irrigation for crops in the case of cotton applied irrigation volume mm is estimated as the difference between actual evapotranspiration aet of rainfed aetrainfed and irrigated aetirrigated cotton eq 2a for wheat grown with 100 cultivated area under irrigation we assume all crop water

classification in pre cd and post cd respectively 3 2 change in recharge from check dams Œ¥gwrcd groundwater recharge from cds gwrcd is simulated using an analytical dynamic tool mozzi et al 2021 the tool integrates a daily water balance of individual cds with a set of analytical infiltration equations bouwer 1969 2002 giving daily dynamics of storage infiltration and evaporation the tool was previously applied to four structures in the bhadar basin and validated at sites in rajasthan where more extensive data were available mozzi et al 2021 application of the tool has shown good performance with validation results giving an average r2 of 0 93 between the simulated and measured water levels in individual cds the tool requires input data on cd geometrical parameters catchment area hydrogeology characteristics daily inflow to cd and potential evaporation representative values of cds in kamadhiya catchment were applied table a2 to estimate gwrcd the tool is used to simulate recharge from a representative cd gwrcd r with a storage capacity vcd r of 21 486 m3 table a2 a simulation is carried out for the pre cd period 1983 2002 where runoff is assumed to be representing the baseline conditions with low cd development annual recharge values are then averaged for each spi class thereafter to get relative cd recharge for pre cd and post cd periods at the catchment scale gwrcd for each spi classified year the ratio of representative cd recharge gwrcd r to its storage capacity vcd r is multiplied with catchment cumulative cd storage capacity vcd pre 1 3 mcm and vcd post 11 4 mcm eqs 11a and 11b 11a gw r cd spi pre gw r cd r spi v cd r v cd pre 11b gw r cd spi post gw r cd r spi v cd r v cd post thereafter change in groundwater recharge Œ¥gwrcd is estimated for each spi class from the mean gwrcd of each spi category for pre cd and post cd and taking the difference eq 12 12 Œ¥ gwr cd spi 1 n postcd spi i 1 n postcd spi gw r cd post i 1 n precd spi i 1 n precd spi gw r cd pre i where spi denotes the spi classification dry normal and wet and n precd spi and n postcd spi is the number of years under each spi classification in pre cd and post cd periods respectively all gwr figures are calculated on daily time scales and thereafter aggregated to annual scale we assume that all cds are functioning behave similarly and do not interact 3 3 observed change in groundwater storage Œ¥gwso the observed change in groundwater storage is the annual net balance of groundwater recharge and abstraction in the catchment this is estimated using the water table fluctuation method mowr rd gr 2017b pavelic et al 2012 the water table fluctuation method has been used extensively and found suitable for climatic and hydrogeological conditions of unconfined weathered hardrock aquifers pavelic et al 2012 dewandel et al 2010 machiwal et al 2017 the water table fluctuation method derives groundwater storage change gwso from the rise in monsoonal groundwater levels gwlr estimated as the difference between pre gwlprm and post monsoon gwlpm groundwater levels eqs 14 15 14 gws o i gwl r i s y catchment area 15 gwl r i gwl pm i gwl prm i 1 where gwl pm i is the post monsoon of gwl of hydrological year i taken in november gwl prm i 1 is the pre monsoon gwl of previous hydrological year i taken in may hence pre monsoon gwl of previous hydrological year is the groundwater level storage at the start of year i sy is the specific yield which is taken as 0 02 as the recommended value for the region mowr rd gr 2017b patel et al 2020 annual catchment averaged pre gwlprm and post monsoon gwlpm groundwater levels are derived using observed data from monitored wells for the time period 1983 2015 from the central groundwater board cgwb 2015 a total of 15 observation wells located within the catchment and up to a 10 km distance beyond the catchment boundary were used for the analysis the data were filtered for outliers using interquartile range method with data outside an interquartile range of 1 5 removed only monitoring wells with observation records containing more than 2 3 of the years of pre and post gwl data points were used gwlpm and gwlprm for each year were then derived from spatially interpolating observation wells using inverse distance weighing li and heap 2008 thereafter gwlr is calculated according to eq 15 finally the change in groundwater storage Œ¥gwro is estimated for each spi classified category by getting mean of gwso of each spi category for pre cd and post cd and taking the difference eq 16 16 Œ¥ gw s o spi 1 n postcd spi i 1 n postcd spi gw s o i 1 n precd i i 1 n precd i gw s o i where spi denotes the spi classification dry normal and wet and n precd spi and n postcd spi is the number of years under each spi classification in pre cd and post cd respectively we compared observed Œ¥gwso eq 16 with estimated Œ¥gwse eq 1 change in groundwater storage to validate our results storage change derived from the water table fluctuation method incorporates all sources and sinks including diffuse rainfall recharge recharge from cds subsurface irrigation returns flows groundwater evaporation and any net lateral groundwater flow pavelic et al 2012 mowr rd gr 2017b it is assumed that net groundwater inflow outflow is negligible as hardrock areas have limited lateral subsurface hydraulic connectivity at the regional scale bouma et al 2011 dewandel et al 2010 pavelic et al 2012 table 1 summarizes the datasets used in the analysis 4 results 4 1 rainfall fig 4 shows the annual rainfall time series with individual years categorized as either wet normal or dry based on spi for the overall period average rainfall is 638 6 mm yr 1 average post cd rainfall 809 8 mm yr 1 is 27 higher than the overall average whilst the pre cd rainfall 511 9 mm yr 1 is 25 lower than the average also there is a high inter annual variability characterized by a high coefficient of variation of 45 across the whole time series wet rainfall years are concentrated in the post cd 8 in post cd vs 3 in pre cd whereas dry years are disproportionately occurring in the pre cd period 8 in pre cd vs 1 in post cd table 2 4 2 groundwater abstraction gwa 4 2 1 cotton area under cotton cultivation has steeply risen especially during the post cd fig 4b the average post cd cotton area 30 670 ha is 124 higher than the pre cd period 13 670 ha table 2 at the same time average irrigated cotton area has increased in post cd to an average of 85 4 of cropped area compared to 64 2 in pre cd fig 4b and table 2 results show that this increase in area and irrigation from pre to post cd is consistent for all spi classified years table 2 increase in cotton area fig 4b translates to more than two fold increase in crop water requirement cwr in post cd for both overall and spi classified years table 2 with 85 of crop area irrigated with groundwater this translates into an increase in potential groundwater demand gwapot of 96 4 mcm increase of 188 62 9 mcm increase of 168 and 56 6 mcm increase of 203 in dry normal and wet years respectively table 2 in normal and wet years with practically all gwapot being met met between 86 2 and 100 table 2 gwa increases by 40 1 mcm increase of 125 and 54 6 mcm increase of 200 respectively however for dry years most of gwapot remains unmet in post cd met 30 reflecting that irrigation in dry years is limited by available groundwater storage thus gwa increases by only 9 8 mcm in dry years between the two periods table 2 4 2 2 wheat the wheat area in post cd period 7770 ha is 112 higher than in the pre cd 3660 ha table 2 in contrast to cotton there is no or limited change in wheat area when compared across similar spi classified years table 2 with area increasing only in wet years 21 however across spi years wheat shows a large increase from dry 700 1000 ha to wet 8500 10 300 ha years this shows that large overall increase 118 in wheat area in post cd is largely due to higher number of wet years table 2 wheat is completely irrigated 99 area under irrigation in both periods for all years fig 4c and table 2 wheat cwr and gwa similar to wheat area show an increase of 115 for overall period in post cd relative to pre cd table 2 however across spi classified years there is no or limited change in cwr and gwa only wet years show moderate increase in gwa by 7 8 mcm 26 increase wheat yield does not show decrease across spi years reflecting that 100 of demand is met gwapot gwa summing up cotton and wheat irrigation overall gwapot and gwa post cd increases by 67 5 mcm 124 and 63 4 mcm 162 as compared to pre cd 4 3 change in recharge from check dams Œ¥gwrcd the average recharge from cds gwrcd increases from 2 4 mcm in pre cd to 34 0 mcm in post cd table 3 overall this means a 14 fold increase in recharge from cds Œ¥gwrcd also gwrcd increases from dry to wet years with Œ¥gwrcd post cd pre cd increasing from dry 10 7 mcm to normal 21 2 mcm to wet years 37 2 mcm table 3 monthly recharge estimates table a3 show that on average highest recharge takes place in july and august when sufficient runoff is available and groundwater tables are deeper table 3 shows that gwrcd is constrained by inflow capture of the cds calculated as the difference between flow entering and leaving a check dam which decreases from dry to wet years on average 67 of inflow is captured by cd with highest capture in dry years 94 followed by normal years 85 and wet years 55 besides rainfall recharge and inflow capture are sensitive to cd geometry catchment area mozzi et al 2021 and results reflect the first order average potential recharge from existing cd storage in the catchment table a3 4 4 observed change in groundwater storage Œ¥gwso gwls show no statistically significant long term declining or rising trend over the whole study period p 0 05 but high inter annual variability fig 5 averaged over pre cd and post cd post monsoon groundwater level gwlpm below ground level bgl and average annual groundwater storage increase gwso are higher gwls closer to ground level during the post cd period gwlpm 6 8 m bgl gwlprm 11 4 m bgl and gwso 107 0 mcm than in the pre cd period gwlpm 8 7 m bgl gwlprm 11 8 m bgl and gwso 70 4 mcm table 3 however when compared across similar spi classified years to account for the influence of rainfall gwls and gwso are lower in post cd as compared to pre cd table 3 for example gwso in post cd decreases by 2 5 mcm pre cd 17 7 mcm and post cd 15 2 mcm 19 4 mcm pre cd 83 9 mcm and post cd 64 5 mcm and 31 1 mcm pre cd 170 8 mcm and post cd 139 7 mcm for dry normal and wet years respectively this shows that overall higher gwls and gwso in post cd is the result of disproportionally higher number of wet years in post cd period table 3 and not due to the increased number of mar interventions dynamics of gwls show that gwlpm are sensitive to the magnitude of monsoon seasonal rainfall with average gwlpm highest during wet years 5 m bgl and much deeper in dry years 11 m bgl on the other hand pre monsoon groundwater levels gwlprm are relatively less sensitive to monsoonal rainfall with average gwlprm fluctuating from 9 4 10 5 m bgl in wet years to 12 6 13 5 m bgl in dry years fig 5 and table 3 this reflects the properties of low storage aquifer systems where storage is filled during monsoon months to an extent depending on rainfall and storage capacity of the aquifer and irrigation leads to desaturation at the end of hydrological year pavelic et al 2012 the lower gwlprm and their low sensitivity to annual rainfall shows that there is limited inter annual groundwater storage carry over from the dry season to the wet season in the catchment 5 discussion 5 1 dynamics of groundwater balance changes table 4 compares changes in observed Œ¥gwso and estimated Œ¥gwse groundwater storage increase in recharge Œ¥gwrcd changes in potential groundwater demand Œ¥gwapot and actual groundwater abstraction Œ¥gwa for the kamadhiya catchment between pre and post cd periods the latter two are aggregated sums of cotton and wheat table 2 results show that both Œ¥gwapot and supply via increased recharge Œ¥gwrcd has increased in post cd but the increase in gwapot has outpaced the increase in gwrcd additionally the increase is not uniform across the spi classified years Œ¥gwrcd is highest in the wet years whereas Œ¥gwapot is highest in the dry years and vice versa thus the deficit demand supply is highest for dry years followed by normal and wet years with Œ¥gwrcd representing only 11 of the increased groundwater demand Œ¥gwapot for dry years with limited natural recharge in dry years combined with low groundwater storage at the start of the year i e gwlprm of previous year fig 5 table 3 and low additional cd recharge Œ¥gwrcd table 4 only 30 of cotton gwapot is met in the post cd period whereas wheat cultivated area is significantly reduced 10 of average wheat area in post cd table 2 limited abstraction and recharge also mean that there is very limited change in estimated groundwater storage Œ¥gwse 2 5 mcm from pre cd to post cd table 4 this matches with limited change observed in groundwater storage Œ¥gwso 2 4 mcm this shows that groundwater storage remains low in dry years for both periods table 3 and is unable to meet irrigation demands the high unmet demand reflects the limited efficacy of cds in semi arid regions with low storage aquifers for mitigating impact of droughts which supports the findings of earlier studies boisson et al 2015 enfors and gordon 2008 kumar et al 2008 kumar and perry 2018 ogilvie et al 2016 2019 for example ogilvie et al 2016 2019 in assessing rainwater storage structures in tunisia showed that their low storage capacity limits their ability to recharge groundwater sufficiently thus having a limited impact on farmers drought coping capacity a similar conclusion was reached by enfors and gordon 2008 assessing mar in tanzania locally termed ndiva system thus the hypothesis that sufficient runoff is available and remains available for planning recharge interventions may not hold in semi arid areas especially in dry years boisson et al 2014 2015 for normal and wet years the deficit is less pronounced relative to dry years table 4 however Œ¥gwrcd can only meet 34 and 58 of increased groundwater demand Œ¥gwapot in normal and wet years respectively table 4 in normal and wet years in contrast to dry years groundwater storage is recharged by rainfall fig 5 gwlr in table 3 and meets the irrigation demand in excess of increased recharge from cds Œ¥gwrcd this is reflected in the results indicating that most of the potential groundwater demand is met in normal and wet years for both major crops table 2 thus higher groundwater abstraction translates to decrease in Œ¥gwse in post period table 4 for both normal 17 7 mcm and wet years 25 2 mcm this matches well with Œ¥gwso of 19 3 mcm and 31 1 mcm in normal and wet years respectively this implies that increase in recharge by cds can only partly support increased kharif irrigation and positive impact of gwrcd on groundwater storage is overshadowed by the increase in demand the findings from this study related to no long term increase in groundwater storage are contrary to findings of other studies patel et al 2020 shah et al 2009 bhanja et al 2017 and we find that higher overall average storage in the post cd period is primarily due to an increased number of wet years the divergence between the findings could be attributed to differences in the temporal period considered and or the spatial scale of analysis for example shah et al 2009 only compared two distinct years 2000 and 2008 but did not fully account for the variability of rainfall similarly both asoka et al 2017 and bhanja et al 2017 have a different temporal period for analysis with data starting from 1996 thus having very limited data for the pre cd period which may accentuate low groundwater levels during the 2000 2002 drought relative to post cd period their analysis was also focused at the national scale thus discerning regional differences is more difficult while patel et al 2020 do account for longer time series starting from 1975 they only compare wet year periods during the pre cd 1975 1984 and post cd 2004 2009 and the analysis focuses on the larger spatial region whole of saurashtra thus again making a direct comparison difficult it is important to note that none of the above studies accounted for changes in water demand without which dynamics of groundwater storage cannot be reliably derived 5 2 implication of mar on kharif and rabi season cropping overall our findings of increased cropping and irrigation water demand of mainly kharif cotton and additional recharge from cds partly support the hypothesis of shah et al 2009 that kharif production has increased with gwrcd making good rainfall years i e normal and wet years better however even in normal and wet years increased recharge can only partially meet increased demand table 4 translating to lower groundwater storage in post cd when compared with pre cd across similar spi years tables 3 and 4 this further builds on the argument that cds can only provide supplemental irrigation during good normal or wet rainfall years and cannot be expected to sustain intensive irrigation in dry years as also evidenced in other regions e g ogilvie et al 2016 2019 our results do not show any consistent and significant increase in wheat area which was also hypothesized by shah et al 2009 except in wet years table 2 in this respect our findings also contrast with findings by garg et al 2020 carried out in bundelkhand region of uttar pradesh state of india their results show that the impact of recharge interventions in terms of increasing area and production was more tangible during the rabi season the low impact on rabi area and production in our study could be attributed to extensive irrigated cotton area in the study catchment table 2 which utilizes much of recharge during the monsoon season thus leaving limited storage for rabi cultivation dependent on irrigation this is supported by the observation that post monsoon gwls gwlpm have been similar or slightly lower in post cd relative to pre cd fig 4 and table 3 with no increases in groundwater storage at the end of the monsoon indicated by gwlpm there is limited increase in wheat area table 2 as it is highly dependent on gwlpm signified by good correlation r2 of 0 64 of wheat area and gwlpm fig 6a this also suggests that farmers across the catchment consistently plan their wheat crop areas cognizant of the irrigation demand that the post monsoon storage can support the correlation of pre monsoon levels with cotton area is much less pronounced r2 of 0 01 fig 6b this could be attributed to kharif cropping dependence on expected monsoon rainfall the increase in wheat area for wet years 21 increase in post cd couldn t be explained just from dynamics of gwls as gwlpm are high and similar in both periods table 3 thus further research is needed to ascertain whether the increase in wheat area in wet years is a result of cd recharge or other dynamics 5 3 inter annual groundwater storage a commonly stated benefit of recharge interventions is that they create storage for dry years by recharging in years of good rainfall alam et al 2020 garg et al 2020 megdal et al 2014 singh et al 2021 this may happen in situations where structures have larger storage capacity and are thus able to capture more and recharge over longer durations ogilvie et al 2016 2019 or in areas where there is low demand due to low cropping and irrigation intensity thus recharged water in wet years is in excess to demand and remains available for irrigation in dry years garg et al 2020 singh et al 2021 the study catchment underlain by hardrock aquifers low porosity limited thickness with limited aquifer storage capacity shows no clear evidence of this as compared to post monsoon gwls gwlpm pre monsoon gwls gwlprm representing end of year storage are much less sensitive to yearly rainfall and is in the range of 10 12 m for all years section 4 4 and table 3 we hypothesize that because of the wheat area s post monsoon crop strong dependence on gwlpm fig 5a and limited post monsoon storage due to high demand by the monsoon cotton crop limited storage is available by the end of hydrological year fig 5 very low wheat cultivated area in years with gwlpm lower than 10 m bgl fig 6a suggests that groundwater storage below 10 m bgl offers limited utility to support irrigation due to the low porosity and limited thickness of the underlying hardrock aquifers direct evidence of limited impact of carry over storage is indicated by the severe impact on crop area and production in the drought year of 2012 which followed a wet year of 2011 figure a2 during 2011 wheat sown area was very high resulting in limited storage at the end of the season gwl of 11 8 m bgl fig 4 thus without significant carry over storage and low rainfall thus low recharge and high demand the impact of drought was severe in the catchment with cotton and wheat production in 2012 being only 27 and 6 of their respective production in 2011 5 4 vulnerability versus benefits and tradeoffs of mar supply demand dynamics in the catchment points to the case of jevons paradox alcott 2005 where increased water demand from increased production outweighs water savings scott et al 2014 glendenning et al 2012 in this case the increased recharge from cds in the absence of any policy or quota on irrigation irrigation expansion and higher irrigation efficiency can aggravate scarcity and reduce resilience scott et al 2014 however more research is required to ascertain if the increase in demand increased crop area and irrigation water use is resulting from perceived increase in supply through gwrcd increase in rainfall years or other market related factors a counter argument to this is that these small storage aquifers are self regulating because they cannot be continuously depleted over many years taylor et al 2019 the silver lining to this is that the system will likely not collapse and whenever there is a good rainfall the aquifers will be filled up in turn irrigated areas will not expand continuously and likely they will vary more in tune with rainfall but exhaust the groundwater storage every year the argument can be made that this increase in demand outpacing supply has increased agricultural vulnerability to drought in the catchment for example the percent of demand met was only 30 in dry years for the post cd period whereas this was 54 in pre cd period dry years table 2 this is evident in the 2012 drought where reduction in cotton production is much higher relative decrease of 300 in post cd compared to 2000 in pre cd relative decrease of 61 figure a2 this reiterates that cds are not effective in a catchment with very low rainfall in dry years little runoff to capture and low storage aquifers meaning limited carry over storage however on the other hand an argument can be made that increased production in normal and wet years supported by cds outweighs the losses in dry years this suggest that rather than looking at productivity in individual years the benefits of cds or recharge interventions in the area should be assessed by combining good years with bad years good rainfall years allow farmers to make higher profits from increased capture of rainfall and address tide over losses from dry years which remain as bad or worse as the pre mar situation more research and analysis are needed to ascertain these aspects the narrative also points towards the need for better understanding the benefits and tradeoffs of mar in these environments our results suggests that though cd came up in response to a drought they are not necessarily efficient in drought proofing 5 5 uncertainties in this analysis and future research needs the simple method applied in this study with clearly defined assumptions and accounting for major factors is able to progress the assessment of the impact of high density cd development on climate resilience of agriculture in saurashtra with implications for similar regions elsewhere there are two major sources of uncertainty in the analysis a reliability and inherent errors in the data used and b methodological assumptions and simplifications made agricultural data crop area irrigated area and irrigation source in gujarat and in india more broadly is primarily derived from government reported annual agricultural statistics which are collected bottom up from the village scale and then aggregated to higher administrative levels through random sample surveys of 20 of the villages during each crop season in a state and is then further cross checked through random sampling ministry of statistics and programme implementation 2018 planning commission 2001 similarly crop yield data are collected through crop cutting experiments in randomly selected fields and then cross checked however being a manual survey process errors can result from 1 non reporting of crops sown predominant error 2 incorrect area entered for the crop or 3 non reporting of the crop actually sown in the field ministry of statistics and programme implementation 2018 data for 2015 16 at the national scale in india shows that the error mismatch of information identified in cross checking was 9 25 in different seasons for crop area 9 for irrigation data annual and 5 10 for yields cotton and groundnut ministry of statistics and programme implementation 2018 despite these errors the absence of other annually available and long term collected data makes this the primary source of data used extensively in agricultural and water resources research sidhu et al 2022 and contributes to data for many global datasets e g siebert et al 2010 similarly data on groundwater levels is collected by the central ground water board cgwb four times each year january may august and november by field personnel covering an extensive national monitoring well network cgwb 2015 the cgwb data has again been used extensively by researchers over many years as this represents the main source of groundwater data in india e g hora et al 2019 asoka et al 2017 bhanja et al 2017 however this data has gaps and outliers and is often sparse these issues are usually addressed by removing outliers and monitoring wells with missing data above a threshold as was done in this study asoka et al 2017 bhanja et al 2017 however hora et al 2019 found that this may lead to bias so called survivor bias where dried wells often missing data may lead to better picture of the aquifer than is actually the case other sources of data such as grace satellite data couldn t be used due to the small spatial scale of the catchment daily rainfall is taken from imd gridded datasets and again has been used extensively asoka et al 2017 kumar singh et al 2019 imd gridded data is derived from using records of 7000 rain gauge stations pai et al 2014 multiple studies evaluating the performance of available rainfall products have shown that the imd data performs satisfactorily over indian monsoon conditions pai et al 2014 kumar singh et al 2019 thus while we have used the best available data in some cases the only source and published data sources table 1 which have been used extensively they come with inherent uncertainties which have a bearing on the results this analysis required making certain methodological assumptions and simplifications as have been documented in section 3 one limitation is that the method applied assumes that changes in annual yields primarily results from changes in ground water availability whereas moving average of yields captures changes resulting from improvement in inputs e g better seeds fertilizers better wells and pumps etc however the other factors e g heat waves cold waves pest attacks can still add to yield variability and couldn t be accounted for also we donot consider irrigation efficiency with the assumption that irrigation return flows are completely recyclable additionally while we have considered potential recharge by check dams there is a need for further research to ascertain plausible upstream downstream tradeoffs due to the same as effects of flows captured in upstream areas potentially negatively impacts downstream communities calder et al 2008 ribeiro neto et al 2022 nune et al 2014 similarly lumped catchment assessment ignores the distribution both spatial and social of impacts and there is a need to assess how socially equitable the benefits have been for example there are concerns that cd impacts are concentrated near structures in low lying areas shah et al 2021 and that farmers with more financial and social capital benefit the most bouma et al 2011 calder et al 2008 this requires setting up more comprehensive hydrological assessments capturing catchment water balance and more explicit inclusion of surface groundwater dynamics along with socioeconomic field data the latter is also critical to determine the drivers and impacts of increase in demand further research is also needed to assess how these structures will work under the realities of climate change where extreme events are expected to increase mukherjee et al 2018 6 conclusions managed aquifer recharge mar through various interventions including cds is increasingly being promoted and adopted for sustainable groundwater use and resilience building to dry periods and droughts our study analyzed the case of high density cd development in the saurashtra region of gujarat india results considering rainfall variability and crop irrigation water demand show that counter to assumptions of cds being a strong measure to alleviate the impacts of droughts their capability is highly restricted in dry years and especially under scenarios of possibly accompanying increasing water demand this is because there is limited runoff to capture and recharge and the underlying aquifer has low storage capacity that is replenished and depleted annually with limited carry over storage the study shows that irrigation water demand has increased significantly and outstripped the increase in recharge from cds thus with limited runoff in dry years low groundwater storage and increasing demand these interventions may not be very effective in securing irrigation water supplies and may not necessarily lead to long term climate resilience for good rainfall years increased recharge via cds does increase supply but can only partially compensate for the increased demand of the kharif season indicating that overall reduction of irrigated areas and flexible annual adjustment to rainfall in the wet season and adjustment to groundwater storage in the dry season are required these findings suggest that mar unless complemented by greater emphasis on water demand management and groundwater governance may not suffice as a standalone solution to achieving sustainable groundwater and concurrently expanding food production in hydrogeological and climatic settings like in gujarat india additionally irrigated agriculture needs to be flexible and adaptable to prevailing climate and groundwater storage conditions there is a need for clear communication and realistic assessment and expectation of the potential benefits of recharge interventions in regions with limited aquifer storage and highly variable runoff while also ensuring that basic water needs are not sacrificed in the quest for increased food production funding this research was made possible

7806,study region qira oasis a typical catchment alluvial fan composed by agriculture and natural shrubs at the south margin of taklimakan desert china study focus water management modeling involves causal interaction effects of various water related ecosystem services ess under multiple criteria water management alternatives measuring expected benefits of water related ess many multi criteria decision tools have been developed to mitigate some of major challenges of ess tradeoffs however few formal es trade off frameworks have focused on the multiple criteria alternatives assessment and indifference point identifications of water related es this paper proposes a causal structure based multiple criteria decision framework to model water related ess and to detect the points where the decision makers would be indifferent between two alternatives and to compare with the optimum recommendation value using bayesian networks bns with analytic hierarchy process ahp new hydrological insights for the region the study confirms that the proposed causal structure based multiple criteria decision framework is a promising approach to modeling possible climate irrigation and water policy scenarios and to examining influences of those scenarios on water related ess the framework can be used to effectively recommend optimum water management alternatives and to identify the indifference points by combining bns into ahp under stakeholder participation the framework also provides a qualitative and quantitative assessment to reduce the conflicts and uncertainties of multiple criteria weights in diagnosing water related es trade offs owing to different stakeholder preferences graphical abstract ga1 keywords water related ess multiple criteria decision making

to the well being of humans has received broad scale public recognition in ecosystem management millennium ecosystem assessment 2005 egoh et al 2007 remme et al 2021 maintaining the components and functions of ecosystems have become necessary to ensure the provision of ecosystem services at present and in the future egoh et al 2008 shackelford et al 2019 with the complexity of the ess including both tangible and intangible services the ecosystem management strategies need to combine biophysical eco environmental socioeconomic cultural and political factors into the recommendations decision making processes and implementation of the decisions while involving the interests of stakeholders carmona et al 2011 kragt et al 2011 mamitimin et al 2015 in such numerous factors water is essential in meeting the demands of both humans and the health of ecosystems pimentel et al 2004 bakker 2012 liu et al 2013 as human requirements for water increase the water related ess become more valuable brauman et al 2007 the water related ess are often defined as the benefits obtained from ecosystems for which ecosystem composition structure and function depend on a supply of water schmalz et al 2015 chang and bonnette 2016 chen et al 2018 luo et al 2021 water management has moved toward the governance of water related ess from previous comprehensive multi purpose basin management especially in arid regions cook and spray 2012 therefore the management of water related ess creates an opportunity to fill a vacuum by merging es into integrated water management systems iwrm cook and spray 2012 xue et al 2017b numerous qualitative and quantitative process based modeling on ess supporting sustainable water management has been conducted daily et al 2009 landuyt et al 2013 barton et al 2020 according to many researchers the water related ess managements are typically complex multidisciplinary and multiple criteria decision making issues involving uncertainty watthayu and peng 2004 kragt 2009 2010 while the multiple criteria decision making solutions are classified into deterministic and stochastic categories they depend on whether considering the uncertainty due to nonlinear and tedious restrictive conditions it is often difficult to obtain unique solution and to consider the uncertainty in the deterministic type such as system dynamics dynamic programming approaches and pattern oriented models carmona et al 2011 majumder 2015 blair and buytaert 2016 the stochastic decision approaches are the most suitable way in representing uncertainty based on probability theory pearl 1988 recently bayesian networks bns as stochastically probabilistic approach has attracted considerable attention in ess modeling and iwrm landuyt et al 2013 xue et al 2017b due to their better characteristics including 1 possessing high flexibility and transparency 2 treating multivariable complexity and uncertainty 3 incorporating qualitative and quantitative data 4 allowing stakeholder participation and 5 updating and improving the model structures and parameters when new knowledge or data become available bns have been widely applied to support multi criteria decision analysis in many fields including water management carmona et al 2013 coastal ecosystem evaluation gawne et al 2012 lehikoinen et al 2014 urban planning langemeyer et al 2020 guo et al 2020 and diagnosis of hydropower production peng et al 2018 barton et al 2016 2020 especially bns as an effective multi criteria decision analysis tool has continuously appeared in the field of ess management in the freshwater systems shenton et al 2010 barton et al 2020 the bns have been verified with a considerable capacity and superiority via probabilistic rather than deterministic interpretations between variables in ess modeling and water resources management decisions smith et al 2011 chan and pollino 2012 kelly et al 2013 due to defective system understanding and difficult parameterization the stakeholder participation plays a key role in bns modeling and exchange of knowledge carmona et al 2013 bertone et al 2016 dean 2020 dai et al 2021 effectively eliciting inputs judgments and view acceptance in multi criteria decision analysis heli et al 2019 to date the numerous bn models have successfully been used to multi criteria decision analysis by coupling ess into iwrm siew and d√∂ll 2012 han saem et al 2015 xue et al 2017b but it is difficult to evaluate trade offs and decisions involving the selection of the best alternatives across management objectives using bns under uncertain environments the benefits of water related ess are multiple criteria trade offs and optimization problems which need to evaluate the management objectives from a series of alternatives watthayu and peng 2004 valipour et al 2014 despite the relationship between benefits of ess and water management decision making can be carried out in the bns modeling based on raw data the model results stakeholder opinion or expert knowledge the existing approaches frameworks are not well performed to achieve the trade offs and optimization between the multiple criteria expected benefits of water related ess via involving stakeholder participation using bns recently to address the multiple criteria ess trade offs and optimization problems many multi criteria decision approaches have been developed the multiple attribute utility theory outranking approaches and compensatory methods are main categories of multi criteria decision making due to their ease of implementation watthayu and peng 2004 majumder 2015 marttunen et al 2019 krainyk et al 2021 wotlolan et al 2021 while the multiple attribute utility theory can address the nonlinear nature of certain attributes this method is not appropriate for trade offs between characteristics of alternatives with more than three or four criteria saarikoski et al 2016 hallouin et al 2016 the outranking approaches e g electre roy 1991 and compensatory methods e g ahp saaty 2008 allow qualitative and quantitative criteria to assess the trade offs of certain criteria but they are difficult to be applicable in uncertainty situations saarikoski et al 2016 encouragingly a hybrid approach combining bns with ahp is considered as an ideal means with which to recommend decision alternatives options dealing with several criteria that may be conflicting and more uncertain park et al 2015 ahp overcomes weight trade off issue of several conflicting criteria in multiple criteria bns modeling owing to different expert or stakeholder preferences while bns can model uncertainty resulting from multiple criteria quantification in ahp criteria weights via the conditional probability tables barton et al 2020 the hybrid approach has largely been used in the defining tourists preferences papiƒá blagojeviƒá et al 2012 tourist attractions huang and bian 2009 reliability analysis zubair 2014 mobile information recommendation park et al 2015 recently many multi criteria decision analysis tools have been provided as effectively methodological framework to allow stakeholders for mitigating some of the major challenges of ess tradeoffs langemeyer et al 2016 2018 mustajoki et al 2020 while the iterative participatory processes with stakeholders and decision makers are complement for feedbacks in the iterative model development calibration and verification chan et al 2010 few formal causal structure based multiple criteria trade offs frameworks to date have been proposed to focus on water related ess modeling and assessment using bns with ahp under stakeholder participation moreover the indifference points i e points of subjective equality or skiba points are defined to detect the points where the decision makers would be indifferent between two alternatives friedlob and ramsay 1986 scott and antonsson 2000 wagener 2003 and to compare with the optimum recommendation value the identification of indifference points is however often lacking oasis is a type non zonal landscape supported by natural or artificial inland rivers in arid desert environment liu et al 2018 the competition for water demands between artificial oasis ecosystems e g agricultural land and urban system and natural oasis ecosystems e g desert vegetation and riparian forests has drastically been aggravated by a lack of coordination regarding water allocation conflicts between the two in the face of water use competition between eco environmental protection and sustainable socioeconomic development in the oasis regions the adaptive management approaches e g scenario based modeling and bayesian networks and more effective mathematical models e g oasis dissipative hydrological model have widely used to allocate water use between natural and artificial oasis ecosystems zhao et al 2005 lei et al 2006 xue et al 2017a b however the trade offs and optimization of oasis water resources are impacted by the multiple criteria decisions of ecosystem management options and the uncertainty involved therefore a more effective multiple criteria decision tool is urgently needed to implement such multidisciplinary problems in the oasis regions this paper aims to propose a causal structure based multiple criteria decision framework combining bns with an ahp model to show how trade offs optimizations and recommendations between water management alternatives and the expected benefits of water related ess can be operationalized with stakeholder participation the case application is conducted in the qira oasis of south edge of taklimakan desert northwest china as a typical dry irrigation region the study area is facing severe conflicts between the demand for water by human activities and natural ecosystems owing to aggravating competition of water for agricultural domestic and industrial use in this paper the structure is given as following the causal structure based multiple criteria decision framework is first described by the characteristics of the water related ess next the study area used to test the proposed framework is described and then the bns model development ahp modeling and multiple criteria making decisions and recommendations are conducted furthermore we evaluate the validity of models analyze the response of optimization variables to the alternative water management strategies and discuss the uncertainties and possible further modeling in water related ess management finally the conclusions and the future work are presented 2 causal structure based multiple criteria decision framework the proposed causal structure based multiple criteria decision framework for trade offs optimization and recommendations for different alternative water management systems and the expected benefits of water related ess consists of three steps fig 1 1 participatory bns modeling based on an analysis of water related ess 2 multiple criteria decision analysis using bns with ahp and 3 decision making and recommendations under different water management alternatives in the multiple criteria decision framework the bns are used to model the expected benefits of water related ess under the water management alternatives whereas the ahp approach is applied to assess the trade offs optimization and recommendations across management alternatives through criteria weight assignments 2 1 participatory bns modeling based on water related ess analysis bns have been known as valuable tools with which to handle the complex and uncertain issues in environmental modeling mccann et al 2006 uusitalo 2007 they can be used to assess the synergistic effects of various disturbances in the decision making process ayre and landis 2012 and to evaluate the management strategies used in building the decision support system cain 2001 papiƒáblagojeviƒá nata≈°a et al 2012 a bn is a multivariate causal model comprised of three elements bromley et al 2005 shenton et al 2010 a set of variables nodes representing the system a set of links describing the cause effect relationship conditional dependence between the variables and a set of probabilities measuring the belief of conditional dependence between the linking variables the three elements can be defined by two major elements aguilera et al 2011 1 the qualitative structure a directed acyclic graph dag that is built by a set of variables and links representing the cause effect relationships and 2 quantitative inference conditional probability tables cpts quantified by a set of probabilities measuring the belief of conditional dependence the procedures involved in developing the bns in modeling environmental systems are pollino and henderson 2010 ayre and landis 2012 1 identifying the objective of the model 2 building a dag with relevant variables and links 3 assigning states to the variables 4 specifying the prior probabilities in terms of cpts 5 assessing the model performance using sensitivity analysis or expert knowledge and 6 inferencing and updating the model with new data or evidence if a set of variables are x x 1 x 2 x n in the bns modeling of an environmental system then the joint distribution is equal to the product of all the conditional distributions attached to each variable the statistical expression is written as 1 p x 1 x 2 x n i n p x i p a x i x 1 x 2 x n œÜ x 1 œÜ x 2 œÜ x n where p x 1 x 2 x n stands for the joint distribution of variables x x 1 x 2 x n pa x i represents the parent variables of variable x i and œÜ x i refers to the set of all possible values of variable x i each marginal distribution can be calculated by the joint distribution in eq 1 there is no need to determine the joint distribution itself the conditional distribution can be estimated by efficient algorithms experimental or field data process based model results or the elicited beliefs of experts madsen and jensen 1999 borsuk et al 2006 wang et al 2009 active involvement and negotiation by public participation can flexibly transparently and effectively reach a common perspective in decision making processes lynam et al 2007 carmona et al 2011 bns have been widely used as participatory modeling tools in environmental modeling and ultimately achieve a visual explanation of reality under public participation lynam et al 2007 reed 2008 this study first identifies the water related ess and then analyzes the trade off and synergy between different users of water and the expected benefits of water related ess a participatory bn model is developed by what if analysis between the different water management alternatives and the expected benefits of water related ess to implement the scenario analysis 2 2 multiple criteria decision analysis using bns with ahp ahp first proposed by saaty 1977 is a useful model with which to solve multi criteria decision issues and has been applied in numerous research fields such as planning selecting a best alternative and resource allocation and conflict resolution zubair 2014 the ahp conducts the decision making problems through a hierarchical structure with a limited number usually four or five of levels saaty 1980 jablonsky 2005 the first level sets a key goal for the multiple criteria decision issues whereas the last level is the decision alternatives or scenarios the levels between the first and last level are usually the criteria of the decision problems moreover the secondary goal and sub criteria are basic elements involved in the ahp structure saaty 1994 papiƒáblagojeviƒá nata≈°a et al 2012 fig 2 the process of multi criteria decision making in the ahp model is carried out using following four steps saaty 1994 park et al 2015 structuring the ahp hierarchy making a pairwise comparison of each alternative to obtain the judgmental matrix computing the weights of alternatives and conducting decision making with calculated weights the pairwise comparison matrix obtaining a priority vector is an important task in these four steps each value in the matrix is defined by the relative importance value shown in table 1 after a questionnaire survey or expert judgment saaty 1994 papiƒáblagojeviƒá nata≈°a et al 2012 park et al 2015 2 a a i j n n a 11 a 12 a 1 n a 21 a 22 a 2 n a n 1 a n 2 a n n where a represents the pairwise comparison matrix and a ij is the relative importance value in the i th row and j th column 3 a i j 1 a j i a j i 0 i j 1 2 n with respect to the pairwise comparison matrix the weighting coefficients can be obtained by determining the principal eigenvector of comparison matrix liang et al 2017 4 a 11 a 12 a 1 n a 21 a 22 a 2 n a n 1 a n 2 a n n w 1 w 2 w n Œª m a x w 1 w 2 w n where w max w 1 w 2 w n t is the maximal eigenvector of matrix a and Œª max is the maximal eigenvalue of matrix a the weighting coefficient vector w i of indicator i can be calculated by normalization of the maximal eigenvector liang et al 2017 5 w i w i i 1 n w i if p ij is an inferred probability set of bn models with j states in i th criterion then the recommendation values of the alternatives can be determined by park et al 2015 6 r i j p i j w i where i is the criterion 1 2 n j is the states of variables 1 2 l l refers to the number of states of the i th criterion as a measure of the reliability of the results the goodness of judgment can be evaluated by the consistency radio c r in the ahp model the c r is determined by dividing the consistency index c i by the random index r i saaty 1990 bevilacqua and braglia 2000 the hierarchies in the ahp model are considered acceptable if c r 0 1 the main advantage of the ahp model is the use of pairwise comparisons to obtain the weights of the measurements by consulting the stakeholders managers decision makers or experts erdogan et al 2017 this study used an bn models with ahp model to determine the recommendation values based on the simulation results of the bns and the weight values of the ahp fig 3 the use of an ahp model overcomes a practically difficult issue in bns modeling in multiple criteria trade offs situations 2 3 decision making and recommendations of water management alternatives according to the recommendation values determined here the optimum value of the alternatives can be obtained by selecting the maximum recommended value park et al 2015 fig 3 7 r o p t i m a l v a l u e m a x i 1 2 n j 1 2 l r i j in this paper the largest r optimal value of all combinations of attributes is considered as the optimum recommendation value of the water management alternatives furthermore the indifference points are determined as halfway between this minimum accepted recommendation value of the alternative and the largest rejected recommendation value of the alternative by eq 6 caulkins et al 2015 3 study area the qira oasis is situated in the downstream of the qira river catchment of xinjiang northwest china and covers approximately 274 63 km2 80 43 e 80 53 e 36 57 n 37 05 n fig 4 it is a typical alluvial fan in which the agricultural and natural oases are the main landscape types bruelheide et al 2003 xue et al 2016 the qira oasis has an annual mean temperature of 11 9 c accumulated precipitation of 35 mm and pan evaporation of 2600 mm liu et al 2018 chang et al 2022 the water supply in the qira oasis relies on river runoff which is generated from glacier and or snow melt water as well as precipitation in the alpine valley of the kunlun mountains flows through the qira oasis and eventually pours into the arid taklimakan desert bruelheide et al 2003 xue et al 2017a its annual average runoff during 1985 2010 is 1 27 108 m3 extremely low precipitation strong evaporation and highly vulnerable ecosystems are the major characteristics of this desert bruelheide et al 2003 xue b et al 2017 agricultural oasis is the main land use type the natural oasis including riparian forests e g populus and dense shrubs e g tamarix and phragmites is chiefly distributed in the desert oasis ecotone which consists of semi shrubs and perennial herbaceous grasses e g calligonum tamarix chinensis and alhagi sparsifolia chang et al 2022 the ecosystems in the qira oasis are experiencing serious problems due to the over utilization of water for agricultural irrigation together with increasing demands for water for domestic and industrial use the excessive use of water for agricultural irrigation threatens the health of natural oasis ecosystems many ecological issues have emerged such as the deterioration of groundwater quality the degradation of riparian forests and desert shrubs and grasslands and lowering of the groundwater table that maintains the growth of the desert vegetation xue et al 2015 based on the principles of iwrm and ess together with a multiple criteria decision framework managing water resources is crucial for achieving sustainable water development and ecological security in terms of identifying reasonable water allocation and management strategies in a coordinated way hotan water resources 2013 liu et al 2018 xue et al 2017b the qira oasis was selected for study because it can be used as a universal case of many typical irrigation regions in which the ess face threats as a result of increasing competition of water for agricultural domestic industrial and ecological water uses worldwide especially in arid regions in addition a key consideration is that the data in the study area can easily obtained with the support of the cele national station of observation and research for desert grassland ecosystems of the chinese academy of sciences 4 model development and description 4 1 development of a participatory bn model the bn model was developed under public participation and underwent four recursive phases of 1 identifying the issues and cause effect variables 2 designing the casual loop diagram 3 implementing bn inferences or diagnosis and 4 evaluating the model robustness the participatory bn model was built to run from march 2015 to august 2016 table 2 the 28 participants in the qira oasis were classified into four groups researchers water management experts stakeholders and the water manager six departments the water conservancy bureau the agricultural bureau the meteorological bureau the forestry bureau the environmental protection bureau and the village committee were identified as the stakeholders every department stakeholder is adopted two representatives i e a head and a professional based on their well rounded understanding of the issues the policy maker and decision maker in qira oasis was the water manager at the qira water management institute which releases water management policies and plans six professional water management scientists were consulted in the model development data elicitation and verification the researchers offered the participants a water related ess background and obtained their feedbacks zorrilla et al 2010 xue et al 2017b the participatory bn model was constructed by face to face discussions and evaluations among stakeholders domain experts and water managers as well as researchers all the participants identified the variables states and their relationships while also defining the plausible structure of the bn model and eliciting sound specialized knowledge the quantitative data used to populate the cpts were collected from a variety of sources including the scientific literature monitoring hydrometeorological data socioeconomic data model results documentary databases government statistics and expert judgment the obtained data sources are divided into two types the quantifiable data such as hydrometeorological and socioeconomic data can be parameterized by em algorithm while the unquantifiable data such as water management policies and measures are obtained by expert assessment when building the bn structure the cpts are elicited to simulate the results via variable parameterization moreover the developed bn model was assessed and updated by the participants in the participatory process an integrated cause and effect structure of the bn was eventually built after achieving a consensus from all the participants fig 5 the final structure of the bn was presented in the netica software package with a total of 56 variables and 74 links fig 6 the structure of the bn model showed the flow of water via the water supply and demand analysis carried out in the qira oasis the seven end variables used as output variables presented the expected benefits of the water related ess the detailed development processes in the participatory bn model including the participatory process model construction data collection could be found in xue et al 2017b an explanation of each variable and the states representing it are described and given in table a1 of appendix 4 2 ahp modeling the ahp hierarchy structure was created as four levels fig 7 the top level was defined as the total objective of expected benefits maximization from water related ess the evaluation criteria which impact the total goal are set at the second level and are related to seven different aspects biodiversity grassland degradation land desertification groundwater safety agricultural income drinking water security and soil salinization these criteria are then divided into several sub criteria associated with water security factors at the third level including ecological water demands water for urban greenbelts water for man made shelterbelt spring irrigation the available agricultural water groundwater quality and groundwater depth the lowest level comprised 225 water management alternatives these alternatives were set as a combination of different management scenarios the weight coefficients of the decision alternatives were calculated by pairwise comparisons after the ahp hierarchy structure of decision making problems had been defined table 3 shows an example of the pairwise comparison matrix of criteria regarding the goal the comparison matrix of the sub criteria against the criteria and the comparison matrix of water management alternatives with respect to the sub criteria were quantified to optimize the water management alternatives the comparison matrix of the alternatives was defined at the same level of importance the 225 water management alternatives in the ahp hierarchical structure were a combination of different management scenarios these scenarios were defined as the assembly of states in the variables of the developed bn the variables included groundwater extraction three states groundwater quality three states ecological water demands five states and the irrigation quota five states 5 results and discussion 5 1 model validity to ensure their reliability and accuracy the bn and ahp models were validated by sensitivity analysis and degree of consistency respectively sensitivity analysis is considered as one of the more effective approaches to evaluating bn models charnley and engelbert 2005 kragt 2009 chan et at 2010 and is conducted to detect the sensitivity of the bn target variables to the input variables using mutual information rowe and frewer 2004 barton et al 2008 the seven variables for the expected benefits of water related es were defined as the target variables on which to carry out the sensitivity analysis the sensitivity results were verified with the reliability and reasonability reported by xue et al 2017b the knowledge of local experts and the judgment of stakeholder perspectives were used to evaluate the acceptability and plausibility of the modeling results these validities matched well with anecdotal evidence in the scientific literature in addition all the c r values for different criteria were 0 10 that is the consistency radio in the ahp is appropriate and it can be confirmed that the modeling results are reliable and acceptable 5 2 multiple criteria decision making and recommendations using bn with ahp the ahp model provided weight coefficients of 0 03 0 04 0 13 0 14 and 0 30 for biodiversity grassland degradation land desertification groundwater safety and agricultural income and weight coefficients of 0 33 and 0 04 for drinking water security and soil salinization respectively fig 8 drinking water security and agricultural income accounting for about 30 were larger weight coefficients in the expected benefits of water related ess according to the weight coefficients calculated in the sub criteria the groundwater quality groundwater depth and spring irrigation were the main criteria accounting for about 25 with respect to the water management alternatives since the government and managers in the study area pay more attention to ecological and agricultural water tradeoffs under groundwater security the groundwater extraction groundwater quality ecological water demands and irrigation quota are selected as the decision variables consequently a total of 225 scenarios were set to simulate the expected benefits of water related ess under the different state combinations of four water management variables fig 9 illustrated bn model simulation example with elicited cpts in combination of water management alternatives according to eq 6 the recommendation values were calculated as shown in fig 10 for example the recommendation value was 0 24 under the combination of 1 g l groundwater quality 9857 10 728 m3 ha irrigation quota 22 80 million m3 groundwater extraction and 40 29 ecological water demands in fig 10a the optimum alternatives are determined by assessing the maximum recommended values the baseline of maximum recommended value is defined as greater than 0 37 according to value differences the water management alternatives are recommended as the 12 scenarios which were determined by the different combinations of groundwater extraction groundwater quality ecological water demands and irrigation quota table 4 5 3 response of optimization variables to water management alternatives the impacts of water management alternatives on the optimization variables spring irrigation agricultural irrigation area man made shelterbelt area amount of agricultural irrigation water for man made shelterbelt water price standards and water saving efficiency were assessed the scenario simulations were conducted by testing the changes in the probability values in the states of each optimization variable under the different water management alternatives based on the recommendation values using the bn model with ahp the 15 scenarios were simulated to show the probability of changes in the optimization variables in the bn model the scenarios are easily examined by specifying the state of the water management alternatives fig 11 shows the probability variations of the optimization variables under different water management alternatives using the bn model with ahp the magnitude of probability variations describes the strength of the influence of different scenarios mamitimin et al 2015 although the effects of combinations among the different water management alternatives can alleviate water pressure and conflict at the spatio temporal scale spring irrigation is still insufficient with about a 45 chance for agricultural water demand in spring fig 11a the results imply that there is no efficient reservoir upstream in the qira river to store water for agricultural irrigation in spring this also verifies that the current water management alternatives are insufficient to completely meet the requirements of spring irrigation which comprises 35 of the annual agricultural water demand xue et al 2017b by contrast the areas of agricultural irrigation and man made shelterbelts have high increasing chances as the groundwater extraction and irrigation quotas increase fig 11b c for example 11 326 ha agricultural area and 3500 3850 ha man made shelterbelt area are higher than 10 10 and 30 00 respectively under 23 26 million m3 groundwater extraction 1 g l groundwater quality 58 75 ecological water demands and 10 728 12 128 m3 ha irrigation quota compared with the a priori condition this also results in an increase of probability in the agricultural irrigation quantity and the amount of water for man made shelterbelt fig 9f g for instance 27 168 thousand m3 water for man made shelterbelt is higher than 48 8 under 23 26 million m3 groundwater extraction 1 g l groundwater quality 58 75 ecological water demand and 10 728 12 128 m3 ha irrigation quota compared with the a priori condition however the increase in the agricultural irrigation quantity and water for man made shelterbelt leads to a significant decrease of probability in the water price standard and water saving efficiency fig 9d e 0 02 rmb m3 water price standard and 0 43 water saving efficiency were 4 40 and 26 respectively under 23 26 million m3 groundwater extraction 1 g l groundwater quality 58 75 ecological water demands and 10 728 12 128 m3 ha irrigation quota compared with the a priori condition this shows that a low irrigation water price and water saving efficiencies affect the cost of water and pressure on water use in the arid qira oasis 5 4 uncertainties and further modeling for water related ess although the bn model can effectively cope with the uncertainties in the ess modeling poppenborg and koellner 2014 and ahp provides reliable recommendations for water management alternatives in multiple criteria decision making park et al 2015 various uncertainties exist in the proposed multiple criteria decision framework assessments due to the complex relationships in water related ess modeling these uncertainties result from the combined effects of the inherent variations in water supply conflicts in water use water saving practices and water management policy based on the principle of maximum recommended values four water management alternatives are optimum the first alternative is 22 80 million m3 groundwater extraction 1 g l groundwater quality 58 75 ecological water demands and 10 728 12 128 m3 ha irrigation quota recommended value for 0 40 this recommendation chases the groundwater extraction and irrigation quota as little as possible after meeting the demands of the groundwater quality and ecological water demands the second alternative is 22 80 million m3 groundwater extraction 1 g l groundwater quality 58 75 ecological water demands and 12 128 m3 ha irrigation quota recommended value for 0 42 this recommendation chases the groundwater extraction as little as possible and gives an adequate irrigation quota after meeting the demands of groundwater quality and ecological water demands the third alternative is 22 80 23 26 million m3 groundwater extraction 1 g l groundwater quality 58 75 ecological water demands and 10 728 12 128 m3 ha irrigation quota recommended value for 0 41 this recommendation chases the moderate groundwater extraction and irrigation quota after meeting the demands of groundwater quality and ecological water demands the fourth alternative is 22 80 23 26 million m3 groundwater extraction 1 g l groundwater quality 58 75 ecological water demands and 12 128 m3 ha irrigation quota recommended value for 0 43 this recommendation chases the moderate groundwater extraction and irrigation quota adequately after meeting the demands of groundwater quality and ecological water demands according to the definition of the indifference points or skiba points the alternative of 22 80 million m3 groundwater extraction 1 g l groundwater quality 40 29 50 84 the ecological water demands and 9857 10 728 m3 ha irrigation quota recommended value for 0 27 and the alternative of 22 80 million m3 groundwater extraction 1 g l groundwater quality 50 84 53 48 ecological water demands and 8142 9857 m3 ha irrigation quota recommended value for 0 27 this reflects that low ecological water demand is indifferent between two alternatives in the decision of managers furthermore the alternative of 22 80 23 26 million m3 groundwater extraction 1 g l groundwater quality 40 29 50 84 ecological water demands and 9857 10 728 m3 ha irrigation quota recommended value for 0 27 and the alternative of 22 80 23 26 million m3 groundwater extraction 1 g l groundwater quality 50 84 53 48 ecological water demands and 8142 9857 m3 ha irrigation quota recommended value for 0 27 this implies that the medium groundwater extraction indifferent between two alternatives in general the decision makers would be indifferent intermediate level of recommended values between two alternatives which can shift the skiba point in such a way that the optimal recommended value will be reached this also verifies the existence of skiba point in ecosystem service modeling friedlob and ramsay 1986 scott and antonsson 2000 wagener 2003 caulkins et al 2015 with agricultural water use accounting for 97 7 of the total water supply in this arid oasis xue et al 2017a improving the efficiency of water use via water saving measures is crucial in alleviating conflicts over water in regional sustainable development therefore to save the water currently used for agricultural irrigation for other water requirements particularly the ecological water demands the third optimum alternative is more suitable for the current study area although an increase in the price of water can improve the efficiency of agricultural water use mamitimin et al 2015 additional adjustments e g upgrading the irrigation system reducing water losses from leakage applying advanced irrigation techniques and agricultural policies such as economic compensation can effectively improve the water management alternatives for sustainable development pang et al 2014 xue et al 2017b instead of deriving a final optimum result from the multiple criteria decision making process the objective of this study is to propose a generalizable assessment framework to develop a water related ess model to support multiple criteria decisions in water management systems particularly in arid and semiarid regions this framework provides a flexible and objective evaluation method allowing the integration of additional knowledge and data into the assessment using the hybrid approach of ahp and bn however some important issues remain unresolved the structures of the bn model are hierarchical and acyclic this is an important weakness of bn in environmental and ecosystem services modeling mechanistically and dynamically landuyt et al 2013 numerous studies have pointed out that the absence of feedback loops is a restriction of bn model uusitalo 2007 aguilera et al 2011 according to aguilera et al 2011 and landuyt et al 2013 the bn model to combine multiple other models is better potential to handle the feedback issue of environmental modeling under stakeholder participations this study developed the bn model combined with ahp under stakeholder participations considering the feedbacks in model development this process is embodied in the iterative participations chan et al 2010 such hierarchical decision making processes have widely been accepted in environmental and ecosystem services modeling around the world such as groundwater management in denmark henriksen 2010 catchment based water resource management in the kongulai catchment of australia chan et al 2010 ecosystem services modeling in the haean watershed of germany poppenborg and koellner 2014 regional water resources management in guadiana basin of spain and estuarine dynamics in the neuse river estuary in north carolina of america alameddine et al 2011 despite the participatory bn development combined with ahp is strictly conducted by iterative participatory feedback processes the spatial and temporal variations were not considered in the water related ess modeling to support feedback loops in the temporal or spatial dynamics either additional variables separate casual networks for each temporal and spatial state the integration of other models into bn modeling or the time sliced model i e dynamic bayesian network are more suitable and acceptable for further study uusitalo 2007 pollino and henderson 2010 duespohl et al 2012 castelletti and soncini sessa 2007 6 conclusions this paper proposes a causal structure based multiple criteria decision framework illustrating how the hybrid approaches of ahp and bn can be used to model water related es and to identify the indifference points the proposed framework in this paper comprises three steps 1 bns modeling based on water related ess analysis 2 multiple criteria decision analysis using bns with ahp and 3 decision making and the recommendation of water management alternatives the bn model builds multiple water related ess in decision making contexts providing a flexible and powerful tool for ess modeling and scenario analysis the ahp model is used to identify the relative importance of each decision making criterion the weighted values of the expected benefits of water related ess are quantified to cope with multi criteria decision making that involves trade offs and optimization among various ess the case analysis in the qira oasis of northwest china confirmed that the proposed multiple criteria decision framework combining the bn into an ahp model is a promising approach with which to model ess and to recommend optimum water management alternatives the proposed framework is particularly well suited for detecting the points where the decision makers would be indifferent between two alternatives and to compare with the optimum recommendation value by modeling the expected benefits of water related ess the use of transdisciplinary approaches combining bn models into an ahp model allows for trade offs optimization and recommendations between multiple and conflicting decision alternatives in an uncertain environment the framework is considered as an effective tool providing a qualitative and quantitative assessment method that improves the disadvantage of each approach and can solve transdisciplinary and multiple criteria decision issues it is not limited to the ess modeling in multiple criteria decision making to make the multiple criteria decision framework more plausible and reliable further work needs to consider the spatial and temporal variations in water related ess modeling compliance with ethical standards na credit authorship

causal interaction effects of various water related ecosystem services ess under multiple criteria water management alternatives measuring expected benefits of water related ess many multi criteria decision tools have been developed to mitigate some of major challenges of ess tradeoffs however few formal es trade off frameworks have focused on the multiple criteria alternatives assessment and indifference point identifications of water related es this paper proposes a causal structure based multiple criteria decision framework to model water related ess and to detect the points where the decision makers would be indifferent between two alternatives and to compare with the optimum recommendation value using bayesian networks bns with analytic hierarchy process ahp new hydrological insights for the region the study confirms that the proposed causal structure based multiple criteria decision framework is a promising approach to modeling possible climate irrigation and water policy scenarios and to examining influences of those scenarios on water related ess the framework can be used to effectively recommend optimum water management alternatives and to identify the indifference points by combining bns into ahp under stakeholder participation the framework also provides a qualitative and quantitative assessment to reduce the conflicts and uncertainties of

to the well being of humans has received broad scale public recognition in ecosystem management millennium ecosystem assessment 2005 egoh et al 2007 remme et al 2021 maintaining the components and functions of ecosystems have become necessary to ensure the provision of ecosystem services at present and in the future egoh et al 2008 shackelford et al 2019 with the complexity of the ess including both tangible and intangible services the ecosystem management strategies need to combine biophysical eco environmental socioeconomic cultural and political factors into the recommendations decision making processes and implementation of the decisions while involving the interests of stakeholders carmona et al 2011 kragt et al 2011 mamitimin et al 2015 in such numerous factors water is essential in meeting the demands of both humans and the health of ecosystems pimentel et al 2004 bakker 2012 liu et al 2013 as human requirements for water increase the water related ess become more valuable brauman et al 2007 the water related ess are often defined as the benefits obtained from ecosystems for which ecosystem composition structure and function depend on a supply of water schmalz et al 2015 chang and bonnette 2016 chen et al 2018 luo et al 2021 water management has moved toward the governance of water related ess from previous comprehensive multi purpose basin management especially in arid regions cook and spray 2012 therefore the management of water related ess creates an opportunity to fill a vacuum by merging es into integrated water management systems iwrm cook and spray 2012 xue et al 2017b numerous qualitative and quantitative process based modeling on ess supporting sustainable water management has been conducted daily et al 2009 landuyt et al 2013 barton et al 2020 according to many researchers the water related ess managements are typically complex multidisciplinary and multiple criteria decision making issues involving uncertainty watthayu and peng 2004 kragt 2009 2010 while the multiple criteria decision making solutions are classified into deterministic and stochastic categories they depend on whether considering the uncertainty due to nonlinear and tedious restrictive conditions it is often difficult to obtain unique solution and to consider the uncertainty in the deterministic type such as system dynamics dynamic programming approaches and pattern oriented models carmona et al 2011 majumder 2015 blair and buytaert 2016 the stochastic decision approaches are the most suitable way in representing uncertainty based on probability theory pearl 1988 recently bayesian networks bns as stochastically probabilistic approach has attracted considerable attention in ess modeling and iwrm landuyt et al 2013 xue et al 2017b due to their better characteristics including 1 possessing high flexibility and transparency 2 treating multivariable complexity and uncertainty 3 incorporating qualitative and quantitative data 4 allowing stakeholder participation and 5 updating and improving the model structures and parameters when new knowledge or data become available bns have been widely applied to support multi criteria decision analysis in many fields including water management carmona et al 2013 coastal ecosystem evaluation gawne et al 2012 lehikoinen et al 2014 urban planning langemeyer et al 2020 guo et al 2020 and diagnosis of hydropower production peng et al 2018 barton et al 2016 2020 especially bns as an effective multi criteria decision analysis tool has continuously appeared in the field of ess management in the freshwater systems shenton et al 2010 barton et al 2020 the bns have been verified with a considerable capacity and superiority via probabilistic rather than deterministic interpretations between variables in ess modeling and water resources management decisions smith et al 2011 chan and pollino 2012 kelly et al 2013 due to defective system understanding and difficult parameterization the stakeholder participation plays a key role in bns modeling and exchange of knowledge carmona et al 2013 bertone et al 2016 dean 2020 dai et al 2021 effectively eliciting inputs judgments and view acceptance in multi criteria decision analysis heli et al 2019 to date the numerous bn models have successfully been used to multi criteria decision analysis by coupling ess into iwrm siew and d√∂ll 2012 han saem et al 2015 xue et al 2017b but it is difficult to evaluate trade offs and decisions involving the selection of the best alternatives across management objectives using bns under uncertain environments the benefits of water related ess are multiple criteria trade offs and optimization problems which need to evaluate the management objectives from a series of alternatives watthayu and peng 2004 valipour et al 2014 despite the relationship between benefits of ess and water management decision making can be carried out in the bns modeling based on raw data the model results stakeholder opinion or expert knowledge the existing approaches frameworks are not well performed to achieve the trade offs and optimization between the multiple criteria expected benefits of water related ess via involving stakeholder participation using bns recently to address the multiple criteria ess trade offs and optimization problems many multi criteria decision approaches have been developed the multiple attribute utility theory outranking approaches and compensatory methods are main categories of multi criteria decision making due to their ease of implementation watthayu and peng 2004 majumder 2015 marttunen et al 2019 krainyk et al 2021 wotlolan et al 2021 while the multiple attribute utility theory can address the nonlinear nature of certain attributes this method is not appropriate for trade offs between characteristics of alternatives with more than three or four criteria saarikoski et al 2016 hallouin et al 2016 the outranking approaches e g electre roy 1991 and compensatory methods e g ahp saaty 2008 allow qualitative and quantitative criteria to assess the trade offs of certain criteria but they are difficult to be applicable in uncertainty situations saarikoski et al 2016 encouragingly a hybrid approach combining bns with ahp is considered as an ideal means with which to recommend decision alternatives options dealing with several criteria that may be conflicting and more uncertain park et al 2015 ahp overcomes weight trade off issue of several conflicting criteria in multiple criteria bns modeling owing to different expert or stakeholder preferences while bns can model uncertainty resulting from multiple criteria quantification in ahp criteria weights via the conditional probability tables barton et al 2020 the hybrid approach has largely been used in the defining tourists preferences papiƒá blagojeviƒá et al 2012 tourist attractions huang and bian 2009 reliability analysis zubair 2014 mobile information recommendation park et al 2015 recently many multi criteria decision analysis tools have been provided as effectively methodological framework to allow stakeholders for mitigating some of the major challenges of ess tradeoffs langemeyer et al 2016 2018 mustajoki et al 2020 while the iterative participatory processes with stakeholders and decision makers are complement for feedbacks in the iterative model development calibration and verification chan et al 2010 few formal causal structure based multiple criteria trade offs frameworks to date have been proposed to focus on water related ess modeling and assessment using bns with ahp under stakeholder participation moreover the indifference points i e points of subjective equality or skiba points are defined to detect the points where the decision makers would be indifferent between two alternatives friedlob and ramsay 1986 scott and antonsson 2000 wagener 2003 and to compare with the optimum recommendation value the identification of indifference points is however often lacking oasis is a type non zonal landscape supported by natural or artificial inland rivers in arid desert environment liu et al 2018 the competition for water demands between artificial oasis ecosystems e g agricultural land and urban system and natural oasis ecosystems e g desert vegetation and riparian forests has drastically been aggravated by a lack of coordination regarding water allocation conflicts between the two in the face of water use competition between eco environmental protection and sustainable socioeconomic development in the oasis regions the adaptive management approaches e g scenario based modeling and bayesian networks and more effective mathematical models e g oasis dissipative hydrological model have widely used to allocate water use between natural and artificial oasis ecosystems zhao et al 2005 lei et al 2006 xue et al 2017a b however the trade offs and optimization of oasis water resources are impacted by the multiple criteria decisions of ecosystem management options and the uncertainty involved therefore a more effective multiple criteria decision tool is urgently needed to implement such multidisciplinary problems in the oasis regions this paper aims to propose a causal structure based multiple criteria decision framework combining bns with an ahp model to show how trade offs optimizations and recommendations between water management alternatives and the expected benefits of water related ess can be operationalized with stakeholder participation the case application is conducted in the qira oasis of south edge of taklimakan desert northwest china as a typical dry irrigation region the study area is facing severe conflicts between the demand for water by human activities and natural ecosystems owing to aggravating competition of water for agricultural domestic and industrial use in this paper the structure is given as following the causal structure based multiple criteria decision framework is first described by the characteristics of the water related ess next the study area used to test the proposed framework is described and then the bns model development ahp modeling and multiple criteria making decisions and recommendations are conducted furthermore we evaluate the validity of models analyze the response of optimization variables to the alternative water management strategies and discuss the uncertainties and possible further modeling in water related ess management finally the conclusions and the future work are presented 2 causal structure based multiple criteria decision framework the proposed causal structure based multiple criteria decision framework for trade offs optimization and recommendations for different alternative water management systems and the expected benefits of water related ess consists of three steps fig 1 1 participatory bns modeling based on an analysis of water related ess 2 multiple criteria decision analysis using bns with ahp and 3 decision making and recommendations under different water management alternatives in the multiple criteria decision framework the bns are used to model the expected benefits of water related ess under the water management alternatives whereas the ahp approach is applied to assess the trade offs optimization and recommendations across management alternatives through criteria weight assignments 2 1 participatory bns modeling based on water related ess analysis bns have been known as valuable tools with which to handle the complex and uncertain issues in environmental modeling mccann et al 2006 uusitalo 2007 they can be used to assess the synergistic effects of various disturbances in the decision making process ayre and landis 2012 and to evaluate the management strategies used in building the decision support system cain 2001 papiƒáblagojeviƒá nata≈°a et al 2012 a bn is a multivariate causal model comprised of three elements bromley et al 2005 shenton et al 2010 a set of variables nodes representing the system a set of links describing the cause effect relationship conditional dependence between the variables and a set of probabilities measuring the belief of conditional dependence between the linking variables the three elements can be defined by two major elements aguilera et al 2011 1 the qualitative structure a directed acyclic graph dag that is built by a set of variables and links representing the cause effect relationships and 2 quantitative inference conditional probability tables cpts quantified by a set of probabilities measuring the belief of conditional dependence the procedures involved in developing the bns in modeling environmental systems are pollino and henderson 2010 ayre and landis 2012 1 identifying the objective of the model 2 building a dag with relevant variables and links 3 assigning states to the variables 4 specifying the prior probabilities in terms of cpts 5 assessing the model performance using sensitivity analysis or expert knowledge and 6 inferencing and updating the model with new data or evidence if a set of variables are x x 1 x 2 x n in the bns modeling of an environmental system then the joint distribution is equal to the product of all the conditional distributions attached to each variable the statistical expression is written as 1 p x 1 x 2 x n i n p x i p a x i x 1 x 2 x n œÜ x 1 œÜ x 2 œÜ x n where p x 1 x 2 x n stands for the joint distribution of variables x x 1 x 2 x n pa x i represents the parent variables of variable x i and œÜ x i refers to the set of all possible values of variable x i each marginal distribution can be calculated by the joint distribution in eq 1 there is no need to determine the joint distribution itself the conditional distribution can be estimated by efficient algorithms experimental or field data process based model results or the elicited beliefs of experts madsen and jensen 1999 borsuk et al 2006 wang et al 2009 active involvement and negotiation by public participation can flexibly transparently and effectively reach a common perspective in decision making processes lynam et al 2007 carmona et al 2011 bns have been widely used as participatory modeling tools in environmental modeling and ultimately achieve a visual explanation of reality under public participation lynam et al 2007 reed 2008 this study first identifies the water related ess and then analyzes the trade off and synergy between different users of water and the expected benefits of water related ess a participatory bn model is developed by what if analysis between the different water management alternatives and the expected benefits of water related ess to implement the scenario analysis 2 2 multiple criteria decision analysis using bns with ahp ahp first proposed by saaty 1977 is a useful model with which to solve multi criteria decision issues and has been applied in numerous research fields such as planning selecting a best alternative and resource allocation and conflict resolution zubair 2014 the ahp conducts the decision making problems through a hierarchical structure with a limited number usually four or five of levels saaty 1980 jablonsky 2005 the first level sets a key goal for the multiple criteria decision issues whereas the last level is the decision alternatives or scenarios the levels between the first and last level are usually the criteria of the decision problems moreover the secondary goal and sub criteria are basic elements involved in the ahp structure saaty 1994 papiƒáblagojeviƒá nata≈°a et al 2012 fig 2 the process of multi criteria decision making in the ahp model is carried out using following four steps saaty 1994 park et al 2015 structuring the ahp hierarchy making a pairwise comparison of each alternative to obtain the judgmental matrix computing the weights of alternatives and conducting decision making with calculated weights the pairwise comparison matrix obtaining a priority vector is an important task in these four steps each value in the matrix is defined by the relative importance value shown in table 1 after a questionnaire survey or expert judgment saaty 1994 papiƒáblagojeviƒá nata≈°a et al 2012 park et al 2015 2 a a i j n n a 11 a 12 a 1 n a 21 a 22 a 2 n a n 1 a n 2 a n n where a represents the pairwise comparison matrix and a ij is the relative importance value in the i th row and j th column 3 a i j 1 a j i a j i 0 i j 1 2 n with respect to the pairwise comparison matrix the weighting coefficients can be obtained by determining the principal eigenvector of comparison matrix liang et al 2017 4 a 11 a 12 a 1 n a 21 a 22 a 2 n a n 1 a n 2 a n n w 1 w 2 w n Œª m a x w 1 w 2 w n where w max w 1 w 2 w n t is the maximal eigenvector of matrix a and Œª max is the maximal eigenvalue of matrix a the weighting coefficient vector w i of indicator i can be calculated by normalization of the maximal eigenvector liang et al 2017 5 w i w i i 1 n w i if p ij is an inferred probability set of bn models with j states in i th criterion then the recommendation values of the alternatives can be determined by park et al 2015 6 r i j p i j w i where i is the criterion 1 2 n j is the states of variables 1 2 l l refers to the number of states of the i th criterion as a measure of the reliability of the results the goodness of judgment can be evaluated by the consistency radio c r in the ahp model the c r is determined by dividing the consistency index c i by the random index r i saaty 1990 bevilacqua and braglia 2000 the hierarchies in the ahp model are considered acceptable if c r 0 1 the main advantage of the ahp model is the use of pairwise comparisons to obtain the weights of the measurements by consulting the stakeholders managers decision makers or experts erdogan et al 2017 this study used an bn models with ahp model to determine the recommendation values based on the simulation results of the bns and the weight values of the ahp fig 3 the use of an ahp model overcomes a practically difficult issue in bns modeling in multiple criteria trade offs situations 2 3 decision making and recommendations of water management alternatives according to the recommendation values determined here the optimum value of the alternatives can be obtained by selecting the maximum recommended value park et al 2015 fig 3 7 r o p t i m a l v a l u e m a x i 1 2 n j 1 2 l r i j in this paper the largest r optimal value of all combinations of attributes is considered as the optimum recommendation value of the water management alternatives furthermore the indifference points are determined as halfway between this minimum accepted recommendation value of the alternative and the largest rejected recommendation value of the alternative by eq 6 caulkins et al 2015 3 study area the qira oasis is situated in the downstream of the qira river catchment of xinjiang northwest china and covers approximately 274 63 km2 80 43 e 80 53 e 36 57 n 37 05 n fig 4 it is a typical alluvial fan in which the agricultural and natural oases are the main landscape types bruelheide et al 2003 xue et al 2016 the qira oasis has an annual mean temperature of 11 9 c accumulated precipitation of 35 mm and pan evaporation of 2600 mm liu et al 2018 chang et al 2022 the water supply in the qira oasis relies on river runoff which is generated from glacier and or snow melt water as well as precipitation in the alpine valley of the kunlun mountains flows through the qira oasis and eventually pours into the arid taklimakan desert bruelheide et al 2003 xue et al 2017a its annual average runoff during 1985 2010 is 1 27 108 m3 extremely low precipitation strong evaporation and highly vulnerable ecosystems are the major characteristics of this desert bruelheide et al 2003 xue b et al 2017 agricultural oasis is the main land use type the natural oasis including riparian forests e g populus and dense shrubs e g tamarix and phragmites is chiefly distributed in the desert oasis ecotone which consists of semi shrubs and perennial herbaceous grasses e g calligonum tamarix chinensis and alhagi sparsifolia chang et al 2022 the ecosystems in the qira oasis are experiencing serious problems due to the over utilization of water for agricultural irrigation together with increasing demands for water for domestic and industrial use the excessive use of water for agricultural irrigation threatens the health of natural oasis ecosystems many ecological issues have emerged such as the deterioration of groundwater quality the degradation of riparian forests and desert shrubs and grasslands and lowering of the groundwater table that maintains the growth of the desert vegetation xue et al 2015 based on the principles of iwrm and ess together with a multiple criteria decision framework managing water resources is crucial for achieving sustainable water development and ecological security in terms of identifying reasonable water allocation and management strategies in a coordinated way hotan water resources 2013 liu et al 2018 xue et al 2017b the qira oasis was selected for study because it can be used as a universal case of many typical irrigation regions in which the ess face threats as a result of increasing competition of water for agricultural domestic industrial and ecological water uses worldwide especially in arid regions in addition a key consideration is that the data in the study area can easily obtained with the support of the cele national station of observation and research for desert grassland ecosystems of the chinese academy of sciences 4 model development and description 4 1 development of a participatory bn model the bn model was developed under public participation and underwent four recursive phases of 1 identifying the issues and cause effect variables 2 designing the casual loop diagram 3 implementing bn inferences or diagnosis and 4 evaluating the model robustness the participatory bn model was built to run from march 2015 to august 2016 table 2 the 28 participants in the qira oasis were classified into four groups researchers water management experts stakeholders and the water manager six departments the water conservancy bureau the agricultural bureau the meteorological bureau the forestry bureau the environmental protection bureau and the village committee were identified as the stakeholders every department stakeholder is adopted two representatives i e a head and a professional based on their well rounded understanding of the issues the policy maker and decision maker in qira oasis was the water manager at the qira water management institute which releases water management policies and plans six professional water management scientists were consulted in the model development data elicitation and verification the researchers offered the participants a water related ess background and obtained their feedbacks zorrilla et al 2010 xue et al 2017b the participatory bn model was constructed by face to face discussions and evaluations among stakeholders domain experts and water managers as well as researchers all the participants identified the variables states and their relationships while also defining the plausible structure of the bn model and eliciting sound specialized knowledge the quantitative data used to populate the cpts were collected from a variety of sources including the scientific literature monitoring hydrometeorological data socioeconomic data model results documentary databases government statistics and expert judgment the obtained data sources are divided into two types the quantifiable data such as hydrometeorological and socioeconomic data can be parameterized by em algorithm while the unquantifiable data such as water management policies and measures are obtained by expert assessment when building the bn structure the cpts are elicited to simulate the results via variable parameterization moreover the developed bn model was assessed and updated by the participants in the participatory process an integrated cause and effect structure of the bn was eventually built after achieving a consensus from all the participants fig 5 the final structure of the bn was presented in the netica software package with a total of 56 variables and 74 links fig 6 the structure of the bn model showed the flow of water via the water supply and demand analysis carried out in the qira oasis the seven end variables used as output variables presented the expected benefits of the water related ess the detailed development processes in the participatory bn model including the participatory process model construction data collection could be found in xue et al 2017b an explanation of each variable and the states representing it are described and given in table a1 of appendix 4 2 ahp modeling the ahp hierarchy structure was created as four levels fig 7 the top level was defined as the total objective of expected benefits maximization from water related ess the evaluation criteria which impact the total goal are set at the second level and are related to seven different aspects biodiversity grassland degradation land desertification groundwater safety agricultural income drinking water security and soil salinization these criteria are then divided into several sub criteria associated with water security factors at the third level including ecological water demands water for urban greenbelts water for man made shelterbelt spring irrigation the available agricultural water groundwater quality and groundwater depth the lowest level comprised 225 water management alternatives these alternatives were set as a combination of different management scenarios the weight coefficients of the decision alternatives were calculated by pairwise comparisons after the ahp hierarchy structure of decision making problems had been defined table 3 shows an example of the pairwise comparison matrix of criteria regarding the goal the comparison matrix of the sub criteria against the criteria and the comparison matrix of water management alternatives with respect to the sub criteria were quantified to optimize the water management alternatives the comparison matrix of the alternatives was defined at the same level of importance the 225 water management alternatives in the ahp hierarchical structure were a combination of different management scenarios these scenarios were defined as the assembly of states in the variables of the developed bn the variables included groundwater extraction three states groundwater quality three states ecological water demands five states and the irrigation quota five states 5 results and discussion 5 1 model validity to ensure their reliability and accuracy the bn and ahp models were validated by sensitivity analysis and degree of consistency respectively sensitivity analysis is considered as one of the more effective approaches to evaluating bn models charnley and engelbert 2005 kragt 2009 chan et at 2010 and is conducted to detect the sensitivity of the bn target variables to the input variables using mutual information rowe and frewer 2004 barton et al 2008 the seven variables for the expected benefits of water related es were defined as the target variables on which to carry out the sensitivity analysis the sensitivity results were verified with the reliability and reasonability reported by xue et al 2017b the knowledge of local experts and the judgment of stakeholder perspectives were used to evaluate the acceptability and plausibility of the modeling results these validities matched well with anecdotal evidence in the scientific literature in addition all the c r values for different criteria were 0 10 that is the consistency radio in the ahp is appropriate and it can be confirmed that the modeling results are reliable and acceptable 5 2 multiple criteria decision making and recommendations using bn with ahp the ahp model provided weight coefficients of 0 03 0 04 0 13 0 14 and 0 30 for biodiversity grassland degradation land desertification groundwater safety and agricultural income and weight coefficients of 0 33 and 0 04 for drinking water security and soil salinization respectively fig 8 drinking water security and agricultural income accounting for about 30 were larger weight coefficients in the expected benefits of water related ess according to the weight coefficients calculated in the sub criteria the groundwater quality groundwater depth and spring irrigation were the main criteria accounting for about 25 with respect to the water management alternatives since the government and managers in the study area pay more attention to ecological and agricultural water tradeoffs under groundwater security the groundwater extraction groundwater quality ecological water demands and irrigation quota are selected as the decision variables consequently a total of 225 scenarios were set to simulate the expected benefits of water related ess under the different state combinations of four water management variables fig 9 illustrated bn model simulation example with elicited cpts in combination of water management alternatives according to eq 6 the recommendation values were calculated as shown in fig 10 for example the recommendation value was 0 24 under the combination of 1 g l groundwater quality 9857 10 728 m3 ha irrigation quota 22 80 million m3 groundwater extraction and 40 29 ecological water demands in fig 10a the optimum alternatives are determined by assessing the maximum recommended values the baseline of maximum recommended value is defined as greater than 0 37 according to value differences the water management alternatives are recommended as the 12 scenarios which were determined by the different combinations of groundwater extraction groundwater quality ecological water demands and irrigation quota table 4 5 3 response of optimization variables to water management alternatives the impacts of water management alternatives on the optimization variables spring irrigation agricultural irrigation area man made shelterbelt area amount of agricultural irrigation water for man made shelterbelt water price standards and water saving efficiency were assessed the scenario simulations were conducted by testing the changes in the probability values in the states of each optimization variable under the different water management alternatives based on the recommendation values using the bn model with ahp the 15 scenarios were simulated to show the probability of changes in the optimization variables in the bn model the scenarios are easily examined by specifying the state of the water management alternatives fig 11 shows the probability variations of the optimization variables under different water management alternatives using the bn model with ahp the magnitude of probability variations describes the strength of the influence of different scenarios mamitimin et al 2015 although the effects of combinations among the different water management alternatives can alleviate water pressure and conflict at the spatio temporal scale spring irrigation is still insufficient with about a 45 chance for agricultural water demand in spring fig 11a the results imply that there is no efficient reservoir upstream in the qira river to store water for agricultural irrigation in spring this also verifies that the current water management alternatives are insufficient to completely meet the requirements of spring irrigation which comprises 35 of the annual agricultural water demand xue et al 2017b by contrast the areas of agricultural irrigation and man made shelterbelts have high increasing chances as the groundwater extraction and irrigation quotas increase fig 11b c for example 11 326 ha agricultural area and 3500 3850 ha man made shelterbelt area are higher than 10 10 and 30 00 respectively under 23 26 million m3 groundwater extraction 1 g l groundwater quality 58 75 ecological water demands and 10 728 12 128 m3 ha irrigation quota compared with the a priori condition this also results in an increase of probability in the agricultural irrigation quantity and the amount of water for man made shelterbelt fig 9f g for instance 27 168 thousand m3 water for man made shelterbelt is higher than 48 8 under 23 26 million m3 groundwater extraction 1 g l groundwater quality 58 75 ecological water demand and 10 728 12 128 m3 ha irrigation quota compared with the a priori condition however the increase in the agricultural irrigation quantity and water for man made shelterbelt leads to a significant decrease of probability in the water price standard and water saving efficiency fig 9d e 0 02 rmb m3 water price standard and 0 43 water saving efficiency were 4 40 and 26 respectively under 23 26 million m3 groundwater extraction 1 g l groundwater quality 58 75 ecological water demands and 10 728 12 128 m3 ha irrigation quota compared with the a priori condition this shows that a low irrigation water price and water saving efficiencies affect the cost of water and pressure on water use in the arid qira oasis 5 4 uncertainties and further modeling for water related ess although the bn model can effectively cope with the uncertainties in the ess modeling poppenborg and koellner 2014 and ahp provides reliable recommendations for water management alternatives in multiple criteria decision making park et al 2015 various uncertainties exist in the proposed multiple criteria decision framework assessments due to the complex relationships in water related ess modeling these uncertainties result from the combined effects of the inherent variations in water supply conflicts in water use water saving practices and water management policy based on the principle of maximum recommended values four water management alternatives are optimum the first alternative is 22 80 million m3 groundwater extraction 1 g l groundwater quality 58 75 ecological water demands and 10 728 12 128 m3 ha irrigation quota recommended value for 0 40 this recommendation chases the groundwater extraction and irrigation quota as little as possible after meeting the demands of the groundwater quality and ecological water demands the second alternative is 22 80 million m3 groundwater extraction 1 g l groundwater quality 58 75 ecological water demands and 12 128 m3 ha irrigation quota recommended value for 0 42 this recommendation chases the groundwater extraction as little as possible and gives an adequate irrigation quota after meeting the demands of groundwater quality and ecological water demands the third alternative is 22 80 23 26 million m3 groundwater extraction 1 g l groundwater quality 58 75 ecological water demands and 10 728 12 128 m3 ha irrigation quota recommended value for 0 41 this recommendation chases the moderate groundwater extraction and irrigation quota after meeting the demands of groundwater quality and ecological water demands the fourth alternative is 22 80 23 26 million m3 groundwater extraction 1 g l groundwater quality 58 75 ecological water demands and 12 128 m3 ha irrigation quota recommended value for 0 43 this recommendation chases the moderate groundwater extraction and irrigation quota adequately after meeting the demands of groundwater quality and ecological water demands according to the definition of the indifference points or skiba points the alternative of 22 80 million m3 groundwater extraction 1 g l groundwater quality 40 29 50 84 the ecological water demands and 9857 10 728 m3 ha irrigation quota recommended value for 0 27 and the alternative of 22 80 million m3 groundwater extraction 1 g l groundwater quality 50 84 53 48 ecological water demands and 8142 9857 m3 ha irrigation quota recommended value for 0 27 this reflects that low ecological water demand is indifferent between two alternatives in the decision of managers furthermore the alternative of 22 80 23 26 million m3 groundwater extraction 1 g l groundwater quality 40 29 50 84 ecological water demands and 9857 10 728 m3 ha irrigation quota recommended value for 0 27 and the alternative of 22 80 23 26 million m3 groundwater extraction 1 g l groundwater quality 50 84 53 48 ecological water demands and 8142 9857 m3 ha irrigation quota recommended value for 0 27 this implies that the medium groundwater extraction indifferent between two alternatives in general the decision makers would be indifferent intermediate level of recommended values between two alternatives which can shift the skiba point in such a way that the optimal recommended value will be reached this also verifies the existence of skiba point in ecosystem service modeling friedlob and ramsay 1986 scott and antonsson 2000 wagener 2003 caulkins et al 2015 with agricultural water use accounting for 97 7 of the total water supply in this arid oasis xue et al 2017a improving the efficiency of water use via water saving measures is crucial in alleviating conflicts over water in regional sustainable development therefore to save the water currently used for agricultural irrigation for other water requirements particularly the ecological water demands the third optimum alternative is more suitable for the current study area although an increase in the price of water can improve the efficiency of agricultural water use mamitimin et al 2015 additional adjustments e g upgrading the irrigation system reducing water losses from leakage applying advanced irrigation techniques and agricultural policies such as economic compensation can effectively improve the water management alternatives for sustainable development pang et al 2014 xue et al 2017b instead of deriving a final optimum result from the multiple criteria decision making process the objective of this study is to propose a generalizable assessment framework to develop a water related ess model to support multiple criteria decisions in water management systems particularly in arid and semiarid regions this framework provides a flexible and objective evaluation method allowing the integration of additional knowledge and data into the assessment using the hybrid approach of ahp and bn however some important issues remain unresolved the structures of the bn model are hierarchical and acyclic this is an important weakness of bn in environmental and ecosystem services modeling mechanistically and dynamically landuyt et al 2013 numerous studies have pointed out that the absence of feedback loops is a restriction of bn model uusitalo 2007 aguilera et al 2011 according to aguilera et al 2011 and landuyt et al 2013 the bn model to combine multiple other models is better potential to handle the feedback issue of environmental modeling under stakeholder participations this study developed the bn model combined with ahp under stakeholder participations considering the feedbacks in model development this process is embodied in the iterative participations chan et al 2010 such hierarchical decision making processes have widely been accepted in environmental and ecosystem services modeling around the world such as groundwater management in denmark henriksen 2010 catchment based water resource management in the kongulai catchment of australia chan et al 2010 ecosystem services modeling in the haean watershed of germany poppenborg and koellner 2014 regional water resources management in guadiana basin of spain and estuarine dynamics in the neuse river estuary in north carolina of america alameddine et al 2011 despite the participatory bn development combined with ahp is strictly conducted by iterative participatory feedback processes the spatial and temporal variations were not considered in the water related ess modeling to support feedback loops in the temporal or spatial dynamics either additional variables separate casual networks for each temporal and spatial state the integration of other models into bn modeling or the time sliced model i e dynamic bayesian network are more suitable and acceptable for further study uusitalo 2007 pollino and henderson 2010 duespohl et al 2012 castelletti and soncini sessa 2007 6 conclusions this paper proposes a causal structure based multiple criteria decision framework illustrating how the hybrid approaches of ahp and bn can be used to model water related es and to identify the indifference points the proposed framework in this paper comprises three steps 1 bns modeling based on water related ess analysis 2 multiple criteria decision analysis using bns with ahp and 3 decision making and the recommendation of water management alternatives the bn model builds multiple water related ess in decision making contexts providing a flexible and powerful tool for ess modeling and scenario analysis the ahp model is used to identify the relative importance of each decision making criterion the weighted values of the expected benefits of water related ess are quantified to cope with multi criteria decision making that involves trade offs and optimization among various ess the case analysis in the qira oasis of northwest china confirmed that the proposed multiple criteria decision framework combining the bn into an ahp model is a promising approach with which to model ess and to recommend optimum water management alternatives the proposed framework is particularly well suited for detecting the points where the decision makers would be indifferent between two alternatives and to compare with the optimum recommendation value by modeling the expected benefits of water related ess the use of transdisciplinary approaches combining bn models into an ahp model allows for trade offs optimization and recommendations between multiple and conflicting decision alternatives in an uncertain environment the framework is considered as an effective tool providing a qualitative and quantitative assessment method that improves the disadvantage of each approach and can solve transdisciplinary and multiple criteria decision issues it is not limited to the ess modeling in multiple criteria decision making to make the multiple criteria decision framework more plausible and reliable further work needs to consider the spatial and temporal variations in water related ess modeling compliance with ethical standards na credit authorship

7807,study region tsengwen reservoir taiwan study focus water level wl and water volume wv are important indicators for analyzing surface water resources satellite remote sensing enables continuous monitoring of inland water bodies in human inaccessible areas we integrate landsat imagery and satellite altimetry to derive long term 2003 2020 wl and wv variations of tsengwen reservoir first water area wa was extracted from landsat imagery by modified normalized difference water index method and a second order regression model is proposed to recover the entire wa from cloud covered images to enhance the data usage then was and wls provided from satellite altimetry are utilized to build a linear regression model which is used to transfer wa into wl finally wv was computed based on the wa and wl new hydrological insights for the region results showed that the usage rate of landsat 8 imagery utilized for conversion from wa to wl can be increased from 23 to 43 moreover the root mean square error of the difference of wls between the estimates and a local gauge is 2 95 5 56 m with correlation coefficients cc of 0 93 0 99 in addition the derived wv variations and ground truth showed a good agreement with cc in 0 88 0 97 the results indicated that the integration of multi source remote sensing technologies can effectively provide long term hydrological parameters to assist administrative agencies with an appropriate plan for water resources management graphical abstract ga1 keywords landsat imagery satellite altimetry water level water volume data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction climate change has increased the frequency of extreme weather events such as floods droughts and heat waves schiermeier et al 2018 it gradually altered the original precipitation patterns including the increasing rainfall intensity prolonged drought duration and higher evapotranspiration leading to an unbalanced distribution of spatiotemporal pattern in precipitation bogardi et al 2012 as a result the changes in the minimum river flows seasonal flows and groundwater recharge are expected to have significant impacts on both regional and global water resources khandu et al 2016 this condition indicates the importance of formulating water maintenance strategies for countries around the world when analyzing and managing surface water resources e g reservoirs rivers and lakes water level wl and water volume wv are crucial parameters which can reflect the long term impact of global climate change on water bodies liu et al 2016 in general these two measurements are obtained from in situ monitoring instruments or from a combination of satellite altimetry satellite imagery and supplemental topographic data such as the digital elevation model dem although onsite instrumentation can provide continuous and precise measurements the infrastructure is not economically viable in many remote places in addition to economic reasons koblinsky et al 1993 pointed out quantitatively assessing water resources in remote regions for example amazon basin is always difficult due to the factors including long distances and restricted access other classic examples can also be found in arctic lakes and river basins alsdorf et al 2007 and lakes in tibetan plateau tp so called asia s water tower li et al 2019 with the evolution of radar and laser satellite altimetry we can measure several stratified surface heights through elapsed time in recent years it was widely applied to non open ocean applications through waveform retracking for example ice sheet elevation changes fricker et al 2012 lee et al 2013 helm et al 2014 and the study of nearshore wave patterns vignudelli et al 2011 yang et al 2012 wang and huang 2021 as satellite altimetry has the advantage of offering continuous and repeated observations regardless of weather distance and locations many researchers have also applied it to monitor inland water bodies which can fill the gap of wl information for distant regions maheu et al 2003 used topex poseidon to monitor wl changes of major rivers in the second largest plain of south america plata basin the results showed that the wl changes in the river are related to el ni√±o southern oscillation indicating that wl is one of the significant factors reflecting the climate changes sulistioadi et al 2015 adopted envisat to analyze the wls of narrow 40 200 m wide medium 200 800 m wide rivers and small lakes was are less than 1000 km2 and the root mean square error rmse ranges from 0 21 m to 0 69 m jason 2 data were used to assess the wls of the bazhang stream in taiwan and the standard deviation std of the differences between the altimeter measurements and the onsite gauge was only 31 cm kuo and kao 2011 kao et al 2019 showed that wl change trends observed by cryosat 2 20 hz retracked observations the saral altika 40 hz ice 1 retracked data and the hydroweb measurements are consistent for the tibetan migriggyangzham co and dorsoidong co respectively the abovementioned studies had shown the potential of satellite altimetry algorithms for inland hydrological applications nevertheless with the limitation of a long repeat cycle 10 35 days the huge size of the footprint 3 5 km and dozens of kilometers split of ground tracks conventional pulse limited satellite altimetry can only provide observations for a fixed number of lakes rivers and reservoirs sulistioadi et al 2015 abdalla et al 2021 the hydrological information of some vital water bodies might be left unknown besides the high spatiotemporal sampling of wls cannot be easily acquired by a single satellite altimetry mission tourian et al 2016 given this duan and bastiaanssen 2013 combined four kinds of satellite altimetry data and optical satellite imagery to evaluate the wv changes of lakes and reservoirs similarly the thematic imagery altimetry system proposed by tseng et al 2016 was an integration of landsat imagery and a digital elevation model dem their study inferred a 32 year time series of hoover dam in the united states and showed a good accuracy in terms of rmse at 0 85 m compared to the ground truth furthermore liu et al 2016 presented to integrate landsat images dem and satellite altimetry to assess hydrological regimes and the characteristics of two dams in the upper mekong river in vietnam they evaluated the impact of river flow regulation in the upper stream to the lower reaches in the mekong river the rmse of wl at 2 5 m of wls was achieved and the estimated wv was only 3 different from the reference it showed that a combination of multi source remote sensing technology could effectively support water resources monitoring and provide local governments with a reference for developing hydrological policies although the integrated method had been proven in the abovementioned studies fewer studies have applied the integrated method to small water bodies surrounded by mountains that are challenging for satellite altimetry observations due primarily to the restricted spatial resolution and contaminated waveforms downing et al 2006 also reported that the total area of natural lakes in the world is dominated by millions of was less than 1 km2 so the importance of small water bodies must be considered for global water resource management for example more than 1200 lakes located on the tp served as indicators for rapid climate change and regional hydrology li et al 2019 thus this study proposes a scheme by combining multi source remote sensing to 1 apply the integrated method to small water bodies in mountain areas to derive long term wl and wv time series 2 increase the data availability of optical images by using cloud contaminated imageries and 3 establish two regression models that can be used across different landsat imageries in a small inland water body to convert from water area wa to wl and subset wa to entire wa respectively 2 research area and data 2 1 research area tsengwen reservoir is located in the upper reaches of tsengwen river in chiayi country taiwan it was constructed in 1973 and served as a multi purpose reservoir that provides water for agricultural industrial and domestic usages in the chia nan plain the detailed information of tsengwen reservoir is shown in table 1 it is the largest and one of the most essential water resource facilities in taiwan this study takes tsengwen reservoir as the study area for two reasons first the in situ monitoring instruments are regularly maintained providing long term continuous and reliable measurements for the verification of the wl and wv derived from our workflow furthermore the shape size and surrounding terrain of tsengwen reservoir are quite challenging for satellite altimetry as fig 1 shows the reservoir has a long and narrow shape and the boundary consists of flooded river valleys in addition the surrounding terrain is mainly composed of mountains hills and plains with a varying elevation in 100 1200 m fig 2 2 2 data 2 2 1 landsat imagery this study utilized 76 landsat 5 tm images and 325 landsat 8 oli images in collection 1 t1 level 1 precision terrain corrected l1 tp products the data were downloaded from the united states geological survey usgs earthexplorer website and the details are shown in table 2 although landsat 5 satellite was launched in 1984 the in situ observations of tsengwen reservoir could only be traced back to october 29 2003 to synchronize the time series between satellite images and the in situ observations for validation this study only collected landsat 5 cloud free images starting from november 2003 on the other hand the tm sensor on landsat 5 failed to deliver images in 2011 so we just acquired landsat 5 images covering from 2003 to 2011 the l1 tp images have been radiometrically calibrated and orthorectified using ground control points and dem to correct for relief displacement and then sensor calibration has to be performed the digital numbers dn are linearly converted to the at sensor radiance using the calibration coefficients of each band of the sensor then the at sensor radiance is converted to the top of atmosphere toa reflectance in this study we adopted the conversion formula provided by usgs to compute the toa of landsat 5 and landsat 8 images and the conversion of the two are slightly different as described in eqs 1 4 usgs 2019 chander et al 2009 for landsat 5 1 l Œª gain dn bias where l Œª is spectral radiance gain is the gain value for each band dn is the dn values provided by level 1 products and bias is the bias for each band 2 œÅ Œª œÄ l Œª d 2 esun Œª cos Œ∏ s where œÅ Œª is toa planetary reflectance d is the distance between earth and sun esun Œª

the band specific multiplicative rescaling factor from the metadata q cal is the quantized and calibrated standard product pixel values dn and a œÅ is the band specific additive rescaling factor from

solar zenith angle Œ∏ sz 90 Œ∏ se 2 2 2 envisat satellite altimetry envisat was launched by the european space agency esa in march 2002 it has most overlapped wl observations corresponding to the dates of landsat imagery compared with other altimetry satellites saral cryosat 2 icesat and icesat 2 whose ground track passed the tsengwen reservoir thus this study used envisat 18 hz sensor geophysical data record sgdr data from november 2002 to july 2010 corresponding to cycle 10 to cycle 90 and the satellite ground track is no 993 as shown in fig 1 which passed the middle part of tsengwen reservoir the waveforms were retracked by seaice retracker which can better accommodate specular or narrow peak waveforms laxon 1994 and the corrections of instruments ionosphere troposphere solid earth tides and pole tides were applied 2 2 3 water gauge the data of wl and effective water storage capacity were collected from the open data portal maintained by the water resources agency ministry of economic affairs taiwan available at https www wrasb gov tw index aspx the observation frequency is once an hour for comparison with the remote sensing method this study used a daily average value the wl is relative to the tsengwen reservoir height system which differs from the taiwan vertical datum 2001 twvd 2001 by approximately 1 3 m 3 methodology the flowchart of the proposed method is demonstrated in fig 3 the procedure contains 1 wa detection by water index and cloud detection only for landsat 8 and wa computation by a wa wa regression model constructed by landsat 8 2 wl derivation through a wa wl regression model established by envisat wl data and landsat 5 wa information and 3 variations of wv a novel feature of the proposed scheme is that the wa wa and wa wl regression model can be applied across different series of landsat imagery and the details are elaborated in sections 3 1 3 3 3 1 wa detection and computation 3 1 1 water index and threshold the objective of this study is to estimate wa by the number of pixels within the boundary of the water body we adopted the modified normalized difference water index mndwi to extract wa xu 2007 and the equation can be shown as eq 5 5 mndwi green mir green mir where green and mir represent the green and mid infrared bands respectively the bands used to calculate mndwi in landsat 5 and landsat 8 imagery are shown in table 3 the next step is to decide the appropriate threshold to distinguish between water and non water pixels the threshold value changes with the location and time of image acquisition feyisa et al 2014 which causes uncertainties and errors when a single threshold method is used for example the threshold is set to zero namely the h0 method thus the threshold value should be selected in a more robust way to maintain the accuracy of the classification results the otsu algorithm otsu 1979 is regarded as the best for automatic threshold selection pan et al 2020 indicated that the outlier resulting from the otsu algorithm is less than the h0 method therefore this study adopted otsu s algorithm and the thresholds range from 0 to 0 4 finally the wa can be estimated by multiplying the calculated total number of water pixels by the spatial resolution of the satellite 3 1 2 cloud detection landsat 8 in previous studies some authors only manually picked cloud free images to delineate water bodies tseng et al 2016 liu et al 2016 in this study we aimed at improving the usage rate of landsat imagery thus we also utilized the images that contain a certain cloud in this section we directly used the information from the quality assessment band qa band of landsat 8 the reason is that more cloud situations such as cirrus and cloud shadow are considered and it is convenient for users to directly use this information to detect clouds in images considering the distribution of clouds in the study area and the shape of tsengwen reservoir we defined five regions of interest roi shown in fig 4 the red box 315 371 pixel contains the whole study area denoted as roi 0 the green boxes 315 30 pixel are roi 1 to roi 4 which are equally spaced and cover different parts of the study area to observe the distribution of clouds it is worth mentioning that the number and size of roi varies in different regions and they should be empirically decided from one place to another after detecting which pixels are cloud covered we computed the total number of cloud pixels within the water body of each roi and estimated the shaded ratio the equivalent of cloud pixels within water body in each roi total pixels of water body in each roi and used it as an indicator to determine the degree of cloud contamination through manual examination and validation it is suggested that using 2 threshold would not cause excessive cloud detection and to preserve partially usable images table 4 shows the rules for grading the degree of cloud cover according to this rule the images are classified into three levels namely cloud free partially cloudy and fully cloudy the number of landsat 8 images for three levels are 83 66 and 176 and this study only utilizes the first two types for further calculation 3 2 regression model analysis 3 2 1 wa wa regression model landsat 8 before constructing the regression model cloud free images classified by the qa band were manually checked and eight fully cloudy images were misclassified and deleted from the dataset due to the difficulty to detect the cirrus clouds qiu et al 2020 besides eight cloud free images were selected for validation as discussed in section 4 1 therefore the partial wa roi 1 roi 4 and entire wa roi 0 of 67 cloudless images are used to establish the regression model a second order polynomial regression model is adopted in this study then the partial wa of the partially cloudy images are regarded as the model input to obtain an estimate of the entire wa with a view to improving the usage rate of images the coefficient of determination r2 of four models are 0 95 roi 1 0 99 roi 2 0 87 roi 3 and 0 96 roi 4 with the residual standard error œÉ ÀÜ of 0 42 0 20 0 70 and 0 40 km 2 respectively for the latter analysis the priority to use roi would follow the order of roi 2 roi 4 roi 1 and roi 3 3 2 2 wa wl regression model landsat 5 the was from landsat 5 and the wls from envisat were adopted to construct the wa wl regression model the reason to only use landsat 5 was the few corresponding wl observations during landsat 8 operation in this study the average of the difference between the envisat wls and the corresponding in situ observations is removed from the time series to the same datum for further validation from fig 5 it is obvious that the wls from envisat have good agreement with in situ water gauge records where the std of differences is 1 70 m after checking the quality of wl from satellite altimetry we applied a linear regression model to convert wa to wl with the assumption that the terrain slope of the reservoir is unchanging liu et al 2016 the relationship is illustrated in fig 6 where r2 is 0 99 and the residual standard error is 2 55 m 3 3 variations of wv duan and bastiaanssen 2013 proposed that the total volume of a lake reservoir is composed of a constant minimum wv v con and a variable wv v var the relationship is shown as eq 6 v con stands for a constant wv within a fixed wl to the bottom of a lake reservoir v var denotes the wv variation caused by the changes of wls the schematic diagram is illustrated in fig 7 then we can define a fixed reference wl with respect to a specific time to obtain v con because 1 the purpose of this study is to estimate the relative change of wv for water management because of the lack of terrain data e g dem and it is not necessary to obtain the absolute value of wv 2 this study only utilized a single altimetry satellite thus the vertical displacement between different satellites is not considered 6 v v con v var medina et al 2010 introduced a rough estimation method that assumes an ideal quadrangular pyramid composed of wl wa changes and the lake bottom the variation of wv v t can be derived by eq 7 where s t and l t are the lake surface and lake level as a function of time t 7 v t s t s t 1 2 l t l t 1 in this study eq 7 is further rewritten as eq 8 the differences between the two equations are that s t 1 and l t 1 are replaced by s t reference and l t re f e r e n c e respectively the purpose of rewriting is to ensure the same v con by a fixed reference time in addition it also enhanced the computation efficiency and is convenient to compare the variation of wv directly therefore eq 8 was applied to convert the wa and wl into the changes of wv 8 v t s t s t reference 2 l t l t reference 4 results 4 1 recovered wa results in this study 64 wa estimates are recovered from partially cloudy images of landsat 8 and the data utilization rate can be increased from 23 to 43 i e it is equivalent to obtaining twice cloud free images to examine whether the wa wa regression model established by landsat 8 images can be applied to the different series of imagery 76 cloud free landsat 5 images were utilized for validation according to the order of priority of the wa wa regression model the roi 2 wa wa regression model is implemented and the was computed by the mndwi method were used for comparison the result indicates that the correlation coefficient between was roi 2 and was mndwi is 0 99 with an rmse of 0 85 km2 which shows high consistency and good accuracy thus it demonstrates the possibility of exploiting the wa wa regression model for different series of landsat imagery the overall wa results computed from landsat 5 roi2 cloud free images and landsat 8 cloud free and partially cloudy images along with in situ water gauge wl measurements are shown in fig 8 in a general case low wls should correspond to small was and vice versa this is also a simple way to check whether there is any unreasonable wa result when the ground truth is not available evidently the wls and was derived from landsat 8 do not match well when the was are smaller than 8 km2 the major difference between landsat 5 and landsat 8 results is attributed to the type of image used for computation landsat 5 images are cloud free whereas landsat 8 results were combined from four rois with different accuracy levels besides the difference can be caused by the lack of smaller wa samples in the wa wa regression model from fig 9 most samples were larger than 8 km2 whereas merely two samples smaller than 8 km2 were used for regression in this way the regression model would have good performance and better comprehension on larger wa high wl rather than smaller wa low wl the phenomenon can be further explained by fig 10 and we randomly selected eight cloud free images each a year from landsat 8 including high and low wls from 2003 to 2020 the wa wa regression models of roi 1 to roi 4 are applied to compute the was and then compared with those derived from the mndwi method for low wl i e wa 8 km2 the was computed by the four regression models showed larger discrepancies than those of high wls i e wa 8 km2 therefore the was were prone to be overestimated or underestimated for better realization the cloud free true color images of tsengwen reservoir corresponding to the dates with lower wl were demonstrated in fig 11 according to the water distribution in fig 11 the wa changes are not proportional to the center of the reservoir but are irregularly deformed with the surrounding terrain fig 12 shows the effect of the topography at the bottom of the reservoir on the wa at the high wl 1 and wl 2 it is still within the range of artificially constructed dams so the gradient can be assumed constant along the side slope as the wl decreases to a certain low level the terrain might be affected by siltation or other external forces the assumption of the constant slope is not applicable resulting in the worse estimates of was thus 1 the bottom topography causes the low accuracy of the regression model at low wl and 2 each regression model responds differently to low was due to inconsistent topography in each roi this can also explain why those was are either underestimated or overestimated in fig 10 4 2 2003 2020 wl and wv variations time series wls are computed by the wa wl regression model constructed by landsat 5 imagery and envisat observations to assess the impact of various wa calculations on wl estimates using landsat 5 we used the was derived from mndwi and roi 2 wa wa regression model as the inputs compared with in situ gauge observations the rmse of wl mndwi and wl roi 2 sa are 2 30 m and 2 95 m respectively the results indicate that the wl estimates from these two methods are fairly comparable in accuracy it also indicates that the complete wa may not be an essential component for estimating wls in other words as long as there are enough cloud free images and altimetry wl to establish the wa wl regression model then the partially cloudy images can be estimated by the wa wa regression model to obtain the estimates of the entire was in this way the data usage rate or equivalently the temporal sampling rate can be improved for wls of landsat 8 the rmse and correlation coefficient compared with ground truth are 5 56 m and 0 93 respectively the poor accuracy can be primarily attributed to the following 1 the input data of landsat 8 mixes four roi calculation results with different estimated accuracy 2 tsengwen reservoir is a small inland water body in the mountainous area resulting in low accuracy for satellite altimetry observations and 3 few paired data can be used to establish the wa wl regression model except for the underestimation at low wl most of the wls are consistent with the gauge data to estimate the accuracy at high wl we deleted 13 observations with wl below 192 m and the accuracy is significantly improved with the rmse of 2 30 m if the estimation error at low wl can be reduced applying the wa wl regression model across the landsat imagery is still a feasible and promising method an 18 year wl time series of our proposed method is shown in fig 13 a the estimates at high wl have good agreement with in situ gauge records and can demonstrate the seasonal and yearly hydrological changes from low wls to high wls however there are discrepancies overestimation for landsat 5 and underestimation for landsat 8 at low wl which can be clearly shown as fig 13 b and c by using scatter plots the slopes of linear regression for landsat 5 and landsat 8 are 0 91 and 1 32 with the r2 of 0 98 and 0 86 still indicating the relatively good fitness of wls between on site water gauge and satellite derived results the proposed method certainly provides an alternative method for monitoring the wl of lakes or reservoirs in remote and challenging areas or regions that lack in situ measurements after obtaining the was and wls we can compute the variations of wv via eq 8 then we selected the date corresponding to the minimum wv as the t reference to keep the variations derived from landsat 5 and landsat 8 positive the t reference used for landsat 5 and landsat 8 results are 2004 01 02 and 2019 05 10 respectively meanwhile the water gauge records are deducted by the wv corresponding to the t reference for comparisons with landsat 5 and landsat 8 derived results the rmse between the proposed method and in situ observations for landsat 5 and landsat 8 are 10 084 75 unit 10 000 m3 and 6017 62 unit 10 000 m3 with the correlation coefficients of 0 97 and 0 88 respectively wv variations of the proposed method in 2003 2020 and the in situ records are illustrated in fig 14 a fig 14 b and c illustrate the scatter plots of wv variations between water gauge and landsat 5 and landsat 8 results respectively the slopes of linear regression are merely 0 73 and 0 64 with r2 of 0 88 and 0 77 for landsat 5 and landsat 8 derived results respectively although the data did not match each other well the trends in the estimates of wv variations are similar moreover the topographic data i e dem were not included in this study and the changes of water storage simply combined the estimates of wa wl in a simple model errors resulting from the estimates of wa wl and the terrain effects accumulate in the process of calculating wv variations therefore it is reasonable that the error in the estimation of wv changes is relatively large yet the study fully demonstrated the possibility and potential of the integrated remote sensing approach to monitor the hydrological parameters including wa wl and wv for a small inland water body in mountainous areas 5 discussions in this study we adopted the water index mndwi with landsat 8 qa band to partially mitigate the cloud effects on optical satellite images and successfully increase the number of images by wa wa regression model then the recovered was can be used for the conversion to wls in addition the wa wa model established by landsat 8 can be further applied to landsat 5 imagery it solved the issue that we can only acquire cloud free images for most optical satellite applications also wls and wv variations of a small water body surrounded by mountains are obtained by integrating satellite altimetry and landsat imagery without additional information such as topographic data for our scenario as long as the water body of interest can be captured by satellite images and with enough altimetry data to establish wa wa and wa wl models it is expected that the hydrological changes of the water body at a certain level of accuracy can be achieved and better performance at high wl however there are still improvements for further studies first the criteria to select the roi and how many rois should be utilized to improve the results which would be directly linked to topographical circumstances and meteorological situations near the water body second multi mission satellite altimetry satellites should be considered as possible to enhance the robustness of the wa wl regression model especially for low wls in addition different order of regression models can be validated to achieve better fitness of the relationship between wa and wl of the water body last but not the least the additional topographic data i e dem can be included to precisely compute the wv undoubtedly but again the target of this study is to introduce a scheme that can be generally applied to the remote area with no ground truth or supplementary data 6 conclusions this study aims at integrating remote sensing techniques including landsat imagery and satellite altimetry to monitor a multi decadal time series 2003 2020 of wl and wv variations for a small inland water body in the vicinity of mountains meanwhile the estimated hydrometric parameters are validated and assessed using in situ data as demonstrated in the tsengwen reservoir case the wa wa regression model proposed to recover the water area from a partially cloud contaminated landsat image could increase the data usage rate from 23 to 43 besides a square kilometer level and a meter level accuracy can be achieved for wa and wl estimation but the accuracy decreases with the drops of wl it is expected to improve the accuracy and robustness of the regression models by 1 fine tuning the usage of rois if the topographic data is available 2 adopting the wls from laser altimetry instead of radar altimetry and 3 utilizing high resolution optical images such as sentinel and formosat 2 5 on the other hand the national aeronautics and space administration schedules to launch the surface water and ocean topography satellite by the end of 2022 carrying a high resolution satellite radar that can monitor rivers and other small water bodies worldwide it will be another powerful technique that can be combined for further studies in summary this study successfully provides a potential method to serve as a supplementary or alternative tool for evaluating the hydrological parameters of surface water bodies in remote areas the procedure can be applied to any inland water bodies covered by altimetry and optical satellites in addition the monitoring results can assist local governments or global societies to develop better strategies for water resources management credit authorship contribution statement chi ming lee software validation formal analysis visualization conceptualization writing

7807,study region tsengwen reservoir taiwan study focus water level wl and water volume wv are important indicators for analyzing surface water resources satellite remote sensing enables continuous monitoring of inland water bodies in human inaccessible areas we integrate landsat imagery and satellite altimetry to derive long term 2003 2020 wl and wv variations of tsengwen reservoir first water area wa was extracted from landsat imagery by modified normalized difference water index method and a second order regression model is proposed to recover the entire wa from cloud covered images to enhance the data usage then was and wls provided from satellite altimetry are utilized to build a linear regression model which is used to transfer wa into wl finally wv was computed based on the wa and wl new hydrological insights for the region results showed that the usage rate of landsat 8 imagery utilized for conversion from wa to wl can be increased from 23 to 43 moreover the root mean square error of the difference of wls between the estimates and a local gauge is 2 95 5 56 m with correlation coefficients cc of 0 93 0 99 in addition the derived wv variations and ground truth showed a good agreement with cc in 0 88 0 97 the results indicated that the integration of multi source remote sensing technologies can effectively provide long term hydrological parameters to assist administrative agencies with an appropriate plan for water resources management graphical abstract ga1 keywords landsat imagery satellite altimetry water level water volume data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction climate change has increased the frequency of extreme weather events such as floods droughts and heat waves schiermeier et al 2018 it gradually altered the original precipitation patterns including the increasing rainfall intensity prolonged drought duration and higher evapotranspiration leading to an unbalanced distribution of spatiotemporal pattern in precipitation bogardi et al 2012 as a result the changes in the minimum river flows seasonal flows and groundwater recharge are expected to have significant impacts on both regional and global water resources khandu et al 2016 this condition indicates the importance of formulating water maintenance strategies for countries around the world when analyzing and managing surface water resources e g reservoirs rivers and lakes water level wl and water volume wv are crucial parameters which can reflect the long term impact of global climate change on water bodies liu et al 2016 in general these two measurements are obtained from in situ monitoring instruments or from a combination of satellite altimetry satellite imagery and supplemental topographic data such as the digital elevation model dem although onsite instrumentation can provide continuous and precise measurements the infrastructure is not economically viable in many remote places in addition to economic reasons koblinsky et al 1993 pointed out quantitatively assessing water resources in remote regions for example amazon basin is always difficult due to the factors including long distances and restricted access other classic examples can also be found in arctic lakes and river basins alsdorf et al 2007 and lakes in tibetan plateau tp so called asia s water tower li et al 2019 with the evolution of radar and laser satellite altimetry we can measure several stratified surface heights through elapsed time in recent years it was widely applied to non open ocean applications through waveform retracking for example ice sheet elevation changes fricker et al 2012 lee et al 2013 helm et al 2014 and the study of nearshore wave patterns vignudelli et al 2011 yang et al 2012 wang and huang 2021 as satellite altimetry has the advantage of offering continuous and repeated observations regardless of weather distance and locations many researchers have also applied it to monitor inland water bodies which can fill the gap of wl information for distant regions maheu et al 2003 used topex poseidon to monitor wl changes of major rivers in the second largest plain of south america plata basin the results showed that the wl changes in the river are related to el ni√±o southern oscillation indicating that wl is one of the significant factors reflecting the climate changes sulistioadi et al 2015 adopted envisat to analyze the wls of narrow 40 200 m wide medium 200 800 m wide rivers and small lakes was are less than 1000 km2 and the root mean square error rmse ranges from 0 21 m to 0 69 m jason 2 data were used to assess the wls of the bazhang stream in taiwan and the standard deviation std of the differences between the altimeter measurements and the onsite gauge was only 31 cm kuo and kao 2011 kao et al 2019 showed that wl change trends observed by cryosat 2 20 hz retracked observations the saral altika 40 hz ice 1 retracked data and the hydroweb measurements are consistent for the tibetan migriggyangzham co and dorsoidong co respectively the abovementioned studies had shown the potential of satellite altimetry algorithms for inland hydrological applications nevertheless with the limitation of a long repeat cycle 10 35 days the huge size of the footprint 3 5 km and dozens of kilometers split of ground tracks conventional pulse limited satellite altimetry can only provide observations for a fixed number of lakes rivers and reservoirs sulistioadi et al 2015 abdalla et al 2021 the hydrological information of some vital water bodies might be left unknown besides the high spatiotemporal sampling of wls cannot be easily acquired by a single satellite altimetry mission tourian et al 2016 given this duan and bastiaanssen 2013 combined four kinds of satellite altimetry data and optical satellite imagery to evaluate the wv changes of lakes and reservoirs similarly the thematic imagery altimetry system proposed by tseng et al 2016 was an integration of landsat imagery and a digital elevation model dem their study inferred a 32 year time series of hoover dam in the united states and showed a good accuracy in terms of rmse at 0 85 m compared to the ground truth furthermore liu et al 2016 presented to integrate landsat images dem and satellite altimetry to assess hydrological regimes and the characteristics of two dams in the upper mekong river in vietnam they evaluated the impact of river flow regulation in the upper stream to the lower reaches in the mekong river the rmse of wl at 2 5 m of wls was achieved and the estimated wv was only 3 different from the reference it showed that a combination of multi source remote sensing technology could effectively support water resources monitoring and provide local governments with a reference for developing hydrological policies although the integrated method had been proven in the abovementioned studies fewer studies have applied the integrated method to small water bodies surrounded by mountains that are challenging for satellite altimetry observations due primarily to the restricted spatial resolution and contaminated waveforms downing et al 2006 also reported that the total area of natural lakes in the world is dominated by millions of was less than 1 km2 so the importance of small water bodies must be considered for global water resource management for example more than 1200 lakes located on the tp served as indicators for rapid climate change and regional hydrology li et al 2019 thus this study proposes a scheme by combining multi source remote sensing to 1 apply the integrated method to small water bodies in mountain areas to derive long term wl and wv time series 2 increase the data availability of optical images by using cloud contaminated imageries and 3 establish two regression models that can be used across different landsat imageries in a small inland water body to convert from water area wa to wl and subset wa to entire wa respectively 2 research area and data 2 1 research area tsengwen reservoir is located in the upper reaches of tsengwen river in chiayi country taiwan it was constructed in 1973 and served as a multi purpose reservoir that provides water for agricultural industrial and domestic usages in the chia nan plain the detailed information of tsengwen reservoir is shown in table 1 it is the largest and one of the most essential water resource facilities in taiwan this study takes tsengwen reservoir as the study area for two reasons first the in situ monitoring instruments are regularly maintained providing long term continuous and reliable measurements for the verification of the wl and wv derived from our workflow furthermore the shape size and surrounding terrain of tsengwen reservoir are quite challenging for satellite altimetry as fig 1 shows the reservoir has a long and narrow shape and the boundary consists of flooded river valleys in addition the surrounding terrain is mainly composed of mountains hills and plains with a varying elevation in 100 1200 m fig 2 2 2 data 2 2 1 landsat imagery this study utilized 76 landsat 5 tm images and 325 landsat 8 oli images in collection 1 t1 level 1 precision terrain corrected l1 tp products the data were downloaded from the united states geological survey usgs earthexplorer website and the details are shown in table 2 although landsat 5 satellite was launched in 1984 the in situ observations of tsengwen reservoir could only be traced back to october 29 2003 to synchronize the time series between satellite images and the in situ observations for validation this study only collected landsat 5 cloud free images starting from november 2003 on the other hand the tm sensor on landsat 5 failed to deliver images in 2011 so we just acquired landsat 5 images covering from 2003 to 2011 the l1 tp images have been radiometrically calibrated and orthorectified using ground control points and dem to correct for relief displacement and then sensor calibration has to be performed the digital numbers dn are linearly converted to the at sensor radiance using the calibration coefficients of each band of the sensor then the at sensor radiance is converted to the top of atmosphere toa reflectance in this study we adopted the conversion formula provided by usgs to compute the toa of landsat 5 and landsat 8 images and the conversion of the two are slightly different as described in eqs 1 4 usgs 2019 chander et al 2009 for landsat 5 1 l Œª gain dn bias where l Œª is spectral radiance gain is the gain value for each band dn is the

dates of landsat imagery compared with other altimetry satellites saral cryosat 2 icesat and icesat 2 whose ground track passed the tsengwen reservoir thus this study used envisat 18 hz sensor geophysical data record sgdr data from november 2002 to july 2010 corresponding to cycle 10 to cycle 90 and the satellite ground track is no 993 as shown in fig 1 which passed the middle part of tsengwen reservoir the waveforms were retracked by seaice retracker which can better accommodate specular or narrow peak waveforms laxon 1994 and the corrections of instruments ionosphere troposphere solid earth tides and pole tides were applied 2 2 3 water gauge the data of wl and effective water storage capacity were collected from the open data portal maintained by the water resources agency ministry of economic affairs taiwan available at https www wrasb gov tw index aspx the observation frequency is once an hour for comparison with the remote sensing method this study used a daily average value the wl is relative to the tsengwen reservoir height system which differs from the taiwan vertical datum 2001 twvd 2001 by approximately 1 3 m 3 methodology the flowchart of the proposed method is demonstrated in fig 3 the procedure contains 1 wa detection by water index and cloud detection only for landsat 8 and wa computation by a wa wa regression model constructed by landsat 8 2 wl derivation through a wa wl regression model established by envisat wl data and landsat 5 wa information and 3 variations of wv a novel feature of the proposed scheme is that the wa wa and wa wl regression model can be applied across different series of landsat imagery and the details are elaborated in sections 3 1 3 3 3 1 wa detection and computation 3 1 1 water index and threshold the objective of this study is to estimate wa by the number of pixels within the boundary of the water body we adopted the modified normalized difference water index mndwi to extract wa xu 2007 and the equation can be shown as eq 5 5 mndwi green mir green mir where green and mir represent the green and mid infrared bands respectively the bands used to calculate mndwi in landsat 5 and landsat 8 imagery are shown in table 3 the next step is to decide the appropriate threshold to distinguish between water and non water pixels the threshold value changes with the location and time of image acquisition feyisa et al 2014 which causes uncertainties and errors when a single threshold method is used for example the threshold is set to zero namely the h0 method thus the threshold value should be selected in a more robust way to maintain the accuracy of the classification results the otsu algorithm otsu 1979 is regarded as the best for automatic threshold selection pan et al 2020 indicated that the outlier resulting from the otsu algorithm is less than the h0 method therefore this study adopted otsu s algorithm and the thresholds range from 0 to 0 4 finally the wa can be estimated by multiplying the calculated total number of water pixels by the spatial resolution of the satellite 3 1 2 cloud detection landsat 8 in previous studies some authors only manually picked cloud free images to delineate water bodies tseng et al 2016 liu et al 2016 in this study we aimed at improving the usage rate of landsat imagery thus we also utilized the images that contain a certain cloud in this section we directly used the information from the quality assessment band qa band of landsat 8 the reason is that more cloud situations such as cirrus and cloud shadow are considered and it is convenient for users to directly use this information to detect clouds in images considering the distribution of clouds in the study area and the shape of tsengwen reservoir we defined five regions of interest roi shown in fig 4 the red box 315 371 pixel contains the whole study area denoted as roi 0 the green boxes 315 30 pixel are roi 1 to roi 4 which are equally spaced and cover different parts of the study area to observe the distribution of clouds it is worth mentioning that the number and size of roi varies in different regions and they should be empirically decided from one place to another after detecting which pixels are cloud covered we computed the total number of cloud pixels within the water body of each roi and estimated the shaded ratio the equivalent of cloud pixels within water body in each roi total pixels of water body in each roi and used it as an indicator to determine the degree of cloud contamination through manual examination and validation it is suggested that using 2 threshold would not cause excessive cloud detection and to preserve partially usable images table 4 shows the rules for grading the degree of cloud cover according to this rule the images are classified into three levels namely cloud free partially cloudy and fully cloudy the number of landsat 8 images for three levels are 83 66 and 176 and this study only utilizes the first two types for further calculation 3 2 regression model analysis 3 2 1 wa wa regression model landsat 8 before constructing the regression model cloud free images classified by the qa band were manually checked and eight fully cloudy images were misclassified and deleted from the dataset due to the difficulty to detect the cirrus clouds qiu et al 2020 besides eight cloud free images were selected for validation as discussed in section 4 1 therefore the partial wa roi 1 roi 4 and entire wa roi 0 of 67 cloudless images are used to establish the regression model a second order polynomial regression model is adopted in this study then the partial wa of the partially cloudy images are regarded as the model input to obtain an estimate of the entire wa with a view to improving the usage rate of images the coefficient of determination r2 of four models are 0 95 roi 1 0 99 roi 2 0 87 roi 3 and 0 96 roi 4 with the residual standard error œÉ ÀÜ of 0 42 0 20 0 70 and 0 40 km 2 respectively for the latter analysis the priority to use roi would follow the order of roi 2 roi 4 roi 1 and roi 3 3 2 2 wa wl regression model landsat 5 the was from landsat 5 and the wls from envisat were adopted to construct the wa wl regression model the reason to only use landsat 5 was the few corresponding wl observations during landsat 8 operation in this study the average of the difference between the envisat wls and the corresponding in situ observations is removed from the time series to the same datum for further validation from fig 5 it is obvious that the wls from envisat have good agreement with in situ water gauge records where the std of differences is 1 70 m after checking the quality of wl from satellite altimetry we applied a linear regression model to convert wa to wl with the assumption that the terrain slope of the reservoir is unchanging liu et al 2016 the relationship is illustrated in fig 6 where r2 is 0 99 and the residual standard error is 2 55 m 3 3 variations of wv duan and bastiaanssen 2013 proposed that the total volume of a lake reservoir is composed of a constant minimum wv v con and a variable wv v var the relationship is shown as eq 6 v con stands for a constant wv within a fixed wl to the bottom of a lake reservoir v var denotes the wv variation caused by the changes of wls the schematic diagram is illustrated in fig 7 then we can define a fixed reference wl with respect to a specific time to obtain v con because 1 the purpose of this study is to estimate the relative change of wv for water management because of the lack of terrain data e g dem and it is not necessary to obtain the absolute value of wv 2 this study only utilized a single altimetry satellite thus the vertical displacement between different satellites is not considered 6 v v con v var medina et al 2010 introduced a rough estimation method that assumes an ideal quadrangular pyramid composed of wl wa changes and the lake bottom the variation of wv v t can be derived by eq 7 where s t and l t are the lake surface and lake level as a function of time t 7 v t s t s t 1 2 l t l t 1 in this study eq 7 is further rewritten as eq 8 the differences between the two equations are that s t 1 and l t 1 are replaced by s t reference and l t re f e r e n c e respectively the purpose of rewriting is to ensure the same v con by a fixed reference time in addition it also enhanced the computation efficiency and is convenient to compare the variation of wv directly therefore eq 8 was applied to convert the wa and wl into the changes of wv 8 v t s t s t reference 2 l t l t reference 4 results 4 1 recovered wa results in this study 64 wa estimates are recovered from partially cloudy images of landsat 8 and the data utilization rate can be increased from 23 to 43 i e it is equivalent to obtaining twice cloud free images to examine whether the wa wa regression model established by landsat 8 images can be applied to the different series of imagery 76 cloud free landsat 5 images were utilized for validation according to the order of priority of the wa wa regression model the roi 2 wa wa regression model is implemented and the was computed by the mndwi method were used for comparison the result indicates that the correlation coefficient between was roi 2 and was mndwi is 0 99 with an rmse of 0 85 km2 which shows high consistency and good accuracy thus it demonstrates the possibility of exploiting the wa wa regression model for different series of landsat imagery the overall wa results computed from landsat 5 roi2 cloud free images and landsat 8 cloud free and partially cloudy images along with in situ water gauge wl measurements are shown in fig 8 in a general case low wls should correspond to small was and vice versa this is also a simple way to check whether there is any unreasonable wa result when the ground truth is not available evidently the wls and was derived from landsat 8 do not match well when the was are smaller than 8 km2 the major difference between landsat 5 and landsat 8 results is attributed to the type of image used for computation landsat 5 images are cloud free whereas landsat 8 results were combined from four rois with different accuracy levels besides the difference can be caused by the lack of smaller wa samples in the wa wa regression model from fig 9 most samples were larger than 8 km2 whereas merely two samples smaller than 8 km2 were used for regression in this way the regression model would have good performance and better comprehension on larger wa high wl rather than smaller wa low wl the phenomenon can be further explained by fig 10 and we randomly selected eight cloud free images each a year from landsat 8 including high and low wls from 2003 to 2020 the wa wa regression models of roi 1 to roi 4 are applied to compute the was and then compared with those derived from the mndwi method for low wl i e wa 8 km2 the was computed by the four regression models showed larger discrepancies than those of high wls i e wa 8 km2 therefore the was were prone to be overestimated or underestimated for better realization the cloud free true color images of tsengwen reservoir corresponding to the dates with lower wl were demonstrated in fig 11 according to the water distribution in fig 11 the wa changes are not proportional to the center of the reservoir but are irregularly deformed with the surrounding terrain fig 12 shows the effect of the topography at the bottom of the reservoir on the wa at the high wl 1 and wl 2 it is still within the range of artificially constructed dams so the gradient can be assumed constant along the side slope as the wl decreases to a certain low level the terrain might be affected by siltation or other external forces the assumption of the constant slope is not applicable resulting in the worse estimates of was thus 1 the bottom topography causes the low accuracy of the regression model at low wl and 2 each regression model responds differently to low was due to inconsistent topography in each roi this can also explain why those was are either underestimated or overestimated in fig 10 4 2 2003 2020 wl and wv variations time series wls are computed by the wa wl regression model constructed by landsat 5 imagery and envisat observations to assess the impact of various wa calculations on wl estimates using landsat 5 we used the was derived from mndwi and roi 2 wa wa regression model as the inputs compared with in situ gauge observations the rmse of wl mndwi and wl roi 2 sa are 2 30 m and 2 95 m respectively the results indicate that the wl estimates from these two methods are fairly comparable in accuracy it also indicates that the complete wa may not be an essential component for estimating wls in other words as long as there are enough cloud free images and altimetry wl to establish the wa wl regression model then the partially cloudy images can be estimated by the wa wa regression model to obtain the estimates of the entire was in this way the data usage rate or equivalently the temporal sampling rate can be improved for wls of landsat 8 the rmse and correlation coefficient compared with ground truth are 5 56 m and 0 93 respectively the poor accuracy can be primarily attributed to the following 1 the input data of landsat 8 mixes four roi calculation results with different estimated accuracy 2 tsengwen reservoir is a small inland water body in the mountainous area resulting in low accuracy for satellite altimetry observations and 3 few paired data can be used to establish the wa wl regression model except for the underestimation at low wl most of the wls are consistent with the gauge data to estimate the accuracy at high wl we deleted 13 observations with wl below 192 m and the accuracy is significantly improved with the rmse of 2 30 m if the estimation error at low wl can be reduced applying the wa wl regression model across the landsat imagery is still a feasible and promising method an 18 year wl time series of our proposed method is shown in fig 13 a the estimates at high wl have good agreement with in situ gauge records and can demonstrate the seasonal and yearly hydrological changes from low wls to high wls however there are discrepancies overestimation for landsat 5 and underestimation for landsat 8 at low wl which can be clearly shown as fig 13 b and c by using scatter plots the slopes of linear regression for landsat 5 and landsat 8 are 0 91 and 1 32 with the r2 of 0 98 and 0 86 still indicating the relatively good fitness of wls between on site water gauge and satellite derived results the proposed method certainly provides an alternative method for monitoring the wl of lakes or reservoirs in remote and challenging areas or regions that lack in situ measurements after obtaining the was and wls we can compute the variations of wv via eq 8 then we selected the date corresponding to the minimum wv as the t reference to keep the variations derived from landsat 5 and landsat 8 positive the t reference used for landsat 5 and landsat 8 results are 2004 01 02 and 2019 05 10 respectively meanwhile the water gauge records are deducted by the wv corresponding to the t reference for comparisons with landsat 5 and landsat 8 derived results the rmse between the proposed method and in situ observations for landsat 5 and landsat 8 are 10 084 75 unit 10 000 m3 and 6017 62 unit 10 000 m3 with the correlation coefficients of 0 97 and 0 88 respectively wv variations of the proposed method in 2003 2020 and the in situ records are illustrated in fig 14 a fig 14 b and c illustrate the scatter plots of wv variations between water gauge and landsat 5 and landsat 8 results respectively the slopes of linear regression are merely 0 73 and 0 64 with r2 of 0 88 and 0 77 for landsat 5 and landsat 8 derived results respectively although the data did not match each other well the trends in the estimates of wv variations are similar moreover the topographic data i e dem were not included in this study and the changes of water storage simply combined the estimates of wa wl in a simple model errors resulting from the estimates of wa wl and the terrain effects accumulate in the process of calculating wv variations therefore it is reasonable that the error in the estimation of wv changes is relatively large yet the study fully demonstrated the possibility and potential of the integrated remote sensing approach to monitor the hydrological parameters including wa wl and wv for a small inland water body in mountainous areas 5 discussions in this study we adopted the water index mndwi with landsat 8 qa band to partially mitigate the cloud effects on optical satellite images and successfully increase the number of images by wa wa regression model then the recovered was can be used for the conversion to wls in addition the wa wa model established by landsat 8 can be further applied to landsat 5 imagery it solved the issue that we can only acquire cloud free images for most optical satellite applications also wls and wv variations of a small water body surrounded by mountains are obtained by integrating satellite altimetry and landsat imagery without additional information such as topographic data for our scenario as long as the water body of interest can be captured by satellite images and with enough altimetry data to establish wa wa and wa wl models it is expected that the hydrological changes of the water body at a certain level of accuracy can be achieved and better performance at high wl however there are still improvements for further studies first the criteria to select the roi and how many rois should be utilized to improve the results which would be directly linked to topographical circumstances and meteorological situations near the water body second multi mission satellite altimetry satellites should be considered as possible to enhance the robustness of the wa wl regression model especially for low wls in addition different order of regression models can be validated to achieve better fitness of the relationship between wa and wl of the water body last but not the least the additional topographic data i e dem can be included to precisely compute the wv undoubtedly but again the target of this study is to introduce a scheme that can be generally applied to the remote area with no ground truth or supplementary data 6 conclusions this study aims at integrating remote sensing techniques including landsat imagery and satellite altimetry to monitor a multi decadal time series 2003 2020 of wl and wv variations for a small inland water body in the vicinity of mountains meanwhile the estimated hydrometric parameters are validated and assessed using in situ data as demonstrated in the tsengwen reservoir case the wa wa regression model proposed to recover the water area from a partially cloud contaminated landsat image could increase the data usage rate from 23 to 43 besides a square kilometer level and a meter level accuracy can be achieved for wa and wl estimation but the accuracy decreases with the drops of wl it is expected to improve the accuracy and robustness of the regression models by 1 fine tuning the usage of rois if the topographic data is available 2 adopting the wls from laser altimetry instead of radar altimetry and 3 utilizing high resolution optical images such as sentinel and formosat 2 5 on the other hand the national aeronautics and space administration schedules to launch the surface water and ocean topography satellite by the end of 2022 carrying a high resolution satellite radar that can monitor rivers and other small water bodies worldwide it will be another powerful technique that can be combined for further studies in summary this study successfully provides a potential method to serve as a supplementary or alternative tool for evaluating the hydrological parameters of surface water bodies in remote areas the procedure can be applied to any inland water bodies covered by altimetry and optical satellites in addition the monitoring results can assist local governments or global societies to develop better strategies for water resources management credit authorship contribution statement chi ming lee software validation formal analysis visualization conceptualization writing

7808,study region the eastern coast of new caledonia sw pacific study focus the hydrothiem hydrological observatory is devoted to the study of the impact of invasive ungulate species and bushfires on water resources erosion and water quality in a catchment used for drinking water it includes 1 three 100 m2 plots located on characteristic land surfaces i e a woody savanna submitted to bushfires every few years a healthy forest and a forest strongly degraded by deer and wild pigs 2 two watersheds covering areas of 25 200 m2 and 3 1 km2 the first watershed includes mostly savanna while the second one is mostly constituted of humid forest available data include rainfall soil moisture discharge and suspended matter concentration new hydrological insight discharge and erosion rates exhibit striking differences between the three plots the healthy forest presents a 3 runoff and almost no erosion the degraded forest being characterized by a 90 runoff and large erosion the savanna presenting intermediate values of runoff and erosion the largest watershed present a 64 runoff and an erosion rate amounting to 72 of the one of the degraded plot this emphasizes the role of subsurface flow and of gully erosion respectively results from the hydrothiem observatory can be used for a comparison with similar watersheds and may suggest guidelines for restoration and conservation strategies graphical abstract ga1 keywords hydrologic regime erosion degraded land surface bushfire savanna tropical forest tropical climate invasive animal species new caledonia data availability data are available in repository site see 4 1 introduction wildfires are a general concern worldwide recently emphasis was set on giant wildfires and their immediate and long term environmental consequences duncombe 2020 especially on the hydrosedimentary regime of burned surfaces viera et al 2015 stavi 2019 ebel et al 2022 besides stable patterns of forest and savanna may be maintained in the tropics by frequent and low severity fires due to tree cover fire feedbacks murphy and bowman 2012 contrasted soil properties result from gradation in fire severity mataix solera et al 2011 moody et al 2016 which also result in contrasted hydrosedimentary responses to fire moody et al 2013 the east coast of new caledonia sw pacific presents a high frequency of human induced fires termed locally as bushfires which constitute a common agricultural practice near villages and a space management tool for hunting activities toussaint 2020 more than 70 of bushfires occur at less than 0 5 km from an access road or an house dumas et al 2013 and it is estimated by local people that each surface located a few km away from a road or a village is burned every 3 yrs this produces a woody savanna land surface characterized by an herbaceous strata including mostly invasive species and an unique and fire resistant woody species melaleuca quinquenervia ibanez et al 2013 as a consequence of seeds dispersal and fire dynamics savannas are present near crest lines ibanez et al 2013 and may impact the hydrosedimentary regime of forests located downstream tramier et al 2021 in new caledonia the population of deer cervus timorensis and of wild pigs sus scrofa has dramatically increased for the last 30 years and they are now considered as a threat to forests de garine wichatitsky et al 2009 deer browse the regeneration strata and wild pigs scour the soil impacts of deer on forests equilibrium are a general concern martin and baltzinger 2002 davis et al 2016 as invasive ungulate species impact soil and root properties consequences are expected on the hydrological regime of degraded surfaces however very few studies dealt with effects of ungulate species on the hydrological and erosion regime of forests nakagawa 2021 the hydrothiem observatory is devoted to hydrological studies of individual surfaces degraded by low intensity wildfires and by invasive ungulate fauna by comparison with a healthy forest surface as well as with a mosaic of such surfaces at the scale of a small catchments since the setup of this observatory in 2017 it produced an unprecedented dataset in the southern pacific region allowing an understanding of flow generation and erosion at the scale of erosion plots and small catchments data recorded between 0ct 2018 and march 2021 are presented including rainfall discharge suspended matter concentration smc erosion and soil moisture these data could be useful for researchers working on impacts of fire and of ungulate invasive fauna as well as for comparison of different examples of tropical forests and savannas 2 study area the hydrothiem hydrological site is located near the village of touho on the windward coast of grande terre the main island of new caledonia sw pacific in the 64 km2 watershed of the thiem river fig 1 it is included in the massif des levres which is the second largest massif in grande terre culminating at 1076 m altitude the thiem river drains in the lagoon surrounding grande terre which is a hot spot of biodiversity and one of the world heritage sites of unesco climate is wet tropical with a marked rainy and warm season between december and march and a drier and cooler season between june and september rainfall is strongly modulated by enso el ni√±o southern oscillation el ni√±o years are dryer while la ni√±a corresponds to humid years during the wet season the study area is exposed to tropical depressions and cyclones with rainfall amounting to several hundred of mm in a few days maitrepierre 2012 temperature variations are limited all year long and the mean annual rainfall at zero altitude is 2400 mm fig 2 the basement consists of low temperature high pressure metasediments with limited outcrops of ultramafic serpentines less than 10 in area generally corresponding to crest lines maurizot et al 2020 this basement is topped with a weathering profile characteristic of a humid tropical climate there are only poor data on the weathering profile of micaschists of grande terre maurizot et al 2020 but it is expected to correspond to the general pattern of weathering of basement rocks and to include from top to bottom an organic layer layer b a lateritic layer up to a few tens meter thick and including clay minerals according to the composition of the parent rocks a saprolitic layer where fragments of the original parent rock can be recognized and finally at the base of the profile a fissured layer up to a few tens meter thick lachassagne et al 2021 both the superficial organic layer and the fissured layer present significant permeability 3 instrumentation data were recorded at three 100 m2 hydrosedimentary plots sav regen and scar and at two small catchments barr and capt which are indicated in fig 1 and described in sections 3 2 and 3 3 the type of data recorded at each plot or catchment is indicated in table 1 and each data type is discussed below 3 1 rainfall five automatic tipping bucket raingauges were installed sav regen and scar are equipped with campbell cs 701 raingauges which allow to record rainfall with a 2 accuracy for intensities in the 0 250 mm h range and a 3 accuracy in the 250 500 mm h range rainfall data were recorded at a 6 min time step by cr 200x data loggers these three raingauges were calibrated in the field in 2019 and 2021 according to the manufacturer s specifications and rainfall data are available continuously between may 2018 and oct 2021 two additional onset rg3 m raingauges were installed in the upper capt watershed and called tipo and tiotei their accuracy is 1 up to a rainfall intensity of 130 mm h and they were calibrated in the laboratory before installation in feb 2020 due to power shortages and failures only discontinuous records are available for these two raingauges altitudes of the five raingauges are 190 m 220 m 345 m 370 m and 400 m for sav regen tipo tiotei and scar respectively with an accuracy of 10 m no corrections were applied to rainfall data cumulated rainfall from the sav scar and regen raingauges are pictured in fig 3 3 2 runoff soil moisture suspended matter and erosion at the plot scale 3 2 1 runoff three plots were installed in contrasted land surfaces with a similar area near 100 m2 20 m 5 m and along similar slopes these three plots were described in tramier et al 2021 and their major features are listed in table 2 the sav plot fig 4a is located in a woody savanna which was subjected to a bushfire in oct 2015 according to local inhabitants this plot was burned again by our team in oct 2019 and allowed to recover spontaneously since then the regen plot fig 4b is situated in a healthy part of the forest while the scar plot fig 4c is located in a forest surface extremely degraded by deer and wild pigs the plots are limited by steel plates pushed down to a nearly 10 cm depth but tramier et al 2021 showed these plates did not prevent subsurface flow from above the plot to enter the plot properties of the contributive areas above the plots are also given in table 2 as well as the topographic wetness indices defined by beven and kirkby 1979 the top of the regen plot corresponds to a local topographic maximum so that there is no contributing area above this plot water is collected at the base of the plot in a gutter inserted down to a mean depth of 16 cm it is directed toward a first well where turbidity is measured then to a 2 m long horizontal channel and to a 244 mm openchannelfow v shaped hs flume weir allowing to measure flow rates ranging from 0 009 to 12 9 dm3 s according to the manufacturer s specifications the water height in the weir is measured in a lateral stilling well with a te connectivity trueblue 555 level datalogger presenting a 2 mm accuracy the channel and the stilling well were levelled each year and we found that a step of maximum height of 9 mm was present at the junction of the stilling well and the pipe bringing water from the channel therefore it was concluded that water levels below 9 mm in the channel could not be measured according to the table provided by the hs flume manufacturer this height of 9 mm corresponds to a flow rate of 0 02 dm3 s this effect does not impact the accuracy of measurements of water heights above 9 mm in the weir the regen scar and sav raingauges were installed less than 200 m away from the corresponding plot in an area devoid of trees discharge from the 3 plots are compared in fig 5 3 2 2 soil moisture partitioning of rainfall between runoff and infiltration depends on the water saturation of the superficial soil layers soil moisture was explored with delta t thetraprobes ml2x and ml3 installed at depths ranging from 0 2 m to 0 6 m in the three plots thetraprobes moisture measurements rely on propagation and reflection of a high frequency 100 mhz electrical signal between four 6 cm long electrodes inserted in close contact with soil the thetraprobes were connected to a gp1 datalogger recording either at a 6 min or at a 15 min time step two pairs of probes were installed at the scar and sav plots at mean depths of 0 2 and 0 6 m in the upper and lower part of the plot while at regen three probes were installed at 0 2 0 45 and 0 6 m depths in the middle of the plot the calibrations provided by delta t for organics soil and for mineral soil were used above and below 0 3 m depth however unrealistic high moistures where produced during rain events with these calibrations reaching 0 8 0 7 and 0 85 at the superficial probes of scar sav and regen respectively by comparison total porosity was measured by the weight difference of soil samples saturated during 12 h in water and oven dried during 24 h the measured porosity at 0 2 m was 58 5 at scar 55 5 at sav and 60 5 at regen therefore moisture data presented here provide only qualitative information on the soil saturation some gaps in the dataset result from failure of one probe or of the datalogger and from removal of the electrodes before setting fire at sav comparison of the moisture signal at regen sav and scar is provided in fig 6 3 2 3 suspended matter concentration smc and erosion at the three plots suspended matter was measured in the hydrothiem site due to its potential impact on coral species of the lagoon suspended sediment transport was also used to compute an estimate of erosion at each plot turbidity was measured with a ponsel ntu sensor using side scattered light in the near infrared domain 880 nm using successive dilutions of a concentrated solution it was determined that these turbidimeters provided a linear relationship between the measured turbidity and smc up to 1 500 ntu for the sediments encountered in the hydrothiem site the time step of the turbidimeters was set to 6 min and reduced to 1 min for a few rain events isolated turbidity peaks were observed either at the 6 min or at the 1 min time step however when two turbidimeters were placed in the reservoir these peaks were only observed on one of them therefore they were considered as artifacts resulting from macrosediments vegetal debris by example and replaced by the mean of the previous and the following data points moreover turbidity in the reservoir was no more considered as soon as the flow from the plot stopped suspended matter concentration smc was measured from samples collected during two different rain events at the sav and scar plots given the low runoff and turbidity observed at the regen plot it was estimated that this kind of surface produced a negligible amount of suspended matter and the relation between smc and turbidity was not calibrated there the following relationships were obtained between smc g m3 and measured turbidity turb in ntu for the scar and sav plots 1 smc scar 0 555 turb scar 45 4 r2 0 99 2 smc sav 0 285 turb sav 0 276 r2 0 90 due to the maximum turbidity observed in our samples these relationships are valid up to 1 100 ntu at scar and to 600ntu at sav the corresponding error was computed with a student law parametrized by the number of turbidity samples 9 for scar and 17 for sav assuming a 0 95 probability the mean resulting error on the validity domain of relationships 1 and 2 was 45 gm 3 for scar and 60 gm 3 for sav discharge was interpolated at the turbidity measurement points to produce an erosion rate computed as the product of discharge and smc maximum and minimum erosion rates resulting from uncertainties on smc and discharge are provided 3 3 runoff and suspended matter at the catchment scale in order to assess the scale effect on hydrosedimentary properties of characteristic surfaces runoff was recorded for two watersheds with increasing size 25 200 m2 and 3 1 km2 and smc was measured on the largest one 3 3 1 the savana watershed 25 200 m2 the smallest watershed is called barr as well its gaging station it includes mostly woody savanna was burned once between 2010 and 2020 and its tree cover increased significantly between 1976 and today it presents a single gully separating two contrasted slopes the southern and the smallest one 5 200 m2 presents a 25 mean slope while the northern one 20 000 m2 presents a 17 5 mean slope and a larger tree cover this watershed is equipped with a double rectangular thin plate weir the upper crest breadth is 1 30 m and its height is 0 345 m while the lower aperture is 0 3 m wide and 0 15 m high the lower and upper apertures allow to measure discharges rates ranging from 0 58 dm3 s to 31 4 dm3 s and from 12 5 dm3 s to 524 dm3 s respectively so that the double rectangular weir provides a discharge versus height relationship valid between 0 58 and 556 dm3 s herschy 2009 the steel plate was inserted in the borders of the gully and perfect sealing between the plate and the gully s banks and bottom was insured by maintaining a thin layer of cement at their junction no overflow above the border of the outer aperture was observed during the monitoring period the height versus discharge relationship is the one of the lower weir for a water height in the 0 03 0 15 m range and discharges of the upper weir and of the full lower weir were added for heights larger than 0 18 m linear interpolation of these relationships was used for heights lower than 0 03 m or in the 0 15 0 18 m range water height was measured with an ott pls probe connected to paratronic mac 10 r datalogger with an associated accuracy of 1 cm discharge errors result from this 1 cm water height error and from a 2 accuracy estimate for discharge equation of rectangular weirs herschy 2009 3 3 2 the capt watershed 3 1 km2 this watershed is mainly constituted of forest presenting a high density and diversity of seedling of the regeneration strata on healthy surfaces and locally some strong degradations by invasive ungulates it constitutes half of the surface draining in the haccinem reservoir which provides drinking water for half of the population of the touho village both the regen and scar plots are located in the forested part of this watershed savana represents 24 of the surface of this watershed the capt hydrological station is located at base of the watershed 200 m upstream of the haccinem reservoir 3 3 2 1 rating curve and discharge at capt the water level is measured with an ott pls probe with a 1 cm accuracy in the 0 4 m range and is recorded at a 6 min time step by a paratronic mac10r datalogger three low flow discharge values were obtained using a mechanical current meter with an assumed error of 10 high flow discharges values were computed from two videos including the cross section where the water level probe is located and where the river bed topography was previously measured these video records were analyzed according to the lspiv method fujita et al 1998 muste et al 2008 using the discharge https discharge ch website which produced a pixel frame image this image was converted to a superficial velocity image using a two steps method firstly the velocity of floating objects within the image was directly measured simultaneously with the video recording using two markers drawn on both banks of the river secondly the observation conditions above the river were exactly reproduced above a grid of regularly spaced ropes and the resulting image was superposed on the pixel frame image in order to measure geometrical deformations of the pixel frame image finally total discharge of the river was computed by point integration assuming that the mean velocity on a vertical line was 0 85 times the superficial velocity herschy 2009 there is a large number of possible errors in the lspiv method and an error of 15 in the high range of those proposed in muste et al 2008 was assumed finally the four gaging points were fitted with a power law relationship resulting in the following equation 3 q 0 0043 h2 82 where q is the discharge rate in dm3 s and h is the recorded stage in cm the exponent of 2 82 indicates that eq 3 is controlled by a section which lies nearly 20 m downstream the gaging station and where the flow becomes turbulent due to a slope discontinuity kennedy 1984 herschy 2009 this equation is accurate only up the highest measured discharge corresponding to h 196 cm while stage values up to 350 cm were recorded however there are no slope discontinuities in the river banks up to h 290 cm so that eq 3 provides a fair estimate of discharge at capt up to this value during the studied period the total discharge above h 196 cm and h 290 cm amounted to 8 and 2 of the total discharge respectively 3 3 2 2 suspended matter at capt turbidity is measured by a campbell obs501 dual sensor probe and recorded at a 6 min time step by a campbell cr300 datalogger both turbidity sensors use light emitted in the near infrared domain 850 nm the sidescatter sensor measures right angle scattered light and is devoted to low turbidities the backscatter sensor works with light scattered at angles ranging from 125 to 170 from the incident beam and is devoted to measurements of large turbidities turbidity data are lacking for a few short time periods resulting from power failures laboratory tests with successive dilutions of a concentrated solution showed that the backscatter sensor provided a linear response up to 1050 fbu this sensor is best suited for erosion studies at the 6 min time step turbidity data from both the sidescatter or the backscatter sensors presented a continuous signal with some isolated peaks which were removed and replaced by interpolation from the previous and the next data point after correction of these isolated peaks the maximum recorded turbidity was 820 fbu which lies inside the range of linear response of the backscatter turbidimeter the relationship between turbidity and smc was established with 39 samples from three different rain events for the backscatter sensor and with 13 samples of clear water for the sidescatter sensor resulting in the two following relationships where smc is in mg dm3 turb bs is in fbu units and turb ss is in fnu units 4 smc bs 2 168 turb bs 78 4 5 smc ss 0 76 turb ss 5 7 errors on smcs computed from eqs 4 and 5 were calculated using a student law parametrized with the number of samples and a 0 95 probability the mean resulting error on eqs 4 and 5 were 30 mg dm3 and 10 mg dm3 respectively we noted that although the optical windows was cleaned at each data upload the minimal observed turbidity was increasing from 0 2 fnu at the beginning of the data record toward 10 fnu at the end of the record this results in a low accuracy of the lowest turbidity values smc was computed by the smc ss equation if turb bs 60 fbu by the smc bs equation if turb bs 80 fbu and by a weighted mean of smc ss and smc bs between 60 fbu and 80 fbu the weight of turb bs increasing linearly from zero at 60 fbu to one at 80 fbu the sm discharge was computed as the product of smc and discharge interpolated at the smc measurement points maximum and minimum erosion values resulting from errors in discharge and smc are provided the sm discharge rate is strongly impacted by uncertainties on the rating curve since highest smc are observed during highest discharges events the total amount of sm discharged above h 196 cm and 290 cm are 45 and 19 respectively so that the largest uncertainties on the rating curve only impact 19 of the total sm discharge cumulative discharge and erosion at capt are pictured in fig 7 4 data availability availability of the different data is provided in fig 8 example of most data are shown in figs 3 5 6 and 7 data are stored on the datasud repository site of ird https dataverse ird fr they are included in the hydothiem directory and metadata are provided new data will be append as soon as these data become available and checked 5 results fig 3 shows that similar rainfalls were observed at the three plots regen receiving most rain cumulated rainfall at scar and sav amount to 86 and 73 of the one at regen on the period displayed on fig 3 there is no systematic altitude effect on these three raingauges which is confirmed if the two additional raingauges tipo and tiotei are considered fig 5 shows that the healthy forest plot regen corresponds to low runoff 3 of the incident rainfall on the displayed period and to dominant infiltration of rainwater which is a common result in tropical forests sidle et al 2001 anache et al 2017 by contrast the degraded forest plot scar produces a large runoff amounting to 90 of the incident rainfall this high runoff is explained by the several water exfiltration zones observed inside the plot the sav plot corresponds to runoff properties intermediate between those of regen and scar no significant change in runoff was observed at sav after the artificial bushfire of oct 2019 tramier et al 2021 show that the large differences in runoff regimes of the three plots persist if the contributive areas above each plot are considered however the absence of any contributive area above the regen plot should be considered for interpreting these contrasted runoff coefficients indeed healthy tropical forests are known to produce large subsurface flow sidle et al 2001 and water infiltrating at regen can exfiltrate lower in the slope so that healthy forest surfaces could produce significant runoff at the scale of a watershed similarly the large contributive area above scar allows a large exfiltration component in the observed runoff and this large runoff could partly explain the degradation at this plot at the scale of the capt watershed the cumulated rainfall amounts to 5180 mm and the cumulated discharge represents 3380 mm of rainfall during the time period displayed on fig 7 this corresponds to a mean runoff coefficient of 64 and therefore to 36 of rainfall returning to the atmosphere or being transferred to aquifers and discharged lower in the river or directly to the sea the resulting maximum et coefficient is 36 which is low for a watershed including 76 of forest this is interpreted as resulting from degraded runoff properties of this watershed water being lost through runoff and not allowed to infiltrate and return to the atmosphere through et in the three plots moisture shows decreasing reaction to rainfall with increasing depth this is best seen in the regen plot which presents three sensors at 0 20 m 0 45 m and 0 60 m and can be interpreted as a progressive decrease of soil permeability with depth the two superficial sensors at sav react strongly to rainfall the bottom sensor presenting slower drying after rainfall the bottom deep sensor 60 cm depth presents a stable moisture near 0 38 a drying during the drought of aug and sep 2019 and is perturbed since its removal during the artificial fire experiment in oct 2019 at scar the two superficial sensors present similar behaviors and react to every significant rain event the two deep sensors present a moisture signal characterized by a slightly large mean value and a lower amplitude reaction to rain events when compared to the superficial ones they react to the most significant rain events which could be related to subsurface flow and water exfiltration in this plot cumulated erosion is computed for the three plots during the 2020 rain season which extended from feb 2020 to may 2020 the regen plot presents low runoff and sediment load therefore erosion is negligible at this plot at scar erosion reaches 26 kg 2 2 105 kg km2 including 14 kg during the single 12 h event of april 20 during the same time period 0 6 kg were eroded from the sav plot including 0 3 kg for the april 20 event hence erosion at the three plots present still stronger contrasts than runoff during the time period displayed on fig 7 cumulated erosion at capt reaches 1 6 107 kg including 0 49 107 kg 1 6 105 kg km2 for the 2020 rain season 1560 mm rainfall and 1 1 107 kg 3 5 105 kg km2 for the beginning of the 2020 2021 rain season 2790 mm rainfall for the 2020 rain season the erosion rate observed at the scale of the whole capt watershed amounts to 72 of the erosion rate observed at scar which is one of the most degraded surface of the watershed since it can observed on the field that extremely degraded surfaces constitute at most 25 of the watershed it can be concluded that erosion at the scale of the capt watershed includes a large part of gully erosion this emphasizes the scale effect on erosion in the capt watershed however erosion values presented here cannot be used for estimating long term erosion since the observation period is too short to include the strongest rain events which control a significant part of erosion nearing et al 2017 6 conclusion the dataset presented here evidence contrasted hydrosedimentary regimes at a 100 m2 plot scale between forest and a savanna submitted to a humid tropical climate scale effect can be addressed by comparison of results obtained at the plot scale and at the two watersheds healthy forest allows infiltration of rainwater while degraded forest is associated to large runoff infiltrated water returns to the atmosphere with et and promotes a smooth hydrological regime of the thiem river through subsurface flow the moderate intensity artificial bushfire set up at sav in oct 2019 did not induce a strong change in runoff or erosion however bushfires may impact the hydrological regime of a watershed by inducing retreating of forests and replacement of forest by savannas therefore conservation strategies of watersheds should include regulation of ungulate species in forest and protection of forest savanna borders from bushfires the dataset gathered in the hydrothiem observatory may help fine tuning of hydrological models such as those of cerbelaud et al 2022 or provide a comparison for researchers working on tropical forests and savannas moreover since individual effects of moderate wildfires and of ungulate invasive species are considered in the hydrothiem project comparison with other degradations such as deforestation can be achieved at the 100 m2 scale as well as at the scale of a small watershed declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

7808,study region the eastern coast of new caledonia sw pacific study focus the hydrothiem hydrological observatory is devoted to the study of the impact of invasive ungulate species and bushfires on water resources erosion and water quality in a catchment used for drinking water it includes 1 three 100 m2 plots located on characteristic land surfaces i e a woody savanna submitted to bushfires every few years a healthy forest and a forest strongly degraded by deer and wild pigs 2 two watersheds covering areas of 25 200 m2 and 3 1 km2 the first watershed includes mostly savanna while the second one is mostly constituted of humid forest available data include rainfall soil moisture discharge and suspended matter concentration new hydrological insight discharge and erosion rates exhibit striking differences between the three plots the healthy forest presents a 3 runoff and almost no erosion the degraded forest being characterized by a 90 runoff and large erosion the savanna presenting intermediate values of runoff and erosion the largest watershed present a 64 runoff and an erosion rate amounting to 72 of the one of the degraded plot this emphasizes the role of subsurface flow and of gully erosion respectively results from the hydrothiem observatory can be used for a comparison with similar watersheds and may suggest guidelines for restoration and

environmental consequences duncombe 2020 especially on the hydrosedimentary regime of burned surfaces viera et al 2015 stavi 2019 ebel et al 2022 besides stable patterns of forest and savanna may be maintained in the tropics by frequent and low severity fires due to tree cover fire feedbacks murphy and bowman 2012 contrasted soil properties result from gradation in fire severity mataix solera et al 2011 moody et al 2016 which also result in contrasted hydrosedimentary responses to fire moody et al 2013 the east coast of new caledonia sw pacific presents a high frequency of human induced fires termed locally as bushfires which constitute a common agricultural practice near villages and a space management tool for hunting activities toussaint 2020 more than 70 of bushfires occur at less than 0 5 km from an access road or an house dumas et al 2013 and it is estimated by local people that each surface located a few km away from a road or a village is burned every 3 yrs this produces a woody savanna land surface characterized by an herbaceous strata including mostly invasive species and an unique and fire resistant woody species melaleuca quinquenervia ibanez et al 2013 as a consequence of seeds dispersal and fire dynamics savannas are present near crest lines ibanez et al 2013 and may impact the hydrosedimentary regime of forests located downstream tramier et al 2021 in new caledonia the population of deer cervus timorensis and of wild pigs sus scrofa has dramatically increased for the last 30 years and they are now considered as a threat to forests de garine wichatitsky et al 2009 deer browse the regeneration strata and wild pigs scour the soil impacts of deer on forests equilibrium are a general concern martin and baltzinger 2002 davis et al 2016 as invasive ungulate species impact soil and root properties consequences are expected on the hydrological regime of degraded surfaces however very few studies dealt with effects of ungulate species on the hydrological and erosion regime of forests nakagawa 2021 the hydrothiem observatory is devoted to hydrological studies of individual surfaces degraded by low intensity wildfires and by invasive ungulate fauna by comparison with a healthy forest surface as well as with a mosaic of such surfaces at the scale of a small catchments since the setup of this observatory in 2017 it produced an unprecedented dataset in the southern pacific region allowing an understanding of flow generation and erosion at the scale of erosion plots and small catchments data recorded between 0ct 2018 and march 2021 are presented including rainfall discharge suspended matter concentration smc erosion and soil moisture these data could be useful for researchers working on impacts of fire and of ungulate invasive fauna as well as for comparison of different examples of tropical forests and savannas 2 study area the hydrothiem hydrological site is located near the village of touho on the windward coast of grande terre the main island of new caledonia sw pacific in the 64 km2 watershed of the thiem river fig 1 it is included in the massif des levres which is the second largest massif in grande terre culminating at 1076 m altitude the thiem river drains in the lagoon surrounding grande terre which is a hot spot of biodiversity and one of the world heritage sites of unesco climate is wet tropical with a marked rainy and warm season between december and march and a drier and cooler season between june and september rainfall is strongly modulated by enso el ni√±o southern oscillation el ni√±o years are dryer while la ni√±a corresponds to humid years during the wet season the study area is exposed to tropical depressions and cyclones with rainfall amounting to several hundred of mm in a few days maitrepierre 2012 temperature variations are limited all year long and the mean annual rainfall at zero altitude is 2400 mm fig 2 the basement consists of low temperature high pressure metasediments with limited outcrops of ultramafic serpentines less than 10 in area generally corresponding to crest lines maurizot et al 2020 this basement is topped with a weathering profile characteristic of a humid tropical climate there are only poor data on the weathering profile of micaschists of grande terre maurizot et al 2020 but it is expected to correspond to the general pattern of weathering of basement rocks and to include from top to bottom an organic layer layer b a lateritic layer up to a few tens meter thick and including clay minerals according to the composition of the parent rocks a saprolitic layer where fragments of the original parent rock can be recognized and finally at the base of the profile a fissured layer up to a few tens meter thick lachassagne et al 2021 both the superficial organic layer and the fissured layer present significant permeability 3 instrumentation data were recorded at three 100 m2 hydrosedimentary plots sav regen and scar and at two small catchments barr and capt which are indicated in fig 1 and described in sections 3 2 and 3 3 the type of data recorded at each plot or catchment is indicated in table 1 and each data type is discussed below 3 1 rainfall five automatic tipping bucket raingauges were installed sav regen and scar are equipped with campbell cs 701 raingauges which allow to record rainfall with a 2 accuracy for intensities in the 0 250 mm h range and a 3 accuracy in the 250 500 mm h range rainfall data were recorded at a 6 min time step by cr 200x data loggers these three raingauges were calibrated in the field in 2019 and 2021 according to the manufacturer s specifications and rainfall data are available continuously between may 2018 and oct 2021 two additional onset rg3 m raingauges were installed in the upper capt watershed and called tipo and tiotei their accuracy is 1 up to a rainfall intensity of 130 mm h and they were calibrated in the laboratory before installation in feb 2020 due to power shortages and failures only discontinuous records are available for these two raingauges altitudes of the five raingauges are 190 m 220 m 345 m 370 m and 400 m for sav regen tipo tiotei and scar respectively with an accuracy of 10 m no corrections were applied to rainfall data cumulated rainfall from the sav scar and regen raingauges are pictured in fig 3 3 2 runoff soil moisture suspended matter and erosion at the plot scale 3 2 1 runoff three plots were installed in contrasted land surfaces with a similar area near 100 m2 20 m 5 m and along similar slopes these three plots were described in tramier et al 2021 and their major features are listed in table 2 the sav plot fig 4a is located in a woody savanna which was subjected to a bushfire in oct 2015 according to local inhabitants this plot was burned again by our team in oct 2019 and allowed to recover spontaneously since then the regen plot fig 4b is situated in a healthy part of the forest while the scar plot fig 4c is located in a forest surface extremely degraded by deer and wild pigs the plots are limited by steel plates pushed down to a nearly 10 cm depth but tramier et al 2021 showed these plates did not prevent subsurface flow from above the plot to enter the plot properties of the contributive areas above the plots are also given in table 2 as well as the topographic wetness indices defined by beven and kirkby 1979 the top of the regen plot corresponds to a local topographic maximum so that there is no contributing area above this plot water is collected at the base of the plot in a gutter inserted down to a mean depth of 16 cm it is directed toward a first well where turbidity is measured then to a 2 m long horizontal channel and to a 244 mm openchannelfow v shaped hs flume weir allowing to measure flow rates ranging from 0 009 to 12 9 dm3 s according to the manufacturer s specifications the water height in the weir is measured in a lateral stilling well with a te connectivity trueblue 555 level datalogger presenting a 2 mm accuracy the channel and the stilling well were levelled each year and we found that a step of maximum height of 9 mm was present at the junction of the stilling well and the pipe bringing water from the channel therefore it was concluded that water levels below 9 mm in the channel could not be measured according to the table provided by the hs flume manufacturer this height of 9 mm corresponds to a flow rate of 0 02 dm3 s this effect does not impact the accuracy of measurements of water heights above 9 mm in the weir the regen scar and sav raingauges were installed less than 200 m away from the corresponding plot in an area devoid of trees discharge from the 3 plots are compared in fig 5 3 2 2 soil moisture partitioning of rainfall between runoff and infiltration depends on the water saturation of the superficial soil layers soil moisture was explored with delta t thetraprobes ml2x and ml3 installed at depths ranging from 0 2 m to 0 6 m in the three plots thetraprobes moisture measurements rely on propagation and reflection of a high frequency 100 mhz electrical signal between four 6 cm long electrodes inserted in close contact with soil the thetraprobes were connected to a gp1 datalogger recording either at a 6 min or at a 15 min time step two pairs of probes were installed at the scar and sav plots at mean depths of 0 2 and 0 6 m in the upper and lower part of the plot while at regen three probes were installed at 0 2 0 45 and 0 6 m depths in the middle of the plot the calibrations provided by delta t for organics soil and for mineral soil were used above and below 0 3 m depth however unrealistic high moistures where produced during rain events with these calibrations reaching 0 8 0 7 and 0 85 at the superficial probes of scar sav and regen respectively by comparison total porosity was measured by the weight difference of soil samples saturated during 12 h in water and oven dried during 24 h the measured porosity at 0 2 m was 58 5 at scar 55 5 at sav and 60 5 at regen therefore moisture data presented here provide only qualitative information on the soil saturation some gaps in the dataset result from failure of one probe or of the datalogger and from removal of the electrodes before setting fire at sav comparison of the moisture signal at regen sav and scar is provided in fig 6 3 2 3 suspended matter concentration smc and erosion at the three plots suspended matter was measured in the hydrothiem site due to its potential impact on coral species of the lagoon suspended sediment transport was also used to compute an estimate of erosion at each plot turbidity was measured with a ponsel ntu sensor using side scattered light in the near infrared domain 880 nm using successive dilutions of a concentrated solution it was determined that these turbidimeters provided a linear relationship between the measured turbidity and smc up to 1 500 ntu for the sediments encountered in the hydrothiem site the time step of the turbidimeters was set to 6 min and reduced to 1 min for a few rain events isolated turbidity peaks were observed either at the 6 min or at the 1 min time step however when two turbidimeters were placed in the reservoir these peaks were only observed on one of them therefore they were considered as artifacts resulting from macrosediments vegetal debris by example and replaced by the mean of the previous and the following data points moreover turbidity in the reservoir was no more considered as soon as the flow from the plot stopped suspended matter concentration smc was measured from samples collected during two different rain events at the sav and scar plots given the low runoff and turbidity observed at the regen plot it was estimated that this kind of surface produced a negligible amount of suspended matter and the relation between smc and turbidity was not calibrated there the following relationships were obtained between smc g m3 and measured turbidity turb in ntu for the scar and sav plots 1 smc scar 0 555 turb scar 45 4 r2 0 99 2 smc sav 0 285 turb sav 0 276 r2 0 90 due to the maximum turbidity observed in our samples these relationships are valid up to 1 100 ntu at scar and to 600ntu at sav the corresponding error was computed with a student law parametrized by the number of turbidity samples 9 for scar and 17 for sav assuming a 0 95 probability the mean resulting error on the validity domain of relationships 1 and 2 was 45 gm 3 for scar and 60 gm 3 for sav discharge was interpolated at the turbidity measurement points to produce an erosion rate computed as the product of discharge and smc maximum and minimum erosion rates resulting from uncertainties on smc and discharge are provided 3 3 runoff and suspended matter at the catchment scale in order to assess the scale effect on hydrosedimentary properties of characteristic surfaces runoff was recorded for two watersheds with increasing size 25 200 m2 and 3 1 km2 and smc was measured on the largest one 3 3 1 the savana watershed 25 200 m2 the smallest watershed is called barr as well its gaging station it includes mostly woody savanna was burned once between 2010 and 2020 and its tree cover increased significantly between 1976 and today it presents a single gully separating two contrasted slopes the southern and the smallest one 5 200 m2 presents a 25 mean slope while the northern one 20 000 m2 presents a 17 5 mean slope and a larger tree cover this watershed is equipped with a double rectangular thin plate weir the upper crest breadth is 1 30 m and its height is 0 345 m while the lower aperture is 0 3 m wide and 0 15 m high the lower and upper apertures allow to measure discharges rates ranging from 0 58 dm3 s to 31 4 dm3 s and from 12 5 dm3 s to 524 dm3 s respectively so that the double rectangular weir provides a discharge versus height relationship valid between 0 58 and 556 dm3 s herschy 2009 the steel plate was inserted in the borders of the gully and perfect sealing between the plate and the gully s banks and bottom was insured by maintaining a thin layer of cement at their junction no overflow above the border of the outer aperture was observed during the monitoring period the height versus discharge relationship is the one of the lower weir for a water height in the 0 03 0 15 m range and discharges of the upper weir and of the full lower weir were added for heights larger than 0 18 m linear interpolation of these relationships was used for heights lower than 0 03 m or in the 0 15 0 18 m range water height was measured with an ott pls probe connected to paratronic mac 10 r datalogger with an associated accuracy of 1 cm discharge errors result from this 1 cm water height error and from a 2 accuracy estimate for discharge equation of rectangular weirs herschy 2009 3 3 2 the capt watershed 3 1 km2 this watershed is mainly constituted of forest presenting a high density and diversity of seedling of the regeneration strata on healthy surfaces and locally some strong degradations by invasive ungulates it constitutes half of the surface draining in the haccinem reservoir which provides drinking water for half of the population of the touho village both the regen and scar plots are located in the forested part of this watershed savana represents 24 of the surface of this watershed the capt hydrological station is located at base of the watershed 200 m upstream of the haccinem reservoir 3 3 2 1 rating curve and discharge at capt the water level is measured with an ott pls probe with a 1 cm accuracy in the 0 4 m range and is recorded at a 6 min time step by a paratronic mac10r datalogger three low flow discharge values were obtained using a mechanical current meter with an assumed error of 10 high flow discharges values were computed from two videos including the cross section where the water level probe is located and where the river bed topography was previously measured these video records were analyzed according to the lspiv method fujita et al 1998 muste et al 2008 using the discharge https discharge ch website which produced a pixel frame image this image was converted to a superficial velocity image using a two steps method firstly the velocity of floating objects within the image was directly measured simultaneously with the video recording using two markers drawn on both banks of the river secondly the observation conditions above the river were exactly reproduced above a grid of regularly spaced ropes and the resulting image was superposed on the pixel frame image in order to measure geometrical deformations of the pixel frame image finally total discharge of the river was computed by point integration assuming that the mean velocity on a vertical line was 0 85 times the superficial velocity herschy 2009 there is a large number of possible errors in the lspiv method and an error of 15 in the high range of those proposed in muste et al 2008 was assumed finally the four gaging points were fitted with a power law relationship resulting in the following equation 3 q 0 0043 h2 82 where q is the discharge rate in dm3 s and h is the recorded stage in cm the exponent of 2 82 indicates that eq 3 is controlled by a section which lies nearly 20 m downstream the gaging station and where the flow becomes turbulent due to a slope discontinuity kennedy 1984 herschy 2009 this equation is accurate only up the highest measured discharge corresponding to h 196 cm while stage values up to 350 cm were recorded however there are no slope discontinuities in the river banks up to h 290 cm so that eq 3 provides a fair estimate of discharge at capt up to this value during the studied period the total discharge above h 196 cm and h 290 cm amounted to 8 and 2 of the total discharge respectively 3 3 2 2 suspended matter at capt turbidity is measured by a campbell obs501 dual sensor probe and recorded at a 6 min time step by a campbell cr300 datalogger both turbidity sensors use light emitted in the near infrared domain 850 nm the sidescatter sensor measures right angle scattered light and is devoted to low turbidities the backscatter sensor works with light scattered at angles ranging from 125 to 170 from the incident beam and is devoted to measurements of large turbidities turbidity data are lacking for a few short time periods resulting from power failures laboratory tests with successive dilutions of a concentrated solution showed that the backscatter sensor provided a linear response up to 1050 fbu this sensor is best suited for erosion studies at the 6 min time step turbidity data from both the sidescatter or the backscatter sensors presented a continuous signal with some isolated peaks which were removed and replaced by interpolation from the previous and the next data point after correction of these isolated peaks the maximum recorded turbidity was 820 fbu which lies inside the range of linear response of the backscatter turbidimeter the relationship between turbidity and smc was established with 39 samples from three different rain events for the backscatter sensor and with 13 samples of clear water for the sidescatter sensor resulting in the two following relationships where smc is in mg dm3 turb bs is in fbu units and turb ss is in fnu units 4 smc bs 2 168 turb bs 78 4 5 smc ss 0 76 turb ss 5 7 errors on smcs computed from eqs 4 and 5 were calculated using a student law parametrized with the number of samples and a 0 95 probability the mean resulting error on eqs 4 and 5 were 30 mg dm3 and 10 mg dm3 respectively we noted that although the optical windows was cleaned at each data upload the minimal observed turbidity was increasing from 0 2 fnu at the beginning of the data record toward 10 fnu at the end of the record this results in a low accuracy of the lowest turbidity values smc was computed by the smc ss equation if turb bs 60 fbu by the smc bs equation if turb bs 80 fbu and by a weighted mean of smc ss and smc bs between 60 fbu and 80 fbu the weight of turb bs increasing linearly from zero at 60 fbu to one at 80 fbu the sm discharge was computed as the product of smc and discharge interpolated at the smc measurement points maximum and minimum erosion values resulting from errors in discharge and smc are provided the sm discharge rate is strongly impacted by uncertainties on the rating curve since highest smc are observed during highest discharges events the total amount of sm discharged above h 196 cm and 290 cm are 45 and 19 respectively so that the largest uncertainties on the rating curve only impact 19 of the total sm discharge cumulative discharge and erosion at capt are pictured in fig 7 4 data availability availability of the different data is provided in fig 8 example of most data are shown in figs 3 5 6 and 7 data are stored on the datasud repository site of ird https dataverse ird fr they are included in the hydothiem directory and metadata are provided new data will be append as soon as these data become available and checked 5 results fig 3 shows that similar rainfalls were observed at the three plots regen receiving most rain cumulated rainfall at scar and sav amount to 86 and 73 of the one at regen on the period displayed on fig 3 there is no systematic altitude effect on these three raingauges which is confirmed if the two additional raingauges tipo and tiotei are considered fig 5 shows that the healthy forest plot regen corresponds to low runoff 3 of the incident rainfall on the displayed period and to dominant infiltration of rainwater which is a common result in tropical forests sidle et al 2001 anache et al 2017 by contrast the degraded forest plot scar produces a large runoff amounting to 90 of the incident rainfall this high runoff is explained by the several water exfiltration zones observed inside the plot the sav plot corresponds to runoff properties intermediate between those of regen and scar no significant change in runoff was observed at sav after the artificial bushfire of oct 2019 tramier et al 2021 show that the large differences in runoff regimes of the three plots persist if the contributive areas above each plot are considered however the absence of any contributive area above the regen plot should be considered for interpreting these contrasted runoff coefficients indeed healthy tropical forests are known to produce large subsurface flow sidle et al 2001 and water infiltrating at regen can exfiltrate lower in the slope so that healthy forest surfaces could produce significant runoff at the scale of a watershed similarly the large contributive area above scar allows a large exfiltration component in the observed runoff and this large runoff could partly explain the degradation at this plot at the scale of the capt watershed the cumulated rainfall amounts to 5180 mm and the cumulated discharge represents 3380 mm of rainfall during the time period displayed on fig 7 this corresponds to a mean runoff coefficient of 64 and therefore to 36 of rainfall returning to the atmosphere or being transferred to aquifers and discharged lower in the river or directly to the sea the resulting maximum et coefficient is 36 which is low for a watershed including 76 of forest this is interpreted as resulting from degraded runoff properties of this watershed water being lost through runoff and not allowed to infiltrate and return to the atmosphere through et in the three plots moisture shows decreasing reaction to rainfall with increasing depth this is best seen in the regen plot which presents three sensors at 0 20 m 0 45 m and 0 60 m and can be interpreted as a progressive decrease of soil permeability with depth the two superficial sensors at sav react strongly to rainfall the bottom sensor presenting slower drying after rainfall the bottom deep sensor 60 cm depth presents a stable moisture near 0 38 a drying during the drought of aug and sep 2019 and is perturbed since its removal during the artificial fire experiment in oct 2019 at scar the two superficial sensors present similar behaviors and react to every significant rain event the two deep sensors present a moisture signal characterized by a slightly large mean value and a lower amplitude reaction to rain events when compared to the superficial ones they react to the most significant rain events which could be related to subsurface flow and water exfiltration in this plot cumulated erosion is computed for the three plots during the 2020 rain season which extended from feb 2020 to may 2020 the regen plot presents low runoff and sediment load therefore erosion is negligible at this plot at scar erosion reaches 26 kg 2 2 105 kg km2 including 14 kg during the single 12 h event of april 20 during the same time period 0 6 kg were eroded from the sav plot including 0 3 kg for the april 20 event hence erosion at the three plots present still stronger contrasts than runoff during the time period displayed on fig 7 cumulated erosion at capt reaches 1 6 107 kg including 0 49 107 kg 1 6 105 kg km2 for the 2020 rain season 1560 mm rainfall and 1 1 107 kg 3 5 105 kg km2 for the beginning of the 2020 2021 rain season 2790 mm rainfall for the 2020 rain season the erosion rate observed at the scale of the whole capt watershed amounts to 72 of the erosion rate observed at scar which is one of the most degraded surface of the watershed since it can observed on the field that extremely degraded surfaces constitute at most 25 of the watershed it can be concluded that erosion at the scale of the capt watershed includes a large part of gully erosion this emphasizes the scale effect on erosion in the capt watershed however erosion values presented here cannot be used for estimating long term erosion since the observation period is too short to include the strongest rain events which control a significant part of erosion nearing et al 2017 6 conclusion the dataset presented here evidence contrasted hydrosedimentary regimes at a 100 m2 plot scale between forest and a savanna submitted to a humid tropical climate scale effect can be addressed by comparison of results obtained at the plot scale and at the two watersheds healthy forest allows infiltration of rainwater while degraded forest is associated to large runoff infiltrated water returns to the atmosphere with et and promotes a smooth hydrological regime of the thiem river through subsurface flow the moderate intensity artificial bushfire set up at sav in oct 2019 did not induce a strong change in runoff or erosion however bushfires may impact the hydrological regime of a watershed by inducing retreating of forests and replacement of forest by savannas therefore conservation strategies of watersheds should include regulation of ungulate species in forest and protection of forest savanna borders from bushfires the dataset gathered in the hydrothiem observatory may help fine tuning of hydrological models such as those of cerbelaud et al 2022 or provide a comparison for researchers working on tropical forests and savannas moreover since individual effects of moderate wildfires and of ungulate invasive species are considered in the hydrothiem project comparison with other degradations such as deforestation can be achieved at the 100

ncep forecasts showed good performance in various studies for precipitation and temperature forecasting phan van et al 2018 sangelantoni et al 2019 yuan et al 2013 and drought prediction lang et al 2020 these forecasts usually have a coarse spatial resolution limiting their direct use in regional scale applications siegmund et al 2015 therefore a downscaling method should be applied to convert the forecasts for regional scale applications in this regard several studies have applied ai in developing precipitation kisi and cimen 2012 temperature chevalier et al 2011 evaporation dehghanipour et al 2021 and runoff adamowski 2013 munoz et al 2021 forecast models using observed historical data liu et al 2021 however using observational data to forecast future precipitation increases uncertainty because precipitation is a random phenomenon requiring the use of complex dynamics and numerical procedures to be forecast ecmwf 2013 hybrid ai models combine several methods that can reduce uncertainty ahmadi et al 2019 however few studies have applied hybrid ai for downscaling seasonal weather forecasts sun and lan 2021 in addition to using deterministic ai methods probabilistic models such as bbns have been applied for estimating weather variables such as precipitation hruschka and nicoletti 2013 while bbns are an appropriate approach in situations with high uncertainty and complexity molina et al 2013 no study has used this method to downscale seasonal weather forecasts in this study we focus on weather and runoff forecasting in the ulb bukan reservoir is the largest reservoir in ulb and is located upstream of the zarrineh rood river zrr recent research investigated the long term climate change effects on water resources in the zrr basin and indicated a decrease in precipitation upstream of zrr leading to a decline in runoff to bukan reservoir in the future dariane and pouryafar 2021 in the face of reducing precipitation and increasing agricultural water consumption in ulb the development of a runoff forecast system for this reservoir can help policymakers optimize water allocation between agricultural and environmental sectors in ulb while there have been numerous modeling studies in ulb runoff forecasting has received little attention with past studies focusing on either simulating historical hydrological dynamics dehghanipour et al 2020 2019 or developing long term scenarios and projections for the distant future emami and koch 2019 mahmudi et al 2021 moreover the simulation of snow accumulation and river runoff in sub basins upstream of bukan reservoir has only been done on a monthly scale so far ahmadaali et al 2017 mostafazade and alizadeh 2020 finally a model that can forecast future water balance components using real time weather forecasts data has not been proposed for the region because most studies used observed historical data instead of forecast runoff gavahi et al 2019 in this study a weather forecast downscaling model is coupled to a daily hydrological rainfall runoff model to forecast inflow into bukan reservoir the resulting runoff and inflow forecasts support water resources management plans to increase the inflow to urmia lake ul and reduce the impacts of both water scarcity and flooding this research has the following innovations compared to previous studies first a weather forecast downscaling model is developed comparing hybrid deterministic ai and probabilistic bbn methods for downscaling the raw ecmwf and ncep weather forecasts second an existing rainfall runoff model is implemented for the first time in this region for modeling daily snow and soil moisture dynamics with a two storage method that accounts for snow accumulation and melt actual evapotranspiration irrigation surface and subsurface runoff and groundwater recharge in contrast previous studies have only considered monthly dynamics resulting in a less accurate simulation of water balance components third although some research has developed a rainfall runoff model for this region these models e g swat are complex and require many input data and calibration parameters since the required data of these models are not available in the study area simplifying assumptions were used to estimate the required data and parameters of the model leading to errors and uncertainties in river runoff simulation however our method uses fewer input data collected in the region leading to no simplifying assumptions and at the same time the complexity of the model improves its performance and maintains the capabilities of previous models the paper is divided into five sections section 2 introduces the study area section 3 describes the methodology including developing the weather forecast model the downscaling methods the hydrological rainfall runoff model and the calibration approach results and discussion are presented in section 4 and the conclusions are presented in section 5 2 study area ulb with an approximate area of 51 760 km2 is one of the largest endorheic basins in iran located in the mountainous region of northwestern iran ul is located in the center of ulb and it is a drainage place of the whole basin s surface water the surface water supply of ul originates from six important rivers zrr simineh rood ajichay ghadarchay shahrchay and zolachay fig 1a zrr is the largest and most important river in ul the average annual runoff of this river is about 2000 mcm and it supplies more than 40 of the total annual environmental flow to ul ghaheri et al 1999 meydani et al 2021 moreover bukan reservoir as the biggest reservoir in the ulb is located on the zrr dehghanipour et al 2020 2019 in this study four sub basins of the zrr basin located upstream of bukan reservoir are selected as a case study fig 1 the sub basins include saqez river zrr upstream khoorkhooreh river and saruq river the mean annual precipitation and temperature are about 650 mm and 10 c respectively for these sub basins yekom consulting engineers 2016 most of the precipitation from mid december to early march is snow fig 2 and the average snow area is 53 of the total area yekom consulting engineers 2016 therefore snow is one of this region s primary water balance components and the flow regime in these sub basins is snow rainy yekom consulting engineers 2016 snowmelt accounts for about 67 of annual runoff there are no significant aquifers in the region bukan reservoir was built in 1971 with a storage capacity of 650 mcm which was increased to 808 mcm in 2005 saruq khoorkhooreh and saqez rivers are tributaries of the zrr and supply additional inflow into bukan reservoir fig 1b bukan reservoir provides drinking water for major cities such as tabriz bukan and miyandoab and it is also a strategic surface water source for irrigated agriculture in sain qaleh and miyandoab plains downstream of the reservoir sain qaleh and miyandoab plains with an approximate area of 17 000 ha and 100 000 ha are the most modern and most extensive agricultural irrigated plains of this basin and about 64 of the rural employment is in the agricultural sector dehghanipour et al 2020 the net annual releases from bukan reservoir amount to 500 and 80 mcm of water to meet agricultural and urban water demands in miyandoab and sain qala plains respectively yekom consulting engineers 2016 3 methodology in this study a runoff forecast model was developed to forecast inflow to bukan reservoir an essential and strategic reservoir in ulb the runoff forecast model helps policymakers optimize allocation to agricultural demands drinking water and environmental requirements downstream of bukan reservoir as outlined in fig 3 this model consists of 1 a weather forecast downscaling model and 2 a hydrological rainfall runoff model meteorological input data for the models were based on observed data from tekab synoptic station for the saruq river sub basin and from saqez synoptic station for the other sub basins fig 1 these two stations were chosen because they have high quality data and little missing data during the modeling period the weather forecast downscaling model was developed to downscale large scale raw weather forecast data of ecmwf and ncep to small scale resolutions the downscaling procedure helps to reduce errors between observed data and the nearest grid point the forecasted weather variables include monthly precipitation and daily temperature since the rainfall runoff model has a daily time scale the monthly forecasted precipitation was disaggregated to daily forecasted precipitation based on the daily distribution of raw forecast data in each month the spatially downscaled and temporally disaggregated precipitation and temperature data are subsequently used as inputs to the hydrological rainfall runoff model the hydrological rainfall runoff model simulates water balance components including snow storage snowmelt actual evapotranspiration surface runoff and subsurface flow for sub basins upstream of bukan reservoir the output of the hydrological rainfall runoff model consists of daily forecasted inflow to bukan reservoir at the beginning of each month and for a 1 month lead time in the following sections we discuss the various parts of both models in more detail furthermore more details are provided in table 1 about the periods and input data used in each model 3 1 weather forecast downscaling model 3 1 1 ecmwf forecasts ecmwf is run by an independent intergovernmental entity supported by 34 european nations these forecasts are based on mathematical models of the atmosphere and oceans to forecast weather variables based on current and initial weather conditions therefore different meteorological organizations operate different models for forecasting atmospheric conditions and the results vary for the same area the ecmwf system has been upgraded every five years with seas5 the fifth and latest seasonal forecast system johnson et al 2019 seasonal forecasts are possible due to the slow evolution of some of the earth s components and their effect on the atmosphere the seasonal forecasts provide information on the upcoming season s weather conditions and are useful for various sectors such as water resources management agriculture health and energy ecmwf 2013 here we use seas5 ecmwf provides seasonal forecast data from 1993 to 2016 as hindcast data calibrated and verified using a set of retrospective seasonal forecasts for past dates and is more accurate compared to the historical data johnson et al 2019 from 2017 onward forecast instead of hindcast data is available in this study the ensemble mean of seasonal monthly and daily weather forecast data i e respectively seasonal forecast monthly statistics on the single level and seasonal forecast daily and sub daily data on the single level were downloaded ecmwf 2021a b these global products have a horizontal resolution of 1 degree the lowest monthly precipitation lead time i e 1 month lead time was selected for downscaling to have more accurate forecasts it should be noted that initially the daily precipitation data were downscaled while the results were not satisfactory because precipitation is a highly uncertain phenomenon so monthly precipitation downscaling was considered as the main objective of this study daily temperature data were downscaled with a 6 month lead time because temperature forecasts are much less uncertain than precipitation 3 1 2 ncep forecasts the us government runs ncep under the leadership of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration and its subsidiary agencies the second version of the climate forecast system cfsv2 became operational in 2011 cfsv2 has higher skill than version 1 due to improvements in the initial state of its underlying model saha et al 2014 data used in this study are from the cfsv2 operational forecasts time series product and monthly precipitation and temperature and daily temperature in this study to prevent confusion and easy understanding of results gfsv2 s products are called ncep for ncep precipitation and temperature forecasts were downloaded for 1 month and 6 month lead times respectively ncep 2011 3 1 3 ai downscaling methods the meteorological models used in this study are global and large scale the outputs of meteorological models need to be downscaled to small scale resolutions in the study region to reduce forecast errors recently ai has been used for downscaling weather forecasts due to its ability to identify complex patterns and unforeseen behavior benderskaya 2013 and its capability of extracting non linear relations from data without prior knowledge of the parametric form of these relations valverde ram√≠rez et al 2006 here we downscale the forecasts to the point scale of synoptic weather stations whose data are used to force the hydrological rainfall runoff model in this study three ai methods are used for downscaling raw weather forecast data as detailed below each method contains parameters that are estimated by minimizing the discrepancy between the downscaled precipitation and temperature estimates and their weather station observed counterparts with discrepancy quantified by eq 1 in addition to nse the rmse criterion is used to quantify performance of the downscaled forecasts 1 n s e 1 i 1 m v o b s i v d o w n i 2 i 1 m v o b s i v o b s 2 2 r m s e i 1 m v d o w n i v o b s i m 2 where v o b s i and v d o w n i are observed data and downscaled forecasts respectively at the synoptic station furthermore the ratio of the train data to the test data was 70 30 more information on three methods is presented in the following sections 3 1 3 1 group method of data handling gmdh the first method is based on a multilayer network where each layer acts as a non linear function of its inputs ivakhnenko 1970 input data define the number of neurons for instance if the number of input variables is k the number of neurons in each layer equals m 2 k which will enter the neuron as a binary permutation fig 4 shows the multilayer structure of the gmdh neural network model the main objective of this method is to define a function that minimizes the difference between downscaled forecast data and observed data of synoptic stations at first as one of the best polynomial equations eq 3 volterra equation was applied to construct a high order polynomial by ivakhnenko 1970 generally eq 3 is used to calculate up to the square terms as eq 4 to determine the correlation between raw forecast data and observed gauge data 3 y a 0 i 1 n a i x i i 1 n j 1 n a i j x i x j i 1 n j 1 n k 1 n a i j k x i x j x k 4 y a 0 i 1 n a i x i i 1 n j 1 n a i j x i x j where a 0 a i a i j are coefficients of variables in the polynomial that can be calculated by the least squares error method x i x j x k are input variables which are combined pairwise in each neuron based on eq 4 and n is the number of variables in each combination n 2 this method considers all pairwise combinations in a time series and each combination is fed to each neuron in fig 4 in other words the coefficients of eq 4 are estimated in each neuron and the output is calculated using input variables then the nse values between model output and data of each neuron are calculated and neurons are sorted based on nse values in order to eliminate deficient neurons step by step nariman zadeh et al 2002 inputs to the gmdh model for downscaling precipitation are a combination of raw forecast data of precipitation at time step t and t 1 the month number and precipitation of observed gauge data in time step t raw forecast and observed gauge data of temperature are input variables to downscaling temperature selected neurons are the inputs to the next layer the process is continued until the last layer in which the obtained neuron is the estimated a 0 a i a i j for the time series 3 1 3 2 support vector regression svr the idea of svr is to approximate the best value within the margin called Œµ sensitive zone by minimizing the error inside a specific threshold like fig 5 for a linear function due to the non linear nature of the problem with the help of svr regression function in the form of eq 5 is obtained 5 f x w œï x b where œï x is a non linear transfer function to map raw forecast data to higher dimensional space w is a weight factor and b is a deviation constant in fig 5 the straight line is the hyperplane that separates the line between two classes in a higher dimension than the actual dimension the dashed line in fig 5 shows the boundaries at a distance Œµ to create a margin between for example raw precipitation forecast data indeed Œµ represents the quality of optimization and states deviation between observed gauge data and downscaled forecast data with the help of risk minimization eq 6 eq 5 is solved at a higher dimension for raw forecast data to make linear separation possible 6 r w Œ∂ Œ∂ 1 2 w 2 c i 1 m Œ∂ i Œ∂ i subject to y i w œï x i b i Œµ Œ∂ i w œï x i b i y i Œµ Œ∂ i Œ∂ i Œ∂ i 0 where x and y are raw and downscaled forecast data respectively in the above equations given the training sample set x i y i x i is the n dimensional input vector for different variables mentioned in gmdh method and y i is the desired 1 dimensional output at the point i x i r n y i r n Œ∂ Œ∂ are slack variables to measure errors for any variable that falls outside of Œµ in upside and downside respectively b r n and w r n are constants for showing deviation and weight factor respectively and c is a regularization constant for balancing error minimization and maximization m is the size of raw forecast data f x is the modeled target that calculates downscaled forecast data based on the observed gauge data dodangeh et al 2020 using the lagrange function method non linear regression becomes eq 7 where kernel function is used to transform data into higher dimension space for more detail about lagrange and kernel transformations see geng et al 2020 yaghoubi et al 2019 7 f x i 1 m Œ± i Œ± i k x x i b where k x x i œï x œï x i is kernel function a gaussian type of kernel equation is used in this study and Œ± i Œ± i are lagrange coefficients nse function eq 1 is used between downscaled forecast and observed gauge data to optimize model parameters including c Œµ and kernel function parameters 3 1 3 3 hybrid ai downscaling method svr gmdh we also test a hybrid approach that combines gmdh and svr fig 6 applying the gmdh and svr forms an efficient downscaling model because of gmdh s capability in modeling highly non linear relations and svr s independence on the dimensionality of the input space due to its model computational complexity dodangeh et al 2020 in this case raw precipitation forecast data are used to produce downscaled estimates with both gmdh and svr and the final hybrid downscaled values are then estimated as a linear combination of the gmdh and svr outputs coefficients b c and d of the linear combination and coefficients of the individual methods are jointly optimized by particle swarm optimization pso with eq 1 as the objective function in order to increase the efficiency 3 1 4 bbn downscaling method bbns were introduced in the late 1980s and they have been used frequently in water resources planning and management govender et al 2021 phan et al 2016 xue et al 2017 for instance bbns were applied to estimate missing rainfall data sun et al 2017 and forecast flood peaks goodarzi et al 2019 khan and coulibaly 2006 reported better performance of a bbn compared to an artificial neural network for simulating daily river flow and reservoir inflow the bbn is a probabilistic graphical model consisting of nodes arranged in an acyclic directional graph nodes represent discrete or continuous random variables and the direction of the arrows indicates whether or not the nodes are dependent on each other the head node of the arrow is called the child node and the start node is called the parent node so that the child node is dependent on the parent node a node without parents and a node without children is called the root node and leaf node respectively if the nodes represent discrete random variables then conditional probability tables cpts are used to quantify the probabilistic influence of the parent nodes on the child node values for the entries in the cpts where each entry represents the conditional probability of a child node state given its parent node states are obtained by training or calibrating the bbn using observed gauge precipitation data from synoptic stations sensitivity analysis and cross validation tests are used to validate the model validation tests are based on the confusion matrix the accuracy criterion and the receiver operating characteristic roc curve fawcett 2006 the bbn for downscaling monthly precipitation forecasts is shown in fig 7 it consists of four nodes i e one child node for downscaled precipitation and three parent nodes representing precipitation forecasts for the previous and current month as well as the number of the current month downscaled precipitation and raw forecast precipitation were classified in two categories to perform probabilistic classification shown in table 2 continuous forecast precipitation values can be obtained by multiplying the probability of each category into the mean of upper and lower limits of table 2 3 2 hydrological rainfall runoff model the hydrological rainfall runoff model was developed using two snow and soil moisture storages illustrated in fig 8 the parameters presented in fig 8 and their equations are shown in table 3 and table 4 for snow and soil moisture storages respectively snow and soil moisture water balance equations are applied for each sub basin on a daily scale the input water balance component to the snow storage is precipitation and its output water balance component is effective precipitation pe table 3 in particular effective precipitation pe enters the soil moisture storage dependent on the air temperature and its comparison with freezing point tf and melting point tm fig 8 the output components of soil moisture storage include actual evapotranspiration etac irrigation qisw qigw surface runoff qsur subsurface runoff qint and groundwater recharge qr as shown in table 4 these output components are calculated by empirical functions based on relative soil water content z1 the value of z1 varies between 0 dry soil and 1 saturated soil the two storage model contains six parameters 1 freezing temperature of snow tf 2 melting temperature of snow tm 3 runoff resistance factor rrf 4 root zone conductivity k 5 soil water capacity swc and 6 initial soil moisture in the root zone z1 rrf controls surface runoff so that a significant value of rrf causes less surface runoff this parameter depends on vegetation root zone conductivity k is a function of soil type and initial soil moisture in the root zone z1 is the percentage of occupied water ratio to the adequate total root zone storage at the beginning of the simulation we consider four sub basins upstream of bukan reservoir corresponding to four rivers namely zrr upstream saruq river khoorkhooreh river and saqez river fig 1b separate snow and soil moisture storages are considered for each sub basin there is no specific groundwater aquifer in the region due to the mountainous nature of the region yekom consulting engineers 2016 and groundwater recharge is considered zero the observed weather data such as precipitation temperature relative humidity wind speed and sunshine hours were obtained from the meteorological organization of iran the required land use information was extracted from urmia lake restoration program and food and agriculture organization reports land use includes three rainfed rangeland and irrigated groups in the study area table 5 3 3 multiobjective calibration of hydrological rainfall runoff model using mopso optimization algorithm this study used two objective functions based on nse eq 8 and eq 9 the multiobjective perspective can reduce the uncertainty of determining the parameters of the hydrological model compared to the single objective calibration process her and seong 2018 schoups et al 2005 determining the objective functions is one of the essential steps in developing hydrological models in some cases due to the low diversity of observational data lack of soil moisture data and groundwater level and low discharge of rivers in the basin a unique approach should be used to determine the objective functions approaches such as reverse flow pushpalatha et al 2012 or logarithm of flow oudin et al 2006 roodari et al 2020 are suitable for objective functions for this reason the approach of maximizing the simulation accuracy of observed flow and logarithm of flow were used as calibration objective functions in the present study the calibration of the model was done using the observed temperature and precipitation input variables precipitation of upstream bukan reservoir is very low from mid spring to mid autumn as inflow to the reservoir is supplied by snowmelt during these dry months to assess any potential trade offs in the model in fitting low and high flows we use two objective functions that capture these two flow regimes 8 nse q 1 t 1 t q s t q o t 2 t 1 t q o t q o 2 9 nse l o g q 1 t 1 t l o g q s t l o g q o t 2 t 1 t l o g q o t l o g q o 2 where q s t and q o t represent the simulated and observed flow in daily time step respectively q o and l o g q o are the average observed flow and the average logarithm of flow respectively over the calibration period the output of the two objective calibration is a pareto front of multiple solutions and the following euclidean distance ed formula eq 10 is used to identify a single best model run hrachowitz and clark 2017 10 ed 1 n s e q 2 1 n s e l o g q 2 the mopso algorithm was used to calibrate the two objective hydrological model coello et al 2004 fig 9 illustrates the step by step procedure of mopso and its interaction with the hydrological rainfall runoff model in mopso the algorithm starts by creating a random population of x i particles fig 9b so that each particle has an n dimensional set for n calibration parameters in this study each particle is a 6 parameter set of snow and soil moisture storage calibration parameters s w c k r r f z 1 t f t m see table 3 and table 4 with upper and lower limits shown in table 6 each particle represents a set of calibration parameters used to run the hydrological model for the entire simulation period 2001 2014 on a daily time scale daily flow and logarithm flow are simulated by the hydrologic model and they are imported to the optimization model for calculating the objective functions the process is repeated for each particle in the current population finally non dominated particles in the population are saved and added to the pareto set if the stopping criterion of the optimization model is not reached a new population of particles is generated by the optimization algorithm and the entire procedure is repeated finally the best parameters set of pareto fronts with the minimum ed is selected for the hydrological rainfall runoff model more details about mopso and its parameters are presented in coello et al 2004 dehghanipour et al 2019 the calibration period was considered for 11 years in a daily time step a total of 4018 time steps for the period 2003 2014 moreover the period of 1999 2003 1826 time steps was examined as a validation period 4 results 4 1 weather forecast downscaling 4 1 1 ai downscaling methods for a better understanding of the functionality of the mentioned ai methods in downscaling weather forecasts the efficiency of each method was examined separately table 7 summarizes the efficiency criteria of downscaled precipitation forecasts for tekab and saqez synoptic stations the optimization results show that the hybrid approach has far better efficiency than svr and gmdh for ecmwf and ncep data in this case nse values of the hybrid approach were twice those of the non hybrid methods the results also show the better performance of the ecmwf monthly precipitation forecasts for both stations and on both test and train data in all three optimization methods the optimization results of ecmwf are much better than ncep one reason is their different approach in forecasting weather conditions ncep uses a hydrostatic model combined with approximate estimates of topography ecmwf on the other hand uses a non hydrostatic model and more precisely accounts for topographic effects on the weather forecast owens and hewson 2018 saha et al 2010 therefore ecmwf has better performance in mountainous areas sodoudi et al 2010 moreover test data had higher nse than train data as the end of the test data period benefits from ecmwf s new update to seas5 in 2017 which includes an upgraded resolution and many other features table 8 shows that results of downscaling daily temperature at 2 m are similar for both ncep and ecmwf forecasts downscaling temperature with the gmdh method is acceptable since the temperature is not a random phenomenon like precipitation and there is no significant benefit in using a more complex hybrid method the corresponding forecast time series in fig 10 show that the gmdh downscaling method is capable of reducing the difference between observed and raw forecast data 4 1 2 bbn downscaling method the bbn precipitation forecast model was used to forecast monthly precipitation for validating the trained network accuracy criteria confusion matrix table 9 and roc curve fig 11 were calculated for the child output node these are bbn s probabilistic results for showing its efficiency bayesfusion 2017 the roc curve for forecasting precipitation at saqez station is shown in fig 11 the corresponding confusion matrix and accuracy criterion of the station are presented in table 9 and table 10 respectively the values of the area under the roc curve auc for all precipitation categories are shown in table 10 the numbers on the main diameter of the confusion matrix are more significant than the other arrays indicating that the trained bbn simulates the true positive and the false positive with reasonable accuracy for different categories moreover the accuracy and auc values for different categories are close to 1 indicating the bbn s acceptable performance and accuracy 4 1 3 comparison of bbn and hybrid ai downscaling methods fig 12 shows the train and test results of precipitation downscaling methods and observed data in which bbn method was better able to fit the diagram with observed data furthermore the downscaled forecasts from the bbn and hybrid ai methods in 2020 and 2021 were compared with the observed precipitation data at saqez station fig 13 and table 11 the probabilistic categorical forecasts from the bbn model were converted into a single value forecast by computing the average of each precipitation category weighted by the forecast probability of each category fig 13 and table 11 show the bbn has a better performance in downscaling precipitation and it better captures the dynamics in the observed data a possible reason for the better performance may be due to the probabilistic nature of the bbn in better capturing the random nature of precipitation dynamics compared to the deterministic ai methods as discussed earlier the deterministic methods work better for temperature which generally has greater predictability 4 2 hydrological model calibration in this study a computer was used with a 2 8 ghz cpu and 16 gb of ram the running time of the hydrological rainfall runoff model and optimization model took 35 s in the daily time step about 30 s was dedicated to the running time of the hydrological model and about 5 s to call the results of runoff simulation calculate the objective functions in the calibration process and apply new calibration parameters to the hydrological model fig 14 shows optimization results of the mopso algorithm after 7250 model runs for saruq river sub basin it shows no significant trade off between the two objective functions and improving one objective function does not significantly affect the performance of the other objective function this suggests that the rainfall runoff model adequately captures both low flows baseflow and high flows however many errors and uncertainties would occur in a single objective calibration approach for estimating parameters for instance in fig 14 the three points a b and c correspond to maximum simulation accuracy of the logarithm of flow the minimum ed and maximum simulation accuracy of flow respectively based on fig 14 if the one objective calibration was applied to maximize nselogq the value would be 0 55 for nselogq corresponding to point a this value is slightly higher than the value corresponding to the minimum ed in a two objective calibration of 0 54 point b but the nseq in the single objective calibration was 0 2 point a which is very different from the value corresponding to the minimum ed in the two objective calibration which is equal to 0 55 point b convergence of the mopso calibration was assessed by visual inspection of the pareto front and the calibration was stopped when the pareto front did not show significant changes between successive iterations fig 15 shows scatter diagrams of the objective functions versus the calibration parameters for the saruq river sub basin when swc increases the two objective functions first increase and then decrease with an optimal value around 300 mm the concentration of scatter points around the vertical axis in the plots for parameters k and z1 is evident for both objective functions indicating that optimal values for these parameters are close to their lower limit table 6 z1 corresponds to the relative soil water content at the start of the simulation 1 october when rainfall is low and soils are likely dry likewise the small value for parameter k reflects the mountainous nature of the region with soils having low permeability according to fig 15 values of the objective functions are highly sensitive to the parameters representing freezing and melting temperature as would be expected in a region where runoff is affected by significant snow accumulation and snowmelt optimal values of the calibration parameters in zrr upstream saqez river saruq river and khoorkhooreh river sub basins corresponding to maximum nseq maximum nselogq and minimum ed are summarized in table 12 the results of this table show that the optimum freezing point tf and melting point tm for the snow storage of these sub basins are close to the upper limit of these parameters in table 6 by examining the region s data we considered values up to 10 c for melting parameter tm since it may take until may with average temperature of 10 c for snow to completely disappear this shows the mountainous nature of the study area and snow s predominant role in the water balance equation indicating the early freezing of precipitation in winter and the late melting of snow in spring furthermore as discussed earlier z1 and k are closer to their lower limits table 12 table 13 shows nse values for simulating daily river runoff and logarithm of flow for each sub basin during calibration and validation periods most nse values in this table are above 0 5 similar or lower nse values 0 4 0 5 were obtained in previous simulation studies for this basin emami and koch 2019 moriasi et al 2007 with the critical caveat that those were based on monthly flows whereas here we calculate the performance of daily flow simulations for instance fig 16 shows simulated and observed time series of saruq river flow the nse results of table 13 and the comparison of simulated and observed flow in fig 16 show the model s acceptable performance in simulating wet and dry periods within the year as well as simulating drought and wet years finally precipitation and temperature outputs of the weather forecast downscaling model were used to force the hydrological rainfall runoff model fig 17 shows the daily forecasted inflow to bukan reservoir by the runoff forecast system and observed inflow to bukan reservoir in 2020 and 2021 we note that the runoff forecasting model generates accurate forecasts in both dry and wet months with an overall nse value of 0 66 for two consecutive years forecast performance is better in wet months this time period is important because there is a possibility of floods at this time and because it is a non agricultural season during which optimal management of the reservoir could maximize surplus water allocations for meeting the environmental needs of ul the model was also able to forecast days of peak inflow on march 18th and april 8th 2020 and march 15th 2021 forecasting these days is essential from two perspectives first it can lead to better flood management and thereby reduce downstream damages second forecasting the volume of water inflow to the reservoir can help in the optimal cultivation planning so that in case of drought financial losses will not be inflicted on farmers 5 conclusion this study developed and applied the first runoff forecast system on a daily time scale for upstream inflow into bukan reservoir a key component of the water management infrastructure in ulb the forecast system consists of two models 1 a weather forecast model that downscales the large scale weather outputs of ecmwf and ncep to small scale spatial resolutions and 2 a hydrological rainfall runoff model that forecasts inflow into bukan reservoir the weather forecast downscaling model was developed based on two probabilistic and deterministic approaches and produced temperature and precipitation inputs for the hydrological rainfall runoff model three deterministic ai methods including gmdh svr and a hybrid gmdh svr method as well as a probabilistic bbn were used to downscale the raw precipitation forecasts while gmdh was used to downscale the raw temperature forecasts the hydrological rainfall runoff model includes two storages 1 snow storage that simulates daily snow accumulation and snowmelt and 2 soil moisture storage that simulates daily water balance components in the root zone calibration of the hydrological model was performed using the mopso multi objective optimization algorithm to estimate hydrological model parameters for each sub basin upstream of bukan reservoir there is no aquifer in the study area the weather forecast downscaling model results show that the hybrid method performs much better than the non hybrid methods for downscaling precipitation moreover ecmwf s precipitation forecast data are more accurate than ncep for this region the average nse of the hybrid method for ecmwf s 1 month lead time forecast downscaled to individual rain gauges was 0 53 and 0 62 for train and test data respectively by comparing the forecast precipitation of bbn and the hybrid ai method bbn has better performance due to its probabilistic feature that helps forecast precipitation with high uncertainty for instance the nse of bbn and hybrid ai for forecasting monthly precipitation were 0 88 and 0 61 respectively in 2020 and 2021 temperature forecast data of both organizations ecmwf and ncep had acceptable accuracy and similar performance the average nse for train and test data respectively were 0 79 and 0 85 for ecmwf and 0 85 and 0 83 for ncep forecasts with a 6 month lead time the calibration of the hydrological rainfall runoff model indicates that there is no significant trade off between maximizing objective functions for low and high flows and improving one objective function does not deteriorate the performance of the other one in addition the results show that two objective calibration reduces the uncertainty in estimating the calibration parameters compared to single objective calibration the average nse in the calibration period was 0 43 and 0 63 and in the validation period 0 54 and 0 55 respectively for flow and logarithm of flow furthermore the runoff forecast system resulted in daily forecasts of inflow into bukan reservoir with an nse of 0 67 in 2020 and 2021 we conclude that the runoff forecast system developed in this study has high accuracy in forecasting inflow into bukan reservoir policymakers and operators of the reservoir can use the system to forecast inflows to bukan reservoir and optimize water allocation between agricultural and environmental demands moreover this system could be beneficial to trigger prior managerial planning and actions before severe droughts or floods happen the system used in this research can be implemented on other sub basins and reservoirs in ulb to aid runoff forecasting and optimal management of water resources credit authorship contribution statement amirreza meydani conceptualization methodology software data curation visualization writing

focus a weather forecast downscaling model is developed for downscaling large scale raw weather forecasts of ecmwf and ncep to small scale spatial resolutions various downscaling methods are compared including deterministic artificial intelligence ai techniques and a bayesian belief network bbn downscaled precipitation and temperature forecasts are then fed into a rainfall runoff model that accounts for daily snow and soil moisture dynamics in the sub basins upstream of bukan reservoir the multi objective particle swarm optimization mopso method is used to estimate hydrological model parameters by maximizing the simulation accuracy of observed river flow nseq and the logarithm of river flow nselogq in each sub basin new hydrological insights for the region results of the weather forecast downscaling model show that the accuracy of the bbn is greater than the various deterministic ai methods tested calibration results of the rainfall runoff model indicate no significant trade off between fitting daily high and low flows with an average nseq and nselogq of 0 43 and 0 63 for the calibration period and 0 54 and 0 57 for the validation period the entire forecasting system was evaluated using inflow observations for years 2020 and 2021 resulting in an nse of 0 66 for forecasting daily inflow into bukan reservoir the inflow forecasts can be used by policymakers and operators

reservoir data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction increased agricultural water consumption along with repercussions of climate change drought and mismanagement of water resources leads to competition for water supply between agriculture and environmental sectors and has brought adverse environmental effects such as the destruction of ecosystems and natural bodies of water especially in arid and semi arid regions dehghanipour et al 2020 dunn et al 2003 khorasani et al 2018 mancosu et al 2015 sisto 2009 valipour et al 2015 xue et al 2017 seasonal weather forecast models can be an invaluable tool to manage competing water demands from agriculture and the environment rayner et al 2005 seasonal weather forecast models enable water resources managers to adapt their actions to pre emptively resolve any shortages or decide optimal planning applying weather forecasts in water resources management leads to better foresight of water related risks grillakis et al 2018 and increases sustainability in agriculture and natural ecosystems several studies accounted for using weather forecasts in flood management voisin et al 2011 wang et al 2012 multi reservoir operation ficch√¨ et al 2016 and optimal agricultural water allocation kaune et al 2020 the european center for medium range weather forecast ecmwf and the national center for environmental prediction ncep provide real time and seasonal weather forecasts various studies have evaluated ecmwf seasonal forecast capabilities including its temperature forecast performance over south america gubler et al 2020 precipitation performance over central himalaya chen et al 2021 temperature and precipitation skills in the danube basin voisin et al 2011 and prediction of caspian sea level arpe et al 2014 the ncep forecasts showed good performance in various studies for precipitation and temperature forecasting phan van et al 2018 sangelantoni et al 2019 yuan et al 2013 and drought prediction lang et al 2020 these forecasts usually have a coarse spatial resolution limiting their direct use in regional scale applications siegmund et al 2015 therefore a downscaling method should be applied to convert the forecasts for regional scale applications in this regard several studies have applied ai in developing precipitation kisi and cimen 2012 temperature chevalier et al 2011 evaporation dehghanipour et al 2021 and runoff adamowski 2013 munoz et al 2021 forecast models using observed historical data liu et al 2021 however using observational data to forecast future precipitation increases uncertainty because precipitation is a random phenomenon requiring the use of complex dynamics and numerical procedures to be forecast ecmwf 2013 hybrid ai models combine several methods that can reduce uncertainty ahmadi et al 2019 however few studies have applied hybrid ai for downscaling seasonal weather forecasts sun and lan 2021 in addition to using deterministic ai methods probabilistic models such as bbns have been applied for estimating weather variables such as precipitation hruschka and nicoletti 2013 while bbns are an appropriate approach in situations with high uncertainty and complexity molina et al 2013 no study has used this method to downscale seasonal weather forecasts in this study we focus on weather and runoff forecasting in the ulb bukan reservoir is the largest reservoir in ulb and is located upstream of the zarrineh rood river zrr recent research investigated the long term climate change effects on water resources in the zrr basin and indicated a decrease in precipitation upstream of zrr leading to a decline in runoff to bukan reservoir in the future dariane and pouryafar 2021 in the face of reducing precipitation and increasing agricultural water consumption in ulb the development of a runoff forecast system for this reservoir can help policymakers optimize water allocation between agricultural and environmental sectors in ulb while there have been numerous modeling studies in ulb runoff forecasting has received little attention with past studies focusing on either simulating historical hydrological dynamics dehghanipour et al 2020 2019 or developing long term scenarios and projections for the distant future emami and koch 2019 mahmudi et al 2021 moreover the simulation of snow accumulation and river runoff in sub basins upstream of bukan reservoir has only been done on a monthly scale so far ahmadaali et al 2017 mostafazade and alizadeh 2020 finally a model that can forecast future water balance components using real time weather forecasts data has not been proposed for the region because most studies used observed historical data instead of forecast runoff gavahi et al 2019 in this study a weather forecast downscaling model is coupled to a daily hydrological rainfall runoff model to forecast inflow into bukan reservoir the resulting runoff and inflow forecasts support water resources management plans to increase the inflow to urmia lake ul and reduce the impacts of both water scarcity and flooding this research has the following innovations compared to previous studies first a weather forecast downscaling model is developed comparing hybrid deterministic ai and probabilistic bbn methods for downscaling the raw ecmwf and ncep weather forecasts second an existing rainfall runoff model is implemented for the first time in this region for modeling daily snow and soil moisture dynamics with a two storage method that accounts for snow accumulation and melt actual evapotranspiration irrigation surface and subsurface runoff and groundwater recharge in contrast previous studies have only considered monthly dynamics resulting in a less accurate simulation of water balance components third although some research has developed a rainfall runoff model for this region these models e g swat are complex and require many input data and calibration parameters since the required data of these models are not available in the study area simplifying assumptions were used to estimate the required data and parameters of the model leading to errors and uncertainties in river runoff simulation however our method uses fewer input data collected in the region leading to no simplifying assumptions and at the same time the complexity of the model improves its performance and maintains the capabilities of previous models the paper is divided into five sections section 2 introduces the study area section 3 describes the methodology including developing the weather forecast model the downscaling methods the hydrological rainfall runoff model and the calibration approach results and discussion are presented in section 4 and the conclusions are presented in section 5 2 study area ulb with an approximate area of 51 760 km2 is one of the largest endorheic basins in iran located in the mountainous region of northwestern iran ul is located in the center of ulb and it is a drainage place of the whole basin s surface water the surface water supply of ul originates from six important rivers zrr simineh rood ajichay ghadarchay shahrchay and zolachay fig 1a zrr is the largest and most important river in ul the average annual runoff of this river is about 2000 mcm and it supplies more than 40 of the total annual environmental flow to ul ghaheri et al 1999 meydani et al 2021 moreover bukan reservoir as the biggest reservoir in the ulb is located on the zrr dehghanipour et al 2020 2019 in this study four sub basins of the zrr basin located upstream of bukan reservoir are selected as a case study fig 1 the sub basins include saqez river zrr upstream khoorkhooreh river and saruq river the mean annual precipitation and temperature are about 650 mm and 10 c respectively for these sub basins yekom consulting engineers 2016 most of the precipitation from mid december to early march is snow fig 2 and the average snow area is 53 of the total area yekom consulting engineers 2016 therefore snow is one of this region s primary water balance components and the flow regime in these sub basins is snow rainy yekom consulting engineers 2016 snowmelt accounts for about 67 of annual runoff there are no significant aquifers in the region bukan reservoir was built in 1971 with a storage capacity of 650 mcm which was increased to 808 mcm in 2005 saruq khoorkhooreh and saqez rivers are tributaries of the zrr and supply additional inflow into bukan reservoir fig 1b bukan reservoir provides drinking water for major cities such as tabriz bukan and miyandoab and it is also a strategic surface water source for irrigated agriculture in sain qaleh and miyandoab plains downstream of the reservoir sain qaleh and miyandoab plains with an approximate area of 17 000 ha and 100 000 ha are the most modern and most extensive agricultural irrigated plains of this basin and about 64 of the rural employment is in the agricultural sector dehghanipour et al 2020 the net annual releases from bukan reservoir amount to 500 and 80 mcm of water to meet agricultural and urban water demands in miyandoab and sain qala plains respectively yekom consulting engineers 2016 3 methodology in this study a runoff forecast model was developed to forecast inflow to bukan reservoir an essential and strategic reservoir in ulb the runoff forecast model helps policymakers optimize allocation to agricultural demands drinking water and environmental requirements downstream of bukan reservoir as outlined in fig 3 this model consists of 1 a weather forecast downscaling model and 2 a hydrological rainfall runoff model meteorological input data for the models were based on observed data from tekab synoptic station for the saruq river sub basin and from saqez synoptic station for the other sub basins fig 1 these two stations were chosen because they have high quality data and little missing data during the modeling period the weather forecast downscaling model was developed to downscale large scale raw weather forecast data of ecmwf and ncep to small scale resolutions the downscaling procedure helps to reduce errors between observed data and the nearest grid point the forecasted weather variables include monthly precipitation and daily temperature since the rainfall runoff model has a daily time scale the monthly forecasted precipitation was disaggregated to daily forecasted precipitation based on the daily distribution of raw forecast data in each month the spatially downscaled and temporally disaggregated precipitation and temperature data are subsequently used as inputs to the hydrological rainfall runoff model the hydrological rainfall runoff model simulates water balance components including snow storage snowmelt actual evapotranspiration surface runoff and subsurface flow for sub basins upstream of bukan reservoir the output of the hydrological rainfall runoff model consists of daily forecasted inflow to bukan reservoir at the beginning of each month and for a 1 month lead time in the following sections we discuss the various parts of both models in more detail furthermore more details are provided in table 1 about the periods and input data used in each model 3 1 weather forecast downscaling model 3 1 1 ecmwf forecasts ecmwf is run by an independent intergovernmental entity supported by 34 european nations these forecasts are based on mathematical models of the atmosphere and oceans to forecast weather variables based on current and initial weather conditions therefore different meteorological organizations operate different models for forecasting atmospheric conditions and the results vary for the same area the ecmwf system has been upgraded every five years with seas5 the fifth and latest seasonal forecast system johnson et al 2019 seasonal forecasts are possible due to the slow evolution of some of the earth s components and their effect on the atmosphere the seasonal forecasts provide information on the upcoming season s weather conditions and are useful for various sectors such as water resources management agriculture health and energy ecmwf 2013 here we use seas5 ecmwf provides seasonal forecast data from 1993 to 2016 as hindcast data calibrated and verified using a set of retrospective seasonal forecasts for past dates and is more accurate compared to the historical data johnson et al 2019 from 2017 onward forecast instead of hindcast data is available in this study the ensemble mean of seasonal monthly and daily weather forecast data i e respectively seasonal forecast monthly statistics on the single level and seasonal forecast daily and sub daily data on the single level were downloaded ecmwf 2021a b these global products have a horizontal resolution of 1 degree the lowest monthly precipitation lead time i e 1 month lead time was selected for downscaling to have more accurate forecasts it should be noted that initially the daily precipitation data were downscaled while the results were not satisfactory because precipitation is a highly uncertain phenomenon so monthly precipitation downscaling was considered as the main objective of this study daily temperature data were downscaled with a 6 month lead time because temperature forecasts are much less uncertain than precipitation 3 1 2 ncep forecasts the us government runs ncep under the leadership of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration and its subsidiary agencies the second version of the climate forecast system cfsv2 became operational in 2011 cfsv2 has higher skill than version 1 due to improvements in the initial state of its underlying model saha et al 2014 data used in this study are from the cfsv2 operational forecasts time series product and monthly precipitation and temperature and daily temperature in this study to prevent confusion and easy understanding of results gfsv2 s products are called ncep for ncep precipitation and temperature forecasts were downloaded for 1 month and 6 month lead times respectively ncep 2011 3 1 3 ai downscaling methods the meteorological models used in this study are global and large scale the outputs of meteorological models need to be downscaled to small scale resolutions in the study region to reduce forecast errors recently ai has been used for downscaling weather forecasts due to its ability to identify complex patterns and unforeseen behavior benderskaya 2013 and its capability of extracting non linear relations from data without prior knowledge of the parametric form of these relations valverde ram√≠rez et al 2006 here we downscale the forecasts to the point scale of synoptic weather stations whose data are used to force the hydrological rainfall runoff model in this study three ai methods are used for downscaling raw weather forecast data as detailed below each method contains parameters that are estimated by minimizing the discrepancy between the downscaled precipitation and temperature estimates and their weather station observed counterparts with discrepancy quantified by eq 1 in addition to nse the rmse criterion is used to quantify performance of the downscaled forecasts 1 n s e 1 i 1 m v o b s i v d o w n i 2 i 1 m v o b s i v o b s 2 2 r m s e i 1 m v d o w n i v o b s i m 2 where v o b s i and v d o w n i are observed data and downscaled forecasts respectively at the synoptic station furthermore the ratio of the train data to the test data was 70 30 more information on three methods is presented in the following sections 3 1 3 1 group method of data handling gmdh the first method is based on a multilayer network where each layer acts as a non linear function of its inputs ivakhnenko 1970 input data define the number of neurons for instance if the number of input variables is k the number of neurons in each layer equals m 2 k which will enter the neuron as a binary permutation fig 4 shows the multilayer structure of the gmdh neural network model the main objective of this method is to define a function that minimizes the difference between downscaled forecast data and observed data of synoptic stations at first as one of the best polynomial equations eq 3 volterra equation was applied to construct a high order polynomial by ivakhnenko 1970 generally eq 3 is used to calculate up to the square terms as eq 4 to determine the correlation between raw forecast data and observed gauge data 3 y a 0 i 1 n a i x i i 1 n j 1 n a i j x i x j i 1 n j 1 n k 1 n a i j k x i x j x k 4 y a 0 i 1 n a i x i i 1 n j 1 n a i j x i x j where a 0 a i a i j are coefficients of variables in the polynomial that can be calculated by the least squares error method x i x j x k are input variables which are combined pairwise in each neuron based on eq 4 and n is the number of variables in each combination n 2 this method considers all pairwise combinations in a time series and each combination is fed to each neuron in fig 4 in other words the coefficients of eq 4 are estimated in each neuron and the output is calculated using input variables then the nse values between model output and data of each neuron are calculated and neurons are sorted based on nse values in order to eliminate deficient neurons step by step nariman zadeh et al 2002 inputs to the gmdh model for downscaling precipitation are a combination of raw forecast data of precipitation at time step t and t 1 the month number and precipitation of observed gauge data in time step t raw forecast and observed gauge data of temperature are input variables to downscaling temperature selected neurons are the inputs to the next layer the process is continued until the last layer in which the obtained neuron is the estimated a 0 a i a i j for the time series 3 1 3 2 support vector regression svr the idea of svr is to approximate the best value within the margin called Œµ sensitive zone by minimizing the error inside a specific threshold like fig 5 for a linear function due to the non linear nature of the problem with the help of svr regression function in the form of eq 5 is obtained 5 f x w œï x b where œï x is a non linear transfer function to map raw forecast data to higher dimensional space w is a weight factor and b is a deviation constant in fig 5 the straight line is the hyperplane that separates the line between two classes in a higher dimension than the actual dimension the dashed line in fig 5 shows the boundaries at a distance Œµ to create a margin between for example raw precipitation forecast data indeed Œµ represents the quality of optimization and states deviation between observed gauge data and downscaled forecast data with the help of risk minimization eq 6 eq 5 is solved at a higher dimension for raw forecast data to make linear separation possible 6 r w Œ∂ Œ∂ 1 2 w 2 c i 1 m Œ∂ i Œ∂ i subject to y i w œï x i b i Œµ Œ∂ i w œï x i b i y i Œµ Œ∂ i Œ∂ i Œ∂ i 0 where x and y are raw and downscaled forecast data respectively in the above equations given the training sample set x i y i x i is the n dimensional input vector for different variables mentioned in gmdh method and y i is the desired 1 dimensional output at the point i x i r n y i r n Œ∂ Œ∂ are slack variables to measure errors for any variable that falls outside of Œµ in upside and downside respectively b r n and w r n are constants for showing deviation and weight factor respectively and c is a regularization constant for balancing error minimization and maximization m is the size of raw forecast data f x is the modeled target that calculates downscaled forecast data based on the observed gauge data dodangeh et al 2020 using the lagrange function method non linear regression becomes eq 7 where kernel function is used to transform data into higher dimension space for more detail about lagrange and kernel transformations see geng et al 2020 yaghoubi et al 2019 7 f x i 1 m Œ± i Œ± i k x x i b where k x x i œï x œï x i is kernel function a gaussian type of kernel equation is used in this study and Œ± i Œ± i are lagrange coefficients nse function eq 1 is used between downscaled forecast and observed gauge data to optimize model parameters including c Œµ and kernel function parameters 3 1 3 3 hybrid ai downscaling method svr gmdh we also test a hybrid approach that combines gmdh and svr fig 6 applying the gmdh and svr forms an efficient downscaling model because of gmdh s capability in modeling highly non linear relations and svr s independence on the dimensionality of the input space due to its model computational complexity dodangeh et al 2020 in this case raw precipitation forecast data are used to produce downscaled estimates with both gmdh and svr and the final hybrid downscaled values are then estimated as a linear combination of the gmdh and svr outputs coefficients b c and d of the linear combination and coefficients of the individual methods are jointly optimized by particle swarm optimization pso with eq 1 as the objective function in order to increase the efficiency 3 1 4 bbn downscaling method bbns were introduced in the late 1980s and they have been used frequently in water resources planning and management govender et al 2021 phan et al 2016 xue et al 2017 for instance bbns were applied to estimate missing rainfall data sun et al 2017 and forecast flood peaks goodarzi et al 2019 khan and coulibaly 2006 reported better performance of a bbn compared to an artificial neural network for simulating daily river flow and reservoir inflow the bbn is a probabilistic graphical model consisting of nodes arranged in an acyclic directional graph nodes represent discrete or continuous random variables and the direction of the arrows indicates whether or not the nodes are dependent on each other the head node of the arrow is called the child node and the start node is called the parent node so that the child node is dependent on the parent node a node without parents and a node without children is called the root node and leaf node respectively if the nodes represent discrete random variables then conditional probability tables cpts are used to quantify the probabilistic influence of the parent nodes on the child node values for the entries in the cpts where each entry represents the conditional probability of a child node state given its parent node states are obtained by training or calibrating the bbn using observed gauge precipitation data from synoptic stations sensitivity analysis and cross validation tests are used to validate the model validation tests are based on the confusion matrix the accuracy criterion and the receiver operating characteristic roc curve fawcett 2006 the bbn for downscaling monthly precipitation forecasts is shown in fig 7 it consists of four nodes i e one child node for downscaled precipitation and three parent nodes representing precipitation forecasts for the previous and current month as well as the number of the current month downscaled precipitation and raw forecast precipitation were classified in two categories to perform probabilistic classification shown in table 2 continuous forecast precipitation values can be obtained by multiplying the probability of each category into the mean of upper and lower limits of table 2 3 2 hydrological rainfall runoff model the hydrological rainfall runoff model was developed using two snow and soil moisture storages illustrated in fig 8 the parameters presented in fig 8 and their equations are shown in table 3 and table 4 for snow and soil moisture storages respectively snow and soil moisture water balance equations are applied for each sub basin on a daily scale the input water balance component to the snow storage is precipitation and its output water balance component is effective precipitation pe table 3 in particular effective precipitation pe enters the soil moisture storage dependent on the air temperature and its comparison with freezing point tf and melting point tm fig 8 the output components of soil moisture storage include actual evapotranspiration etac irrigation qisw qigw surface runoff qsur subsurface runoff qint and groundwater recharge qr as shown in table 4 these output components are calculated by empirical functions based on relative soil water content z1 the value of z1 varies between 0 dry soil and 1 saturated soil the two storage model contains six parameters 1 freezing temperature of snow tf 2 melting temperature of snow tm 3 runoff resistance factor rrf 4 root zone conductivity k 5 soil water capacity swc and 6 initial soil moisture in the root zone z1 rrf controls surface runoff so that a significant value of rrf causes less surface runoff this parameter depends on vegetation root zone conductivity k is a function of soil type and initial soil moisture in the root zone z1 is the percentage of occupied water ratio to the adequate total root zone storage at the beginning of the simulation we consider four sub basins upstream of bukan reservoir corresponding to four rivers namely zrr upstream saruq river khoorkhooreh river and saqez river fig 1b separate snow and soil moisture storages are considered for each sub basin there is no specific groundwater aquifer in the region due to the mountainous nature of the region yekom consulting engineers 2016 and groundwater recharge is considered zero the observed weather data such as precipitation temperature relative humidity wind speed and sunshine hours were obtained from the meteorological organization of iran the required land use information was extracted from urmia lake restoration program and food and agriculture organization reports land use includes three rainfed rangeland and irrigated groups in the study area table 5 3 3 multiobjective calibration of hydrological rainfall runoff model using mopso optimization algorithm this study used two objective functions based on nse eq 8 and eq 9 the multiobjective perspective can reduce the uncertainty of determining the parameters of the hydrological model compared to the single objective calibration process her and seong 2018 schoups et al 2005 determining the objective functions is one of the essential steps in developing hydrological models in some cases due to the low diversity of observational data lack of soil moisture data and groundwater level and low discharge of rivers in the basin a unique approach should be used to determine the objective functions approaches such as reverse flow pushpalatha et al 2012 or logarithm of flow oudin et al 2006 roodari et al 2020 are suitable for objective functions for this reason the approach of maximizing the simulation accuracy of observed flow and logarithm of flow were used as calibration objective functions in the present study the calibration of the model was done using the observed temperature and precipitation input variables precipitation of upstream bukan reservoir is very low from mid spring to mid autumn as inflow to the reservoir is supplied by snowmelt during these dry months to assess any potential trade offs in the model in fitting low and high flows we use two objective functions that capture these two flow regimes 8 nse q 1 t 1 t q s t q o t 2 t 1 t q o t q o 2 9 nse l o g q 1 t 1 t l o g q s t l o g q o t 2 t 1 t l o g q o t l o g q o 2 where q s t and q o t represent the simulated and observed flow in daily time step respectively q o and l o g q o are the average observed flow and the average logarithm of flow respectively over the calibration period the output of the two objective calibration is a pareto front of multiple solutions and the following euclidean distance ed formula eq 10 is used to identify a single best model run hrachowitz and clark 2017 10 ed 1 n s e q 2 1 n s e l o g q 2 the mopso algorithm was used to calibrate the two objective hydrological model coello et al 2004 fig 9 illustrates the step by step procedure of mopso and its interaction with the hydrological rainfall runoff model in mopso the algorithm starts by creating a random population of x i particles fig 9b so that each particle has an n dimensional set for n calibration parameters in this study each particle is a 6 parameter set of snow and soil moisture storage calibration parameters s w c k r r f z 1 t f t m see table 3 and table 4 with upper and lower limits shown in table 6 each particle represents a set of calibration parameters used to run the hydrological model for the entire simulation period 2001 2014 on a daily time scale daily flow and logarithm flow are simulated by the hydrologic model and they are imported to the optimization model for calculating the objective functions the process is repeated for each particle in the current population finally non dominated particles in the population are saved and added to the pareto set if the stopping criterion of the optimization model is not reached a new population of particles is generated by the optimization algorithm and the entire procedure is repeated finally the best parameters set of pareto fronts with the minimum ed is selected for the hydrological rainfall runoff model more details about mopso and its parameters are presented in coello et al 2004 dehghanipour et al 2019 the calibration period was considered for 11 years in a daily time step a total of 4018 time steps for the period 2003 2014 moreover the period of 1999 2003 1826 time steps was examined as a validation period 4 results 4 1 weather forecast downscaling 4 1 1 ai downscaling methods for a better understanding of the functionality of the mentioned ai methods in downscaling weather forecasts the efficiency of each method was examined separately table 7 summarizes the efficiency criteria of downscaled precipitation forecasts for tekab and saqez synoptic stations the optimization results show that the hybrid approach has far better efficiency than svr and gmdh for ecmwf and ncep data in this case nse values of the hybrid approach were twice those of the non hybrid methods the results also show the better performance of the ecmwf monthly precipitation forecasts for both stations and on both test and train data in all three optimization methods the optimization results of ecmwf are much better than ncep one reason is their different approach in forecasting weather conditions ncep uses a hydrostatic model combined with approximate estimates of topography ecmwf on the other hand uses a non hydrostatic model and more precisely accounts for topographic effects on the weather forecast owens and hewson 2018 saha et al 2010 therefore ecmwf has better performance in mountainous areas sodoudi et al 2010 moreover test data had higher nse than train data as the end of the test data period benefits from ecmwf s new update to seas5 in 2017 which includes an upgraded resolution and many other features table 8 shows that results of downscaling daily temperature at 2 m are similar for both ncep and ecmwf forecasts downscaling temperature with the gmdh method is acceptable since the temperature is not a random phenomenon like precipitation and there is no significant benefit in using a more complex hybrid method the corresponding forecast time series in fig 10 show that the gmdh downscaling method is capable of reducing the difference between observed and raw forecast data 4 1 2 bbn downscaling method the bbn precipitation forecast model was used to forecast monthly precipitation for validating the trained network accuracy criteria confusion matrix table 9 and roc curve fig 11 were calculated for the child output node these are bbn s probabilistic results for showing its efficiency bayesfusion 2017 the roc curve for forecasting precipitation at saqez station is shown in fig 11 the corresponding confusion matrix and accuracy criterion of the station are presented in table 9 and table 10 respectively the values of the area under the roc curve auc for all precipitation categories are shown in table 10 the numbers on the main diameter of the confusion matrix are more significant than the other arrays indicating that the trained bbn simulates the true positive and the false positive with reasonable accuracy for different categories moreover the accuracy and auc values for different categories are close to 1 indicating the bbn s acceptable performance and accuracy 4 1 3 comparison of bbn and hybrid ai downscaling methods fig 12 shows the train and test results of precipitation downscaling methods and observed data in which bbn method was better able to fit the diagram with observed data furthermore the downscaled forecasts from the bbn and hybrid ai methods in 2020 and 2021 were compared with the observed precipitation data at saqez station fig 13 and table 11 the probabilistic categorical forecasts from the bbn model were converted into a single value forecast by computing the average of each precipitation category weighted by the forecast probability of each category fig 13 and table 11 show the bbn has a better performance in downscaling precipitation and it better captures the dynamics in the observed data a possible reason for the better performance may be due to the probabilistic nature of the bbn in better capturing the random nature of precipitation dynamics compared to the deterministic ai methods as discussed earlier the deterministic methods work better for temperature which generally has greater predictability 4 2 hydrological model calibration in this study a computer was used with a 2 8 ghz cpu and 16 gb of ram the running time of the hydrological rainfall runoff model and optimization model took 35 s in the daily time step about 30 s was dedicated to the running time of the hydrological model and about 5 s to call the results of runoff simulation calculate the objective functions in the calibration process and apply new calibration parameters to the hydrological model fig 14 shows optimization results of the mopso algorithm after 7250 model runs for saruq river sub basin it shows no significant trade off between the two objective functions and improving one objective function does not significantly affect the performance of the other objective function this suggests that the rainfall runoff model adequately captures both low flows baseflow and high flows however many errors and uncertainties would occur in a single objective calibration approach for estimating parameters for instance in fig 14 the three points a b and c correspond to maximum simulation accuracy of the logarithm of flow the minimum ed and maximum simulation accuracy of flow respectively based on fig 14 if the one objective calibration was applied to maximize nselogq the value would be 0 55 for nselogq corresponding to point a this value is slightly higher than the value corresponding to the minimum ed in a two objective calibration of 0 54 point b but the nseq in the single objective calibration was 0 2 point a which is very different from the value corresponding to the minimum ed in the two objective calibration which is equal to 0 55 point b convergence of the mopso calibration was assessed by visual inspection of the pareto front and the calibration was stopped when the pareto front did not show significant changes between successive iterations fig 15 shows scatter diagrams of the objective functions versus the calibration parameters for the saruq river sub basin when swc increases the two objective functions first increase and then decrease with an optimal value around 300 mm the concentration of scatter points around the vertical axis in the plots for parameters k and z1 is evident for both objective functions indicating that optimal values for these parameters are close to their lower limit table 6 z1 corresponds to the relative soil water content at the start of the simulation 1 october when rainfall is low and soils are likely dry likewise the small value for parameter k reflects the mountainous nature of the region with soils having low permeability according to fig 15 values of the objective functions are highly sensitive to the parameters representing freezing and melting temperature as would be expected in a region where runoff is affected by significant snow accumulation and snowmelt optimal values of the calibration parameters in zrr upstream saqez river saruq river and khoorkhooreh river sub basins corresponding to maximum nseq maximum nselogq and minimum ed are summarized in table 12 the results of this table show that the optimum freezing point tf and melting point tm for the snow storage of these sub basins are close to the upper limit of these parameters in table 6 by examining the region s data we considered values up to 10 c for melting parameter tm since it may take until may with average temperature of 10 c for snow to completely disappear this shows the mountainous nature of the study area and snow s predominant role in the water balance equation indicating the early freezing of precipitation in winter and the late melting of snow in spring furthermore as discussed earlier z1 and k are closer to their lower limits table 12 table 13 shows nse values for simulating daily river runoff and logarithm of flow for each sub basin during calibration and validation periods most nse values in this table are above 0 5 similar or lower nse values 0 4 0 5 were obtained in previous simulation studies for this basin emami and koch 2019 moriasi et al 2007 with the critical caveat that those were based on monthly flows whereas here we calculate the performance of daily flow simulations for instance fig 16 shows simulated and observed time series of saruq river flow the nse results of table 13 and the comparison of simulated and observed flow in fig 16 show the model s acceptable performance in simulating wet and dry periods within the year as well as simulating drought and wet years finally precipitation and temperature outputs of the weather forecast downscaling model were used to force the hydrological rainfall runoff model fig 17 shows the daily forecasted inflow to bukan reservoir by the runoff forecast system and observed inflow to bukan reservoir in 2020 and 2021 we note that the runoff forecasting model generates accurate forecasts in both dry and wet months with an overall nse value of 0 66 for two consecutive years forecast performance is better in wet months this time period is important because there is a possibility of floods at this time and because it is a non agricultural season during which optimal management of the reservoir could maximize surplus water allocations for meeting the environmental needs of ul the model was also able to forecast days of peak inflow on march 18th and april 8th 2020 and march 15th 2021 forecasting these days is essential from two perspectives first it can lead to better flood management and thereby reduce downstream damages second forecasting the volume of water inflow to the reservoir can help in the optimal cultivation planning so that in case of drought financial losses will not be inflicted on farmers 5 conclusion this study developed and applied the first runoff forecast system on a daily time scale for upstream inflow into bukan reservoir a key component of the water management infrastructure in ulb the forecast system consists of two models 1 a weather forecast model that downscales the large scale weather outputs of ecmwf and ncep to small scale spatial resolutions and 2 a hydrological rainfall runoff model that forecasts inflow into bukan reservoir the weather forecast downscaling model was developed based on two probabilistic and deterministic approaches and produced temperature and precipitation inputs for the hydrological rainfall runoff model three deterministic ai methods including gmdh svr and a hybrid gmdh svr method as well as a probabilistic bbn were used to downscale the raw precipitation forecasts while gmdh was used to downscale the raw temperature forecasts the hydrological rainfall runoff model includes two storages 1 snow storage that simulates daily snow accumulation and snowmelt and 2 soil moisture storage that simulates daily water balance components in the root zone calibration of the hydrological model was performed using the mopso multi objective optimization algorithm to estimate hydrological model parameters for each sub basin upstream of bukan reservoir there is no aquifer in the study area the weather forecast downscaling model results show that the hybrid method performs much better than the non hybrid methods for downscaling precipitation moreover ecmwf s precipitation forecast data are more accurate than ncep for this region the average nse of the hybrid method for ecmwf s 1 month lead time forecast downscaled to individual rain gauges was 0 53 and 0 62 for train and test data respectively by comparing the forecast precipitation of bbn and the hybrid ai method bbn has better performance due to its probabilistic feature that helps forecast precipitation with high uncertainty for instance the nse of bbn and hybrid ai for forecasting monthly precipitation were 0 88 and 0 61 respectively in 2020 and 2021 temperature forecast data of both organizations ecmwf and ncep had acceptable accuracy and similar performance the average nse for train and test data respectively were 0 79 and 0 85 for ecmwf and 0 85 and 0 83 for ncep forecasts with a 6 month lead time the calibration of the hydrological rainfall runoff model indicates that there is no significant trade off between maximizing objective functions for low and high flows and improving one objective function does not deteriorate the performance of the other one in addition the results show that two objective calibration reduces the uncertainty in estimating the calibration parameters compared to single objective calibration the average nse in the calibration period was 0 43 and 0 63 and in the validation period 0 54 and 0 55 respectively for flow and logarithm of flow furthermore the runoff forecast system resulted in daily forecasts of inflow into bukan reservoir with an nse of 0 67 in 2020 and 2021 we conclude that the runoff forecast system developed in this study has high accuracy in forecasting inflow into bukan reservoir policymakers and operators of the reservoir can use the system to forecast inflows to bukan reservoir and optimize water allocation between agricultural and environmental demands moreover this system could be beneficial to trigger prior managerial planning and actions before severe droughts or floods happen the system used in this research can be implemented on other sub basins and reservoirs in ulb to aid
