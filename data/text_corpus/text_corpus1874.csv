9370,a field experiment was conducted to explore the mechanism of drip fertilization to increase grain yield and water productivity wp of winter wheat the traditional irrigation and fertilization method surface flooding irrigation artificially applying fertilizer was used as ck and two drip fertilization methods were set up surface drip fertilization i1 and subsurface drip fertilization i2 the results showed that drip fertilization affected the root morphological pattern rmp and root activity pattern rap of wheat by affecting the distribution of water and nitrogen in the soil at heading stage both i1 and i2 had higher root weight density rwd and root length density rld in deep soil layer 40 80 cm compared with ck but lower rwd and rld in the topsoil layer 0 20 cm i1 and i2 had greater root activity in deep soil layer compare to ck but root activity of i2 in 0 20 cm surface soil was lower than that of ck and i1 drip fertilization also affected the distribution space of maximum root activity mra of plant at heading stage the distribution space of mra of i1 and i2 was the same as that of ck and all of them were located in 20 40 cm soil layer at the filling stage mra of ck was located in 40 80 cm soil layer and that of i1 and i2 were in 20 60 cm soil layer plant can adjust its water uptake strategy and rap according to soil moisture and the growth stages plants in i1 and ck mainly use water from 0 to 20 cm soil layer at jointing stage one week after irrigation and i2 mainly absorbs water from 20 to 40 cm soil layer at the filling stage three weeks after irrigation the main uptake space mus of root moved to 40 80 cm soil layers but i1 and i2 had greater water uptake capacity in this position compared with ck drip fertilization also triggered non hydraulic root sourced signal nhrs earlier but delayed the emergence of hydraulic root sourced signal hrs in addition the grain yield yield stability ys and wp of i1 and i2 were higher than those of ck in conclusion drip fertilization optimized rmp rap and root sourced signal characteristics of crop by improving the water and fertilizer environment in the root zone thus improving grain yield ys and wp of crop keywords winter wheat drip fertilization root sourced signal root activity pattern yield stability 1 introduction winter wheat is the main food crop in china water and fertilizer are the main factors limiting wheat production wang et al 2014 farmers overuse water and fertilizer resources to increase crop yields which not only causes waste of resources serious overexploitation of groundwater but also seriously pollutes the agricultural environment especially in the huang huai hai plain drip fertilization technology can accurately and timely apply water and fertilizer near root zone of plant through piping system thus reducing fertilizer loss and improving water and fertilizer utilization efficiency wang et al 2016 therefore the research on drip fertilization technology of wheat can not only save water and fertilizer resources and improve the utilization efficiency of water and fertilizer but also be an important measure to realize the sustainable development of agriculture compared with traditional irrigation fertilization drip fertilization affected the infiltration and redistribution of water and fertilizer in soil resulting in the temporal and spatial distribution differences of water and nutrients as a result soil physiological and biochemical characteristics will change significantly which will affect the root growth development and metabolism and affect the shoot through the root system ma et al 2013 therefore understanding root system s adaptive responses specific to soil environments will provide important opportunities to reveal the mechanism of drip fertilization to promote efficient utilization of water and fertilizer however the current studies on drip fertilization mainly focus on the shoot physiological characteristics of crops water saving effects soil nutrient migration and irrigation system selection etc sun and ma 2016 and the researches on the physiological response of root system to drip fertilization and its regulation effect on the shoot is relatively insufficient the crucial reason is the lack of a good way to combine soil environmental change root response and shoot adjustment which restricts the further improvement and optimization of this technology in recent years the use of root sourced signaling to guide water saving irrigation has been widely concerned some water saving irrigation techniques such as alternate partial root zone irrigation affect the horizontal distribution of soil water through alternate irrigation the drought signals root sourced signals generated by the roots in the dry zone are transmitted to the shoot to regulate stomatal opening of leaves and reduce water loss while the roots in the wet zone absorb water from the soil to meet the needs of normal crop growth thus improving the water use efficiency of crops shahnazari et al 2007 du et al 2010 it has been confirmed that aba is the root sourced signal substance but whether it is the only signal substance is still controversial the sap composition of roots and xylem changes greatly when plants are subjected to drought stress and many experiments have shown that stomatal closure is not always due to increased aba concentration wigger et al 2002 other chemical substance such as ph ctk calcium ions etc and their interactions also play important role in stomatal regulation fan et al 2008 therefore the characteristics of root sourced signal may be the combined regulating effect of all signal substances and it is not conducive to scientifically explain the water saving mechanism of plants only by measuring a single signal substance based on the water saving practice if the root sourced characteristics can be analyzed from the comprehensive physiological performance of plants it can not only avoid the deficiency in judging root sourced signal by testing a single signal substance but also facilitate the application of root sourced signal to guide the practice of water saving irrigation our previous study found that various soil environments induced by different irrigation strategies have different effects on the root sourced signal characteristics of crops ma et al 2015 therefore it is of great theoretical and practical value to clarify the root sourced signal characteristics i e the range of soil moisture threshold when it appears of crop under drip irrigation so as to accurately guide water saving irrigation by determining the upper and lower limits of water supply and irrigation volume and further explain the water saving mechanism of crop in addition the actual uptake of water or nutrients by crops depends not only on the number and distribution of roots but also on root physiological activities and the root microenvironment in different soil layers zhang and yuan 1995 root activity pattern rap reflects the contribution of each part of root system to the total root water uptake of plant sun et al 2006 compared with traditional irrigation fertilization drip fertilization changed the distribution characteristics of water and fertilizer in the root zone which affected the root distribution and its actual absorption function although rap and its dynamic changes have been widely used to guide water and fertilizer management sun et al 2006 few studies have used rap to explain the law of water uptake by plants under drip fertilization therefore it is of great significance to further explain the mechanism of drip fertilization promoting efficient utilization of water and fertilizer by exploring rap of crop under different irrigation treatments in addition the understanding of crop rap can also provide scientific decision making basis for drip fertilization management including the determination of optimal fertilization water location and time and drip pipe layout etc therefore by analyzing root sourced signal characteristics and raps of wheat under different irrigation and fertilization conditions our study aims to deeply and systematically explain the mechanism of drip fertilization promoting high yield and high efficiency of crop and provide scientific theoretical basis and technical support for the optimization of water saving irrigation technology of winter wheat 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant materials and experimental design a 2 yr field plot experiment was conducted from october 2019 to june 2021 in the

were irrigated 70 mm ha 1 and applied nitrogen n at 70 kg ha 1 50 kg ha 1 respectively n topdressing was artificially applied in ck and applied by drip fertilization in i1 and i2 after irrigation at jointing and flowering stage plants of each irrigation mode were divided into two groups sufficient water supply group group1 maintained 70 75 fwc and natural drying group group2 each irrigation treatment had 6 plots in each group plants in group 2 were no longer irrigated and dried naturally plants in group1 were watered when soil water content swc was below 70 fwc irrigation amount was

swc in group 2 were measured at 20 cm intervals to 100 cm soil depth the swc was measured using a time domain reflectometry tdr device trime pico iph germany fig 2 is the distribution of tdr monitoring locations after the determination of swc the soil samples were collected to test soil n distribution in soil profile the soil samples from the mid point between two drip tapes were

germany 2 2 2 the root sourced signals of plant at jointing and flowering stage the leaf relative water content lrwc and stomatal conductance gs of the same leaf position in group1 and group 2 were measured every two hours from9 00 am to 17 00 pm every day the appearance and end time of root sourced signals were determined by measuring and analyzing leaf lrwc and gs of the same leaf position in group1 and group 2 when gs of plant in group2 decreased significantly without a change in lrwc compared with that in group1 that is non hydraulic root sourced signal nhrs appeared at this time soil water content swc in group 2 is the critical point for the emergence of nhrs after that the plants in group 2 still remained natural drying hydraulic root signal hrs of plants were judged to begin when lrwc in group2 was significantly lower than that in group1 at this time the swc in group 2 was the turning point when nhrs ended and hrs appeared xiong et al 2006 swcs of each plot were measured at 20 cm intervals to 100 cm depth using a tdr prior to gs measurement gs was monitored using a portable photosynthesis system li 6400 li cor usa every two hours from9 00 am to 17 00 pm every day nine leaves 3 leaves 3 plot were measured per group after gs was measured the same leaf was sheared off immediately to determine its lrwc according to the following method the fresh weight of the leaves was first measured and then the leaves were immersed in distilled water so that they absorb water to saturation after soaking for 4 h remove the leaves from distilled water blot the surface moisture with blotting paper and then weigh them immediately which is the saturated water weight of the leaf then the leaf sample is dried at 75 c and weighed and lrwc is calculated according to the following formula 2 lrwc wf wd wt wd 100 where wf is leaf fresh weight g wd is leaf dry weight g wt is leaf saturated water weight g 2 2 3 determination of root activity pattern rap root activity pattern rap of plants can be evaluated by measuring and comparing actual water consumption awc of different soil layers in a certain period of time lehmann 2003 sun et al 2006 at jointing stage one week after irrigation heading stage three weeks after irrigation flowering stage one week after irrigation and filling stage three weeks after irrigation swc of natural drying group group2 was measured at 20 cm intervals to 100 cm soil depth by tdr before measuring swc the plastic mulch was laid on the bare surface between the rows of plant and covered with about 1 0 cm of soil to prevent evaporation of soil water the awcs of different soil layers within 5 days is calculated according to the following formula 3 awc mm ρ swc1 swc2 h 10 where ρ is volume mass g cm 3 swc1 is soil water content at the beginning of measurement swc2 is soil water content at the end of measurement h is the height cm of each monitored soil layer the height of each monitored soil layer is 20 cm 2 2 4 root activity root length density and root biomass after measuring the soil water consumption of different soil layers the root samples between two drip tapes were collected at 20 cm intervals to 100 cm soil depth using a root drill with 10 cm inner diameter and 20 cm height at the jointing heading and filling stage two samples per plot were collected one centered over the row and the other at the mid point between the rows the root activity of plant was measured by 2 3 5 triphenyltetrazolium chloride method ttc method and the root length was analyzed by winrhizo analysis system regent instruments inc canada after the root activity and root length analysis all roots were dried to constant weight and the root length density rld and root weight density rwd were calculated rld and rwd is the ratio of root length and weight to corresponding soil volume respectively 2 2 5 grain yield and water use efficiency at maturity stage plants of 1 0 m2 was randomly collected in each plot for measuring their yield traits including spike number 1000 kernel weight and grain yield water productivity wp irrigation water productivity iwp and yield stability ys are calculated according to the following formulas 4 wp kg ha 1mm 1 y kg ha 1 et mm 5 iwp kg ha 1mm 1 y kg ha 1 ir mm 6 ys ygroup2 ygroup1 where y is the grain yield of wheat et is the total evapotranspiration and ir was the recorded irrigation volume throughout the growing season 7 et p i δw u r d where p was the recorded precipitation mm and i is irrigated water amounts mm in the field δw was the change for soil water in 0 100 cm soil layer from sowing to maturity u is the seasonal capillary rise to the root zone mm u was negligible since the groundwater level was 15 20 m below the soil surface r is the seasonal runoff mm r was not observed in the field due to low precipitation intensity d is the seasonal deep percolation mm d was negligible since the swc at the bottom of the root zone didn t exceed the filed capacity due to the low precipitation intensity and appropriate irrigation 2 3 statistical analysis statistical analyses were performed using the spss 25 0 and the differences among different irrigation modes were compared using the least significant difference lsd tests p 0 05 3 results 3 1 the distribution of swc and total n content in the soil profile drip fertilization affected the distribution of swc and total n content in the soil profile before sowing there was no significant difference in swc and total n content in soil profile among different treatments at heading and filling stages swc of i1 was higher but that of i2 was lower compared with ck in 0 20 cm soil layer in the 20 80 cm soil layer swc of i1 and i2 was greater than that of ck in 80 100 cm soil layer swc of i2 was higher than that of ck but there was no significant difference between i1 and ck fig 3 at heading stage total n content of i1 was lower than that of ck but higher than that of i2 in 0 20 cm soil layer in the 20 100 cm soil layer i1 and i2 had higher total n content compared with ck at the filling stage the distribution characteristics of soil n were similar to those at heading stage in 0 20 cm soil layer and i2 had the lowest n content in the 20 80 cm soil layer soil n content of i1 and i2 was higher than that of ck however in 80 100 cm soil layer there was no significant difference in soil n content among all treatments 3 2 root morphological pattern rmp of wheat the distribution of rwd or rld is often used to analyze the root morphological pattern rmp drip fertilization affected the root distribution of wheat at jointing stage the rwd in top soil layer 0 20 cm of i1 was significantly higher than that of ck while that of i2 was significantly lower than that of ck in 20 40 cm soil layer i2 had higher rwd but i1 had lower rwd compared with ck rwd of i1 was significantly lower than that of ck and i2 in the 40 80 cm soil layer at heading stage rwd in the upper soil layer 0 40 cm of i1 was lower than that of ck rwd in the middle soil layer 40 60 cm was higher than that of ck and there was no significant difference in rwd of the deep soil layer 60 100 cm between i1 and ck the rwd in the topsoil layer 0 20 cm of i2 was lower than that of ck and there was no significant difference in rwd in the 20 40cmsoil layer between i2 and ck but the rwd in the 40 100cmsoil layer was higher than that of ck table 1 it can be seen that i1 mainly promoted the root growth in the topsoil layer 0 20 cm in the early growth stage while i2 mainly promoted the root growth in the 20 40 cm soil layer both i1 and i2 promoted the growth of deep roots at late growth stage the rld of winter wheat decreased with the deepening of soil layer however different irrigation treatments have different effects on rld of each soil layer at jointing stage i1 had larger rld in 0 20 cm soil layer while i2 had smaller rld compared with ck in the 20 40 cm soil layer on the contrary rld of i2 was higher than that of ck while rld of i1 was lower than that of ck in 40 80 cm soil layer rld of i2 was significantly higher than that of ck and i1 fig 4 at heading stage i1and i2 had smaller rld compared ck in 0 20 cm soil layer in the 20 40 cm soil layer the rld of i2 was higher than that of ck while that of i1 was lower than that of ck in 40 80 cm soil layer both i1and i2 had larger rld compared with ck especially i2 with the largest rld in 80 100 cm soil layer i2 also had significantly higher rld than ck and i1 but there was no significant difference between ck and i1 it is clear that i1 mainly promoted rld of the topsoil layer 0 20 cm in the early growth stage while i2 mainly promoted that of the 20 80 cm soil layer both i1 and i2 promoted rld of deep soil layer at late growth stage 3 3 root activity and root activity pattern rap of wheat drip fertilization not only affected the root distribution of winter wheat but also greatly affected root activity in different soil layers swcs of i1 and ck were larger than that of i2 in the top soil layer which affected the root activity of this soil layer therefore the root activity in 0 10 cm topsoil of i2 was significantly lower than that of ck and i1during the three test periods at jointing stage in the 20 60 cm soil layer the root activity of both i1 and i2 was greater than that of ck however there was no significant difference in root activity of the 60 80 cm soil layer among the three treatments at heading stage there was no significant difference in the root activity of 20 40 cm soil layer between i1 and ck but the root activity of i2 was greater than that of ck both i1 and i2 was significantly higher root activity compared with ck in 40 100 cm soil layer at the filling stage the root activity of both i1 and i2 was significantly higher than that of ck in the 20 100 cm soil layer fig 5 it is clear that drip fertilization delayed root senescence in the later stage and the roots in the middle and lower soil layers had greater root vitality compared with ck in addition the depth of maximum root activity mra of winter wheat varied with the growth period at the jointing stage mra of i1 and ck was located in the 10 20 cm soil layer and that of i2 was in the 20 40 cm soil layer at heading stage the distribution space of mra in i1 and i2 was the same as that of ck and all of them were located in 20 40 cm soil layer at the filling stage the mra of ck was in the soil layer of 40 80 cm those of i1 and i2 were in 20 60 cm soil layer root activity pattern rap can be evaluated by measuring actual water uptake of root system in different soil layers at the jointing stage the water consumption of i1 was significantly lower than that of ck in the topsoil 0 20 cm layer but higher than that of i2 in the 20 60 cm soil layer the water consumption of i2 was greater than that of ck and i1 in the 60 80 cm soil layer there was no significant difference in water consumption among the three irrigation methods at heading stage the water consumption of i1 was significantly lower than that of ck but higher than that of i2 in 0 20 cm soil layer in the 20 40 cm soil layer there was no significant difference in water consumption among the three irrigation methods in the 40 80 cm soil layer the water consumption of i2 was greater than that of ck and i1 at flowering stage i1 and i2 had lower water consumption in 0 40 cm soil layer but higher in the 40 60 cm soil layer compared with ck in the 60 80 cm soil layer the water consumption of i2 was higher than that of ck and i1 but there was no difference between i1 and ck at the filling stage the water consumption of i2 was significantly lower than that of ck and i1 in 0 20 cm soil layer but higher than that of ck and i1 in 60 80 cm soil layer fig 6 it is very clear that rap of plant varied with different irrigation modes and growth stages in addition the main water uptake space mus of each treatment also varied with different growth stages at the jointing stage one week after irrigation the mus of ck and i1 was in 0 20 cm soil layer and that of i2 was in 20 40 cm soil layer followed by 40 60 cm soil layer at heading stage three weeks after irrigation the muss of ck i1 and i2 were all in 40 60 cm soil layer at flowering stage one week after irrigation the muss of ck and i1 was in 20 40 cm and that of i2 was in 20 60 cm soil layer at filling stage three weeks after irrigation the muss of ck i1 and i2 were in40 80 cm soil layer 3 4 root sourced signal characteristics of wheat under different treatments 3 4 1 stomatal conductance gs and leaf relative water content lrwc at jointing stage there were no significant differences in gs and lrwc between group 2 and group 1 within 1 5 days after stopping watering under i2 and i1 treatments leaf gs of group 2 decreased significantly from the 10th and 12thday after stopping watering compared with group 1 respectively but for ck gs of group 2 decreased significantly from the 6th day after stopping watering compared with group 1 when gs of group 2 decreased significantly without a change in lrwc compared with group1 which indicated that nhrs began to appear gs of plant in group 2 decreased further with the aggravation of drought on the 20th 22nd and 24th day after stopping watering the lrwc of ck i1 and i2 decreased significantly respectively indicating that hrs began to appear according to the above evaluating criteria of root sourced signal at heading stage nhrs of i2 i1 and ck began to appear on the 4th 6th and 8th day after stopping watering and hrs began to appear on the 20th 17th and 15th day after stopping watering respectively fig 7 it can be seen that in two test stages drip fertilization triggered nhrs of plant earlier which enabled plants to save water as early as possible in addition drip fertilization also delayed the appearance of hrs to ensure that plants can maintain good water conditions under drought conditions to meet the needs of growth 3 4 2 soil water content when nhrs and hrs appeared at the jointing stage when nhrs appeared i1 had the highest swc and i2 had the lowest swc in the topsoil 0 20 cm layer in the 20 80 cm soil layer i2 had the highest swc and ck had the lowest swc when nhrs appeared the average swc in 0 80 cm soil layer of ck i1 and i2 was 60 6 62 3 and 63 7 fwc respectively fig 8 these results indicated that i1 and i2 improved the sensitivity of nhrs so nhrs appeared earlier in the process of soil natural drying when hrs appeared i1 had the highest swc and i2 had the lowest swc in the surface soil 0 20 cm in the 20 40 cm soil layer ck had the highest swc and i2 had the lowest swc in 40 80 cm soil layer swc of i2 was significantly higher than those of control and i1 when hrs appeared the average swc in 0 80 cm soil layers of ck i1 and i2 was 54 3 53 8 and 53 9 fwc respectively indicating that i1 and i2 delayed the emergence of hrs in the process of soil natural drying the swc at which nhrs of plants in i1 and i2 appeared was higher and terminated lower than that in ck so the threshold range of nhrs of plant was significantly greater for i1 and i2 than for ck at flowering stage when nhrs appeared the average swc in 0 100 cm layer of ck i1 and i2 was 62 4 64 4 and 65 2 fwc respectively when hrs appeared the average swc in 0 100 cm layer of ck i1 and i2 was 56 2 55 9 and 55 3 fwc respectively the threshold range of nhrs for i1 and i2 was also markedly greater than for ck fig 8 3 5 grain yield water productivity wp and yield stability ys in two test years both i1 and i2 reduced water consumption of winter wheat i1 and i2 had lower et compared with ck under natural drying conditions group2 the 1000 grain weight and grain yield of wheat in i1 and i2 were significantly higher than those of ck under the condition of adequate water supply group1 the grain yield iwp and wp of wheat in i1 and i2 were also higher than those of ck under natural drying conditions group2 the ratio of grain yield of natural drying group group2 to that of sufficient water supply group group1 was used to estimate yield stability ys of wheat ys of i1 and i2 was higher than that of ck table 2 in conclusion i2 had the highest grain yield iwp wp and ys in three irrigation modes which is more conducive to water saving production of winter wheat 4 discussion 4 1 effects of drip fertilization on root morphological pattern rmp root system have strong plasticity zhuge et al 2004 liu et al 2003 and can adjust their morphological structure and spatial distribution to adapt to the environment according to soil moisture and nutrient status yang et al 2018 zhang et al 2009 xue et al 2003 it is of great significance to ensure high and stable yield of crops by adopting appropriate agricultural measures to form environmental conditions that are conducive to increasing the proportion of deep roots miao et al 2019 previous studies have shown that different irrigation strategies can affect soil moisture status which in turn affects plant root growth lv et al 2010 wang et al 2014 drip fertilization affected the infiltration and redistribution of water and fertilizer in soil which affected the size and distribution of roots ma et al 2013 wang et al 2011 documented that irrigation methods had significant effect on the root spatial distribution of winter wheat surface drip irrigation and surface flood irrigation significantly promoted root system in 0 50 cm soil while the spatial variation coefficient of rld in 0 100 cm soil layer under subsurface drip irrigation was significantly smaller than those under surface drip irrigation and surface flood irrigation similar observation also showed that compared with surface flooding irrigation wheat under surface drip irrigation had higher rld in 0 60 cm soil layer while under subsurface drip irrigation the root biomass in shallow soil layer decreased significantly and increased in middle and lower soil layer jha et al 2017 our study also showed that different irrigation treatments also affected the root distribution of wheat in the early growth stage i1 mainly improved rwd and rld in the surface layer 0 20 cm while i2 mainly promoted rwd and rld in the 20 40 cm soil layer both i1 and i2 promoted rwd and rld of deep soil layer at late growth stage increasing deep roots helps make full use of water storage in deep soil layers gowda et al 2011 becker et al 2016 fang et al 2017 thus reducing the risk of yield loss due to drought barraclough and weir 1988 our study also confirmed that drip fertilization reduced the risk of yield loss by improving ys of wheat rwd and rld are often used to assess the effects of different environmental and management factors on root distribution patterns ahmadi et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 based on observations of rwd and rld our study showed that drip fertilization optimized the root morphological pattern rmp of wheat by increasing rwd and rld of deep roots 4 2 effects of drip fertilization on root activity pattern of plant soil moisture not only affects the morphological characteristics of root system but also has important influence on its physiological function the contribution of root system to crops depends not only on its size and distribution but also on the level of root activity wang et al 1995 wu et al 2017a some studies showed that both growth stage and soil water condition had significant effects on the root activity of wheat chu et al 2014 guan et al 2015 this study also showed that irrigation modes not only affected the size and distribution of roots but also had great influence on root activity i1 could not only significantly increase root activity of deep soil layer but also maintain higher root activity of upper layer thus ensuring the whole root system of plant had greater activity in the whole growth period i2 significantly increased root activity in the middle and lower soil layers and delayed the senescence of root in deep soil layers in the late growth stage in addition different irrigation treatments had different effects on the distribution space of maximum root activity mra of wheat at the jointing stage mra of i1 and ck was in10 20 cm soil layer and that of i2 is in 20 40 cm soil layer at the filling stage mra was located in 40 80 cm soil layer for ck and 20 60 cm soil layer for i1 and i2 treatments studies on root activity in different soil layers and its effect on yield at the later growth stage of wheat show that deep roots are the main functional roots in the stage of grain filling wang et al 2001 miao et al 2002 it is clear that drip fertilization can make the root system especially the deep root system maintain high activity in the late growth stage by coordinating the growth and development of deep and shallow root systems which is helpful to improve the grain yield of wheat root activity rwd and rld are important indicators to evaluate the potential water uptake capacity of roots mehrabi et al 2021 wu et al 2017 b however actual water uptake patterns by roots not only depends on the size and distribution of roots and root activity but also is related to the root zone microenvironment such as water and nutrients of plant zhang and yuan 1995 eugenio and dani 1999 the root activity pattern map reflects the actual contribution of each part of the root to its overall absorption capacity wahid 2000 which can be evaluated by measuring the water consumption of in different soil parts lehmann 2003 sun et al 2006 by analyzing the actual water consumption of root in different soil layers this study showed that two drip irrigation treatments significantly affected map of wheat in addition the actual water uptake pattern of root often varies with the temporal and spatial variation of soil water availability due to flexibility and plasticity of root which results in inconsistent rmp such as root length density or root biomass with rap of plant sun et al 2006 eugenio and dani 1999 green and clothier 1995 showed that before irrigation the water uptake pattern of plant was closely related to the distribution of root length density however after irrigation water uptake patterns shifted from rld dominance to water distribution control with priority given to water uptake from the wet parts of the soil therefore plants can adjust their water uptake strategies according to the changes of available water in different soil layers wu et al 2017b our study also shows that plants can adjust their water absorption strategy according to soil moisture status for example compared with the jointing stage after one week of irrigation the main water uptake space mus of each treatment moved to deep layer at heading stage after three weeks of irrigation the rap of plant also varied significantly with growth stages chu et al 2014 lehmann et al 2001 winter wheat mainly uses surface soil water at jointing stage and absorbs water from the middle and lower soil at filling stage liu et al 2020 this study also showed that in the stage of grain filling the mus of roots moved to deeper soil layer but two drip irrigation treatments had greater water absorption capacity in the deep layer therefore the analysis of rap and its variation under different irrigation treatments is helpful to explain the mechanism of efficient water use of crop more scientifically 4 3 influence of drip fertilization on root sourced signal of plant in addition to changing morphological characteristics to adapt to the soil environment roots can also sense the changes of root zone environment and make corresponding physiological responses in the early stage of drought roots can sense soil drought and generate root sourced chemical signals i e nhrs and then transmit them to the shoot and actively regulate stomatal opening to reduce water evaporation without a change in shoot water status li et al 2011 with the aggravation of soil drought the relative water content of the shoot decreased significantly and water status change in plant act as a signal i e hrs to control stomatal opening leading to further reduction of stomatal conductance when hrs appear it will seriously affect the physiological function and growth of plants however the physiological function and growth of plants was not significantly affected in the range of soil moisture threshold from emergence of nhrs to the end i e emergence of hrs xiong et al 2006 the generation of root sourced signals depend on the root biomass in dry soil layer and the difference between soil water potential and root water potential the characteristics of root growth and root sourced signals vary with different soil conditions ma et al 2015 blum and johnson 1993 showed that spring wheat varieties with fewer roots in the soil surface were less sensitive to soil drought and root sourced chemical signals nhrs in our study i1 and i2 also affect the root sourced signal characteristics of crops by optimizing the spatial distribution of water and roots plant in i1 is more sensitive to nhrs due to the increase of surface roots and nhrs appear earlier in the process of soil natural drying i2 also increased the sensitivity of nhrs due to soil surface drought the early activation of nhrs can enable plants to make water saving response as early as possible to resist the coming severe drought ober and sharp 2003 ma et al 2015 thus improving grain yield and water use efficiency in addition due to the increase of root biomass and root length density in the deep soil layer two drip fertilization treatments enhanced the water absorption capacity of the root system under drought conditions thus delaying the emergence of hrs so as to ensure the crop productivity and improved yield stability ys under drought conditions therefore two drip fertilization treatments improved the yield stability and water use efficiency of wheat i2 caused surface soil drought and the nhrs generated by roots in surface dry soil was transmitted to leaves earlier to regulate stomatal opening therefore the nhrs of i2 appeared earlier than that of i1 so that plants could save water earlier while the deep root system can absorb water from the wet soil to meet the needs of normal plant growth in conclusion drip fertilization optimized root morphology and activity pattern and root sourced signal characteristics by improving water and fertilizer environment in root zone thus improving grain yield ys and wp of crop 5 conclusions drip fertilization affected rmp and rap of wheat by affecting the distribution of water and nitrogen in the soil both i1and i2 reduced rwd and rld in 0 20 cm soil layer while promoted those in deep soil layers 40 60 cm i1 and i2 delayed the senescence of roots in the later stage and had greater root activity in the middle and lower soil layers compared with ck drip fertilization also changed the distribution of mra the mra of i1 and ck was located in the10 20 cm soil layer and that of i2 was in 20 40 cm soil layer at the jointing stage at the filling stage the mra of ck was distributed in the 40 80 cm soil layer while mra of i1 and i2 was distributed in 20 60 cm soil layer plant can change its water absorption strategy and rap with varying growth stages at jointing stage plants in i1and ck mainly use soil water in 0 20 cm soil layer while i2 mainly absorbs water from 20 to 40 cm soil layer at the grain filling stage the mus of plants moved to deeper soil layers but i1 and i2 have greater water uptake capacity compared with ck drip fertilization also increased the sensitivity of nhrs nhrs appeared earlier but delayed the emergence of hrs in addition the grain yield ys and wp of i1 and i2 were also higher than those of ck in conclusion drip fertilization optimized rmp and rap and root sourced signal characteristics of crop by improving the water and fertilizer environment in the root zone and thus improved grain yield ys and wp of crop declaration of competing interest the

9370,a field experiment was conducted to explore the mechanism of drip fertilization to increase grain yield and water productivity wp of winter wheat the traditional irrigation and fertilization method surface flooding irrigation artificially applying fertilizer was used as ck and two drip fertilization methods were set up surface drip fertilization i1 and subsurface drip fertilization i2 the results showed that drip fertilization affected the root morphological pattern rmp and root activity pattern rap of wheat by affecting the distribution of water and nitrogen in the soil at heading stage both i1 and i2 had higher root weight density rwd and root length density rld in deep soil layer 40 80 cm compared with ck but lower rwd and rld in the topsoil layer 0 20 cm i1 and i2 had greater root activity in deep soil layer compare to ck but root activity of i2 in 0 20 cm surface soil was lower than that of ck and i1 drip fertilization also affected the distribution space of maximum root activity mra of plant at heading stage the distribution space of mra of i1 and i2 was the same as that of ck and all of them were located in 20 40 cm soil layer at the filling stage mra of ck was located in 40 80 cm soil layer and that of i1 and i2 were in 20 60 cm soil layer plant can adjust its water uptake strategy and rap according to soil moisture and the growth stages plants in i1 and ck mainly use water from 0 to 20 cm soil layer at jointing stage one week after irrigation and i2 mainly absorbs water from 20 to 40 cm soil layer at the filling stage three weeks after irrigation the main uptake space mus of root moved to 40 80 cm soil layers but i1 and i2 had greater water uptake capacity in this position compared with ck drip fertilization also triggered non hydraulic root sourced signal nhrs earlier but delayed the emergence of hydraulic root sourced signal hrs in addition the grain yield yield stability ys and wp of i1 and i2 were higher than those of ck in conclusion drip fertilization optimized rmp rap and root sourced signal characteristics of crop by improving the water and fertilizer environment in the root zone thus improving grain yield ys and wp of crop keywords winter wheat drip fertilization root sourced signal root activity pattern yield stability 1 introduction winter wheat is the main food crop in china water and fertilizer are the main factors limiting wheat production wang et al 2014 farmers overuse water and fertilizer resources to increase crop yields which not only causes waste of resources serious overexploitation of groundwater but also seriously pollutes the agricultural environment especially in the huang huai hai plain drip fertilization technology can accurately and timely apply water and fertilizer near root zone of plant through piping system thus reducing fertilizer loss and improving water and fertilizer utilization efficiency wang et al 2016 therefore the research on drip fertilization technology of wheat can not only save water and fertilizer resources and improve the utilization efficiency of water and fertilizer but also be an important measure to realize the sustainable development of agriculture compared with traditional irrigation fertilization drip fertilization affected the infiltration and redistribution of water and fertilizer in soil resulting in the temporal and spatial distribution differences of water and nutrients as a result soil physiological and biochemical characteristics will change significantly which will affect the root growth development and metabolism and affect the shoot through the root system ma et al 2013 therefore understanding root system s adaptive responses specific to soil environments will provide important opportunities to reveal the mechanism of drip fertilization to promote efficient utilization of water and fertilizer however the current studies on drip fertilization mainly focus on the shoot physiological characteristics of crops water saving effects soil nutrient migration and irrigation system selection etc sun and ma 2016 and the researches on the physiological response of root system to drip fertilization and its regulation effect on the shoot is relatively insufficient the crucial reason is the lack of a good way to combine soil environmental change root response and shoot adjustment which restricts the further improvement and optimization of this technology in recent years the use of root sourced signaling to guide water saving irrigation has been widely concerned some water saving irrigation techniques such as alternate partial root zone irrigation affect the horizontal distribution of soil water through alternate irrigation the drought signals root sourced signals generated by the roots in the dry zone are transmitted to the shoot to regulate stomatal opening of leaves and reduce water loss while the roots in the wet zone absorb water from the soil to meet the needs of normal crop growth thus improving the water use efficiency of crops shahnazari et al 2007 du et al 2010 it has been confirmed that aba is the root sourced signal substance but whether it is the only signal substance is still controversial the sap composition of roots and xylem changes greatly when plants are subjected to drought stress and many experiments have shown that stomatal closure is not always due to increased aba concentration wigger et al 2002 other chemical substance such as ph ctk calcium ions etc and their interactions also play important role in stomatal regulation fan et al 2008 therefore the characteristics of root sourced signal may be the combined regulating effect of all signal substances and it is not conducive to scientifically explain the water saving mechanism of plants only by measuring a single signal substance based on the water saving practice if the root sourced characteristics can be analyzed from the comprehensive physiological performance of plants it can not only avoid the deficiency in judging root sourced signal by testing a single signal substance but also facilitate the application of root sourced signal to guide the practice of water saving irrigation our previous study found that various soil environments induced by different irrigation strategies have different effects on the root sourced signal characteristics of crops ma et al 2015 therefore it is of great theoretical and practical value to clarify the root sourced signal characteristics i e the range of soil moisture threshold when it appears of crop under drip irrigation so as to accurately guide water saving irrigation by determining the upper and lower limits of water supply and irrigation volume and further explain the water saving mechanism of crop in addition the actual uptake of water or nutrients by crops depends not only on the number and distribution of roots but also on root physiological activities and the root microenvironment in different soil layers zhang and yuan 1995 root activity pattern rap reflects the contribution of each part of root system to the total root water uptake of plant sun et al 2006 compared with traditional irrigation fertilization drip fertilization changed the distribution characteristics of water and fertilizer in the root zone which affected the root distribution and its actual absorption function although rap and its dynamic changes have been widely used to guide water and fertilizer management sun et al 2006 few studies have used rap to explain the law of water uptake by plants under drip fertilization therefore it is of great significance to further explain the mechanism of drip fertilization promoting efficient utilization of water and fertilizer by exploring rap of crop under different irrigation treatments in addition the understanding of crop rap can also provide scientific decision making basis for drip fertilization management including the determination of optimal fertilization water location and time and drip pipe layout etc therefore by analyzing root sourced signal characteristics and raps of wheat under different irrigation and fertilization conditions our study aims to deeply and systematically explain the mechanism of drip fertilization promoting high yield and high efficiency of crop and provide scientific theoretical basis and technical support for the optimization of water saving irrigation technology of winter wheat 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant materials and experimental design a 2 yr field plot experiment was conducted from october 2019 to june 2021 in the

were irrigated 70 mm ha 1 and applied nitrogen n at 70 kg ha 1 50 kg ha 1 respectively n topdressing was artificially applied in ck and applied by drip fertilization in i1 and i2 after irrigation at jointing and flowering stage plants of each irrigation mode were divided into two groups sufficient water supply group group1 maintained 70 75 fwc and natural drying group group2 each irrigation treatment had 6 plots in each group plants in group 2 were no longer irrigated and dried naturally plants in group1 were watered when soil water content swc was below 70 fwc irrigation amount was

swc in group 2 were measured at 20 cm intervals to 100 cm soil depth the swc was measured using a time domain reflectometry tdr device trime pico iph germany fig 2 is the distribution of tdr monitoring locations after the determination of swc the soil samples were collected to test soil n distribution in soil profile the soil samples from the mid point between two drip tapes were collected at 20 cm intervals to 100 cm depth using a drill with 5 cm inner diameter and 20 cm height the soil n concentration were measured using an aa3 continuous flow analyzer seal analytical germany 2 2 2 the root sourced signals of plant at jointing and flowering stage the leaf relative water content lrwc and stomatal conductance gs of the same leaf position in group1 and group 2 were measured every two hours from9 00 am to 17 00 pm every day the appearance and end time of root sourced signals were determined by measuring and analyzing leaf lrwc and gs of the same leaf position in group1 and group 2 when gs of plant in group2 decreased significantly without a change in lrwc compared with that in group1 that is non hydraulic root sourced signal nhrs appeared at this time soil water content swc in group 2 is the critical point for the emergence of nhrs after that the plants in group 2 still remained natural drying hydraulic root signal hrs of plants were judged to begin when lrwc in group2 was significantly lower than that in group1 at this time the swc in group 2 was the turning point when nhrs ended and hrs appeared xiong et al 2006 swcs of each plot were measured at 20 cm intervals to 100 cm depth using a tdr prior to gs measurement gs was monitored using a portable photosynthesis system li 6400 li cor usa every two hours from9 00 am to 17 00 pm every day nine leaves 3 leaves 3 plot were measured per group after gs was measured the same leaf was sheared off immediately to determine its lrwc according to the following method the fresh weight of the leaves was first measured and then the leaves were immersed in distilled water so that they absorb water to saturation after soaking for 4 h remove the leaves from distilled water blot the surface moisture with blotting paper and then weigh them immediately which is the saturated water weight of the leaf then the leaf sample is dried at 75 c and weighed and lrwc is calculated according to the following formula 2 lrwc wf wd wt wd 100 where wf is leaf fresh weight g wd is leaf dry weight g wt is leaf saturated water weight g 2 2 3 determination of root activity pattern rap root activity pattern rap of plants can be evaluated by measuring and comparing actual water consumption awc of different soil layers in a certain period of time lehmann 2003 sun et al 2006 at jointing stage one week after irrigation heading stage three weeks after irrigation flowering stage one week after irrigation and filling stage three weeks after irrigation swc of natural drying group group2 was measured at 20 cm intervals to 100 cm soil depth by tdr before measuring swc the plastic mulch was laid on the bare surface between the rows of plant and covered with about 1 0 cm of soil to prevent evaporation of soil water the awcs of different soil layers within 5 days is calculated according to the following formula 3 awc mm ρ swc1 swc2 h 10 where ρ is volume mass g cm 3 swc1 is soil water content at the beginning of measurement swc2 is soil water content at the end of measurement h is the height cm of each monitored soil layer the height of each monitored soil layer is 20 cm 2 2 4 root activity root length density and root biomass after measuring the soil water consumption of different soil layers the root samples between two drip tapes were collected at 20 cm intervals to 100 cm soil depth using a root drill with 10 cm inner diameter and 20 cm height at the jointing heading and filling stage two samples per plot were collected one centered over the row and the other at the mid point between the rows the root activity of plant was measured by 2 3 5 triphenyltetrazolium chloride method ttc method and the root length was analyzed by winrhizo analysis system regent instruments inc canada after the root activity and root length analysis all roots were dried to constant weight and the root length density rld and root weight density rwd were calculated rld and rwd is the ratio of root length and weight to corresponding soil volume respectively 2 2 5 grain yield and water use efficiency at maturity stage plants of 1 0 m2 was randomly collected in each plot for measuring their yield traits including spike number 1000 kernel weight and grain yield water productivity wp irrigation water productivity iwp and yield stability ys are calculated according to the following formulas 4 wp kg ha 1mm 1 y kg ha 1 et mm 5 iwp kg ha 1mm 1 y kg ha 1 ir mm 6 ys ygroup2 ygroup1 where y is the grain yield of wheat et is the total evapotranspiration and ir was the recorded irrigation volume throughout the growing season 7 et p i δw u r d where p was the recorded precipitation mm and i is irrigated water amounts mm in the field δw was the change for soil water in 0 100 cm soil layer from sowing to maturity u is the seasonal capillary rise to the root zone mm u was negligible since the groundwater level was 15 20 m below the soil surface r is the seasonal runoff mm r was not observed in the field due to low precipitation intensity d is the seasonal deep percolation mm d was negligible since the swc at the bottom of the root zone didn t exceed the filed capacity due to the low precipitation intensity and appropriate irrigation 2 3 statistical analysis statistical analyses were performed using the spss 25 0 and the differences among different irrigation modes were compared using the least significant difference lsd tests p 0 05 3 results 3 1 the distribution of swc and total n content in the soil profile drip fertilization affected the distribution of swc and total n content in the soil profile before sowing there was no significant difference in swc and total n content in soil profile among different treatments at heading and filling stages swc of i1 was higher but that of i2 was lower compared with ck in 0 20 cm soil layer in the 20 80 cm soil layer swc of i1 and i2 was greater than that of ck in 80 100 cm soil layer swc of i2 was higher than that of ck but there was no significant difference between i1 and ck fig 3 at heading stage total n content of i1 was lower than that of ck but higher than that of i2 in 0 20 cm soil layer in the 20 100 cm soil layer i1 and i2 had higher total n content compared with ck at the filling stage the distribution characteristics of soil n were similar to those at heading stage in 0 20 cm soil layer and i2 had the lowest n content in the 20 80 cm soil layer soil n content of i1 and i2 was higher than that of ck however in 80 100 cm soil layer there was no significant difference in soil n content among all treatments 3 2 root morphological pattern rmp of wheat the distribution of rwd or rld is often used to analyze the root morphological pattern rmp drip fertilization affected the root distribution of wheat at jointing stage the rwd in top soil layer 0 20 cm of i1 was significantly higher than that of ck while that of i2 was significantly lower than that of ck in 20 40 cm soil layer i2 had higher rwd but i1 had lower rwd compared with ck rwd of i1 was significantly lower than that of ck and i2 in the 40 80 cm soil layer at heading stage rwd in the upper soil layer 0 40 cm of i1 was lower than that of ck rwd in the middle soil layer 40 60 cm was higher than that of ck and there was no significant difference in rwd of the deep soil layer 60 100 cm between i1 and ck the rwd in the topsoil layer 0 20 cm of i2 was lower than that of ck and there was no significant difference in rwd in the 20 40cmsoil layer between i2 and ck but the rwd in the 40 100cmsoil layer was higher than that of ck table 1 it can be seen that i1 mainly promoted the root growth in the topsoil layer 0 20 cm in the early growth stage while i2 mainly promoted the root growth in the 20 40 cm soil layer both i1 and i2 promoted the growth of deep roots at late growth stage the rld of winter wheat decreased with the deepening of soil layer however different irrigation treatments have different effects on rld of each soil layer at jointing stage i1 had larger rld in 0 20 cm soil layer while i2 had smaller rld compared with ck in the 20 40 cm soil layer on the contrary rld of i2 was higher than that of ck while rld of i1 was lower than that of ck in 40 80 cm soil layer rld of i2 was significantly higher than that of ck and i1 fig 4 at heading stage i1and i2 had smaller rld compared ck in 0 20 cm soil layer in the 20 40 cm soil layer the rld of i2 was higher than that of ck while that of i1 was lower than that of ck in 40 80 cm soil layer both i1and i2 had larger rld compared with ck especially i2 with the largest rld in 80 100 cm soil layer i2 also had significantly higher rld than ck and i1 but there was no significant difference between ck and i1 it is clear that i1 mainly promoted rld of the topsoil layer 0 20 cm in the early growth stage while i2 mainly promoted that of the 20 80 cm soil layer both i1 and i2 promoted rld of deep soil layer at late growth stage 3 3 root activity and root activity pattern rap of wheat drip fertilization not only affected the root distribution of winter wheat but also greatly affected root activity in different soil layers swcs of i1 and ck were larger than that of i2 in the top soil layer which affected the root activity of this soil layer therefore the root activity in 0 10 cm topsoil of i2 was significantly lower than that of ck and i1during the three test periods at jointing stage in the 20 60 cm soil layer the root activity of both i1 and i2 was greater than that of ck however there was no significant difference in root activity of the 60 80 cm soil layer among the three treatments at heading stage there was no significant difference in the root activity of 20 40 cm soil layer between i1 and ck but the root activity of i2 was greater than that of ck both i1 and i2 was significantly higher root activity compared with ck in 40 100 cm soil layer at the filling stage the root activity of both i1 and i2 was significantly higher than that of ck in the 20 100 cm soil layer fig 5 it is clear that drip fertilization delayed root senescence in the later stage and the roots in the middle and lower soil layers had greater root vitality compared with ck in addition the depth of maximum root activity mra of winter wheat varied with the growth period at the jointing stage mra of i1 and ck was located in the 10 20 cm soil layer and that of i2 was in the 20 40 cm soil layer at heading stage the distribution space of mra in i1 and i2 was the same as that of ck and all of them were located in 20 40 cm soil layer at the filling stage the mra of ck was in the soil layer of 40 80 cm those of i1 and i2 were in 20 60 cm soil layer root activity pattern rap can be evaluated by measuring actual water uptake of root system in different soil layers at the jointing stage the water consumption of i1 was significantly lower than that of ck in the topsoil 0 20 cm layer but higher than that of i2 in the 20 60 cm soil layer the water consumption of i2 was greater than that of ck and i1 in the 60 80 cm soil layer there was no significant difference in water consumption among the three irrigation methods at heading stage the water consumption of i1 was significantly lower than that of ck but higher than that of i2 in 0 20 cm soil layer in the 20 40 cm soil layer there was no significant difference in water consumption among the three irrigation methods in the 40 80 cm soil layer the water consumption of i2 was greater than that of ck and i1 at flowering stage i1 and i2 had lower water consumption in 0 40 cm soil layer but higher in the 40 60 cm soil layer compared with ck in the 60 80 cm soil layer the water consumption of i2 was higher than that of ck and i1 but there was no difference between i1 and ck at the filling stage the water consumption of i2 was significantly lower than that of ck and i1 in 0 20 cm soil layer but higher than that of ck and i1 in 60 80 cm soil layer fig 6 it is very clear that rap of plant varied with different irrigation modes and growth stages in addition the main water uptake space mus of each treatment also varied with different growth stages at the jointing stage one week after irrigation the mus of ck and i1 was in 0 20 cm soil layer and that of i2 was in 20 40 cm soil layer followed by 40 60 cm soil layer at heading stage three weeks after irrigation the muss of ck i1 and i2 were all in 40 60 cm soil layer at flowering stage one week after irrigation the muss of ck and i1 was in 20 40 cm and that of i2 was in 20 60 cm soil layer at filling stage three weeks after irrigation the muss of ck i1 and i2 were in40 80 cm soil layer 3 4 root sourced signal characteristics of wheat under different treatments 3 4 1 stomatal conductance gs and leaf relative water content lrwc at jointing stage there were no significant differences in gs and lrwc between group 2 and group 1 within 1 5 days after stopping watering under i2 and i1 treatments leaf gs of group 2 decreased significantly from the 10th and 12thday after stopping watering compared with group 1 respectively but for ck gs of group 2 decreased significantly from the 6th day after stopping watering compared with group 1 when gs of group 2 decreased significantly without a change in lrwc compared with group1 which indicated that nhrs began to appear gs of plant in group 2 decreased further with the aggravation of drought on the 20th 22nd and 24th day after stopping watering the lrwc of ck i1 and i2 decreased significantly respectively indicating that hrs began to appear according to the above evaluating criteria of root sourced signal at heading stage nhrs of i2 i1 and ck began to appear on the 4th 6th and 8th day after stopping watering and hrs began to appear on the 20th 17th and 15th day after stopping watering respectively fig 7 it can be seen that in two test stages drip fertilization triggered nhrs of plant earlier which enabled plants to save water as early as possible in addition drip fertilization also delayed the appearance of hrs to ensure that plants can maintain good water conditions under drought conditions to meet the needs of growth 3 4 2 soil water content when nhrs and hrs appeared at the jointing stage when nhrs appeared i1 had the highest swc and i2 had the lowest swc in the topsoil 0 20 cm layer in the 20 80 cm soil layer i2 had the highest swc and ck had the lowest swc when nhrs appeared the average swc in 0 80 cm soil layer of ck i1 and i2 was 60 6 62 3 and 63 7 fwc respectively fig 8 these results indicated that i1 and i2 improved the sensitivity of nhrs so nhrs appeared earlier in the process of soil natural drying when hrs appeared i1 had the highest swc and i2 had the lowest swc in the surface soil 0 20 cm in the 20 40 cm soil layer ck had the highest swc and i2 had the lowest swc in 40 80 cm soil layer swc of i2 was significantly higher than those of control and i1 when hrs appeared the average swc in 0 80 cm soil layers of ck i1 and i2 was 54 3 53 8 and 53 9 fwc respectively indicating that i1 and i2 delayed the emergence of hrs in the process of soil natural drying the swc at which nhrs of plants in i1 and i2 appeared was higher and terminated lower than that in ck so the threshold range of nhrs of plant was significantly greater for i1 and i2 than for ck at flowering stage when nhrs appeared the average swc in 0 100 cm layer of ck i1 and i2 was 62 4 64 4 and 65 2 fwc respectively when hrs appeared the average swc in 0 100 cm layer of ck i1 and i2 was 56 2 55 9 and 55 3 fwc respectively the threshold range of nhrs for i1 and i2 was also markedly greater than for ck fig 8 3 5 grain yield water productivity wp and yield stability ys in two test years both i1 and i2 reduced water consumption of winter wheat i1 and i2 had lower et compared with ck under natural drying conditions group2 the 1000 grain weight and grain yield of wheat in i1 and i2 were significantly higher than those of ck under the condition of adequate water supply group1 the grain yield iwp and wp of wheat in i1 and i2 were also higher than those of ck under natural drying conditions group2 the ratio of grain yield of natural drying group group2 to that of sufficient water supply group group1 was used to estimate yield stability ys of wheat ys of i1 and i2 was higher than that of ck table 2 in conclusion i2 had the highest grain yield iwp wp and ys in three irrigation modes which is more conducive to water saving production of winter wheat 4 discussion 4 1 effects of drip fertilization on root morphological pattern rmp root system have strong plasticity zhuge et al 2004 liu et al 2003 and can adjust their morphological structure and spatial distribution to adapt to the environment according to soil moisture and nutrient status yang et al 2018 zhang et al 2009 xue et al 2003 it is of great significance to ensure high and stable yield of crops by adopting appropriate agricultural measures to form environmental conditions that are conducive to increasing the proportion of deep roots miao et al 2019 previous studies have shown that different irrigation strategies can affect soil moisture status which in turn affects plant root growth lv et al 2010 wang et al 2014 drip fertilization affected the infiltration and redistribution of water and fertilizer in soil which affected the size and distribution of roots ma et al 2013 wang et al 2011 documented that irrigation methods had significant effect on the root spatial distribution of winter wheat surface drip irrigation and surface flood irrigation significantly promoted root system in 0 50 cm soil while the spatial variation coefficient of rld in 0 100 cm soil layer under subsurface drip irrigation was significantly smaller than those under surface drip irrigation and surface flood irrigation similar observation also showed that compared with surface flooding irrigation wheat under surface drip irrigation had higher rld in 0 60 cm soil layer while under subsurface drip irrigation the root biomass in shallow soil layer decreased significantly and increased in middle and lower soil layer jha et al 2017 our study also showed that different irrigation treatments also affected the root distribution of wheat in the early growth stage i1 mainly improved rwd and rld in the surface layer 0 20 cm while i2 mainly promoted rwd and rld in the 20 40 cm soil layer both i1 and i2 promoted rwd and rld of deep soil layer at late growth stage increasing deep roots helps make full use of water storage in deep soil layers gowda et al 2011 becker et al 2016 fang et al 2017 thus reducing the risk of yield loss due to drought barraclough and weir 1988 our study also confirmed that drip fertilization reduced the risk of yield loss by improving ys of wheat rwd and rld are often used to assess the effects of different environmental and management factors on root distribution patterns ahmadi et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 based on observations of rwd and rld our study showed that drip fertilization optimized the root morphological pattern rmp of wheat by increasing rwd and rld of deep roots 4 2 effects of drip fertilization on root activity pattern of plant soil moisture not only affects the morphological characteristics of root system but also has important influence on its physiological function the contribution of root system to crops depends not only on its size and distribution but also on the level of root activity wang et al 1995 wu et al 2017a some studies showed that both growth stage and soil water condition had significant effects on the root activity of wheat chu et al 2014 guan et al 2015 this study also showed that irrigation modes not only affected the size and distribution of roots but also had great influence on root activity i1 could not only significantly increase root activity of deep soil layer but also maintain higher root activity of upper layer thus ensuring the whole root system of plant had greater activity in the whole growth period i2 significantly increased root activity in the middle and lower soil layers and delayed the senescence of root in deep soil layers in the late growth stage in addition different irrigation treatments had different effects on the distribution space of maximum root activity mra of wheat at the jointing stage mra of i1 and ck was in10 20 cm soil layer and that of i2 is in 20 40 cm soil layer at the filling stage mra was located in 40 80 cm soil layer for ck and 20 60 cm soil layer for i1 and i2 treatments studies on root activity in different soil layers and its effect on yield at the later growth stage of wheat show that deep roots are the main functional roots in the stage of grain filling wang et al 2001 miao et al 2002 it is clear that drip fertilization can make the root system especially the deep root system maintain high activity in the late growth stage by coordinating the growth and development of deep and shallow root systems which is helpful to improve the grain yield of wheat root activity rwd and rld are important indicators to evaluate the potential water uptake capacity of roots mehrabi et al 2021 wu et al 2017 b however actual water uptake patterns by roots not only depends on the size and distribution of roots and root activity but also is related to the root zone microenvironment such as water and nutrients of plant zhang and yuan 1995 eugenio and dani 1999 the root activity pattern map reflects the actual contribution of each part of the root to its overall absorption capacity wahid 2000 which can be evaluated by measuring the water consumption of in different soil parts lehmann 2003 sun et al 2006 by analyzing the actual water consumption of root in different soil layers this study showed that two drip irrigation treatments significantly affected map of wheat in addition the actual water uptake pattern of root often varies with the temporal and spatial variation of soil water availability due to flexibility and plasticity of root which results in inconsistent rmp such as root length density or root biomass with rap of plant sun et al 2006 eugenio and dani 1999 green and clothier 1995 showed that before irrigation the water uptake pattern of plant was closely related to the distribution of root length density however after irrigation water uptake patterns shifted from rld dominance to water distribution control with priority given to water uptake from the wet parts of the soil therefore plants can adjust their water uptake strategies according to the changes of available water in different soil layers wu et al 2017b our study also shows that plants can adjust their water absorption strategy according to soil moisture status for example compared with the jointing stage after one week of irrigation the main water uptake space mus of each treatment moved to deep layer at heading stage after three weeks of irrigation the rap of plant also varied significantly with growth stages chu et al 2014 lehmann et al 2001 winter wheat mainly uses surface soil water at jointing stage and absorbs water from the middle and lower soil at filling stage liu et al 2020 this study also showed that in the stage of grain filling the mus of roots moved to deeper soil layer but two drip irrigation treatments had greater water absorption capacity in the deep layer therefore the analysis of rap and its variation under different irrigation treatments is helpful to explain the mechanism of efficient water use of crop more scientifically 4 3 influence of drip fertilization on root sourced signal of plant in addition to changing morphological characteristics to adapt to the soil environment roots can also sense the changes of root zone environment and make corresponding physiological responses in the early stage of drought roots can sense soil drought and generate root sourced chemical signals i e nhrs and then transmit them to the shoot and actively regulate stomatal opening to reduce water evaporation without a change in shoot water status li et al 2011 with the aggravation of soil drought the relative water content of the shoot decreased significantly and water status change in plant act as a signal i e hrs to control stomatal opening leading to further reduction of stomatal conductance when hrs appear it will seriously affect the physiological function and growth of plants however the physiological function and growth of plants was not significantly affected in the range of soil moisture threshold from emergence of nhrs to the end i e emergence of hrs xiong et al 2006 the generation of root sourced signals depend on the root biomass in dry soil layer and the difference between soil water potential and root water potential the characteristics of root growth and root sourced signals vary with different soil conditions ma et al 2015 blum and johnson 1993 showed that spring wheat varieties with fewer roots in the soil surface were less sensitive to soil drought and root sourced chemical signals nhrs in our study i1 and i2 also affect the root sourced signal characteristics of crops by optimizing the spatial distribution of water and roots plant in i1 is more sensitive to nhrs due to the increase of surface roots and nhrs appear earlier in the process of soil natural drying i2 also increased the sensitivity of nhrs due to soil surface drought the early activation of nhrs can enable plants to make water saving response as early as possible to resist the coming severe drought ober and sharp 2003 ma et al 2015 thus improving grain yield and water use efficiency in addition due to the increase of root biomass and root length density in the deep soil layer two drip fertilization treatments enhanced the water absorption capacity of the root system under drought conditions thus delaying the emergence of hrs so as to ensure the crop productivity and improved yield stability ys under drought conditions therefore two drip fertilization treatments improved the yield stability and water use efficiency of wheat i2 caused surface soil drought and the nhrs generated by roots in surface dry soil was transmitted to leaves earlier to regulate stomatal opening therefore the nhrs of i2 appeared earlier than that of i1 so that plants could save water earlier while the deep root system can absorb water from the wet soil to meet the needs of normal plant growth in conclusion drip fertilization optimized root morphology and activity pattern and root sourced signal characteristics by improving water and fertilizer environment in root zone thus improving grain yield ys and wp of crop 5 conclusions drip fertilization affected rmp and rap of wheat by affecting the distribution of water and nitrogen in the soil both i1and i2 reduced rwd and rld in 0 20 cm soil layer while promoted those in deep soil layers 40 60 cm i1 and i2 delayed the senescence of roots in the later stage and had greater root activity in the middle and lower soil layers compared with ck drip fertilization also changed the distribution of mra the mra of i1 and ck was located in the10 20 cm soil layer and that of i2 was in 20 40 cm soil layer at the jointing stage at the filling stage the mra of ck was distributed in the 40 80 cm soil layer while mra of i1 and i2 was distributed in 20 60 cm soil layer plant can change its water absorption strategy and rap with varying growth stages at jointing stage plants in i1and ck mainly use soil water in 0 20 cm soil layer while i2 mainly absorbs water from 20 to 40 cm soil layer at the grain filling stage the mus of plants moved to deeper soil layers but i1 and i2 have greater water uptake capacity compared with ck drip fertilization also increased the sensitivity of nhrs nhrs appeared earlier but delayed the emergence of hrs in addition the grain yield ys and wp of i1 and i2 were also higher than those of ck in conclusion drip fertilization optimized rmp and rap and root sourced signal characteristics of crop by improving the water and fertilizer environment in the root zone and thus improved grain yield ys and wp of crop declaration of competing interest the

9371,for agricultural areas facing water scarcity sustainable water use policy relies on irrigation information that is timely and at a high resolution but existing publicly available water use data are often insufficient for monitoring compliance or understanding the influence of policy on individual farmer decisions this study attempts to fill this data gap by using remote sensing to map annual irrigation quantity at the field scale within the central ogallala aquifer region of the united states we compiled in situ annual irrigation volume data at the field scale in the republican river basin of colorado for 2015 2018 and at the public land survey system plss section scale in western kansas for 2000 2016 which served as reference data in random forest models that relied on landsat based actual evapotranspiration from the operational simplified surface energy balance model ssebop along with maps of irrigated area landsat spectral indices climate soils and derived hydrologic variables the models explained 87 of the variability in irrigation volume in colorado and 75 in kansas but accuracy declined when transferring the models in spatial cross validation colorado r2 0 81 kansas r2 0 51 and temporal cross validation colorado r2 0 82 kansas r2 0 68 predicted annual totals of irrigation volume in western kansas had a mean absolute error of 11 9 which was slightly higher than the average annual change of 11 use of predicted irrigation maps also lead to an underestimated effect size for a water use restriction policy in kansas these results indicate that field and section scale irrigation can be mapped with reasonable accuracy within a region and time period that has adequate sample data but that methods may need to be improved for applying the models more broadly in areas that lack extensive in situ irrigation data to support further research on water use and aid in structuring policy keywords water abstraction groundwater pumping operational simplified surface energy balance ssebop evapotranspiration local enhanced management area model transfer 1 introduction irrigation with groundwater and surface water represents a vital agricultural input responsible for substantial gains in agricultural productivity hornbeck and keskin 2014 yet in some areas the sustainability of agricultural productivity is in jeopardy due to severe groundwater depletion deines et al 2020 the ogallala aquifer in the central plains of the united states in particular accounts for a substantial percentage of the irrigation supplied to this agriculturally productive region but excessive withdrawals from the aquifer have led to severe drawdown in some areas haacker et al 2016 mcguire 2017 this depletion of groundwater resources has been projected to result in a 24 loss in irrigated acreage by 2100 forcing these areas to transition to dryland crop agriculture or pasture deines et al 2020 failing to account for land use suitability can underestimate the county level economic impacts of groundwater depletion by 12 45 deines et al 2020 to support sustainable groundwater use and agricultural productivity accurate monitoring of groundwater withdrawals is needed for informing water policy and management decisions every five years the u s geological survey usgs provides a report on national water use with county level summaries dieter et al 2018 which is compiled from data collected across a multitude of entities using a variety of methods bradley 2017 however because decisions on groundwater use are made at the individual field scale and policies are implemented within water districts that may not correspond to counties irrigation monitoring is needed not just at national state or county levels but at the field level as well besides water management policies several other factors drive individual irrigation decisions made at the field level such as crop type soil characteristics climate and the type of irrigation system consistent and widely available data on field level irrigation would be beneficial to understand how these factors interact to influence the decisions of individual farmers several studies have examined the effects of policies prices and a handful of other determinants on groundwater extraction levels pfeiffer and lin 2014 zhu et al 2007 but these studies have focused on areas where high resolution irrigation information is available however there are other areas that use considerable groundwater for which high resolution data are not available for example nebraska has a collection of local regulations across the state that mandate reporting and limit extraction through allotment systems drilling moratoria and other means ifft et al 2018 these regulations are often credited with improvements in aquifer levels andales et al 2020 but such monitoring and regulation is by far the exception having access to a broader dataset of field scale irrigation both spatially and temporally would greatly increase the potential scope of the aforementioned behavioral studies additionally broadly available field scale irrigation data could ensure water use compliance which is often self reported recent advances in remote sensing have enabled spatially explicit estimation of water abstraction for irrigation at global to field scales using a variety of approaches foster et al 2020 foster et al 2020 categorized these approaches into those primarily based on satellite estimation of soil moisture estimation of crop coefficients and use of thermal infrared imaging for estimating evapotranspiration studies that primarily rely on remotely sensed soil moisture brocca et al 2018 jalilvand et al 2019 zaussinger et al 2019 have been limited to mapping irrigation at gridded resolutions of 25 km or greater rather than field scales due to the coarse resolution of the synthetic aperture radar systems used with the highest resolution soil moisture products now being 1 3 km from the fusion of soil moisture active passive and sentinel 1 das et al 2019 crop coefficient based methods infer vegetation condition over the growing season from remotely sensed vegetation indices from which crop water requirements are estimated however previous studies have shown that actual water use from in situ irrigation data is often not perfectly aligned with estimated crop water requirements foster et al 2019 which could be due to imperfect information on conditions regional water management policies irrigation costs or other factors a third class of approaches estimates irrigation by incorporating remote sensing based actual evapotranspiration eta into soil water balance models or predictive models recent advances in remote sensing of eta have made this approach appealing because it can now be applied at field scales and deriving estimates of irrigation from eta depends less upon assumptions about water application efficiency although eta may be estimated from remote sensing through a variety of techniques zhang et al 2016 many models use a surface energy balance approach that utilizes land surface temperature obtained from remote sensing of thermal radiation allen et al 2007 bastiaanssen et al 1998 senay et al 2013 these methods have recently been extended from coarse resolution sensors such as the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis 500 m to landsat 30 m for relatively high resolution mapping of eta maps of landsat based eta have been used to characterize trends in crop consumptive water use at regional scales senay et al 2019 and aid in understanding the influence of water policy on consumptive water use senay et al 2017 some studies have further partitioned eta into blue water originating from ground and surface water sources and green water originating from precipitation using a combination of remotely sensed et and land surface models romaguera et al 2012 velpuri and senay 2017 foster et al 2020 identified 20 studies that primarily relied upon thermal remote sensing of et for estimating irrigation however only three of these studies folhes et al 2009 lópez valencia et al 2020 tazekrit et al 2018 were applied at the field scale and incorporated the use of in situ irrigation data and they were all limited to a single year and a single region little research has been done to test applicability of irrigation models to other time periods or regions that lack in situ irrigation data majumdar et al 2020 leveraged 17 years of in situ irrigation data in kansas to develop models of irrigation but did so at a 5 km resolution and primarily relied upon crop type maps that only extend back to 2006 in most areas of the united states to achieve sustainable water use goals this approach would need to be extended to a field scale across multiple years of data additionally errors would need to be well characterized to avoid inappropriate policy decisions that could negatively affect farmers or water conservation foster et al 2020 the objective of this study was to develop and test high resolution mapping of irrigation quantity to support sustainable water management goals we made use of advances in remote sensing of eta and irrigated area along with other environmental data to develop empirical models of the volume and depth of irrigation applied to fields across multiple years models were tested at two scales to reflect two different scenarios of data availability one in which individual field boundaries are available for known irrigated fields and one in which field boundaries and irrigation status are unknown but where public land survey system plss sections 640 acres can be used to aggregate several fields through development and testing of these models we sought to answer the following questions 1 how does irrigated map accuracy compare between using field scale models and plss section scale models 2 what is the relative importance of predictor variables related to hydrology and irrigated area in modeling irrigation quantity 3 what is the consistency of map accuracy when applying the models to new time periods and areas with similar conditions 4 what is the potential effect of map error on downstream applications such as regional estimates of irrigation and economic analyses of water use policy through answering these questions this research makes progress towards a model framework that could be applied for high resolution mapping of irrigation in areas and time periods that lack extensive in situ water abstraction data to inform water management and policy 2 methods 2 1 overview of methods this study draws on extensive databases of in situ irrigation data and advances in remote sensing of eta irrigated area and other environmental data to develop empirical models of irrigation across multiple scales and multiple years field scale mapping of irrigation was tested in the republican river basin of colorado where well level data were available on water abstraction from 2015 to 2018 mapping of irrigation was also tested in western kansas where water abstraction data were available at the scale of public land survey system plss sections 640 acres from 2000 to 2016 we developed and tested a series of random forest models of irrigation from this reference data utilizing predictor variables related to soil water balance components including landsat based eta obtained from the operational simplified surface energy balance ssebop model senay et al 2013 precipitation and runoff along with soil water storage capacity landsat based vegetation indices related to irrigated area and previously developed maps of irrigated area deines et al 2019 given the previous challenges with high uncertainty from remotely sensed irrigation we tested the transferability of models across years and sub regions within the study areas we also compared total observed and predicted irrigation levels within the kansas study area for 2000 2016 and we investigated how error in predicted irrigation could lead to different conclusions for an economic policy analysis 2 2 study area modeling and mapping of field level irrigation was conducted for the republican river basin of eastern colorado 22 753 km2 and western kansas 85 444 km2 fig 1 this study area was chosen because it overlies the ogallala aquifer qi 2010 where groundwater depletion is an important issue of concern and because this area contains records of annual well level groundwater pumping that could be joined to individual fields in colorado or to plss sections in kansas irrigation modeling in the colorado study area reflects an application scenario in which field boundaries are known and irrigation is known to have occurred and models of the kansas study area reflect a scenario in which neither field boundaries nor irrigated area are known according to the 2016 cropland data layer cdl usda nass 2019 which maps crop type of both irrigated and non irrigated cultivation there were 9253 km2 and 40 515 km2 of various crops and hay within the colorado and kansas study areas respectively based on the 2016 cdl corn and winter wheat including irrigated and non irrigated were the dominant crops in both the colorado 48 winter wheat and 35 corn and kansas 46 winter wheat and 27 corn study areas these cropland areas and proportions of each crop were different for the data used in modeling after limiting to fields and sections with irrigation data and other filtering described below in section 2 2 corn is typically sown around late april and harvested around october winter wheat is the earliest sown crop that is planted in the fall of the previous year and harvested in the summer while sorghum is the latest common crop with many fields being harvested in november nass 2010 the colorado study area and western kansas have cold semi arid climates koppen classification bsk with warm dry summers and cold winters and the climate becomes humid and subtropical koppen classification cfa with hot humid summers and cold winters when moving farther east into kansas kottek et al 2006 precipitation follows an increasing gradient from west to east with the colorado portion receiving approximately 400 mm per year and the eastern edge of the study area near wichita kansas receiving approximately 900 mm per year daly et al 2008 thirty year normals 1981 2010 of mean minimum and maximum temperature and vapor pressure deficit similarly increase from northwest to southeast mean annual temperature is approximately 10 c in the northwest republican river basin of colorado and approximately 14 c near wichita kansas daly et al 2008 2 3 data 2 3 1 annual field and section level irrigation for the republican river basin of colorado annual irrigation of each field was derived from attributing well pumping data in 2015 2018 to field boundaries cdss 2019 supplied by the colorado division of water resources cdwr annual pumping volume of each well was measured and then reported to the water district by the landowner the cdwr field boundaries were delineated from aerial imagery and landsat maximum normalized difference vegetation index ndvi in each year this field boundary dataset also contains the list of wells serving each field fields ranged in size including fields that were small corners of a parcel around a center pivot 7 ac portions of a center pivot field standard center pivot fields 125 ac and occasionally larger fields we joined the annual well data to the field boundaries and summed irrigation from multiple wells serving a single field water from wells serving multiple fields were divided based on field area for the 53 2 of wells that served multiple fields a vast majority consisted of the water feeding a single circular central pivot field with the remainder going to adjacent small corner fields splitting total irrigation evenly across multiple fields based on field area therefore likely has little effect on the outcome we removed the 0 77 of fields with unreasonably high irrigation levels greater than 3 ac ft per ac filtering the dataset left an average of 1863 km2 of cropland in each year to be used in analysis which was predominately corn mean of 77 corn across years note that this is quite different from the proportion of crops in the region 48 winter wheat and 35 corn from 2016 cdl and field boundaries with well data appeared to exclude some fields likely because they were unirrigated for example national agricultural statistics service nass census data for phillips and yuma counties in colorado nass 2019 which are completely within the study area show that only 8 of the harvested area of winter wheat was irrigated in 2017 although we were primarily interested in volume of water extracted much of the variation in pumping volume was due to variability in field size pearson s r 0 85 so pumping volume was divided by field area to obtain the irrigation quantity as depth in millimeters mm modeling irrigation as depth and converting back to volume yielded slightly better performance than modeling volume directly and better illustrates how much variance is truly explained by the predictive modeling as opposed to simply knowing field size irrigation quantity had a normal distribution with a slight right tail fig 1 and a mean of 328 mm in 2016 the distribution was similar in other years and the overall mean was 336 mm for the kansas study area 2000 2016 annual irrigation for each plss section was derived from well abstraction data from the kansas water information management and analysis system wimas which is managed jointly by the kansas department of agriculture kansas division of water resources and kansas geological survey 2019 landowners are required to self report water use for each well on an annual basis as of 2011 landowners using groundwater must have a flowmeter state of kansas 2011 but prior to this regulation water use may have been estimated by other means such as by multiplying pumping rate and operation time for constant rate pumps we joined this well level water withdrawal data to the kansas plss section map and subset by lands overlapping the ogallala aquifer land ownership and management is divided by these plss sections and wells are typically located within the center of fields at center pivot locations because of this we assumed all water from a well was applied to the same section that it was located in although some water may have been distributed to other sections the standard plss section is 640 acres but section size varied between 13 and 909 acres because of sections on the edge of the state and principal meridians because sections were mostly the same size and entire sections were rarely irrigated irrigation volume was less correlated with section area pearson s r 0 07 but more closely related to estimates of irrigated area which we incorporated into other predictor variables as described in section 2 2 4 in 2016 depth of irrigation mm was zero inflated and had a right skew fig 1 with a mean of 39 mm the distribution was similar in other years and the dataset had an overall mean of 43 mm because the irrigated area within each section was unknown and unlikely to be evenly distributed across the entire section area we modeled volume of irrigation instead of depth for this kansas dataset the overall mean irrigation volume for all years was 90 7 ac ft we removed 0 14 of the observations with unreasonably high irrigation levels 3 ac ft per ac because the maximum allowable water use in counties of western kansas is at most 2 ac ft per ac barfield 2017 filtering the dataset left an average area of 83 211 km2 in each year included in the analysis in years with cdl data 2006 2016 37 118 km2 of this area was cropland on average which was composed of 50 winter wheat 24 corn 16 sorghum 4 soy 3 alfalfa and 3 other crops including double cropping 2 3 2 actual evapotranspiration field scale estimates of monthly actual and growing season evapotranspiration were obtained through application of the ssebop model to landsat imagery and gridmet and daymet climate data in google earth engine senay et al 2017 2016 2013 ssebop estimates the fraction of potential evapotranspiration etf which is multiplied by a scaled k alfalfa reference potential evapotranspiration eto obtained from the gridded surface meteorological dataset gridmet abatzoglou 2013 in order to calculate actual evapotranspiration eta eq 1 etf is obtained through a simplified surface energy balance approach by scaling the difference between the land surface temperature ts and a cold wet limit tc by the surface psychrometric constant of a dry bare surface γ s 1 eta 1 γ s t s t c k eto land surface temperature is calculated from the corrected thermal radiance obtained from landsat and emissivity based on the ndvi threshold method sobrino et al 2004 the daily cold wet limit of surface temperature and the surface psychrometric constant are obtained from daily maximum and minimum temperatures and average clear sky net radiation calculated from daymet thornton et al 2016 desert research institute has created a preliminary implementation of ssebop for landsat in google earth engine gorelick et al 2017 as part of the openet project morton et al 2021 which is the implementation we have used in this study openet core version 0 0 10 and ssebop version 0 0 13 ji et al 2021 found 2015 monthly ssebop estimates of eta had high accuracy when compared against two ameriflux eddy covariance towers in kansas us kfs r2 0 93 bias 5 5 mm rmse 18 9 mm us kls r2 0 87 bias 5 7 mm rmse 20 3 mm landsat tier 1 surface reflectance images from april to october for 2011 2018 were masked for clouds cloud shadow and snow using the provided pixel qa band we applied the ssebop algorithm to these images to estimate daily eta at 30 m and aggregated these estimates to monthly intervals by linearly interpolating daily values between available images field or section level eta was then calculated as the mean of the monthly pixel values within each field or section boundary to reduce the influence of missing data and minor variations within a field that may not be due to actual differences in irrigation the monthly eta values were then summed for the growing season april october as well 2 3 3 other predictors other predictor variables included those related to water balance components and irrigated area monthly precipitation from gridmet 2 5 4 km was incorporated in the modeling along with other hydrologic variables derived from combinations of the precipitation and runoff with eta to account for runoff we obtained usgs estimates of hydrologic unit code huc level 8 watershed runoff which are calculated through area weighted averages of daily streamgage data within basins of the huc8 watersheds brakebill et al 2011 the huc8 watershed intersecting both study areas ranged from 1059 to 9990 km2 mean 3706 km2 mean gridmet precipitation prmean was calculated over each huc8 watershed and an effective precipitation coefficient prcoef for each watershed was calculated as the fraction of watershed precipitation after subtracting runoff eq 2 2 prcoef prmean runoff prmean this effective precipitation coefficient was then used to scale the pixel level 4 km precipitation over each watershed which produces pixel level estimates of effective precipitation pref available for crop water use the mean effective precipitation was calculated for each field in colorado and each section in kansas runoff was generally low across watersheds and years and the precipitation coefficients were correspondingly quite high the growing season april october prcoef averaged across years and watersheds for both study areas ranged from 0 69 to 1 00 and had a mean of 0 97 because of this the effective growing precipitation was lower than precipitation by only 2 6 mm on average for the fields in colorado and by 10 3 mm on average for the sections in kansas irrigation irr could be calculated directly with a simple water balance model if all other factors were known eq 3 including the input of precipitation pr and outputs of actual evapotranspiration eta runoff ro and changes in soil water storage δs 3 irr eta ro s pr because the total annual change in surface soil water storage is relatively small in comparison to the factors that we can estimate such as eta pr ro simply subtracting the effective precipitation from eta to obtain net irrigation netirr table 1 should provide a strong predictor of water abstraction for irrigation in an empirical model the mean net irrigation netirr was calculated on a monthly and seasonal basis for each colorado field and kansas section ideally the annual change in soil water storage would also be included in the model and the derivation of netirr but current soil moisture datasets have at best a 1 km resolution das et al 2019 which is likely insufficient to capture field level spatial variability in soil moisture changes caused by irrigation practices in lieu of having δs we included the mean available water storage in the upper 25 50 100 and 150 cm table 1 as additional predictors which were calculated for each field and section from the ssurgo database soil survey staff 2019 of information obtained from soil surveys deines et al 2019 found a suite of landsat spectral indices to be important predictors in detecting irrigation across the high plains aquifer which contains the ogallala aquifer from 1984 to 2017 these spectral metrics may also capture variance in irrigation quantity not explained by the above water balance components we incorporated the spectral indices which had the highest ranked importance by gini score in their models including the annual maximums of the green chlorophyll vegetation index gcvi normalized difference moisture index ndmi ndvi and the water adjusted green index wgi annual maximum gcvi x annual maximum ndmi shown in table 1 these spectral indices were also normalized by dividing by the 15th percentile value of the index within a 50 km radius to create neighborhood greenness indices ngcvi nndmi nndvi nwgi as in deines et al 2019 prior to calculating the neighborhood values the indices are first masked to exclude urban areas and water using the 2016 national land cover database yang et al 2018 because an abundance of these land cover types depresses the apparent regional greenness holes in the neighborhood image were then filled with the focal median within a 10 km radius we also limited the neighborhood values to be at most the median of the region wide spectral index value within each study area these neighborhood normalized greenness indices provide more consistent metrics for applying the model across a wide range of conditions as they account for regional differences in overall greenness to highlight local variations 2 3 4 irrigated area in colorado individual fields are delineated so the potential irrigated area is known but within the plss sections of the kansas study area the area of active cultivation and irrigation varied greatly with many sections containing no irrigated cropland at all fig 1 to reduce the influence of non irrigated areas on estimates of average et and landsat spectral indices we incorporated the use of irrigated area maps created for the entire high plains aquifer region at a 30 m resolution from 1985 to 2019 by deines et al 2019 which were generated from predictive modeling with landsat neighborhood normalized spectral indices like those described in section 2 2 3 use of these maps has the advantage of focusing summaries of our predictor variables to estimated irrigated areas rather than entire crop areas many of which may not be irrigated also as shown for the colorado study area most of the variance in irrigation volume can be explained by area alone the estimated irrigated area and percent irrigated area within each section in kansas were included as stand alone predictor variables and the mean of the landsat based spectral indices and evapotranspiration were obtained only over the irrigated area other predictor variables had much lower resolutions e g precipitation at 4 km such that summaries using only the irrigated area would be no different than using the entire section for the hydrology based predictor variables et precipitation and et minus precipitation we multiplied the previously calculated depth values by the estimated irrigated area within each section for the appropriate year to convert these variables to volume in acre feet table 1 sections with no irrigated area were given a predicted irrigation volume of 0 ac ft 2 4 irrigation modeling the irrigated area actual evapotranspiration effective precipitation derived net irrigation landsat based spectral indices and soil available water storage variables served as predictors table 1 of field level irrigation depth for the colorado study area and section level irrigation volume in the kansas study area using random forest models breiman 2001 the models used common random forest parameters of 500 trees and splitting at each node by considering the square root of the total number of predictors evaluation of each model was initially done using out of bag predictions which provide unbiased estimates of generalization error breiman 2001 and have been shown to be as accurate as using a test set of the same size as the training set breiman 2001 1996 models were evaluated by the coefficient of determination r2 root mean squared error rmse and mean difference of predictions from the observations bias differences in model accuracy between the two study areas were primarily compared with rmse as a percentage of the mean observed value rmse because of differences in scale when comparing irrigation volume i e fields vs sections and differences in the distributions of irrigation depth fig 1 the primary goal of our study was to develop and test models for high prediction accuracy rather than the development of parsimonious interpretable models however we compared the relative importance of predictor variables to aid future research and also verified that the model was capturing the relationships between key predictor variables and the response variables that would be expected from simple water balance models hydrologic theory and known irrigation practices predictor variables of the full models for each study area were compared by their importance values which were calculated as the mean across trees of the total decrease in mean squared error caused by the variable when it was used for splitting nodes of each tree these importance values were normalized so that they sum to one the models included some highly correlated predictor variables such as adjacent months for hydrologic variables the different landsat spectral indices and the available water storage variables which were not filtered because multicollinearity does not reduce random forest performance however multicollinearity can confound the ability to interpret variable importance values because correlated predictors will often have similar but diluted importance scores while other predictors that may have contributed more novel information for improving model performance could be pushed down in rank kuhn and johnson 2013 a correlation heatmap is shown for both study areas to aid in interpreting the variable importance scores one dimensional accumulated local effects ale plots apley and zhu 2020 were created to capture the main effect of the top ranked predictor variable from each of the six types of predictors eta pref netirr aws area and spectral indices table 1 these plots illustrate the difference of the predicted response from the overall mean prediction across a range of values for a given predictor variable ale plots have the advantages of isolating the main effect for the feature of interest and preventing unreasonable combinations for correlated predictor variables molnar 2019 which are problems common to the more widely used m plots and partial dependence plots respectively because we are primarily interested in the application of these models for other regions and years with no available pumping data we also tested transferability of the models by training on one region and testing on another region leave one side out validation as well as training on a subset of years and testing on the withheld year leave one year out validation these forms of validation serve to test for applicability of the models across space and time but within the same domain i e environment and conditions as the model training space because extrapolation often leads to poor results kuhn and johnson 2013 for the leave one side out validation the data were split spatially into halves for training and testing for example fields or sections with their centroid lying in the eastern half of the study area were used for training and the other half were used for testing and then the training and testing sides were flipped the same process was repeated with a north south split for spatial and temporal cross validation the sample size weighted mean of the accuracy statistics from each test set are given for the colorado models we also provide accuracy statistics once predicted irrigation depth is converted back into volume using field area because estimating volume was of primary interest for the kansas study area where a census of observed irrigation was available we performed an additional analysis comparing the total annual irrigation volume from wimas as well as the observed total irrigation of sections that were included in modeling after filtering for outliers and missing data against the corresponding total of predicted irrigation when that year was the test set of leave one year out validation this comparison illustrates how section level error translates to expected levels of error when aggregating over larger areas and applying the model in years lacking training data often models even with relatively high error can produce reasonable aggregated estimates so long as the model has relatively low bias 2 5 irrigation in local enhanced management areas one of our objectives was to develop an irrigation model that could be used for examining the influence of past water management policies on local and regional water use decisions for areas that lack comprehensive irrigation data because most policy analyses evaluate the average effect of a policy on relevant outcomes we are primarily interested in obtaining predictions of irrigation that are unbiased and errors that are not correlated with the primary factors of interest e g areas where the policy is applied or not applied to test this application we examined the influence of using predicted irrigation versus observed irrigation in an analysis of policy effects on water use decisions this analysis replicated a simplified version of the model presented in drysdale and hendricks 2018 using both our observed irrigation data and the predicted irrigation data at the scale of plss sections in kansas kansas previously implemented a system by which local authorities can self regulate groundwater extraction by establishing a local enhanced management area lema in 2013 a lema was established in the area of sheridan county in kansas which focused on reducing groundwater extractions the study by drysdale and hendricks 2018 compared water usage inside this lema to the immediate surrounding area they used a spatial discontinuity approach using water withdrawal data from a sample of wells from 2007 to 2016 within the lema boundary and then all wells no greater than 5 miles and no less than 2 miles from the lema boundary they ran a series of mixed effect regression models with logged dependent variables total irrigation irrigation intensity and irrigated acres and a set of weather controls as independent variables including temperature and precipitation as well as water rights level fixed effects and farmer year fixed effects a dummy independent variable was also included to indicate whether the well was within the lema or in the buffer zone outside of the lema their results showed that groundwater restrictions within the lema led to a reduction in groundwater use mostly through reductions in irrigation intensity our analysis is modeled after the drysdale and hendricks 2018 study we used a similar set of weather controls as independent variables including potential evapotranspiration et o in mm average temperature temp in c precipitation precip in mm and the square of precipitation precip 2 in mm2 during the growing season calculated from gridmet daily weather estimates abatzoglou 2013 we included precipitation as a quadratic term in the regression to control for non linear effects precipitation may have on irrigation because our observation unit was a section rather than a water right our fixed effects were at the section level along with year fixed effects there were many zeros in our dependent variable and so we excluded wells that reported no irrigation focusing instead on sections that were irrigated we used the level of irrigation volume rather than a log transformation as in drysdale and hendricks 2018 to aid in interpretation our empirical specification was the following v it α i γ t β i it δ x ε it where v it is the volume in acre feet of water pumped within some section i in year t we indicated whether a section was within the lema with the variable i it we had section fixed effects a i and year fixed effects γ t x is the set of weather controls with a set of corresponding coefficients δ the term ε it is an independent and identically distributed i i d random error we ran this regression on four sets of data covering the same extent as in drysdale and hendricks 2018 and years 2000 2016 the first dataset included the full set of observed section level irrigation values in and around the lema the second was the set of out of bag predicted irrigation values from the model of irrigation volume using all data in the kansas study area the third was the set of predictions from temporal cross validation where one year of data was withheld for validation while samples from the remaining years were used for model training the fourth was the set of predicted irrigation values from the spatial cross validation model where the model was trained on the sections in the southern half of kansas and then validated on the northern half of kansas which includes the lema study area we also ran four different versions of our model the first included only fixed effects the second included fixed effects and the total potential evapotranspiration et o during the growing season the third included the fixed effects plus the weather controls of mean temperature temp total precipitation precip and the square of total precipitation precip 2 during the growing season the final model included the fixed effects evapotranspiration and the weather controls all results feature standard errors that were clustered at the section level for each set of models we compared differences in the coefficients between using the observed irrigation data and using the three predicted irrigation datasets to see if different conclusions would be drawn depending on the data source we also evaluated whether presence of a section within the lema had a different average level of error in predicted irrigation volume than outside the lema which could be a major factor in influencing our interpretations from the above regression models 3 results 3 1 field level irrigation in colorado in colorado the random forest model explained about half of the variability in field level irrigation quantity r2 0 49 rmse 30 when modeled as depth fig 2a however the model explains 87 of the variability in irrigation volume which was calculated by multiplying by field size fig 2d as previously mentioned field area alone explains 72 of the variance pearson s r 0 85 in irrigation volume because of the array of field sizes in this study area overall bias was low 1 mm but the two dimensional density plots i e hexbin plots of observations and predictions show the model to underestimate high levels of irrigation with predictions rarely exceeding 500 mm while low levels of irrigation have a slight positive bias fig 2a this compression of predictions towards the mean observed value is common in models using an ensemble of decision trees like random forest for 2016 the spatial distribution of errors from the full model in colorado appeared to be random with no strong clustering in any one region and the histogram of residuals was approximately normal and centered on zero fig 3 model accuracy declined slightly when transferring the model to other time periods through leave one year out cross validation fig 2c rmse 35 and also for transfer to other areas with leave one side out cross validation fig 2b rmse 35 in comparison to the full model fig 2a rmse 30 when converting to volume the full spatial cross validation and temporal cross validation models had slightly greater differences in rmse but smaller difference in r2 and bias fig 2d f more notable is the increase in bias with spatial and temporal cross validation for the depth based results fig 2a c particularly for fields with low irrigation the decreases in accuracy between the full model and when performing spatial and temporal cross validation are likely due to spatial and temporal dependence in the dataset one source of spatial dependence mentioned previously is the predominantly east west precipitation gradient that exists in this region by training and testing on different halves of the dataset we can see that the model would likely have slightly decreased accuracy when transferring to other regions without available training data possibly even those with only slightly different conditions such as modestly higher or lower precipitation the same can be said for transferability to different years but this may be because with only four years in the dataset 2015 2018 the model has yet to be exposed to a wide range of different temporal conditions for training such as multiple wet or dry years the available water storage variables aws 025 100 were all ranked as the most important in the full model fig 4a each having an importance value of 0 04 0 05 these variables were also very highly correlated pearson s r 0 91 0 99 fig s1 and each had a monotonically decreasing but non linear effect on predicted irrigation fig s2 growing season and summer monthly net irrigation variables e g netirr grow netirr 07 09 were the next group of variables with the highest importance ranking importance 0 03 0 04 netirr grow had ale values that increased in an approximately linear fashion when above 100 mm fig s2 landsat spectral indices ranked fairly low in feature importance for this model even though they were important in models of irrigated area by deines et al 2019 the common variable importance method we employ here is known to be biased towards variables with higher cardinality strobl et al 2007 however all the predictor variables were continuous and the most important variables available water storage had the lowest number of unique values in the set of predictors variable rankings were also similar when using a permutation based variable importance method on the training data results not shown 3 2 section level irrigation in kansas the full section level model of irrigation volume in kansas explained a relatively large proportion of the variance r2 0 75 fig 5a but tended to overestimate in sections with low observed irrigation even in this region dominated by irrigated cultivation sections with low pumping volume were common 72 had 0 ac ft which led to a high rmse as a percentage of the mean observed value rmse 114 when disregarding sections with zero irrigation for calculating the accuracy statistics rmse dropped to 54 for this model even though rmse increased to 176 ac ft overall model accuracy improved only slightly to an rmse of 101 4 when only considering data from 2011 and later after the flowmeter installation requirements took effect the predicted irrigation volume was converted to depth in mm fig 5d f using the plss section areas for comparison with the results from the colorado study area but this conversion likely underestimates the amount of irrigation concentrated on the irrigated area because it effectively assumes that the entire section was irrigated the rmse and r2 for the volume estimates fig 5a c were nearly the same as depth based converted results fig 5d f because the section area explained little variation in irrigation volume results were nearly identical if modeling irrigation depth directly and when excluding sections with zero irrigation for 2016 the spatial distribution of errors in mm from the full model appeared to show some clustering with small regions of over and under estimation but as in colorado the residuals were centered on zero and approximately normal fig 3 the net irrigation and eta variables summed over the growing season netirr grow and eta grow and in the summer netirr 07 eta 07 eta 08 were the top five predictor variables fig 4b all five were highly multicollinear pearson s r 0 88 0 97 fig s3 in part because they were all transformed to volume using irrigated area the ale plots of the eta and netirr predictors show steep increases of predicted irrigation as their values increased in the middle ranges but with flat responses at the ends fig s4 the deines et al 2019 predicted irrigated area area alone explained 50 of the variance in irrigation volume pearson s r 0 71 and had a linear effect on predictions until approaching an asymptote after about 450 acres fig s4 although engineering the hydrologic predictors to be in volume units by incorporating irrigated area greatly improved their explanatory power the resulting multicollinearity does confound our ability to determine their relative importance to parse out the effect of irrigated area we evaluated variable importance for another model of kansas irrigation volume with hydrologic predictors used in their original depth form rather than converted to volume using irrigated area fig s5 in this model irrigated area and percent had the highest importance values 0 20 and 0 18 respectively followed by net irrigation and eta variables for the growing season 0 05 and 0 03 respectively and july 0 04 and 0 04 respectively because using the hydrologic variables as depth reduces some of their multicollinearity pearson s r 0 47 0 83 for the same five previously listed other variables that helped to improve model accuracy rose in rank such as ngcvi and the available water storage variables as in the colorado study area model accuracy declined when examining spatial and temporal transferability with leave one side out validation fig 5b and leave one year out validation fig 5c attempting to train and test the model on split halves caused many samples with high observed irrigation to be underestimated fig 5b which led to an overall negative bias this underestimation with spatial transfer is likely due to differences in the distribution of the response between the training and testing halves table 2 for example training on the north half which has a mean of 36 5 ac ft and 83 zeros leads to a bias of 44 2 ac ft when testing on the south half which had a much higher mean of 123 2 ac ft and only 66 zeros irrigation volume was much more consistent temporally with annual mean irrigation having a coefficient of variation cv of 13 as opposed to the 47 cv of spatial halves this greater temporal consistency led to lower error with temporal cross validation rmse 126 than spatial cross validation rmse 159 although the apparent error was still fairly high because of zero inflation depressing the mean of the observations the annual sample size weighted mean of annual irrigation including zeros was 91 ac ft while it was 327 ac ft when excluding zeros even though the overall bias for sections with zero irrigation was reasonably low 25 ac ft in temporal cross validation the accuracy appears to be better when not considering sections with zero irrigation rmse 58 because of zero inflation we examined the effect of model error when totaling irrigation over the entire western kansas study area fig 6 the wimas census of irrigation allowed us to make a direct comparison of the total predicted irrigation i e using predictions of each withheld year from temporal cross validation to the unfiltered total irrigation however because sections with outlier irrigation values i e 3 ac ft per ac and missing data were filtered out in model development the predicted total irrigation is best compared to the same set of observations used in modeling the mean annual observed irrigation was 2 92 million ac ft and the mean absolute error across years was 0 34 million ac ft the absolute error was 11 9 of the observations on average which slightly exceeded the mean absolute percent change between subsequent years of 11 0 although we expected error to be highest in the drought year of 2012 irrigation volume was overestimated the most in 2000 26 and 2016 31 possibly because of overestimation in irrigated area these two years also had the highest mean percent irrigated area area pct for sections that actually had an observed irrigation of 0 ac ft overestimation in sections with zero observed irrigation accounted for on average 63 of the total overestimation volume across years no one factor explained the differences in trends between the observed and predicted total irrigation but predicted irrigation most closely tracked the trend of the annual mean of the top predictor netirr grow 3 3 effect of data source on lema policy considerations we tested whether the predicted irrigation maps would be effective in an application that investigates the average effects of water policy on groundwater extraction using an analysis akin to that in drysdale and hendricks 2018 we found that for the observed data being within the lema was associated with an approximate 21 746 ac ft reduction in water volume extraction table 3 using irrigation from out of bag estimates and temporal and spatial cross validation also showed the lema being associated with reductions in water extraction albeit with lower magnitudes of 9 774 8 697 and 9 714 ac ft respectively in order to evaluate whether the differences in the lema coefficients were significant between models using observed and predicted irrigation we conducted a bootstrapping procedure to obtain their distributions we iteratively sampled the sections in our data with replacement 1000 times re estimating our models for each sample set and storing the coefficient values to generate a distribution for the lema indicator coefficient the bootstrapped difference in the lema coefficients between using the observed irrigation and different sets of the predicted irrigations i e out of bag temporal cross validation and spatial cross validation were evaluated with a one sample t test with the null hypothesis that the difference was 0 table 4 shows that the lema coefficients were very similar when comparing different sets of independent variables i e weather controls potential evapotranspiration or only fixed effects for the same source for the response variable however the lema coefficient values had small but significant differences of 7 494 to 8 468 ac ft depending on whether observed irrigation values or one of the sets of predicted irrigation estimates were used for the dependent variable table 4 when comparing across just the fixed effects model the relative effect of the lema was 46 41 and 46 for the out of bag temporal cross validation and spatial cross validation irrigation sources respectively in comparison to the effect of the lema when using the observed irrigation values as shown in figs 2 and 5 low observed irrigation values tend to be overestimated and high observed irrigation values tend to be underestimated for each model whether evaluated by out of bag estimates spatial cross validation or temporal cross validation because of these biases caused by random forest modeling we decided to also test the effect that the lema could have had on predicted irrigation a bias or error in the predicted irrigation that was correlated with our policy factor of interest the lema could undermine our ability to use the predicted irrigation maps for policy analysis in this case if the lema was effective in decreasing irrigation then it may have lower irrigation values than outside the lema on average and if those lower observed irrigation values in the lema were then overestimated by the random forest model it could lead to a lower apparent magnitude of difference in irrigation between inside and outside the lema i e a smaller lema coefficient compared to using the observed irrigation to test this potential effect of differences in irrigation prediction error or residual i e observed predicted between inside and outside of the lema we performed another regression with the prediction error as the response for each of the predicted irrigation sources i e out of bag temporal cv and spatial cv in each case the irrigation model tended to have a significantly higher overestimate of irrigation inside the lema than outside the lema table 5 this discrepancy in error was mostly composed of lower values 200 ac ft in the lema that were overestimated but also a greater abundance of high irrigation sections 400 ac ft outside the lema that were being highly underestimated 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of high resolution irrigation models the increasing availability of landsat based eta has enabled examination of field scale patterns in crop water consumptive use in agriculture regions such as the central valley of california schauer and senay 2019 the upper rio grande basin senay et al 2019 and colorado river basin senay et al 2016 however in regions such as the ogallala aquifer that primarily rely on groundwater pumping and also have some precipitation input high resolution maps of groundwater withdrawal are useful for water planning monitoring policy compliance and understanding the influence of policy on water use in this study we leveraged high resolution eta from ssebop and landsat along with data related to other water balance components for field scale mapping of irrigation quantity from groundwater withdrawal we compared modeling at different spatial scales as well as spatial and temporal model transferability for potential application of these models in places and time periods where field level irrigation data are unavailable comparing modeling at a section level with the kansas study area to field level modeling in colorado was complicated by several confounding factors besides scale such as differences in their distributions e g zero inflated differences in which crops were dominant corn in colorado and wheat in kansas and other regional differences such as climate under ideal circumstances differences in scale would be compared in the same region but in colorado the irrigation status of every field was not known see section 2 2 1 which could introduce substantial error when aggregating to the section level or a raster grid comparing the two scales in different study areas illustrated that knowledge of irrigated area was of primary importance in determining the accuracy of models of irrigation quantity whether as depth or volume at either scale because even in a region with some of most extensive irrigated cropland in the united states much of the land area is still non irrigated because of this field scale models of irrigation depth with exact irrigated field boundaries in colorado had higher accuracy rmse 30 than similar models in kansas for which irrigated area was predicted rmse 54 even when sections with zero irrigation were disregarded 4 2 consideration of predictors majumdar et al 2020 similarly found density of agriculture derived from 2015 cdl to be the most important predictor in modeling irrigation depth in kansas at a scale of 5 km even though the model was applied across multiple years and also included other environmental variables such as modis based eta and prism climate data this is expected given the high degree of zero inflation for example 87 of sections in kansas between 2011 and 2016 the years in one test set used by majumdar et al 2020 have 0 ac ft of irrigation and most are not cultivated at all even at the scale of individual sections we found simply using the annual percent area of major cdl classes as predictors in random forest of irrigation depth for all of kansas between 2011 and 2016 yielded an rmse of 45 79 mm aggregating well level reference data to a coarser resolution raster grid also reduces the variance that needs to be explained by a model often improving accuracy statistics however aggregation into a grid assumes irrigation is evenly distributed within the area of each grid cell even though grid cells likely do not align with fields or land ownerships which can introduce error in the gridded reference data used for validation these factors of scale and incorporating eastern kansas which has less agriculture may in part explain the comparatively high accuracy in tests by majumdar et al 2020 which contrasts with the higher resolution and focus on the densely cultivated region of western kansas used in this study on the other hand ji et al 2021 found a stronger relationship between irrigation and eta in the more arid western kansas region where generalized efficiency of water use eta precipitation irrigation change in soil moisture is very high the central dilemma with field level modeling of irrigation is that field boundaries are rarely known in the past or over broad regions even in the case where irrigation volumes are known the common land unit dataset produced by the u s department of agriculture delineated field boundaries from aerial imagery but it was removed from public distribution in 2008 in comparison maps of plss sections are readily available and the kansas wimas database of annual well abstractions can be aggregated at this level to provide an extensive training and testing dataset for future model development which could potentially be applied in similar regions back to the start of the landsat archive at this scale high resolution maps of irrigated area such as those from deines et al 2019 became essential and were by far the most important variables in predicting irrigation quantity given their importance efforts to map field scale irrigation may be best spent refining and extending high resolution irrigated area maps recent development of landsat based eta maps such as those from ssebop senay et al 2013 and the openet project https openetdata org could aid greatly in this effort we sought to include datasets closely related to the components of a simple water balance model when constructing our predictor variables even though they are still under development landsat based maps of growing season eta eta grow and derived net irrigation accounting for precipitation and runoff netirr grow were the most important predictors at the section level although unexpectedly available water storage was more important at the field scale landsat based eta with ssebop shows strong agreement with estimates from eddy covariance flux towers ji et al 2021 senay et al 2020 and well represents relative landscape patterns of eta but future efforts may benefit from local calibration to remove bias when integrating with other datasets such as precipitation and runoff estimation of local runoff rather than watershed level runoff could also improve models of irrigation though we believe runoff to be a comparatively minor factor as discussed in the methods section 2 3 3 the neighborhood normalized landsat based variables e g ngcvi which have proven effective in mapping irrigated area deines et al 2019 may have had lower importance in our models simply because the spatial patterns in vegetation greenness they represent were already well captured by the irrigated area maps based upon these variables as well as the landsat based eta variables in the course of compiling datasets we initially attempted to include a much larger suite of climate data from gridmet such as mean vapor pressure deficit and soil data from ssurgo such as drainage class but even with 400 variables the models had negligible improvements of at most 2 7 mm rmse and 0 8 ac ft rmse in colorado and kansas respectively we also initially included additional crop area variables derived from cdl such as the area of major crops like corn but these provided little additional explanatory power i e 1 reduction in rmse and would limit application of models to years with cdl availability which is 2006 at the earliest in kansas these comparisons show that predictor variables less directly related to field scale hydrology increase model complexity for little benefit and may even reduce model transferability advances in mapping water balance components such as further downscaling precipitation and soil moisture disaggregating runoff to fields or improving the accuracy of eta may be the best avenues for improvements in mapping field scale irrigation quantity 4 3 spatial and temporal transferability of models through our analysis we discovered challenges to developing models of irrigation quantity that could be applied reliably in times and regions outside the spatiotemporal extent of the training data for example when evaluating temporal transfer for estimating total irrigation in western kansas we found the average error slightly exceeded the average annual change meaning evaluation of annual changes over a region could be attributed to model error majumdar et al 2020 also found decreases in accuracy when applying irrigation models to other time periods although they chose to test on select groups of years rather than performing a full temporal cross validation majumdar et al 2020 also found only modest decreases in accuracy when testing a model on a withheld sliver through the central portion of their study area to reflect the intended application of our model to similar regions that are completely outside the training area we tested on withheld halves of the study area we found more substantial increases in model error through this approach e g increase in rmse of 45 in kansas with spatial cross validation which could largely be attributed to differences in the distribution of irrigation across regions although we did not evaluate irrigation totals in the field scale models the model error was lower in both spatial and temporal transfer rmse 35 than at the section scale but application of these models would require field boundaries or assuming that field boundaries remain consistent in years without data problems with irrigation reference data itself may also exist given that 0 14 of the western kansas sections had reported water use greater than 3 ac ft per ac much greater than the regulated maximums but still comprised 4 6 of the total irrigation volume in the study area across all years considering the degree of these problems it would be best to formally account for uncertainty either through monte carlo methods coulston et al 2016 or using a model based inference framework with parametric models mcroberts 2011 when applying remote sensing based models of irrigation to evaluate irrigation trends particularly for times and areas outside the training data 4 4 implications of irrigation maps and error a recent review by foster et al 2020 cautions against the use of remote sensing based irrigation mapping without accounting for error and demonstrates how inaccurate maps could have negative consequences for water management and policy in our policy analysis example the true effect of the lema was underestimated by 7 5 8 5 ac ft which could lead policy analysts to erroneously believe that the lema was not as effective and that water use limits need to be further decreased to account for overuse however depending upon the application that level of error in estimating the effect of the lema may not make a meaningful difference for decision making foster et al 2020 notes that even unbiased errors in irrigation estimates can result in overly strict water use regulations that lead to substantial economic losses for farmers because of the asymptotic relationship between irrigation and crop yield we also found that differences in the error of predicted irrigation between inside and outside the lema table 5 was at least one major factor driving down the apparent effect size of the lema thus it is important that analysts also are aware of the potential for spatial or temporal variations in error for predicted irrigation not just overall error because of its potential influence on subsequent analysis machine learning models like random forest commonly overestimate low values and underestimate high values driving estimates more towards the mean observed value developing models that have lower bias in predictions at the ends of the distribution is one potential avenue to making maps of irrigation that would be more useful in policy applications given the relatively high levels of overall error in predicted irrigation from this study and others foster et al 2020 majumdar et al 2020 clear communication between policy and remote sensing analysts on the acceptable and expected levels of uncertainty and bias would be beneficial when developing and using irrigation maps for policy applications despite the aforementioned challenges improved models and the resulting maps of irrigation would be beneficial for a host of applications water use monitoring data is lacking in most regions and although additional in situ data will still be a requirement for model development remote sensing holds the potential to fill data gaps by estimating irrigation in very similar regions such as adjacent water districts or in other time periods models could be extended across the landsat archive 1984 present to analyze spatiotemporal trends of irrigation in regions with similar crops and climate regimes as long as care is taken to avoid extrapolating beyond the range of the training data more accurate annual maps could be used to monitor compliance and serve as a check in areas that rely on self reporting foster et al 2020 they could also serve to identify illegally drilled wells which may be prevalent in low income countries with many small scale farmers al naber and molle 2017 perhaps the most important application of irrigation maps would be for evaluating the effectiveness of water management policies to ensure the long term sustainability of groundwater resources in the many regions that lack in situ monitoring 5 conclusion the recent development of high resolution remote sensing of eta and irrigated area have enabled the potential to map field scale irrigation quantity to aid water use monitoring and evaluate the effects of water use policy in regions and times for which field scale data are currently unavailable in this research we combined remotely sensed data and other environmental information with well level data in two regions for testing empirical modeling of irrigation at different scales regions and time periods we found that models at the field scale had slightly higher accuracy than those at the section scale and that accuracy declined with spatial and temporal transfer for models at both scales knowledge of irrigated area whether through exact field boundaries or remote sensing based maps was of primary importance in predicting irrigation volume and improved the importance of hydrologic variables in our random forest models given the level of model error as well as potential errors in the reference field data caution is warranted when applying such models for evaluating irrigation trends future efforts may look to improve model accuracy through improvements in mapping irrigated area and possible local calibration of remotely sensed evapotranspiration remote sensing of irrigation has the potential to serve several beneficial applications such as checking compliance with water regulations understanding the average effects of water policy and estimating aquifer draw down however given the currently high error of remotely sensed irrigation maps and the propensity of people to regard maps as truth careful communication of uncertainty by the scientific community would be necessary to avoid leading map users and

9371,for agricultural areas facing water scarcity sustainable water use policy relies on irrigation information that is timely and at a high resolution but existing publicly available water use data are often insufficient for monitoring compliance or understanding the influence of policy on individual farmer decisions this study attempts to fill this data gap by using remote sensing to map annual irrigation quantity at the field scale within the central ogallala aquifer region of the united states we compiled in situ annual irrigation volume data at the field scale in the republican river basin of colorado for 2015 2018 and at the public land survey system plss section scale in western kansas for 2000 2016 which served as reference data in random forest models that relied on landsat based actual evapotranspiration from the operational simplified surface energy balance model ssebop along with maps of irrigated area landsat spectral indices climate soils and derived hydrologic variables the models explained 87 of the variability in irrigation volume in colorado and 75 in kansas but accuracy declined when transferring the models in spatial cross validation colorado r2 0 81 kansas r2 0 51 and temporal cross validation colorado r2 0 82 kansas r2 0 68 predicted annual totals of irrigation volume in western kansas had a mean absolute error of 11 9 which was slightly higher than the average annual change of 11 use of predicted irrigation maps also lead to an underestimated effect size for a water use restriction policy in kansas these results indicate that field and section scale irrigation can be mapped with reasonable accuracy within a region and time period that has adequate sample data but that methods may need to be improved for applying the models more

groundwater withdrawals is needed for informing water policy and management decisions every five years the u s geological survey usgs provides a report on national water use with county level summaries dieter et al 2018 which is compiled from data collected across a multitude of entities using a variety of methods bradley 2017 however because decisions on groundwater use are made at the individual field scale and policies are implemented within water districts that may not correspond to counties irrigation monitoring is needed not just at national state or county levels but at the field level as well besides water management policies several other factors drive individual irrigation decisions made at the field level such as crop type soil characteristics climate and the type of irrigation system consistent and widely available data on field level irrigation would be beneficial to understand how these factors interact to influence the decisions of individual farmers several studies have examined the effects of policies prices and a handful of other determinants on groundwater extraction levels pfeiffer and lin 2014 zhu et al 2007 but these studies have focused on areas where high resolution irrigation information is available however there are other areas that use considerable groundwater for which high resolution data are not available for example nebraska has a collection of local regulations across the state that mandate reporting and limit extraction through allotment systems drilling moratoria and other means ifft et al 2018 these regulations are often credited with improvements in aquifer levels andales et al 2020 but such monitoring and regulation is by far the exception having access to a broader dataset of field scale irrigation both spatially and temporally would greatly increase the potential scope of the aforementioned behavioral studies additionally broadly available field scale irrigation data could ensure water use compliance which is often self reported recent advances in remote sensing have enabled spatially explicit estimation of water abstraction for irrigation at global to field scales using a variety of approaches foster et al 2020 foster et al 2020 categorized these approaches into those primarily based on satellite estimation of soil moisture estimation of crop coefficients and use of thermal infrared imaging for estimating evapotranspiration studies that primarily rely on remotely sensed soil moisture brocca et al 2018 jalilvand et al 2019 zaussinger et al 2019 have been limited to mapping irrigation at gridded resolutions of 25 km or greater rather than field scales due to the coarse resolution of the synthetic aperture radar systems used with the highest resolution soil moisture products now being 1 3 km from the fusion of soil moisture active passive and sentinel 1 das et al 2019 crop coefficient based methods infer vegetation condition over the growing season from remotely sensed vegetation indices from which crop water requirements are estimated however previous studies have shown that actual water use from in situ irrigation data is often not perfectly aligned with estimated crop water requirements foster et al 2019 which could be due to imperfect information on conditions regional water management policies irrigation costs or other factors a third class of approaches estimates irrigation by incorporating remote sensing based actual evapotranspiration eta into soil water balance models or predictive models recent advances in remote sensing of eta have made this approach appealing because it can now be applied at field scales and deriving estimates of irrigation from eta depends less upon assumptions about water application efficiency although eta may be estimated from remote sensing through a variety of techniques zhang et al 2016 many models use a surface energy balance approach that utilizes land surface temperature obtained from remote sensing of thermal radiation allen et al 2007 bastiaanssen et al 1998 senay et al 2013 these methods have recently been extended from coarse resolution sensors such as the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis 500 m to landsat 30 m for relatively high resolution mapping of eta maps of landsat based eta have been used to characterize trends in crop consumptive water use at regional scales senay et al 2019 and aid in understanding the influence of water policy on consumptive water use senay et al 2017 some studies have further partitioned eta into blue water originating from ground and surface water sources and green water originating from precipitation using a combination of remotely sensed et and land surface models romaguera et al 2012 velpuri and senay 2017 foster et al 2020 identified 20 studies that primarily relied upon thermal remote sensing of et for estimating irrigation however only three of these studies folhes et al 2009 lópez valencia et al 2020 tazekrit et al 2018 were applied at the field scale and incorporated the use of in situ irrigation data and they were all limited to a single year and a single region little research has been done to test applicability of irrigation models to other time periods or regions that lack in situ irrigation data majumdar et al 2020 leveraged 17 years of in situ irrigation data in kansas to develop models of irrigation but did so at a 5 km resolution and primarily relied upon crop type maps that only extend back to 2006 in most areas of the united states to achieve sustainable water use goals this approach would need to be extended to a field scale across multiple years of data additionally errors would need to be well characterized to avoid inappropriate policy decisions that could negatively affect farmers or water conservation foster et al 2020 the objective of this study was to develop and test high resolution mapping of irrigation quantity to support sustainable water management goals we made use of advances in remote sensing of eta and irrigated area along with other environmental data to develop empirical models of the volume and depth of irrigation applied to fields across multiple years models were tested at two scales to reflect two different scenarios of data availability one in which individual field boundaries are available for known irrigated fields and one in which field boundaries and irrigation status are unknown but where public land survey system plss sections 640 acres can be used to aggregate several fields through development and testing of these models we sought to answer the following questions 1 how does irrigated map accuracy compare between using field scale models and plss section scale models 2 what is the relative importance of predictor variables related to hydrology and irrigated area in modeling irrigation quantity 3 what is the consistency of map accuracy when applying the models to new time periods and areas with similar conditions 4 what is the potential effect of map error on downstream applications such as regional estimates of irrigation and economic analyses of water use policy through answering these questions this research makes progress towards a model framework that could be applied for high resolution mapping of irrigation in areas and time periods that lack extensive in situ water abstraction data to inform water management and policy 2 methods 2 1 overview of methods this study draws on extensive databases of in situ irrigation data and advances in remote sensing of eta irrigated area and other environmental data to develop empirical models of irrigation across multiple scales and multiple years field scale mapping of irrigation was tested in the republican river basin of colorado where well level data were available on water abstraction from 2015 to 2018 mapping of irrigation was also tested in western kansas where water abstraction data were available at the scale of public land survey system plss sections 640 acres from 2000 to 2016 we developed and tested a series of random forest models of irrigation from this reference data utilizing predictor variables related to soil water balance components including landsat based eta obtained from the operational simplified surface energy balance ssebop model senay et al 2013 precipitation and runoff along with soil water storage capacity landsat based vegetation indices related to irrigated area and previously developed maps of irrigated area deines et al 2019 given the previous challenges with high uncertainty from remotely sensed irrigation we tested the transferability of models across years and sub regions within the study areas we also compared total observed and predicted irrigation levels within the kansas study area for 2000 2016 and we investigated how error in predicted irrigation could lead to different conclusions for an economic policy analysis 2 2 study area modeling and mapping of field level irrigation was conducted for the republican river basin of eastern colorado 22 753 km2 and western kansas 85 444 km2 fig 1 this study area was chosen because it overlies the ogallala aquifer qi 2010 where groundwater depletion is an important issue of concern and because this area contains records of annual well level groundwater pumping that could be joined to individual fields in colorado or to plss sections in kansas irrigation modeling in the colorado study area reflects an application scenario in which field boundaries are known and irrigation is known to have occurred and models of the kansas study area reflect a scenario in which neither field boundaries nor irrigated area are known according to the 2016 cropland data layer cdl usda nass 2019 which maps crop type of both irrigated and non irrigated cultivation there were 9253 km2 and 40 515 km2 of various crops and hay within the colorado and kansas study areas respectively based on the 2016 cdl corn and winter wheat including irrigated and non irrigated were the dominant crops in both the colorado 48 winter wheat and 35 corn and kansas 46 winter wheat and 27 corn study areas these cropland areas and proportions of each crop were different for the data used in modeling after limiting to fields and sections with irrigation data and other filtering described below in section 2 2 corn is typically sown around late april and harvested around october winter wheat is the earliest sown crop that is planted in the fall of the previous year and harvested in the summer while sorghum is the latest common crop with many fields being harvested in november nass 2010 the colorado study area and western kansas have cold semi arid climates koppen classification bsk with warm dry summers and cold winters and the climate becomes humid and subtropical koppen classification cfa with hot humid summers and cold winters when moving farther east into kansas kottek et al 2006 precipitation follows an increasing gradient from west to east with the colorado portion receiving approximately 400 mm per year and the eastern edge of the study area near wichita kansas receiving approximately 900 mm per year daly et al 2008 thirty year normals 1981 2010 of mean minimum and maximum temperature and vapor pressure deficit similarly increase from northwest to southeast mean annual temperature is approximately 10 c in the northwest republican river basin of colorado and approximately 14 c near wichita kansas daly et al 2008 2 3 data 2 3 1 annual field and section level irrigation for the republican river basin of colorado annual irrigation of each field was derived from attributing well pumping data in 2015 2018 to field boundaries cdss 2019 supplied by the colorado division of water resources cdwr annual pumping volume of each well was measured and then reported to the water district by the landowner the cdwr field boundaries were delineated from aerial imagery and landsat maximum normalized difference vegetation index ndvi in each year this field boundary dataset also contains the list of wells serving each field fields ranged in size including fields that were small corners of a parcel around a center pivot 7 ac portions of a center pivot field standard center pivot fields 125 ac and occasionally larger fields we joined the annual well data to the field boundaries and summed irrigation from multiple wells serving a single field water from wells serving multiple fields were divided based on field area for the 53 2 of wells that served multiple fields a vast majority consisted of the water feeding a single circular central pivot field with the remainder going to adjacent small corner fields splitting total irrigation evenly across multiple fields based on field area therefore likely has little effect on the outcome we removed the 0 77 of fields with unreasonably high irrigation levels greater than 3 ac ft per ac filtering the dataset left an average of 1863 km2 of cropland in each year to be used in analysis which was predominately corn mean of 77 corn across years note that this is quite different from the proportion of crops in the region 48 winter wheat and 35 corn from 2016 cdl and field boundaries with well data appeared to exclude some fields likely because they were unirrigated for example national agricultural statistics service nass census data for phillips and yuma counties in colorado nass 2019 which are completely within the study area show that only 8 of the harvested area of winter wheat was irrigated in 2017 although we were primarily interested in volume of water extracted much of the variation in pumping volume was due to variability in field size pearson s r 0 85 so pumping volume was divided by field area to obtain the irrigation quantity as depth in millimeters mm modeling irrigation as depth and converting back to volume yielded slightly better performance than modeling volume directly and better illustrates how much variance is truly explained by the predictive modeling as opposed to simply knowing field size irrigation quantity had a normal distribution with a slight right tail fig 1 and a mean of 328 mm in 2016 the distribution was similar in other years and the overall mean was 336 mm for the kansas study area 2000 2016 annual irrigation for each plss section was derived from well abstraction data from the kansas water information management and analysis system wimas which is managed jointly by the kansas department of agriculture kansas division of water resources and kansas geological survey 2019 landowners are required to self report water use for each well on an annual basis as of 2011 landowners using groundwater must have a flowmeter state of kansas 2011 but prior to this regulation water use may have been estimated by other means such as by multiplying pumping rate and operation time for constant rate pumps we joined this well level water withdrawal data to the kansas plss section map and subset by lands overlapping the ogallala aquifer land ownership and management is divided by these plss sections and wells are typically located within the center of fields at center pivot locations because of this we assumed all water from a well was applied to the same section that it was located in although some water may have been distributed to other sections the standard plss section is 640 acres but section size varied between 13 and 909 acres because of sections on the edge of the state and principal meridians because sections were mostly the same size and entire sections were rarely irrigated irrigation volume was less correlated with section area pearson s r 0 07 but more closely related to estimates of irrigated area which we incorporated into other predictor variables as described in section 2 2 4 in 2016 depth of irrigation mm was zero inflated and had a right skew fig 1 with a mean of 39 mm the distribution was similar in other years and the dataset had an overall mean of 43 mm because the irrigated area within each section was unknown and unlikely to be evenly distributed across the entire section area we modeled volume of irrigation instead of depth for this kansas dataset the overall mean irrigation volume for all years was 90 7 ac ft we removed 0 14 of the observations with unreasonably high irrigation levels 3 ac ft per ac because the maximum allowable water use in counties of western kansas is at most 2 ac ft per ac barfield 2017 filtering the dataset left an average area of 83 211 km2 in each year included in the analysis in years with cdl data 2006 2016 37 118 km2 of this area was cropland on average which was composed of 50 winter wheat 24 corn 16 sorghum 4 soy 3 alfalfa and 3 other crops including double cropping 2 3 2 actual evapotranspiration field scale estimates of monthly actual and growing season evapotranspiration were obtained through application of the ssebop model to landsat imagery and gridmet and daymet climate data in google earth engine senay et al 2017 2016 2013 ssebop estimates the fraction of potential evapotranspiration etf which is multiplied by a scaled k alfalfa reference potential evapotranspiration eto obtained from the gridded surface meteorological dataset gridmet abatzoglou 2013 in order to calculate actual evapotranspiration eta eq 1 etf is obtained through a simplified surface energy balance approach by scaling the difference between the land surface temperature ts and a cold wet limit tc by the surface psychrometric constant of a dry bare surface γ s 1 eta 1 γ s t s t c k eto land surface temperature is calculated from the corrected thermal radiance obtained from landsat and emissivity based on the ndvi threshold method sobrino et al 2004 the daily cold wet limit of surface temperature and the surface psychrometric constant are obtained from daily maximum and minimum temperatures and average clear sky net radiation calculated from daymet thornton et al 2016 desert research institute has created a preliminary implementation of ssebop for landsat in google earth engine gorelick et al 2017 as part of the openet project morton et al 2021 which is the implementation we have used in this study openet core version 0 0 10 and ssebop version 0 0 13 ji et al 2021 found 2015 monthly ssebop estimates of eta had high accuracy when compared against two ameriflux eddy covariance towers in kansas us kfs r2 0 93 bias 5 5 mm rmse 18 9 mm us kls r2 0 87 bias 5 7 mm rmse 20 3 mm landsat tier 1 surface reflectance images from april to october for 2011 2018 were masked for clouds cloud shadow and snow using the provided pixel qa band we applied the ssebop algorithm to these images to estimate daily eta at 30 m and aggregated these estimates to monthly intervals by linearly interpolating daily values between available images field or section level eta was then calculated as the mean of the monthly pixel values within each field or section boundary to reduce the influence of missing data and minor variations within a field that may not be due to actual differences in irrigation the monthly eta values were then summed for the growing season april october as well 2 3 3 other predictors other predictor variables included those related to water balance components and irrigated area monthly precipitation from gridmet 2 5 4 km was incorporated in the modeling along with other hydrologic variables derived from combinations of the precipitation and runoff with eta to account for runoff we obtained usgs estimates of hydrologic unit code huc level 8 watershed runoff which are calculated through area weighted averages of daily streamgage data within basins of the huc8 watersheds brakebill et al 2011 the huc8 watershed intersecting both study areas ranged from 1059 to 9990 km2 mean 3706 km2 mean gridmet precipitation prmean was calculated over each huc8 watershed and an effective precipitation coefficient prcoef for each watershed was calculated as the fraction of watershed precipitation after subtracting runoff eq 2 2 prcoef prmean runoff prmean this effective precipitation coefficient was then used to scale the pixel level 4 km precipitation over each watershed which produces pixel level estimates of effective precipitation pref available for crop water use the mean effective precipitation was calculated for each field in colorado and each section in kansas runoff was generally low across watersheds and years and the precipitation coefficients were correspondingly quite high the growing season april october prcoef averaged across years and watersheds for both study areas ranged from 0 69 to 1 00 and had a mean of 0 97 because of this the effective growing precipitation was lower than precipitation by only 2 6 mm on average for the fields in colorado and by 10 3 mm on average for the sections in kansas irrigation irr could be calculated directly with a simple water balance model if all other factors were known eq 3 including the input of precipitation pr and outputs of actual evapotranspiration eta runoff ro and changes in soil water storage δs 3 irr eta ro s pr because the total annual change in surface soil water storage is relatively small in comparison to the factors that we can estimate such as eta pr ro simply subtracting the effective precipitation from eta to obtain net irrigation netirr table 1 should provide a strong predictor of water abstraction for irrigation in an empirical model the mean net irrigation netirr was calculated on a monthly and seasonal basis for each colorado field and kansas section ideally the annual change in soil water storage would also be included in the model and the derivation of netirr but current soil moisture datasets have at best a 1 km resolution das et al 2019 which is likely insufficient to capture field level spatial variability in soil moisture changes caused by irrigation practices in lieu of having δs we included the mean available water storage in the upper 25 50 100 and 150 cm table 1 as additional predictors which were calculated for each field and section from the ssurgo database soil survey staff 2019 of information obtained from soil surveys deines et al 2019 found a suite of landsat spectral indices to be important predictors in detecting irrigation across the high plains aquifer which contains the ogallala aquifer from 1984 to 2017 these spectral metrics may also capture variance in irrigation quantity not explained by the above water balance components we incorporated the spectral indices which had the highest ranked importance by gini score in their models including the annual maximums of the green chlorophyll vegetation index gcvi normalized difference moisture index ndmi ndvi and the water adjusted green index wgi annual maximum gcvi x annual maximum ndmi shown in table 1 these spectral indices were also normalized by dividing by the 15th percentile value of the index within a 50 km radius to create neighborhood greenness indices ngcvi nndmi nndvi nwgi as in deines et al 2019 prior to calculating the neighborhood values the indices are first masked to exclude urban areas and water using the 2016 national land cover database yang et al 2018 because an abundance of these land cover types depresses the apparent regional greenness holes in the neighborhood image were then filled with the focal median within a 10 km radius we also limited the neighborhood values to be at most the median of the region wide spectral index value within each study area these neighborhood normalized greenness indices provide more consistent metrics for applying the model across a wide range of conditions as they account for regional differences in overall greenness to highlight local variations 2 3 4 irrigated area in colorado individual fields are delineated so the potential irrigated area is known but within the plss sections of the kansas study area the area of active cultivation and irrigation varied greatly with many sections containing no irrigated cropland at all fig 1 to reduce the influence of non irrigated areas on estimates of average et and landsat spectral indices we incorporated the use of irrigated area maps created for the entire high plains aquifer region at a 30 m resolution from 1985 to 2019 by deines et al 2019 which were generated from predictive modeling with landsat neighborhood normalized spectral indices like those described in section 2 2 3 use of these maps has the advantage of focusing summaries of our predictor variables to estimated irrigated areas rather than entire crop areas many of which may not be irrigated also as shown for the colorado study area most of the variance in irrigation volume can be explained by area alone the estimated irrigated area and percent irrigated area within each section in kansas were included as stand alone predictor variables and the mean of the landsat based spectral indices and evapotranspiration were obtained only over the irrigated area other predictor variables had much lower resolutions e g precipitation at 4 km such that summaries using only the irrigated area would be no different than using the entire section for the hydrology based predictor variables et precipitation and et minus precipitation we multiplied the previously calculated depth values by the estimated irrigated area within each section for the appropriate year to convert these variables to volume in acre feet table 1 sections with no irrigated area were given a predicted irrigation volume of 0 ac ft 2 4 irrigation modeling the irrigated area actual evapotranspiration effective precipitation derived net irrigation landsat based spectral indices and soil available water storage variables served as predictors table 1 of field level irrigation depth for the colorado study area and section level irrigation volume in the kansas study area using random forest models breiman 2001 the models used common random forest parameters of 500 trees and splitting at each node by considering the square root of the total number of predictors evaluation of each model was initially done using out of bag predictions which provide unbiased estimates of generalization error breiman 2001 and have been shown to be as accurate as using a test set of the same size as the training set breiman 2001 1996 models were evaluated by the coefficient of determination r2 root mean squared error rmse and mean difference of predictions from the observations bias differences in model accuracy between the two study areas were primarily compared with rmse as a percentage of the mean observed value rmse because of differences in scale when comparing irrigation volume i e fields vs sections and differences in the distributions of irrigation depth fig 1 the primary goal of our study was to develop and test models for high prediction accuracy rather than the development of parsimonious interpretable models however we compared the relative importance of predictor variables to aid future research and also verified that the model was capturing the relationships between key predictor variables and the response variables that would be expected from simple water balance models hydrologic theory and known irrigation practices predictor variables of the full models for each study area were compared by their importance values which were calculated as the mean across trees of the total decrease in mean squared error caused by the variable when it was used for splitting nodes of each tree these importance values were normalized so that they sum to one the models included some highly correlated predictor variables such as adjacent months for hydrologic variables the different landsat spectral indices and the available water storage variables which were not filtered because multicollinearity does not reduce random forest performance however multicollinearity can confound the ability to interpret variable importance values because correlated predictors will often have similar but diluted importance scores while other predictors that may have contributed more novel information for improving model performance could be pushed down in rank kuhn and johnson 2013 a correlation heatmap is shown for both study areas to aid in interpreting the variable importance scores one dimensional accumulated local effects ale plots apley and zhu 2020 were created to capture the main effect of the top ranked predictor variable from each of the six types of predictors eta pref netirr aws area and spectral indices table 1 these plots illustrate the difference of the predicted response from the overall mean prediction across a range of values for a given predictor variable ale plots have the advantages of isolating the main effect for the feature of interest and preventing unreasonable combinations for correlated predictor variables molnar 2019 which are problems common to the more widely used m plots and partial dependence plots respectively because we are primarily interested in the application of these models for other regions and years with no available pumping data we also tested transferability of the models by training on one region and testing on another region leave one side out validation as well as training on a subset of years and testing on the withheld year leave one year out validation these forms of validation serve to test for applicability of the models across space and time but within the same domain i e environment and conditions as the model training space because extrapolation often leads to poor results kuhn and johnson 2013 for the leave one side out validation the data were split spatially into halves for training and testing for example fields or sections with their centroid lying in the eastern half of the study area were used for training and the other half were used for testing and then the training and testing sides were flipped the same process was repeated with a north south split for spatial and temporal cross validation the sample size weighted mean of the accuracy statistics from each test set are given for the colorado models we also provide accuracy statistics once predicted irrigation depth is converted back into volume using field area because estimating volume was of primary interest for the kansas study area where a census of observed irrigation was available we performed an additional analysis comparing the total annual irrigation volume from wimas as well as the observed total irrigation of sections that were included in modeling after filtering for outliers and missing data against the corresponding total of predicted irrigation when that year was the test set of leave one year out validation this comparison illustrates how section level error translates to expected levels of error when aggregating over larger areas and applying the model in years lacking training data often models even with relatively high error can produce reasonable aggregated estimates so long as the model has relatively low bias 2 5 irrigation in local enhanced management areas one of our objectives was to develop an irrigation model that could be used for examining the influence of past water management policies on local and regional water use decisions for areas that lack comprehensive irrigation data because most policy analyses evaluate the average effect of a policy on relevant outcomes we are primarily interested in obtaining predictions of irrigation that are unbiased and errors that are not correlated with the primary factors of interest e g areas where the policy is applied or not applied to test this application we examined the influence of using predicted irrigation versus observed irrigation in an analysis of policy effects on water use decisions this analysis replicated a simplified version of the model presented in drysdale and hendricks 2018 using both our observed irrigation data and the predicted irrigation data at the scale of plss sections in kansas kansas previously implemented a system by which local authorities can self regulate groundwater extraction by establishing a local enhanced management area lema in 2013 a lema was established in the area of sheridan county in kansas which focused on reducing groundwater extractions the study by drysdale and hendricks 2018 compared water usage inside this lema to the immediate surrounding area they used a spatial discontinuity approach using water withdrawal data from a sample of wells from 2007 to 2016 within the lema boundary and then all wells no greater than 5 miles and no less than 2 miles from the lema boundary they ran a series of mixed effect regression models with logged dependent variables total irrigation irrigation intensity and irrigated acres and a set of weather controls as independent variables including temperature and precipitation as well as water rights level fixed effects and farmer year fixed effects a dummy independent variable was also included to indicate whether the well was within the lema or in the buffer zone outside of the lema their results showed that groundwater restrictions within the lema led to a reduction in groundwater use mostly through reductions in irrigation intensity our analysis is modeled after the drysdale and hendricks 2018 study we used a similar set of weather controls as independent variables including potential evapotranspiration et o in mm average temperature temp in c precipitation precip in mm and the square of precipitation precip 2 in mm2 during the growing season calculated from gridmet daily weather estimates abatzoglou 2013 we included precipitation as a quadratic term in the regression to control for non linear effects precipitation may have on irrigation because our observation unit was a section rather than a water right our fixed effects were at the section level along with year fixed effects there were many zeros in our dependent variable and so we excluded wells that reported no irrigation focusing instead on sections that were irrigated we used the level of irrigation volume rather than a log transformation as in drysdale and hendricks 2018 to aid in interpretation our empirical specification was the following v it α i γ t β i it δ x ε it where v it is the volume in acre feet of water pumped within some section i in year t we indicated whether a section was within the lema with the variable i it we had section fixed effects a i and year fixed effects γ t x is the set of weather controls with a set of corresponding coefficients δ the term ε it is an independent and identically distributed i i d random error we ran this regression on four sets of data covering the same extent as in drysdale and hendricks 2018 and years 2000 2016 the first dataset included the full set of observed section level irrigation values in and around the lema the second was the set of out of bag predicted irrigation values from the model of irrigation volume using all data in the kansas study area the third was the set of predictions from temporal cross validation where one year of data was withheld for validation while samples from the remaining years were used for model training the fourth was the set of predicted irrigation values from the spatial cross validation model where the model was trained on the sections in the southern half of kansas and then validated on the northern half of kansas which includes the lema study area we also ran four different versions of our model the first included only fixed effects the second included fixed effects and the total potential evapotranspiration et o during the growing season the third included the fixed effects plus the weather controls of mean temperature temp total precipitation precip and the square of total precipitation precip 2 during the growing season the final model included the fixed effects evapotranspiration and the weather controls all results feature standard errors that were clustered at the section level for each set of models we compared differences in the coefficients between using the observed irrigation data and using the three predicted irrigation datasets to see if different conclusions would be drawn depending on the data source we also evaluated whether presence of a section within the lema had a different average level of error in predicted irrigation volume than outside the lema which could be a major factor in influencing our interpretations from the above regression models 3 results 3 1 field level irrigation in colorado in colorado the random forest model explained about half of the variability in field level irrigation quantity r2 0 49 rmse 30 when modeled as depth fig 2a however the model explains 87 of the variability in irrigation volume which was calculated by multiplying by field size fig 2d as previously mentioned field area alone explains 72 of the variance pearson s r 0 85 in irrigation volume because of the array of field sizes in this study area overall bias was low 1 mm but the two dimensional density plots i e hexbin plots of observations and predictions show the model to underestimate high levels of irrigation with predictions rarely exceeding 500 mm while low levels of irrigation have a slight positive bias fig 2a this compression of predictions towards the mean observed value is common in models using an ensemble of decision trees like random forest for 2016 the spatial distribution of errors from the full model in colorado appeared to be random with no strong clustering in any one region and the histogram of residuals was approximately normal and centered on zero fig 3 model accuracy declined slightly when transferring the model to other time periods through leave one year out cross validation fig 2c rmse 35 and also for transfer to other areas with leave one side out cross validation fig 2b rmse 35 in comparison to the full model fig 2a rmse 30 when converting to volume the full spatial cross validation and temporal cross validation models had slightly greater differences in rmse but smaller difference in r2 and bias fig 2d f more notable is the increase in bias with spatial and temporal cross validation for the depth based results fig 2a c particularly for fields with low irrigation the decreases in accuracy between the full model and when performing spatial and temporal cross validation are likely due to spatial and temporal dependence in the dataset one source of spatial dependence mentioned previously is the predominantly east west precipitation gradient that exists in this region by training and testing on different halves of the dataset we can see that the model would likely have slightly decreased accuracy when transferring to other regions without available training data possibly even those with only slightly different conditions such as modestly higher or lower precipitation the same can be said for transferability to different years but this may be because with only four years in the dataset 2015 2018 the model has yet to be exposed to a wide range of different temporal conditions for training such as multiple wet or dry years the available water storage variables aws 025 100 were all ranked as the most important in the full model fig 4a each having an importance value of 0 04 0 05 these variables were also very highly correlated pearson s r 0 91 0 99 fig s1 and each had a monotonically decreasing but non linear effect on predicted irrigation fig s2 growing season and summer monthly net irrigation variables e g netirr grow netirr 07 09 were the next group of variables with the highest importance ranking importance 0 03 0 04 netirr grow had ale values that increased in an approximately linear fashion when above 100 mm fig s2 landsat spectral indices ranked fairly low in feature importance for this model even though they were important in models of irrigated area by deines et al 2019 the common variable importance method we employ here is known to be biased towards variables with higher cardinality strobl et al 2007 however all the predictor variables were continuous and the most important variables available water storage had the lowest number of unique values in the set of predictors variable rankings were also similar when using a permutation based variable importance method on the training data results not shown 3 2 section level irrigation in kansas the full section level model of irrigation volume in kansas explained a relatively large proportion of the variance r2 0 75 fig 5a but tended to overestimate in sections with low observed irrigation even in this region dominated by irrigated cultivation sections with low pumping volume were common 72 had 0 ac ft which led to a high rmse as a percentage of the mean observed value rmse 114 when disregarding sections with zero irrigation for calculating the accuracy statistics rmse dropped to 54 for this model even though rmse increased to 176 ac ft overall model accuracy improved only slightly to an rmse of 101 4 when only considering data from 2011 and later after the flowmeter installation requirements took effect the predicted irrigation volume was converted to depth in mm fig 5d f using the plss section areas for comparison with the results from the colorado study area but this conversion likely underestimates the amount of irrigation concentrated on the irrigated area because it effectively assumes that the entire section was irrigated the rmse and r2 for the volume estimates fig 5a c were nearly the same as depth based converted results fig 5d f because the section area explained little variation in irrigation volume results were nearly identical if modeling irrigation depth directly and when excluding sections with zero irrigation for 2016 the spatial distribution of errors in mm from the full model appeared to show some clustering with small regions of over and under estimation but as in colorado the residuals were centered on zero and approximately normal fig 3 the net irrigation and eta variables summed over the growing season netirr grow and eta grow and in the summer netirr 07 eta 07 eta 08 were the top five predictor variables fig 4b all five were highly multicollinear pearson s r 0 88 0 97 fig s3 in part because they were all transformed to volume using irrigated area the ale plots of the eta and netirr predictors show steep increases of predicted irrigation as their values increased in the middle ranges but with flat responses at the ends fig s4 the deines et al 2019 predicted irrigated area area alone explained 50 of the variance in irrigation volume pearson s r 0 71 and had a linear effect on predictions until approaching an asymptote after about 450 acres fig s4 although engineering the hydrologic predictors to be in volume units by incorporating irrigated area greatly improved their explanatory power the resulting multicollinearity does confound our ability to determine their relative importance to parse out the effect of irrigated area we evaluated variable importance for another model of kansas irrigation volume with hydrologic predictors used in their original depth form rather than converted to volume using irrigated area fig s5 in this model irrigated area and percent had the highest importance values 0 20 and 0 18 respectively followed by net irrigation and eta variables for the growing season 0 05 and 0 03 respectively and july 0 04 and 0 04 respectively because using the hydrologic variables as depth reduces some of their multicollinearity pearson s r 0 47 0 83 for the same five previously listed other variables that helped to improve model accuracy rose in rank such as ngcvi and the available water storage variables as in the colorado study area model accuracy declined when examining spatial and temporal transferability with leave one side out validation fig 5b and leave one year out validation fig 5c attempting to train and test the model on split halves caused many samples with high observed irrigation to be underestimated fig 5b which led to an overall negative bias this underestimation with spatial transfer is likely due to differences in the distribution of the response between the training and testing halves table 2 for example training on the north half which has a mean of 36 5 ac ft and 83 zeros leads to a bias of 44 2 ac ft when testing on the south half which had a much higher mean of 123 2 ac ft and only 66 zeros irrigation volume was much more consistent temporally with annual mean irrigation having a coefficient of variation cv of 13 as opposed to the 47 cv of spatial halves this greater temporal consistency led to lower error with temporal cross validation rmse 126 than spatial cross validation rmse 159 although the apparent error was still fairly high because of zero inflation depressing the mean of the observations the annual sample size weighted mean of annual irrigation including zeros was 91 ac ft while it was 327 ac ft when excluding zeros even though the overall bias for sections with zero irrigation was reasonably low 25 ac ft in temporal cross validation the accuracy appears to be better when not considering sections with zero irrigation rmse 58 because of zero inflation we examined the effect of model error when totaling irrigation over the entire western kansas study area fig 6 the wimas census of irrigation allowed us to make a direct comparison of the total predicted irrigation i e using predictions of each withheld year from temporal cross validation to the unfiltered total irrigation however because sections with outlier irrigation values i e 3 ac ft per ac and missing data were filtered out in model development the predicted total irrigation is best compared to the same set of observations used in modeling the mean annual observed irrigation was 2 92 million ac ft and the mean absolute error across years was 0 34 million ac ft the absolute error was 11 9 of the observations on average which slightly exceeded the mean absolute percent change between subsequent years of 11 0 although we expected error to be highest in the drought year of 2012 irrigation volume was overestimated the most in 2000 26 and 2016 31 possibly because of overestimation in irrigated area these two years also had the highest mean percent irrigated area area pct for sections that actually had an observed irrigation of 0 ac ft overestimation in sections with zero observed irrigation accounted for on average 63 of the total overestimation volume across years no one factor explained the differences in trends between the observed and predicted total irrigation but predicted irrigation most closely tracked the trend of the annual mean of the top predictor netirr grow 3 3 effect of data source on lema policy considerations we tested whether the predicted irrigation maps would be effective in an application that investigates the average effects of water policy on groundwater extraction using an analysis akin to that in drysdale and hendricks 2018 we found that for the observed data being within the lema was associated with an approximate 21 746 ac ft reduction in water volume extraction table 3 using irrigation from out of bag estimates and temporal and spatial cross validation also showed the lema being associated with reductions in water extraction albeit with lower magnitudes of 9 774 8 697 and 9 714 ac ft respectively in order to evaluate whether the differences in the lema coefficients were significant between models using observed and predicted irrigation we conducted a bootstrapping procedure to obtain their distributions we iteratively sampled the sections in our data with replacement 1000 times re estimating our models for each sample set and storing the coefficient values to generate a distribution for the lema indicator coefficient the bootstrapped difference in the lema coefficients between using the observed irrigation and different sets of the predicted irrigations i e out of bag temporal cross validation and spatial cross validation were evaluated with a one sample t test with the null hypothesis that the difference was 0 table 4 shows that the lema coefficients were very similar when comparing different sets of independent variables i e weather controls potential evapotranspiration or only fixed effects for the same source for the response variable however the lema coefficient values had small but significant differences of 7 494 to 8 468 ac ft depending on whether observed irrigation values or one of the sets of predicted irrigation estimates were used for the dependent variable table 4 when comparing across just the fixed effects model the relative effect of the lema was 46 41 and 46 for the out of bag temporal cross validation and spatial cross validation irrigation sources respectively in comparison to the effect of the lema when using the observed irrigation values as shown in figs 2 and 5 low observed irrigation values tend to be overestimated and high observed irrigation values tend to be underestimated for each model whether evaluated by out of bag estimates spatial cross validation or temporal cross validation because of these biases caused by random forest modeling we decided to also test the effect that the lema could have had on predicted irrigation a bias or error in the predicted irrigation that was correlated with our policy factor of interest the lema could undermine our ability to use the predicted irrigation maps for policy analysis in this case if the lema was effective in decreasing irrigation then it may have lower irrigation values than outside the lema on average and if those lower observed irrigation values in the lema were then overestimated by the random forest model it could lead to a lower apparent magnitude of difference in irrigation between inside and outside the lema i e a smaller lema coefficient compared to using the observed irrigation to test this potential effect of differences in irrigation prediction error or residual i e observed predicted between inside and outside of the lema we performed another regression with the prediction error as the response for each of the predicted irrigation sources i e out of bag temporal cv and spatial cv in each case the irrigation model tended to have a significantly higher overestimate of irrigation inside the lema than outside the lema table 5 this discrepancy in error was mostly composed of lower values 200 ac ft in the lema that were overestimated but also a greater abundance of high irrigation sections 400 ac ft outside the lema that were being highly underestimated 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of high resolution irrigation models the increasing availability of landsat based eta has enabled examination of field scale patterns in crop water consumptive use in agriculture regions such as the central valley of california schauer and senay 2019 the upper rio grande basin senay et al 2019 and colorado river basin senay et al 2016 however in regions such as the ogallala aquifer that primarily rely on groundwater pumping and also have some precipitation input high resolution maps of groundwater withdrawal are useful for water planning monitoring policy compliance and understanding the influence of policy on water use in this study we leveraged high resolution eta from ssebop and landsat along with data related to other water balance components for field scale mapping of irrigation quantity from groundwater withdrawal we compared modeling at different spatial scales as well as spatial and temporal model transferability for potential application of these models in places and time periods where field level irrigation data are unavailable comparing modeling at a section level with the kansas study area to field level modeling in colorado was complicated by several confounding factors besides scale such as differences in their distributions e g zero inflated differences in which crops were dominant corn in colorado and wheat in kansas and other regional differences such as climate under ideal circumstances differences in scale would be compared in the same region but in colorado the irrigation status of every field was not known see section 2 2 1 which could introduce substantial error when aggregating to the section level or a raster grid comparing the two scales in different study areas illustrated that knowledge of irrigated area was of primary importance in determining the accuracy of models of irrigation quantity whether as depth or volume at either scale because even in a region with some of most extensive irrigated cropland in the united states much of the land area is still non irrigated because of this field scale models of irrigation depth with exact irrigated field boundaries in colorado had higher accuracy rmse 30 than similar models in kansas for which irrigated area was predicted rmse 54 even when sections with zero irrigation were disregarded 4 2 consideration of predictors majumdar et al 2020 similarly found density of agriculture derived from 2015 cdl to be the most important predictor in modeling irrigation depth in kansas at a scale of 5 km even though the model was applied across multiple years and also included other environmental variables such as modis based eta and prism climate data this is expected given the high degree of zero inflation for example 87 of sections in kansas between 2011 and 2016 the years in one test set used by majumdar et al 2020 have 0 ac ft of irrigation and most are not cultivated at all even at the scale of individual sections we found simply using the annual percent area of major cdl classes as predictors in random forest of irrigation depth for all of kansas between 2011 and 2016 yielded an rmse of 45 79 mm aggregating well level reference data to a coarser resolution raster grid also reduces the variance that needs to be explained by a model often improving accuracy statistics however aggregation into a grid assumes irrigation is evenly distributed within the area of each grid cell even though grid cells likely do not align with fields or land ownerships which can introduce error in the gridded reference data used for validation these factors of scale and incorporating eastern kansas which has less agriculture may in part explain the comparatively high accuracy in tests by majumdar et al 2020 which contrasts with the higher resolution and focus on the densely cultivated region of western kansas used in this study on the other hand ji et al 2021 found a stronger relationship between irrigation and eta in the more arid western kansas region where generalized efficiency of water use eta precipitation irrigation change in soil moisture is very high the central dilemma with field level modeling of irrigation is that field boundaries are rarely known in the past or over broad regions even in the case where irrigation volumes are known the common land unit dataset produced by the u s department of agriculture delineated field boundaries from aerial imagery but it was removed from public distribution in 2008 in comparison maps of plss sections are readily available and the kansas wimas database of annual well abstractions can be aggregated at this level to provide an extensive training and testing dataset for future model development which could potentially be applied in similar regions back to the start of the landsat archive at this scale high resolution maps of irrigated area such as those from deines et al 2019 became essential and were by far the most important variables in predicting irrigation quantity given their importance efforts to map field scale irrigation may be best spent refining and extending high resolution irrigated area maps recent development of landsat based eta maps such as those from ssebop senay et al 2013 and the openet project https openetdata org could aid greatly in this effort we sought to include datasets closely related to the components of a simple water balance model when constructing our predictor variables even though they are still under development landsat based maps of growing season eta eta grow and derived net irrigation accounting for precipitation and runoff netirr grow were the most important predictors at the section level although unexpectedly available water storage was more important at the field scale landsat based eta with ssebop shows strong agreement with estimates from eddy covariance flux towers ji et al 2021 senay et al 2020 and well represents relative landscape patterns of eta but future efforts may benefit from local calibration to remove bias when integrating with other datasets such as precipitation and runoff estimation of local runoff rather than watershed level runoff could also improve models of irrigation though we believe runoff to be a comparatively minor factor as discussed in the methods section 2 3 3 the neighborhood normalized landsat based variables e g ngcvi which have proven effective in mapping irrigated area deines et al 2019 may have had lower importance in our models simply because the spatial patterns in vegetation greenness they represent were already well captured by the irrigated area maps based upon these variables as well as the landsat based eta variables in the course of compiling datasets we initially attempted to include a much larger suite of climate data from gridmet such as mean vapor pressure deficit and soil data from ssurgo such as drainage class but even with 400 variables the models had negligible improvements of at most 2 7 mm rmse and 0 8 ac ft rmse in colorado and kansas respectively we also initially included additional crop area variables derived from cdl such as the area of major crops like corn but these provided little additional explanatory power i e 1 reduction in rmse and would limit application of models to years with cdl availability which is 2006 at the earliest in kansas these comparisons show that predictor variables less directly related to field scale hydrology increase model complexity for little benefit and may even reduce model transferability advances in mapping water balance components such as further downscaling precipitation and soil moisture disaggregating runoff to fields or improving the accuracy of eta may be the best avenues for improvements in mapping field scale irrigation quantity 4 3 spatial and temporal transferability of models through our analysis we discovered challenges to developing models of irrigation quantity that could be applied reliably in times and regions outside the spatiotemporal extent of the training data for example when evaluating temporal transfer for estimating total irrigation in western kansas we found the average error slightly exceeded the average annual change meaning evaluation of annual changes over a region could be attributed to model error majumdar et al 2020 also found decreases in accuracy when applying irrigation models to other time periods although they chose to test on select groups of years rather than performing a full temporal cross validation majumdar et al 2020 also found only modest decreases in accuracy when testing a model on a withheld sliver through the central portion of their study area to reflect the intended application of our model to similar regions that are completely outside the training area we tested on withheld halves of the study area we found more substantial increases in model error through this approach e g increase in rmse of 45 in kansas with spatial cross validation which could largely be attributed to differences in the distribution of irrigation across regions although we did not evaluate irrigation totals in the field scale models the model error was lower in both spatial and temporal transfer rmse 35 than at the section scale but application of these models would require field boundaries or assuming that field boundaries remain consistent in years without data problems with irrigation reference data itself may also exist given that 0 14 of the western kansas sections had reported water use greater than 3 ac ft per ac much greater than the regulated maximums but still comprised 4 6 of the total irrigation volume in the study area across all years considering the degree of these problems it would be best to formally account for uncertainty either through monte carlo methods coulston et al 2016 or using a model based inference framework with parametric models mcroberts 2011 when applying remote sensing based models of irrigation to evaluate irrigation trends particularly for times and areas outside the training data 4 4 implications of irrigation maps and error a recent review by foster et al 2020 cautions against the use of remote sensing based irrigation mapping without accounting for error and demonstrates how inaccurate maps could have negative consequences for water management and policy in our policy analysis example the true effect of the lema was underestimated by 7 5 8 5 ac ft which could lead policy analysts to erroneously believe that the lema was not as effective and that water use limits need to be further decreased to account for overuse however depending upon the application that level of error in estimating the effect of the lema may not make a meaningful difference for decision making foster et al 2020 notes that even unbiased errors in irrigation estimates can result in overly strict water use regulations that lead to substantial economic losses for farmers because of the asymptotic relationship between irrigation and crop yield we also found that differences in the error of predicted irrigation between inside and outside the lema table 5 was at least one major factor driving down the apparent effect size of the lema thus it is important that analysts also are aware of the potential for spatial or temporal variations in error for predicted irrigation not just overall error because of its potential influence on subsequent analysis machine learning models like random forest commonly overestimate low values and underestimate high values driving estimates more towards the mean observed value developing models that have lower bias in predictions at the ends of the distribution is one potential avenue to making maps of irrigation that would be more useful in policy applications given the relatively high levels of overall error in predicted irrigation from this study and others foster et al 2020 majumdar et al 2020 clear communication between policy and remote sensing analysts on the acceptable and expected levels of uncertainty and bias would be beneficial when developing and using irrigation maps for policy applications despite the aforementioned challenges improved models and the resulting maps of irrigation would be beneficial for a host of applications water use monitoring data is lacking in most regions and although additional in situ data will still be a requirement for model development remote sensing holds the potential to fill data gaps by estimating irrigation in very similar regions such as adjacent water districts or in other time periods models could be extended across the landsat archive 1984 present to analyze spatiotemporal trends of irrigation in regions with similar crops and climate regimes as long as care is taken to avoid extrapolating beyond the range of the training data more accurate annual maps could be used to monitor compliance and serve as a check in areas that rely on self reporting foster et al 2020 they could also serve to identify illegally drilled wells which may be prevalent in low income countries with many small scale farmers al naber and molle 2017 perhaps the most important application of irrigation maps would be for evaluating the effectiveness of water management policies to ensure the long term sustainability of groundwater resources in the many regions that lack in situ monitoring 5 conclusion the recent development of high resolution remote sensing of eta and irrigated area have enabled the potential to map field scale irrigation quantity to aid water use monitoring and evaluate the effects of water use policy in regions and times for which field scale data are currently unavailable in this research we combined remotely sensed data and other environmental information with well level data in two regions for testing empirical modeling of irrigation at different scales regions and time periods we found that models at the field scale had slightly higher accuracy than those at the section scale and that accuracy declined with spatial and temporal transfer for models at both scales knowledge of irrigated area whether through exact field boundaries or remote sensing based maps was of primary importance in predicting irrigation volume and improved the importance of hydrologic variables in our random forest models given the level of model error as well as potential errors in the reference field data caution is warranted when applying such models for evaluating irrigation trends future efforts may look to improve model accuracy through improvements in mapping irrigated area and possible local calibration of remotely sensed evapotranspiration remote sensing of irrigation has the potential to serve several beneficial applications such as checking compliance with water regulations understanding the average effects of water policy and estimating aquifer draw down however given the currently high error of remotely sensed irrigation maps and the propensity of people to regard maps as truth careful communication of uncertainty by the scientific community would be necessary to avoid leading map users and

availability of arable land dryland accounts for approximately 40 of the world s arable land and feeds more than one third of the world s population in china approximately 60 of arable land is performed under dryland conditions and approximately 40 of dryland agriculture is performed in the loess plateau anon 2012 which spreads over approximately 64 million hectares and supports approximately 100 million people zhang et al 2018 most of the farmland on the loess plateau belongs to dryland rainfed agriculture accounting for approximately 25 m ha deng et al 2006 zhang et al 2014 and agricultural development in the area is mainly limited by water shortage yi liu et al 2010 therefore increasing food production should be based on improving crop yields and water use efficiency wue of existing cultivation practices to support increasing population in the region maize zea mays l is one of the major crops on the loess plateau accounting for 27 3 of the total agricultural area xue et al 2008 it is usually sown in mid april and harvested in late september fan et al 2005 because of high evaporation during the whole growth stage mulching with plastic film is extensively applied to enhance soil moisture for ensuring maize growth zhang et al 2017 in the region plastic film mulching induces excellent soil hydrothermal conditions thereby improving maize yield and wue compared with those in bare land li et al 2016 liu et al 2014 2009 ye and liu 2012 zhou et al 2015 however excessive soil temperature under the film may negatively affect maize yield especially with global warming global warming has brought great challenges to the sustainable agricultural development especially in the warm temperate regions in china plastic film mulching increases soil temperature leading to premature senescence and yield loss of maize bu et al 2013 qin et al 2018 some researchers believed that these occurrences may be due to the soil warming of the film mulching leading to the advancement of the maize growth period consequently the maize bell stage encounter drought ultimately leading to premature senescence and yield reduction in the later period bu et al 2013 film mulching increases the soil temperature resulting in a faster decomposition rate of soil nutrients which in return become s insufficient in later stages ultimately crop yields decreases domagała świątkiewicz and siwek 2013 zhang et al 2015 either of the results were related to the increase in soil temperature in the surface layer of maize under plastic film mulching therefore the adverse effects of higher soil temperature on the growth and development of maize under film mulching should be considered under the background of global warming global emissions are monitored as the worst case business as usual emission scenario rcp8 5 which is likely similar to unprecedented climate warming from pre industrial 1850 1990 levels of 3 5 c by 2100 allen et al 2014 the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc models project an increase in subsoil temperatures by 4 5 globally by 2100 under rcp 8 5 scenario nearly in synchrony with surface soil and air

changes pramanik et al 2015 l m zhou et al 2012 maize is a temperature sensitive crop and it can exhibit high growth rates under high temperature conditions leading to higher respiratory consumption than photosynthate accumulation and resulting in nutrition deficits and premature senescence bu et al 2013 however moderate soil cooling in the warmer season is beneficial to delaying the premature senescence and increasing the yield of mulched maize by agronomic measures such as mulching soil surface with crop straw keesstra et al 2019 lucas borja et al 2018 removing the mulch bu et al 2013 and black film mulching hu et al 2020 most of the existing reports on mulching maize have focused on the coupling effect of moisture and heat after changing film mulching methods which to some extent cannot accurately reflect the effect of soil temperature change on maize growth and development therefore with global warming as the background this study was based on the water retention function of plastic film mulch and the dual mulching of plastic film and whole maize stalks was innovatively applied to moderately reduce soil temperature and improve soil thermal balance under flat plot planting

layers were respectively calculated as the daily mean temperature in five soil layers the average soil temperature at depths from 5 to 25 cm was used as the daily mean temperature for each treatment 2 3 2 maize development stage evaluation maize plant development was identified using a standardized development stage system ritchie et al 1992 and the date was recorded at which 50 or more of the maize plants in each plot reached the following vegetative vs and reproductive rs stages v3 three leaf stage v6 six leaf stage v12 twelve leaf stage r1 silking r3 grain filling and r6 physiological maturity 2 3 3 root dry matter weight and aboveground dry matter accumulation six normal maize plants from the inner lines of replicate plots were sampled to determine root dry matter weight at 406

intra rows each core was obtained undisturbed at 30 cm increments down to 90 cm depth of the soil column 0 30 30 60 and 60 90 cm in laboratories the root samples from the soil root mixture were selected manually by using forceps and placed in nylon mesh bags the root dry weight was measured by drying the root samples at 105 c for 20 min and then dried at 75 c to a constant dry weight for 48 h similarly aboveground parts of six maize plants were selected from each plot the single maize plant was dried in an oven at 105 c for 30 min to deactivate their enzymes and dried at 75 c to a constant weight for dry matter accumulation 2 3 4 spad and leaf area index lai ten adjacent plants were selected from each plot to determine the spad value and lai the spad value of the functional

dried was approximately 14 plants from border rows were excluded from the harvest ten ears were randomly selected from each plot to determine the kernel number per ear and their 100 kernel dry weight was also determined 2 3 6 water use efficiency wue and precipitation use efficiency pue the five point sampling method was used to determine the swc of 0 200 cm for the whole experimental area before planting and three points were taken for each treatment between two successive plants in the same row after harvest to determine the swc of 0 200 cm wue kg ha 1 mm was calculated according to field water balance formulae hussain and al jaloud 1995 et sws p sws h p wue y et where et mm is the water consumption sws p and sws h are the water storage at sowing and harvest respectively p mm is the precipitation at the whole growth period of spring maize and y kg ha 1 is the grain yield at physiological maturity additionally because the sample area is basically flat and the amount of precipitation in each precipitation event is usually small runoff is assumed to be negligible pue kg ha 1 mm was calculated according to the following formula duan et al 2020 pue y p where p mm is the effective precipitation during the growing season 2 4 statistical analysis experimental data in the three growing seasons were examined via analysis of variance in spss 22 0 spss inc chicago il usa the data obtained from each sampling event were analyzed separately the least significant difference lsd was used to determine differences between means when a significant treatment effect was observed at p 0 05 data figures were created by graphpad prism 8 0 graphpad software inc san diego ca usa 3 results 3 1 soil moisture and temperature 3 1 1 dynamics of soil moisture swc of different treatments during the growth period in the 0 100 cm soil layer is shown in fig 3 swc was generally ranked as follows pfm 17 80 in 201 818 36 in 2019 and 15 24 in 2020 pfm st 17 62 in 201 818 26 in 2019 and 15 01 in 2020 ck 16 47 in 201 817 03 in 2019 and 13 81 in 2020 however swc was greatly affected by mulching patterns and precipitation and it varied with the growth period mulching treatments pfm and pfm st significantly increased the swc at the 0 20 cm soil layer by 11 34 14 24 8 09 10 75 and 8 55 9 51 at 20 das in 20 182 019 and 2020 compared with that of ck respectively mulching treatments had higher swc at the 0 100 cm soil layer than at other soil layers conversely swc slightly differed among the different mulching treatments at the 0 100 cm soil layer compared with pfm st pfm decreased swc by 2 98 4 01 1 89 2 47 and 1 92 2 00 at 40 and 60 das in 20 182 019 and 2020 respectively and these values were mainly observed at the 20 60 cm soil layer conversely compared with pfm pfm st decreased swc at the 20 60 cm soil layer by 1 35 2 74 1 66 1 89 and 2 99 3 10 at 80 and 100 das when maize required a high amount of water in 20 182 019 and 2020 respectively thus as maize grew the swc driven by different mulching methods might increase or decrease but swc under two different mulching treatments had no significant difference at the 0 100 cm soil layer the variation trends of rainfall and 0 100 cm sws of maize at each growth stage were almost the same and the sws of mulching treatments pfm and pfm st and ck at the 0 100 cm soil layer had significant differences fig 4 sws was significantly higher under mulching treatments than those of ck by 6 46 7 12 7 46 7 52 and 8 73 10 38 during the growing seasons in 20 182 019 and 2020 respectively however sws did not significantly differ between the two different mulching treatments 3 1 2 dynamics of soil temperature throughout the maize growth period changes in temperature in each soil layer were similar and the soil temperatures of the mulching treatments pfm and pfm st were higher than those of ck fig 5 the pfm treatment had the highest soil temperature in five soil layers throughout growing seasons and the pfm st was the second but significant differences were observed between pfm and pfm st especially in the early growth period soil temperatures under pfm treatment at 5 10 and 15 cm soil layers were significantly higher than those of pfm st by 1 6 1 4 and 1 3 c at 40 das respectively pfm treatments were significantly higher than pfm st by 2 3 2 1 and 1 5 at 60 das respectively in the later growth period of maize in 20 182 019 and 2020 the difference in the mulching treatments in soil temperature was obviously reduced for instance the soil temperature in pfm was higher than that of pfm st by 1 2 1 0 and 0 9 c at 80 das the soil temperature in pfm treatments was higher than that in pfm st by 1 0 0 9 and 0 7 c at 100 das the soil temperature in pfm treatments was also higher than that in pfm st by 1 1 1 0 and 0 8 at 120 das however with the increase in soil depth the difference in soil temperature at the 25 cm soil layer of mulching treatment at the later stage of maize growth i e 80 120 das was not significant the dynamic changes in average soil temperature at the 0 25 cm soil layer are shown in fig 6 the average soil temperature of two different mulching treatments was significantly higher than that of ck by 2 5 and 1 3 c compared with pfm treatment pfm st treatment decreased the average soil temperatures by 1 3 1 8 1 7 0 9 0 8 and 0 9 c at 20 406 080 100 and 120 das respectively for 3 years at the early growth stages of maize 20 60 das the average soil temperature of pfm st was 1 6 c lower than that of pfm at the 0 25 cm soil layer respectively however the average soil temperature of pfm st was 0 9 c lower than that of pfm at the later growth stages of maize 80 120 das 3 2 maize phenology maize growth was accelerated under pfm treatment in 2018 2020 table 1 pfm treatment advanced the vegetative and reproductive growth by 2 3 and 3 days compared with that of ck respectively this treatment resulted in a shorter growth time to physiological maturity and the time for pfm treatment to reach physiological maturity advanced by 7 9 days pfm treatment advanced vegetative and reproductive growth by 1 2 and 6 7 days compared with that of pfm st treatment and the time for pfm treatment reached the physiological maturity stage was ultimately advanced by 10 days however pfm st treatment advanced vegetative and reproductive growth by 1 and 3 4 days compared with that of ck treatment 3 3 maize growth dynamics 3 3 1 root dry matter weight changes in the root dry matter weight of maize in different soil layer depths and the total root dry matter weight at 40 120 das for 3 years are shown in fig 7 mulching treatments significantly improved the root dry matter weight during the whole growth stages compared with that of ck at 40 and 60 das the total root dry matter weight under pfm treatment was significantly higher than that under pfm st in 2019 and 2020 at 80 das the total root dry matter weight of all treatments rapidly increased and the root dry matter weight under pfm st treatment was higher than that under pfm in all soil depths at 100 das the total root dry matter weight under pfm st treatment was significantly higher than that under pfm in 2018 2020 subsequently the root dry matter weight decreased for all treatments and the root dry matter weight under pfm st treatment was significantly higher than that under pfm at 0 90 cm for 3 years 3 3 2 spad and lai the spad value of functional leaf was affected by mulching treatments pfm and pfm st and ck fig 8 during the entire growing seasons the spad value of mulching treatments initially increased subsequently decreased and reached the maximum at 80 das the spad value of mulching treatments was significantly higher than that of ck in 3 years however the mulching treatments had significant differences at the early growth stage 20 60 das the spad value of pfm treatment was higher than that of pfm st treatment specifically the spad value of pfm was significantly higher than that of pfm st at 40 das in 2018 and 2020 the spad value of pfm was higher than that of pfm st treatment at 60 das but no significant difference was observed between pfm and pfm st treatments in 2018 2020 however the spad value of pfm st was significantly higher than that of pfm treatment in the later growth stages of maize 80 120 das changes in the lai of maize for 3 years are shown in fig 9 similar to the trend of changes in the spad value of the functional leaf the lai for the two mulching treatments was greater than that for ck in 2018 2020 at 20 das the leaf area was small for three treatments and the lai under mulching treatments was significantly higher than that of ck but pfm and pfm st treatments had no significant differences at 40 das the lai under pfm treatment was significantly higher than that under pfm st treatment at 60 das the mulching treatments were higher than pfm no significant differences were found between mulching treatments in 2019 however the leaf area under pfm st treatment was significantly higher than that under pfm treatment at 80 100 and 120 das in 2018 2020 3 3 3 aboveground dry matter throughout the growing seasons the aboveground dry matter accumulation was significantly greater for the mulching treatments pfm and pfm st than that for ck fig 10 at 40 das the aboveground dry matter accumulation in pfm treatment was significantly higher than that in pfm st by 4 80 14 20 in 2018 2020 at 60 das the two mulching treatments had no significant differences and the accumulation in pfm was slightly higher than that in pfm st subsequently the dry matter accumulation of pfm st was significantly higher than that of pfm treatment after silking the aboveground dry matter accumulation of mulching treatments significantly increased by 10 88 19 56 compared with that of pfm in 3 years at 120 das the aboveground dry matter accumulation was generally ranked as follows pfm st 29 245 kg ha 1 in 201 831 931 kg ha 1 in 201 927 926 kg ha 1 in 2020 pfm 25 538 kg ha 1 in 201 828 525 kg ha 1 in 201 924 121 kg ha 1 in 2020 ck 20 038 kg ha 1 in 201 822 197 kg ha 1 in 201 919 073 kg ha 1 in 2020 3 4 yield water use efficiency and precipitation use efficiency all mulching treatments pfm and pfm st were significantly superior to ck in terms of kernel number 100 kernel dry weight and grain yield in 2018 2020 table 2 in comparison with the values obtained in ck the mulching treatments significantly increased the kernel number 100 kernel dry weight and grain yield by 10 31 10 61 11 12 21 64 and 23 52 37 01 in 2018 22 18 23 18 11 60 22 46 and 25 36 39 05 in 2019 and 5 60 6 44 13 02 23 95 and 20 57 33 36 in 2020 respectively of the two mulching treatments pfm st consistently achieved the higher kernel number 100 kernel dry weight and grain yield furthermore 100 kernel dry weight and grain yield of pfm st treatment were significantly higher than those of pfm the 100 kernel dry weight and grain yield of the pfm st treatment significantly increased by 9 47 and 10 92 compared with those of the pfm treatment in 2018 respectively they also increased by 9 74 and 10 92 in 2019 respectively and by 9 67 and 10 61 in 2020 respectively therefore among the treatments the pfm st treatment had the highest kernel number per ear 100 kernel dry weight and grain yield wue and pue were markedly affected by different mulching treatments and evapotranspiration et was not significantly affected table 2 for the three growing seasons the wues and pues of the different treatments in descending order were as follows pfm st pfm ck pfm st had the highest wue and pue and they were significantly higher than those of the other treatments the wue and pue of the mulching treatments pfm and pfm st significantly increased by 24 26 39 84 and 23 15 36 48 compared with those of ck in addition wue and pue in pfm st significantly increased by 12 55 and 10 82 compared with those in pfm treatment respectively 4 discussion 4 1 soil moisture and temperature precipitation is usually the only source of soil water in rainfed agricultural regions gholamhoseini et al 2019 ritchie et al 1992 therefore maintaining as much precipitation as possible in soil is essential for crop growth and development in the loess plateau with dryland agricultural production areas pfm has been widely applied to maize cultivation pfm can significantly improve soil moisture in semi arid regions by increasing the harvest of rainfall and suppressing evaporation gan et al 2013b mo et al 2018 in our study the mulching treatments pfm and pfm st had significantly higher swc during the growing seasons fig 3 although the trend of the changes in swc between mulching treatments was similar the swc of each soil layer was different i e pfm st was higher than pfm at the 40 60 cm soil layer at 40 and 60 das and pfm was higher than pfm st at the 0 60 cm soil layer at 80 and 100 das fig 3 this finding may occur because pfm treatment increased the aboveground transpiration of maize at the early growth stage consequently water consumption increased at the 40 60 cm soil layer at the later stage of maize growth the pfm st treatment required higher moisture for plant growth as a result 0 60 cm soil moisture consumption occurred the mulching treatments produced a higher sws than the ck fig 4 pfm st enabled plants to utilize soil water from deep soil especially in dry year i e in 2020 notably sws had no significant differences between pfm st and pfm during the maize growing seasons in dry and wet years fig 4 single transparent pfm resulted in higher soil temperature figs 5 6 normally transparent plastic film absorbs limited solar radiation transmitting 85 95 of the total solar radiation to soil ham et al 2019 lamont 2005 at the 5 cm soil layer mulching treatments pfm and pfm st increased the soil temperature by 1 8 4 8 c compared with that of ck fig 5 our results were consistent with previously reported findings in maize in the loess plateau wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 the soil warming effect of mulching was greater during the early growth period and diminished when the plants grow larger and their leaves cover most of the mulch surface qin et al 2018 the daily average soil temperatures at the 0 25 cm soil layer under pfm and pfm st increased by 1 3 1 7 c and 0 8 0 9 c relative to ck in early 20 60 das and late 80 120 das growth periods of maize respectively fig 6 our results were consistent with previous findings which showed that plant canopy is sufficiently small in the early growing season of maize development such that most of the plastic film area receives solar energy which warms the topsoil zhou et al 2009 although variations in the average soil temperature were similar under two mulching treatments changes in soil temperature regulated by pfm and pfm st over the growth period had significant differences previous studies found that straw covering the soil surface reduces the solar energy reaching the soil surface keeping the soil cooling in summer and reducing the increase in soil temperature hu et al 2019 kar and kumar 2007 wang et al 2015 interestingly our results found that pfm st decreased the soil temperature by 3 0 c compared with that of pfm at the 5 cm soil layer fig 5 the daily average soil temperature at the 0 25 cm soil layer under pfm st dual mulching of transparent plastic film with straw was an average of 0 8 1 8 c lower than that under pfm transparent mulching and pfm st decreased the soil temperature by 1 3 1 8 c and 0 8 0 9 c relative to pfm in early 20 60 das and late 80 120 das growth seasons of maize in warm semi arid regions respectively fig 6 this observation was mainly because straw mulching forms a physical isolation layer on the soil surface which can effectively intercept and absorb direct solar radiation reduce effective surface radiation decrease heat exchange between soil and atmosphere and decrease soil temperature gao et al 2009 however another study has shown that straw mulching causes soil temperature to be lower than the optimum temperature for crop growth chen et al 2005 this study found that the daily average soil temperatures at 0 25 cm soil layer under pfm st was significantly higher than that of ck especially at the early stage of maize growth 20 60 das this result is different from previously published findings because of the different straw mulching methods the mulching film increased the soil temperature but the dual mulching pfm st weakened solar radiation which significantly decreased the warming effect of the mulching film the growing season of spring maize was from the end of april to the end of august when hot summer conditions prevailed thus a moderately lower soil temperature under the mulching film is conducive to plant growth the dual mulching of the transparent film with straw maintained the same sws as normal film mulching and moderately decreased the soil temperature under the mulching film for maize growth consequently seasonal drought stress and excessive daytime soil temperature stress effectively reduced however studies should determine whether low soil temperature affects the changes in soil nutrients or soil microorganisms 4 2 maize phenology plant phenology is one of the most reliable bioindicators of climate change tao et al 2008 white et al 1997 2008 in general increasing temperature results in an accelerated developmental rate and a shortened growing season yuan liu et al 2010 oteros et al 2015 tao et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 thus the duration for the acquisition of resources radiation water and nutrients shortens and crop productivity in warm environments decreases craufurd and wheeler 2009 nord and lynch 2009 pfm can greatly increase soil temperature and then markedly accelerate maize growth processes liu et al 2010b our study supported the findings of previous studies our study found that spring maize of mulch plastic matured earlier and had shorter vegetative and reproductive growth periods compared to no mulch as mulch increased soil temperature in warmer regions for example pfm advanced vegetative and reproductive growth by 4 6 and 5 7 days pfm st advanced by 1 2 days compared with that of ck table 1 pfm treatment advanced vegetative and reproductive growth by 3 4 and 4 6 days compared with that of pfm st table 1 these growth processes were delayed possibly because of soil cooling under the dual mulching of transparent film with straw compared with the transparent plastic mulch therefore pfm st treatment extended maize growth and might be more conducive to the growth and development of the roots and shoots of maize 4 3 maize growth maize growth is influenced by the transfer and absorption of different resources such as soil water and temperature during the growth season mwale et al 2007 the root system is an important organ that absorbs nutrients and water and sensitive to soil temperature previous studies revealed that the root dry weight of maize and winter rape under film mulching is significantly increased compared with that of bare land gao et al 2014 gu et al 2016 lin et al 2018 similar results were generated in our 3 year study however some studies have shown that low soil temperatures delay the root senescence of spring maize and wheat bu et al 2013 li et al 1999 and promote the root growth of winter strawberry and lettuce in greenhouses pandey et al 2015 sabri et al 2019 other researchers found that the decrease in the dry matter weight of horticultural plant roots is related to high soil temperatures gonzález et al 2009 mcmichael and burke 1998 our previous study found that a high root zone temperature is not conducive to the establishment of root morphology at the maize seedling stage xia et al 2021 this study further found that maize root dry matter weight under pfm transparent pfm was higher than that under pfm st dual mulching of transparent plastic film with straw at 40 and 60 das fig 7 possibly because of the higher soil temperature under pfm enhanced nutrient cycling in the soil fang et al 2011 accelerating root growth in early growth period however as maize grows the root matter weight of pfm st was higher than that of pfm at 80 120 das possibly because the higher soil temperature at the early stage of pfm treatment promotes the absorption of soil nutrients by maize roots resulting in the lack of soil nutrients at later stages in turn it leads to a sharp decrease in nutrients obtained by the roots in the soil at later stages bu et al 2013 and poor root growth mulching improves water availability and soil temperature leading to improved seed germination seedling establishment and maize growth which contributes to greater radiation capture by the canopy bu et al 2013 yi liu et al 2010b in the early period of maize growth mulching can significantly increase the surface soil temperature while reducing water loss thereby increasing spad and lai which may benefit from the increase in water and nutrient absorption by the roots however the spad and lais under pfm st were significantly higher than those under pfm at 80 120 das figs 8 9 these results were supported with a previous study i e the warming effect of transparent plastic film mulch shortened maize growth leading to premature senescence and worse stay green capability of leaves in later stages of maize growth bu et al 2013 qin et al 2018 this study revealed that the spad and lai of pfm st in the middle to late growing season could significantly increase compared with that of pfm treatment thereby ensuring higher aboveground dry matter accumulation of maize during later growth stages dry matter production is a key indicator of the sustainability of rainfed agriculture ceschia et al 2010 gan et al 2013a and favorable hydrothermal conditions resulting from mulching can significantly increase aboveground dry matter liu et al 2009 in the current study all two mulching treatments significantly increased the aboveground biomass compared with that of ck in 2018 2020 maize growing seasons and no significant differences were observed in aboveground dry matter between pfm st and pfm at 60 das in 2018 2020 fig 10 during 80 120 das the greatest aboveground dry matter was observed in the pfm st treatment the aboveground dry matter weight under pfm st was significantly higher than that under pfm likely because pfm st treatment promoted the growth of maize roots which would facilitate greater water and nutrient uptake these resources would then be conveyed to vegetative organs which increased crop canopy growth i e increase in spad and lai 4 4 yield wue and pue increasing productivity and stability are two of the major objectives of development for dryland farming global warming has brought great challenges to the sustainable development of agriculture especially in warm temperate regions in china previous studies showed that plastic film and straw mulching are effective methods to improve wue and yield in maize mo et al 2017 l m zhou et al 2012 wheat chen et al 2015 zhang et al 2007 and potato zhao et al 2014 in semi arid areas mulching with plastic film could reduce the interannual variation in maize yield and increase crop productivity therefore it is an attractive option for developing dryland agriculture in this study the dual mulching of plastic and maize straw pattern with the unchanged water retention function of the mulch film under global warming was used the results from the present study were similar to those of mulching treatments regardless of dual mulching of transparent film with straw or transparent film mulching table 2 the yield increased under mulching treatments especially the dual mulching of transparent film with straw however as per the findings of a previous study straw mulching effects can depend on climatic conditions and soil type acharya et al 2005 and straw mulching tends to reduce soil surface temperature which can lead to a reduction in yield edwards et al 2000 gao and li 2005 the present study observed that the maize yield under pfm st differed significantly from that under pfm in 2018 2020 and was 10 92 1171 kg ha 1 markedly higher than that of pfm table 2 a key reason is that dual mulching increased the soil temperature in relatively bare land and decreased the soil temperature compared with that of mulching with transparent film thus moderate soil warming was beneficial to maize growth but excessively high soil temperature under transparent mulching was detrimental to maize growth in some agricultural production areas with poor irrigation increasing wue and pue is a key goal of sustainable agricultural development gan et al 2013b the application of pfm can significantly increase wue and pue in some arid and semi arid regions xiaoli et al 2012 zhao et al 2014 mulching is an effective practice to increase wue and pue in maize duan et al 2020 l m zhou et al 2012 our data revealed that mulching treatments pfm and pfm st caused a higher wue and pue in 2018 2020 table 2 the main reason was that pfm can effectively limit water loss caused by soil evaporation increase canopy transpiration and promote biomass accumulation thereby increasing grain yield yi liu et al 2010a 2010b et involves soil evaporation and plant transpiration the latter is considered to be the most important component of et jasechko et al 2013 according to previous studies conducted in a semi arid environment the difference in et between mulching treatments and ck was closely related to rainfall during the crop growing season our results showed that the ets of mulching treatments in three seasons were lower than that of ck possibly because soil evaporation is greater than plant transpiration table 2 as a result the wues and pues in mulching treatments pfm and pfm st increased by 24 26 39 84 and 23 15 36 48 in three maize growth seasons compared with those in ck respectively our data revealed that mulching treatments had higher wue and pue than ck grain yield is another more important component determining the wue and pue of maize field in our study the dual mulching of transparent plastic film and straw gained the highest grain yield and hence wue and pue in 2018 2020 table 2 therefore in comparison with pfm leading to premature senescence and yield loss of maize the dual mulching of transparent plastic film and straw may act as a promising flat plot rainfed agricultural management system to improve maize yield and wue in the semi arid loess plateau china 5 conclusions our 3 year study showed that the present grain yield of rainfed mulch spring maize in the loess plateau could be further improved by optimizing agronomic practices the dual mulching of plastic film with straw was an effective practice for maintaining sws and increasing wue more importantly the pfm st cultivation practice moderately decreased average soil temperature under the film and extended the vegetative and reproductive growths of spring maize in the late growth period of spring maize the pfm st significantly increased spad lai and aboveground dry matter accumulation and improved root dry matter weight although global warming and pfm cause an increase in soil temperatures dual mulching can be applied as a promising approach to maintain sws and increase wue and spring maize grain yield in rainfed agricultural areas of the loess plateau in china however the pfm st practice should be further investigated using various crops in multiple sites and years thus this study could be used as a basis for further optimizing cultivation methods based on premature senescence reducing the

9372,transparent plastic film mulching pfm with flat cropping cultivation has been widely applied to grow maize zea mays l in dryland agricultural production areas of the loess plateau in china

warming applying pfm st cultivation practice effectively extended growth period and increased mulching spring maize yield and wue in the study site keywords dryland dual mulching with flat plot soil hydrothermal condition maize phenology water use efficiency 1 introduction rapid population growth poses a major challenge for efficient and sustainable dryland farming practices given the limited availability of arable land dryland accounts for approximately 40 of the world s arable land and feeds more than one third of the world s population in china approximately 60 of arable land is performed under dryland conditions and approximately 40 of dryland agriculture is performed in the loess plateau anon 2012 which spreads over approximately 64 million hectares and supports approximately 100 million people zhang et al 2018 most of the farmland on the loess plateau belongs to dryland rainfed agriculture accounting for approximately 25 m ha deng et al 2006 zhang et al 2014 and agricultural development in the area is mainly limited by water shortage yi liu et al 2010 therefore increasing food production should be based on improving crop yields and water use efficiency wue of existing cultivation practices to support increasing population in the region maize zea mays l is one of the major crops on the loess plateau accounting for 27 3 of the total agricultural area xue et al 2008 it is usually sown in mid april and harvested in late september fan et al 2005 because of high evaporation during the whole growth stage mulching with plastic film is extensively applied to enhance soil moisture for ensuring maize growth zhang et al 2017 in the region plastic film mulching induces excellent soil hydrothermal conditions thereby improving maize yield and wue compared with those in bare land li et al 2016 liu et al 2014 2009 ye and liu 2012 zhou et al 2015 however excessive soil temperature under the film may negatively affect maize yield especially with global warming global warming has brought great challenges to the sustainable agricultural development especially in the warm temperate regions in china plastic film mulching increases soil temperature leading to premature senescence and yield loss of maize bu et al 2013 qin et al 2018 some researchers believed that these occurrences may be due to the soil warming of the film mulching leading to the advancement of the maize growth period consequently the maize bell stage encounter drought ultimately leading to premature senescence and yield reduction in the later period bu et al 2013 film mulching increases the soil temperature resulting in a faster decomposition rate of soil nutrients which in return become s insufficient in later stages ultimately crop yields decreases domagała świątkiewicz and siwek 2013 zhang et al 2015 either of the results were related to the increase in soil temperature in the surface layer of maize under plastic film mulching therefore the adverse effects of higher soil temperature on the growth and development of maize under film mulching should be considered under the background of global warming global emissions are monitored as the worst case business as usual emission scenario rcp8 5 which is likely similar to unprecedented climate warming from pre industrial 1850 1990 levels of 3 5 c by 2100 allen et al 2014 the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc models project an increase in subsoil temperatures by 4 5 globally by 2100 under rcp 8 5 scenario nearly in synchrony with surface soil and air temperatures ipcc 2019 soong et al 2020 with evolution crop growth is more sensitive to soil temperature than to air temperature gan et al 2013b and is significantly affected by soil temperature changes pramanik et al 2015 l m zhou et al 2012 maize is a temperature sensitive crop and it can exhibit high growth rates under high temperature conditions leading to higher respiratory consumption than photosynthate accumulation and resulting in nutrition deficits and premature senescence bu et al 2013 however moderate soil cooling in the warmer season is beneficial to delaying the premature senescence and increasing the yield of mulched maize by agronomic measures such as mulching soil surface with crop straw keesstra et al 2019 lucas borja et al 2018 removing the mulch bu et al 2013 and black film mulching hu et al 2020 most of the existing reports on mulching maize have focused on the coupling effect of moisture and heat after changing film mulching methods which to some extent cannot accurately reflect the effect of soil temperature change on maize growth and development therefore with global warming as the background this study was based on the water retention function of plastic film mulch and the dual mulching of plastic film and whole maize stalks was innovatively applied to moderately reduce soil temperature and improve soil thermal balance under flat plot planting this study was mainly performed to 1 compare soil hydrothermal conditions under mulching methods and 2 identify the effects of dual mulching on phenology grain yield wue and precipitation use

dual mulching of transparent plastic film with whole maize stalks the transparent plastic film is the same as aforementioned whole maize stalks coverage was 3000 kg ha 1 the schematic of the field layout is shown in fig 2 the transparent plastic film was used by covering the soil surface where the film edges were covered carefully and compacted with soil a soil belt was set to prevent the film from being removed by strong winds additionally the whole maize stalks were covered on the transparent plastic film at 15 days after sowing das i e pfm st treatment to ensure the emergence rate and uniformity new plastic film was applied every year when sowing and the maize straw for mulching was removed at harvest and not integrated into the soil the maize field experiment was conducted by a completely randomized design with three replicates and each plot area measured 23 1 m2 4 2 m wide 5 5 m long a 1 5 m wide boundary was set between plots for on site management and sampling activity maize cv zhengdan 958 was planted with equal row spacing 60 cm by 67 500 plants ha 1 planting density on april 3 020 182 019 and 2020 and harvested on september 62 018 september 112 019 and september 62 020 respectively chemical fertilizers were applied in all treatments at rates of 225 kg n ha 1 and 120 kg p2o5 ha 1 by using a hole sowing fertilization machine 1 day before maize planting no irrigation was used and all water inputs were from natural rainfall during this study weeds were controlled manually as required during each crop growth season other experimental field management methods were the same as those in ordinary local fields and strictly conducted in accordance with experimental requirements 2 3 sampling and measurement 2 3 1 soil hydrothermal conditions soil water

das respectively a set of mercury in glass geothermometer was placed at the center of each plot between two successive plants in the same row the mean soil temperatures in 5 101 520 and 25 cm soil layers were respectively calculated as the daily mean temperature in five soil layers the average soil temperature at depths from 5 to 25 cm was used as the daily mean temperature for each treatment 2

intra rows each core was obtained undisturbed at 30 cm increments down to 90 cm depth of the soil column 0 30 30 60 and 60 90 cm in laboratories the root samples from the soil root mixture were selected manually by using forceps and placed in nylon mesh bags the root dry weight was measured by drying the root samples at 105 c for 20 min and then dried at 75 c to a constant dry weight for 48 h similarly aboveground parts of six maize plants were selected from each plot the single maize plant was dried in an oven at 105 c for 30 min to deactivate their enzymes and dried at 75 c to a constant weight for dry matter accumulation 2 3 4 spad and leaf area index lai ten adjacent plants were selected from each plot to determine the spad value and lai the spad value of the functional

planting and three points were taken for each treatment between two successive plants in the same row after harvest to determine the swc of 0 200 cm wue kg ha 1 mm was calculated according to field water balance formulae hussain and al jaloud 1995 et sws p sws h p wue y et where et mm is the water consumption sws p and sws h are the water storage at sowing and harvest respectively p mm is the precipitation at the whole growth period of spring maize and y kg ha 1 is the grain yield at physiological maturity additionally because the sample area is basically flat and the amount of precipitation in each precipitation event is usually small runoff is assumed to be negligible pue kg ha 1 mm was calculated according to the following formula duan et al 2020 pue y p where p mm is the effective precipitation during the growing season 2 4 statistical analysis experimental data in the three growing seasons were examined via analysis of variance in spss 22 0 spss inc chicago il usa the data obtained from each sampling event were analyzed separately the least significant difference lsd was used to determine differences between means when a significant treatment effect was

treatments during the growth period in the 0 100 cm soil layer is shown in fig 3 swc was generally ranked as follows pfm 17 80 in 201 818 36 in 2019 and 15 24 in 2020 pfm st 17 62 in 201 818 26 in 2019 and 15 01 in 2020 ck 16 47 in 201 817 03 in 2019 and 13 81 in 2020 however swc was greatly affected by mulching patterns and precipitation and it varied with the growth period mulching treatments pfm and pfm st significantly increased the swc at the 0 20 cm soil layer by 11 34 14 24 8 09 10 75 and 8 55 9 51 at 20 das in 20 182 019 and 2020 compared with that of ck respectively mulching treatments had higher swc at the 0 100 cm soil layer than at other soil layers conversely swc slightly differed among the different mulching treatments at the 0 100 cm soil layer compared with pfm st pfm decreased swc by 2 98 4 01 1 89 2 47 and 1 92 2 00 at 40 and 60 das in 20 182 019 and 2020 respectively and these values were mainly observed at the 20 60 cm soil layer conversely compared with pfm pfm st decreased swc at the 20 60 cm soil layer by 1 35 2 74 1 66 1 89 and 2 99 3 10 at 80 and 100 das when maize required a high amount of water in 20 182 019 and 2020 respectively thus as maize grew the swc driven by different mulching methods might increase or decrease but swc under two different mulching treatments had no significant difference at the 0 100 cm soil layer the variation trends of rainfall and 0 100 cm sws of maize at each growth stage were almost the same and the sws of mulching treatments pfm and pfm st and ck at the 0 100 cm soil layer had significant differences fig 4 sws was significantly higher under mulching treatments than those of ck by 6 46 7 12 7 46 7 52 and 8 73 10 38 during the growing seasons in 20 182 019 and 2020 respectively however sws did not significantly differ between the two different mulching treatments 3 1 2 dynamics of soil temperature throughout the maize growth period changes in temperature in each soil layer were similar and the soil temperatures of the mulching treatments pfm and pfm st were higher than those of ck fig 5 the pfm treatment had the highest soil temperature in five soil layers throughout growing seasons and the pfm st was the second but significant differences were observed between pfm and pfm st especially in the early growth period soil temperatures under pfm treatment at 5 10 and 15 cm soil layers were significantly higher than those of pfm st by 1 6 1 4 and 1 3 c at 40 das respectively pfm treatments were significantly higher than pfm st by 2 3 2 1 and 1 5 at 60 das respectively in the later growth period of maize in 20 182 019 and 2020 the difference in the mulching treatments in soil temperature was obviously reduced for instance the soil temperature in pfm was higher than that of pfm st by 1 2 1 0 and 0 9 c at 80 das the soil temperature in pfm treatments was higher than that in pfm st by 1 0 0 9 and 0 7 c at 100 das the soil temperature in pfm treatments was also higher than that in pfm st by 1 1 1 0 and 0 8 at 120 das however with the increase in soil depth the difference in soil temperature at the 25 cm soil layer of mulching treatment at the later stage of maize growth i e 80 120 das was not significant the dynamic changes in average soil temperature at the 0 25 cm soil layer are shown in fig 6 the average soil temperature of two different mulching treatments was significantly higher than that of ck by 2 5 and 1 3 c compared with pfm treatment pfm st treatment decreased the average soil temperatures by 1 3 1 8 1 7 0 9 0 8 and 0 9 c at 20 406 080 100 and 120 das respectively for 3 years at the early growth stages of maize 20 60 das the average soil temperature of pfm st was 1 6 c lower than that of pfm at the 0 25 cm soil layer respectively however the average soil temperature of pfm st was 0 9 c lower than that of pfm at the later growth stages of maize 80 120 das 3 2 maize phenology maize growth was accelerated under pfm treatment in 2018 2020 table 1 pfm treatment advanced the vegetative and reproductive growth by 2 3 and 3 days compared with that of ck respectively this treatment resulted in a shorter growth time to physiological maturity and the time for pfm treatment to reach physiological maturity advanced by 7 9 days pfm treatment advanced vegetative and reproductive growth by 1 2 and 6 7 days compared with that of pfm st treatment and the time for pfm treatment reached the physiological maturity stage was ultimately advanced by 10 days however pfm st treatment advanced vegetative and reproductive growth by 1 and 3 4 days compared with that of ck treatment 3 3 maize growth dynamics 3 3 1 root dry matter weight changes in the root dry matter weight of maize in different soil layer depths and the total root dry matter weight at 40 120 das for 3 years are shown in fig 7 mulching treatments significantly improved the root dry matter weight during the whole growth stages compared with that of ck at 40 and 60 das the total root dry matter weight under pfm treatment was significantly higher than that under pfm st in 2019 and 2020 at 80 das the total root dry matter weight of all treatments rapidly increased and the root dry matter weight under pfm st treatment was higher than that under pfm in all soil depths at 100 das the total root dry matter weight under pfm st treatment was significantly higher than that under pfm in 2018 2020 subsequently the root dry matter weight decreased for all treatments and the root dry matter weight under pfm st treatment was significantly higher than that under pfm at 0 90 cm for 3 years 3 3 2 spad and lai the spad value of functional leaf was affected by mulching treatments pfm and pfm st and ck fig 8 during the entire growing seasons the spad value of mulching treatments initially increased subsequently decreased and reached the maximum at 80 das the spad value of mulching treatments was significantly higher than that of ck in 3 years however the mulching treatments had significant differences at the early growth stage 20 60 das the spad value of pfm treatment was higher than that of pfm st treatment specifically the spad value of pfm was significantly higher than that of pfm st at 40 das in 2018 and 2020 the spad value of pfm was higher than that of pfm st treatment at 60 das but no significant difference was observed between pfm and pfm st treatments in 2018 2020 however the spad value of pfm st was significantly higher than that of pfm treatment in the later growth stages of maize 80 120 das changes in the lai of maize for 3 years are shown in fig 9 similar to the trend of changes in the spad value of the functional leaf the lai for the two mulching treatments was greater than that for ck in 2018 2020 at 20 das the leaf area was small for three treatments and the lai under mulching treatments was significantly higher than that of ck but pfm and pfm st treatments had no significant differences at 40 das the lai under pfm treatment was significantly higher than that under pfm st treatment at 60 das the mulching treatments were higher than pfm no significant differences were found between mulching treatments in 2019 however the leaf area under pfm st treatment was significantly higher than that under pfm treatment at 80 100 and 120 das in 2018 2020 3 3 3 aboveground dry matter throughout the growing seasons the aboveground dry matter accumulation was significantly greater for the mulching treatments pfm and pfm st than that for ck fig 10 at 40 das the aboveground dry matter accumulation in pfm treatment was significantly higher than that in pfm st by 4 80 14 20 in 2018 2020 at 60 das the two mulching treatments had no significant differences and the accumulation in pfm was slightly higher than that in pfm st subsequently the dry matter accumulation of pfm st was significantly higher than that of pfm treatment after silking the aboveground dry matter accumulation of mulching treatments significantly increased by 10 88 19 56 compared with that of pfm in 3 years at 120 das the aboveground dry matter accumulation was generally ranked as follows pfm st 29 245 kg ha 1 in 201 831 931 kg ha 1 in 201 927 926 kg ha 1 in 2020 pfm 25 538 kg ha 1 in 201 828 525 kg ha 1 in 201 924 121 kg ha 1 in 2020 ck 20 038 kg ha 1 in 201 822 197 kg ha 1 in 201 919 073 kg ha 1 in 2020 3 4 yield water use efficiency and precipitation use efficiency all mulching treatments pfm and pfm st were significantly superior to ck in terms of kernel number 100 kernel dry weight and grain yield in 2018 2020 table 2 in comparison with the values obtained in ck the mulching treatments significantly increased the kernel number 100 kernel dry weight and grain yield by 10 31 10 61 11 12 21 64 and 23 52 37 01 in 2018 22 18 23 18 11 60 22 46 and 25 36 39 05 in 2019 and 5 60 6 44 13 02 23 95 and 20 57 33 36 in 2020 respectively of the two mulching treatments pfm st consistently achieved the higher kernel number 100 kernel dry weight and grain yield furthermore 100 kernel dry weight and grain yield of pfm st treatment were significantly higher than those of pfm the 100 kernel dry weight and grain yield of the pfm st treatment significantly increased by 9 47 and 10 92 compared with those of the pfm treatment in 2018 respectively they also increased by 9 74 and 10 92 in 2019 respectively and by 9 67 and 10 61 in 2020 respectively therefore among the treatments the pfm st treatment had the highest kernel number per ear 100 kernel dry weight and grain yield wue and pue were markedly affected by different mulching treatments and evapotranspiration et was not significantly affected table 2 for the three growing seasons the wues and pues of the different treatments in descending order were as follows pfm st pfm ck pfm st had the highest wue and pue and they were significantly higher than those of the other treatments the wue and pue of the mulching treatments pfm and pfm st significantly increased by 24 26 39 84 and 23 15 36 48 compared with those of ck in addition wue and pue in pfm st significantly increased by 12 55 and 10 82 compared with those in pfm treatment respectively 4 discussion 4 1 soil moisture and temperature precipitation is usually the only source of soil water in rainfed agricultural regions gholamhoseini et al 2019 ritchie et al 1992 therefore maintaining as much precipitation as possible in soil is essential for crop growth and development in the loess plateau with dryland agricultural production areas pfm has been widely applied to maize cultivation pfm can significantly improve soil moisture in semi arid regions by increasing the harvest of rainfall and suppressing evaporation gan et al 2013b mo et al 2018 in our study the mulching treatments pfm and pfm st had significantly higher swc during the growing seasons fig 3 although the trend of the changes in swc between mulching treatments was similar the swc of each soil layer was different i e pfm st was higher than pfm at the 40 60 cm soil layer at 40 and 60 das and pfm was higher than pfm st at the 0 60 cm soil layer at 80 and 100 das fig 3 this finding may occur because pfm treatment increased the aboveground transpiration of maize at the early growth stage consequently water consumption increased at the 40 60 cm soil layer at the later stage of maize growth the pfm st treatment required higher moisture for plant growth as a result 0 60 cm soil moisture consumption occurred the mulching treatments produced a higher sws than the ck fig 4 pfm st enabled plants to utilize soil water from deep soil especially in dry year i e in 2020 notably sws had no significant differences between pfm st and pfm during the maize growing seasons in dry and wet years fig 4 single transparent pfm resulted in higher soil temperature figs 5 6 normally transparent plastic film absorbs limited solar radiation transmitting 85 95 of the total solar radiation to soil ham et al 2019 lamont 2005 at the 5 cm soil layer mulching treatments pfm and pfm st increased the soil temperature by 1 8 4 8 c compared with that of ck fig 5 our results were consistent with previously reported findings in maize in the loess plateau wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 the soil warming effect of mulching was greater during the early growth period and diminished when the plants grow larger and their leaves cover most of the mulch surface qin et al 2018 the daily average soil temperatures at the 0 25 cm soil layer under pfm and pfm st increased by 1 3 1 7 c and 0 8 0 9 c relative to ck in early 20 60 das and late 80 120 das growth periods of maize respectively fig 6 our results were consistent with previous findings which showed that plant canopy is sufficiently small in the early growing season of maize development such that most of the plastic film area receives solar energy which warms the topsoil zhou et al 2009 although variations in the average soil temperature were similar under two mulching treatments changes in soil temperature regulated by pfm and pfm st over the growth period had significant differences previous studies found that straw covering the soil surface reduces the solar energy reaching the soil surface keeping the soil cooling in summer and reducing the increase in soil temperature hu et al 2019 kar and kumar 2007 wang et al 2015 interestingly our results found that pfm st decreased the soil temperature by 3 0 c compared with that of pfm at the 5 cm soil layer fig 5 the daily average soil temperature at the 0 25 cm soil layer under pfm st dual mulching of transparent plastic film with straw was an average of 0 8 1 8 c lower than that under pfm transparent mulching and pfm st decreased the soil temperature by 1 3 1 8 c and 0 8 0 9 c relative to pfm in early 20 60 das and late 80 120 das growth seasons of maize in warm semi arid regions respectively fig 6 this observation was mainly because straw mulching forms a physical isolation layer on the soil surface which can effectively intercept and absorb direct solar radiation reduce effective surface radiation decrease heat exchange between soil and atmosphere and decrease soil temperature gao et al 2009 however another study has shown that straw mulching causes soil temperature to be lower than the optimum temperature for crop growth chen et al 2005 this study found that the daily average soil temperatures at 0 25 cm soil layer under pfm st was significantly higher than that of ck especially at the early stage of maize growth 20 60 das this result is different from previously published findings because of the different straw mulching methods the mulching film increased the soil temperature but the dual mulching pfm st weakened solar radiation which significantly decreased the warming effect of the mulching film the growing season of spring maize was from the end of april to the end of august when hot summer conditions prevailed thus a moderately lower soil temperature under the mulching film is conducive to plant growth the dual mulching of the transparent film with straw maintained the same sws as normal film mulching and moderately decreased the soil temperature under the mulching film for maize growth consequently seasonal drought stress and excessive daytime soil temperature stress effectively reduced however studies should determine whether low soil temperature affects the changes in soil nutrients or soil microorganisms 4 2 maize phenology plant phenology is one of the most reliable bioindicators of climate change tao et al 2008 white et al 1997 2008 in general increasing temperature results in an accelerated developmental rate and a shortened growing season yuan liu et al 2010 oteros et al 2015 tao et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 thus the duration for the acquisition of resources radiation water and nutrients shortens and crop productivity in warm environments decreases craufurd and wheeler 2009 nord and lynch 2009 pfm can greatly increase soil temperature and then markedly accelerate maize growth processes liu et al 2010b our study supported the findings of previous studies our study found that spring maize of mulch plastic matured earlier and had shorter vegetative and reproductive growth periods compared to no mulch as mulch increased soil temperature in warmer regions for example pfm advanced vegetative and reproductive growth by 4 6 and 5 7 days pfm st advanced by 1 2 days compared with that of ck table 1 pfm treatment advanced vegetative and reproductive growth by 3 4 and 4 6 days compared with that of pfm st table 1 these growth processes were delayed possibly because of soil cooling under the dual mulching of transparent film with straw compared with the transparent plastic mulch therefore pfm st treatment extended maize growth and might be more conducive to the growth and development of the roots and shoots of maize 4 3 maize growth maize growth is influenced by the transfer and absorption of different resources such as soil water and temperature during the growth season mwale et al 2007 the root system is an important organ that absorbs nutrients and water and sensitive to soil temperature previous studies revealed that the root dry weight of maize and winter rape under film mulching is significantly increased compared with that of bare land gao et al 2014 gu et al 2016 lin et al 2018 similar results were generated in our 3 year study however some studies have shown that low soil temperatures delay the root senescence of spring maize and wheat bu et al 2013 li et al 1999 and promote the root growth of winter strawberry and lettuce in greenhouses pandey et al 2015 sabri et al 2019 other researchers found that the decrease in the dry matter weight of horticultural plant roots is related to high soil temperatures gonzález et al 2009 mcmichael and burke 1998 our previous study found that a high root zone temperature is not conducive to the establishment of root morphology at the maize seedling stage xia et al 2021 this study further found that maize root dry matter weight under pfm transparent pfm was higher than that under pfm st dual mulching of transparent plastic film with straw at 40 and 60 das fig 7 possibly because of the higher soil temperature under pfm enhanced nutrient cycling in the soil fang et al 2011 accelerating root growth in early growth period however as maize grows the root matter weight of pfm st was higher than that of pfm at 80 120 das possibly because the higher soil temperature at the early stage of pfm treatment promotes the absorption of soil nutrients by maize roots resulting in the lack of soil nutrients at later stages in turn it leads to a sharp decrease in nutrients obtained by the roots in the soil at later stages bu et al 2013 and poor root growth mulching improves water availability and soil temperature leading to improved seed germination seedling establishment and maize growth which contributes to greater radiation capture by the canopy bu et al 2013 yi liu et al 2010b in the early period of maize growth mulching can significantly increase the surface soil temperature while reducing water loss thereby increasing spad and lai which may benefit from the increase in water and nutrient absorption by the roots however the spad and lais under pfm st were significantly higher than those under pfm at 80 120 das figs 8 9 these results were supported with a previous study i e the warming effect of transparent plastic film mulch shortened maize growth leading to premature senescence and worse stay green capability of leaves in later stages of maize growth bu et al 2013 qin et al 2018 this study revealed that the spad and lai of pfm st in the middle to late growing season could significantly increase compared with that of pfm treatment thereby ensuring higher aboveground dry matter accumulation of maize during later growth stages dry matter production is a key indicator of the sustainability of rainfed agriculture ceschia et al 2010 gan et al 2013a and favorable hydrothermal conditions resulting from mulching can significantly increase aboveground dry matter liu et al 2009 in the current study all two mulching treatments significantly increased the aboveground biomass compared with that of ck in 2018 2020 maize growing seasons and no significant differences were observed in aboveground dry matter between pfm st and pfm at 60 das in 2018 2020 fig 10 during 80 120 das the greatest aboveground dry matter was observed in the pfm st treatment the aboveground dry matter weight under pfm st was significantly higher than that under pfm likely because pfm st treatment promoted the growth of maize roots which would facilitate greater water and nutrient uptake these resources would then be conveyed to vegetative organs which increased crop canopy growth i e increase in spad and lai 4 4 yield wue and pue increasing productivity and stability are two of the major objectives of development for dryland farming global warming has brought great challenges to the sustainable development of agriculture especially in warm temperate regions in china previous studies showed that plastic film and straw mulching are effective methods to improve wue and yield in maize mo et al 2017 l m zhou et al 2012 wheat chen et al 2015 zhang et al 2007 and potato zhao et al 2014 in semi arid areas mulching with plastic film could reduce the interannual variation in maize yield and increase crop productivity therefore it is an attractive option for developing dryland agriculture in this study the dual mulching of plastic and maize straw pattern with the unchanged water retention function of the mulch film under global warming was used the results from the present study were similar to those of mulching treatments regardless of dual mulching of transparent film with straw or transparent film mulching table 2 the yield increased under mulching treatments especially the dual mulching of transparent film with straw however as per the findings of a previous study straw mulching effects can depend on climatic conditions and soil type acharya et al 2005 and straw mulching tends to reduce soil surface temperature which can lead to a reduction in yield edwards et al 2000 gao and li 2005 the present study observed that the maize yield under pfm st differed significantly from that under pfm in 2018 2020 and was 10 92 1171 kg ha 1 markedly higher than that of pfm table 2 a key reason is that dual mulching increased the soil temperature in relatively bare land and decreased the soil temperature compared with that of mulching with transparent film thus moderate soil warming was beneficial to maize growth but excessively high soil temperature under transparent mulching was detrimental to maize growth in some agricultural production areas with poor irrigation increasing wue and pue is a key goal of sustainable agricultural development gan et al 2013b the application of pfm can significantly increase wue and pue in some arid and semi arid regions xiaoli et al 2012 zhao et al 2014 mulching is an effective practice to increase wue and pue in maize duan et al 2020 l m zhou et al 2012 our data revealed that mulching treatments pfm and pfm st caused a higher wue and pue in 2018 2020 table 2 the main reason was that pfm can effectively limit water loss caused by soil evaporation increase canopy transpiration and promote biomass accumulation thereby increasing grain yield yi liu et al 2010a 2010b et involves soil evaporation and plant transpiration the latter is considered to be the most important component of et jasechko et al 2013 according to previous studies conducted in a semi arid environment the difference in et between mulching treatments and ck was closely related to rainfall during the crop growing season our results showed that the ets of mulching treatments in three seasons were lower than that of ck possibly because soil evaporation is greater than plant transpiration table 2 as a result the wues and pues in mulching treatments pfm and pfm st increased by 24 26 39 84 and 23 15 36 48 in three maize growth seasons compared with those in ck respectively our data revealed that mulching treatments had higher wue and pue than ck grain yield is another more important component determining the wue and pue of maize field in our study the dual mulching of transparent plastic film and straw gained the highest grain yield and hence wue and pue in 2018 2020 table 2 therefore in comparison with pfm leading to premature senescence and yield loss of maize the dual mulching of transparent plastic film and straw may act as a promising flat plot rainfed agricultural management system to improve maize yield and wue in the semi arid loess plateau china 5 conclusions our 3 year study showed that the present grain yield of rainfed mulch spring maize in the loess plateau could be further improved by optimizing agronomic practices the dual mulching of plastic film with straw was an effective practice for maintaining sws and increasing wue more importantly the pfm st cultivation practice moderately decreased average soil temperature under the film and extended the vegetative and reproductive growths of spring maize in the late growth period of spring maize the pfm st significantly increased spad lai and aboveground dry matter accumulation and improved root dry matter weight although global warming and pfm cause an increase in soil temperatures dual mulching can be applied as a promising approach to maintain sws and increase wue and spring maize grain yield in rainfed agricultural areas of the loess plateau in china however the pfm st practice should be further investigated using various crops in multiple sites and years thus this study could be used as a basis for further optimizing cultivation methods based on premature senescence reducing the yield of film mulched spring maize in rainfed agricultural areas in the loess plateau and promoting the soil water efficiency and grain yield declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

9373,the continuous monitoring of water stress will increase the accuracy of the deficit irrigation scheduling almonds are very sensitive to water stress conditions and an important water consumer recently a novel approach to the use of trunk growth rate tgr data has been proposed for olive trees these works suggested the use of tgr frequencies to evaluate water status of the trees the aim of the current work was to compare the seasonal pattern of three different indicators derived from the daily curves of trunk diameter fluctuations with midday stem water potential during three consecutive seasons 2017 2019 an irrigation experiment was carried out in a mature almond orchard cv vairo at dos hermanas seville spain four irrigation treatments replicated in four blocks were evaluated using the daily curves of midday stem water potential and trunk diameter fluctuations the different irrigation treatments were control full irrigated conditions rdi 1 irrigation scheduling based on midday stem water potential with a deficit irrigation during kernel filling values around 1 2 mpa rdi 2 similar to rdi 1 but with a more severe water stress 2 mpa and incomplete recovery after harvest due to limitation of the seasonal amount of water around 100 mm sdi sustained deficit irrigation with a seasonal applied water equal to rdi 2 trunk diameter fluctuations were measured with a wireless band dendrometer the daily curves were processed to obtain three different indicators maximum daily shrinkage mds was the difference between the daily maximum and minimum trunk growth rate tgr was the difference between two consecutive daily maximums the frequencies of several ranges of tgr were compared with the midday stem water potential weekly frequencies of values greater than 0 3 mm day 1 decreased with the reduction of midday stem water potential but the pattern changed greatly in different seasons the weekly frequency of values between 0 1 and 0 and between 0 and 0 1 mm day 1 were steadier in different seasons differences between seasons were related to growth pattern and yield keywords deficit irrigation maximum daily shrinkage midday stem water potential trunk diameter fluctuations 1 introduction almond trees prunus dulcis mill da webb are a drought resistant fruit species traditionally cultivated in rainfed conditions in semi arid zones however it has important water needs with crop coefficients kc higher than 1 goldhamer and girona 2012 the yield is extremely sensitive to water stress girona et al 2005 and associated with crown volume goldhamer and fereres 2017 those authors assume that even with an optimum regulated deficit irrigation the water consumption is significant goldhamer and fereres 2017 the competition for water resources for different uses and the increase of drought periods due to climatic change goldhamer and fereres 2017 will drive an improvement of the water management accuracy in the short term this more effective irrigation scheduling will be strongly associated with automating the decision making process in this regard the digitalization of the agricultural activity will be extremely important and will involve the development of new low cost devices and the study of threshold values for actual management at farm level this digitalization process could be supported with different types of devices all of them useful for deficit irrigation scheduling one option is the trunk diameter fluctuations tdf which allows continuous monitoring and with non invasive measurements tdf are daily curves of shrinkage and swelling which occur in all plants such cycles were reported long ago klepper et al 1971 but when continuous monitoring devices became available in the 90 s these indicators were abundantly used ortuño et al 2010 daily curves provide two main indicators namely maximum daily shrinkage mds and trunk growth rate tgr the mds daily difference between maximum and minimum values goldhamer et al 1999 is the most common indicator used for irrigation scheduling ortuño et al 2010 while the tgr difference between two daily maximums moriana and fereres 2002 is not frequently used for such scheduling mds is strongly related to the evaporative demand herzog et al 1995 but its relationship with the stem water potential swp is parabolic showing different ranges of swp in which maximum values of mds are measured ortuño et al 2010 the former implies the need of using a baseline which varies between cultivars and even throughout the cycle ortuño et al 2010 the latter was reported as the reason for mds not to be a water stress indicator in some species such as olives girón et al 2016 it was established that tgr was an early indicator of water stress peaches goldhamer et al 1999 olive moriana and fereres 2002 and it was recommended for young orchards goldhamer and fereres 2001 however tgr changes greatly in different days almond martín palomo et al 2019 and in different phenological stages plum intrigliolo and castel 2006 recently several works in olive trees suggested that the weekly frequency of different ranges of tgr were related to water stress corell et al 2020 martín palomo et al 2021 in a three year experiment water stress conditions increased the weekly frequency of tgr values lower than 0 3 mm day 1 and decreased the frequency of tgr values between 0 1 0 3 mm day 1 this frequency approach reduced the variability and was independent of the evaporative demand and phenology corell et al 2020 martín palomo et al 2021 tdf in almond trees responded to water stress in a similar way to peaches with an important increase of mds goldhamer and fereres 2001 this fruit tree is probably the first one in which a deficit irrigation scheduling based on mds was proposed goldhamer and fereres 2004 however the estimation of the baseline for the management of mds under commercial conditions was not easy this was done at the beginning of the irrigation season egea et al 2009 but some works reported changes throughout the season mainly towards the end martín palomo et al 2019 moreover several works showed that there were no differences of mds in full and deficit irrigated trees nortes et al 2005 martín palomo et al 2019 possibly because of large growth that would reduce the mds values goldhamer and fereres 2001 on the other hand the usefulness of the tgr indicator was less studied in almonds trees it was only considered in young trees with a very active growth nortes et al 2005 however the tgr values changed with the age of the orchard egea et al 2009 and throughout the season martín palomo et al 2019 the current work hypothesized that the tgr frequencies could be useful as a water stress indicator because they could reduce in some tgr ranges the effect of age or nut load the aim of this work was to establish tgr range in which frequencies could be applied and to compare it with the pattern of traditional indicators such as the mds and the tgr 2 material and methods 2 1 site description the experiment was carried out during 3 consecutive seasons from 2017 2019 in a commercial orchard located in finca la florida 37 23ºn 5 91ºw dos hermanas seville spain orchard was 7 years old at the beginning of the experiment 2017 season with a vase training system trees were 6 m x 8 m apart in the orchard with coupled rows of 2 different cultivars cv guara and vairo on gf 677 rootstock to improve the pollination process the experimental plots were a rectangle of 4 3 trees 4 rows of 3 trees each central rows were cv vairo and measurements were taken from the two central trees of both rows of cv vairo trees around these two measured ones were guard lines the experimental design consisted of randomized complete blocks with 4 repetitions of 4 irrigated treatments each block was included in 4 rows because the main soil variability was between rows blocks were located in adjacent rows the irrigation system was a single line of drips 3 4 l h 1 located 0 4 m apart irrigation scheduling was performed weekly with a remote programming device ciclon c 146 v 3 53 maher almeria spain the soil was clay loam with over 1 m depth a high percentage of carbonate higher than 30 and ph around 8 the percentage of organic matter in the 0 30 cm layer was approximately 1 6 with adequate levels of phosphorus 10 4 ppm olsen phosphorus and potassium 161 ppm ammonium acatete extractable potassium according to delgado et al 2016 fertilizers and pest management were conducted by the owner following the common practise of the zone no deficient nutrient level in foliar analysis was detected during the 3 years of the experimental period data not shown climatic data were obtained from the andalusian weather station networks ifapa los palacios station siar 2022 this station is located approximately 6 km away from the experimental orchard the seasonal pattern of potential evapotranspiration eto and rainfall is common of mediterranean conditions fig 1 during the 3 years there was a dry period from mid spring until the end of summer season when maximum eto data were measured around 7 mm day 1 the seasonal amount of rainfall was very variable and two seasons 2017 366 3 mm and 2019 237 6 mm received lower rain than the average annual precipitation rate 589 mm aemet 2022 but 2018 had higher values 667 9 mm 2 2 description of the treatments four irrigation treatments were applied during the 3 years of the experiment these treatments considered the timing and the level of water stress throughout the season three phenological stages were considered for deficit irrigation scheduling simplified from nortes et al 2009 phase i from flowering to the beginning of kernel filling commonly february to mid may phase ii from kernel filling to harvest mid may to early august phase iii postharvest early august to mid october the irrigation scheduling was applied during each treatment weekly and in the case of the rdis treatments it was different for each plot control full irrigated conditions 100 of crop evapotranspiration etc was estimated according to the recommendations for almond goldhamer and girona 2012 and only a dry period a few weeks before harvest was applied crown volume was included in etc estimation with reduction coefficient kr according to steduto et al 2012 the midday stem water potential swp was also used to determine the irrigation scheduling the swp was compared to the mccutchan and shackel 1992 baseline and irrigation was increased to 125 etc when the measured values were lower than the estimated threshold regulated deficit irrigation 1 rdi 1 this treatment and the next one rdi 2 considered the mds and the swp for irrigation scheduling during 2017 described in martín palomo et al 2019 however the approach was changed to using only the swp due to a lack of results with the mds during this first season water stress conditions were applied from kernel filling to harvest phase ii irrigation scheduling considered a threshold value of 1 15 mpa in order to avoid values lower than 1 5 mpa which have been reported as limiting to yield the rest of the season irrigation scheduling was as in control treatment regulated deficit irrigation 2 rdi 2 the period of water stress was the same as in rdi 1 but the level of water stress was more severe because this treatment had seasonal limitation of the applied water 2017 and 2018 100 mm 2019 120 mm in order to adjust this low amount of water the water stress during phase ii was increased by moving the spw threshold down to 2 mpa also the rehydration during phase iii was stopped when seasonal amount of water was reached sustained deficit irrigation sdi the same amount of water as in rdi 2 was applied but with an almost constant rate throughout the pre harvest period phase i and phase ii crown volume yield and nut load increased from the first 2017 to the third 2019 seasons in all treatments table 1 the growth pattern was the same for all treatments data not shown first crown volume increased from 2017 to 2018 season with a steady value in 2019 then yield and nut load enhanced in 2019 season while was almost equal in the two first years 2017 and 2018 these changes meant that the water applied in all treatments was increased fig 2 the seasonal water applied in control trees was significantly greater than the rest and approximately 40 was applied during pre harvest period which included phases i and ii fig 2 the opposite approach was used in the rdis and most of the water was applied during the post harvest period conversely the irrigation was concentrated during pre harvest in the sdi 2 3 measurements water stress of the trees was measured using the midday stem water potential swp and the trunk diameter fluctuations tdf swp was measured at midday using the pressure chamber technique scholander et al 1965 two leaves near the main trunk were covered with aluminium bags two hours before measurements were taken with a pressure chamber model 1000 pms usa the daily cycles of tdf were measured using a band dendrometer d6 ums germany attached to the main trunk this device works like a beam when bending these data were recorded in a datalogger and wireless network sent them to a remote destination the sensor s metallic band rested on a part of the trunk circumference and their ends were connected by a metallic invar cable an alloy of ni and fe with a thermal expansion coefficient close to zero katerji et al 1994 that encircled the trunk a teflon net below the steel prevented friction with the bark surface each band dendrometer was plugged into a node widhoc smart solution sl spain near the sensor each node consisted of two different parts one being the measurement interface and the other the processing recording and communication system the nodes generated a stabilized power supply of 10vdc to the band dendrometer the data from each sensor node were sent wirelessly to the cloud averages of ten measurements of each band dendrometer were taken every fifteen minutes two different indicators were obtained from the tdf daily curves mds was calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum daily diameter tgr was the difference between two consecutive maximum diameters several ranges of tgr were considered to compare with swp the weekly frequency of these tgr ranges were calculated and compared to different ranges of swp according to previous works in olive trees corell et al 2020 martín palomo et al 2021 the range of swp variation identified was narrower than those for olive trees several threshold were selected in order to secure very different water status garcía tejero et al 2018 suggested 1 5 mpa as the threshold value for deficit irrigation this was considered severe water stress threshold according to the leaf conductance vs swp relationship reported by shackel et al 2021 a great reduction of the leaf conductance would be expected from 1 mpa in order to obtain distinct level of water stress two different intermediate threshold were considered the first 1 15 mpa of swp similar to the ones suggest in the current work was a moderate water stress level second 0 8 mpa of swp would be more positive that the one reported by shackel et al 2021 and near to mild or even full irrigated conditions then the different ranges of swp were more positive than 0 8 mpa considered mild water stress conditions between 0 8 and 1 15 mpa considered a moderate water stress level between 1 15 and 1 5 mpa considered as an intermediate water stress and more negative than 1 5 mpa severe water stress data analyses were performed using anova and the mean separation was calculated using a tukey s test with the statistix sx program 8 0 significant differences were considered when the p level 0 05 in both tests calculations of the p level were carried out considering the f test of variance equality 3 results the pattern of midday stem water potential swp throughout the three years of the experiment was similar fig 3 before water stress period swp values were similar and only a few significant differences were found between treatments in the deficit period only control trees were near the swp baseline with several weeks between 2 and 3 weeks of reduction due to the period of drying just before harvest in all seasons control trees showed values that were significantly more positive that those in rdi 2 which presented the lowest swp of the experiment the rdi 1 and sdi were intermediate treatments most the time with no significant differences between them and the rest of treatments sdi treatment was nearer to control group during 2017 fig 3a while rdi 1 was the closest during 2019 minimum swp values of the experiment were obtained between 2 and 2 5 mpa in the control group the minimum values were recorded only in the period of one to two weeks before harvest and oscillated between 1 2 mpa 2019 fig 3c and 1 6 mpa 2018 fig 3b in the recovery period after harvest the control was the first treatment in all the seasons that reached values near the baseline rdi 1 presented a similar pattern to the control in 2018 fig 3b and 2019 fig 3c but not during 2017 when the recovery was clearly delayed fig 3a during this period significant differences were measured mainly between sdi and control rdi 1 rehydration was partial in sdi with the lowest swp values in this period rdi 2 had an initial recovery and got near the control values at the beginning of the rehydration but showed an important decrease of swp during the second part of this period only when rains occurred at the end of the experiment swp in these two treatments sdi and rdi 2 was similar to that of control fig 3a and b the maximum daily shrinkage mds pattern was similar in different treatments fig 4 mds increased until harvest with maximum values around 2 mm except in 2017 when they were greater after harvest mds sharply decreased in all treatments although significant differences were found throughout the experiment in all seasons these were small and no clear patterns between treatments occurred in 2017 fig 4a noticeable differences occurred only during the recovery and between sdi and rdi 2 the latter showing the lowest value in 2018 fig 4b the highest mds values were obtained in rdi 2 and they were significantly different to those of sdi in this season rdi 2 after harvest was considerably different from sdi which presented a similar value to control and rdi 1 in the 2019 season fig 4c most of the differences were measured during the rehydration period for the sdi and the rdi 1 the general pattern for this parameter was not clear with very small variations in all seasons only during 2019 fig 4c rdi 1 and control showed a trend to values lower than those in sdi and rdi 2 from the beginning of the water stress period fig 4c the relationship between mds and swp is presented in fig 5 and table 2 in all seasons those relationships trended to be linear fig 5 though some of them were weak or even not significant table 2 in all seasons fit of control mds presented greater slope than the rest of treatments table 2 and then greater mds at moderate water stress conditions fig 5 relationships even considering the same treatment were different between seasons table 2 the pattern of the weekly frequencies of tgr fr changed with the water stress levels considered fig 6 fr of negative tgr values was lower than the positive ones in all seasons mainly for tgr 0 1 mm day 1 left column in all water stress levels the pattern of this range of values lower than 0 1 mm day 1 was erratic with water stress fr increased significantly with more negative values of swp during 2017 fig 6a but was almost constant around 20 in 2019 fig 6c on the contrary ranges between 0 1 and 0 second left column and between 0 and 0 1 mm day 1 third left column increased significantly in all seasons from full irrigated conditions until severe water stress the range of variations of these two latter frs was similar for the different seasons the ranges of tgr between 0 1 and 0 2 fourth left column and between 0 2 and 0 3 mm day 1 fifth left column did not present a clear pattern with water stress significant changes with water stress were only found in 2018 fig 6b both and 2019 fig 6c only the greatest tgr the fr of tgr 0 3 mm day 1 presented the greatest changes with water stress with an important reduction from fully irrigated conditions to severe water stress however frs values also varied considerably depending on the season with maximum values in 2017 from full irrigation around 60 30 fig 6a and 2019 from around 20 to less than 5 fig 6c the results shown in fig 6 allow selecting several tgr ranges to compare seasonal patterns of fr with the ones of swp fig 7 shows data of fr of tgr values between 0 1 and 0 grouped according to irrigation treatment significant differences were found only in water deficit treatments and during rehydration periods during 2017 fig 7a control trees tended to show lower values than the rest of the treatments while the rest of the trees were similar only on a few dates during the rehydration period the values of rdi 2 were clearly greater than rdi 1 during 2018 fig 7b there were few significant differences during the water stress period treatments were similar although the sdi tended to values higher than the rest towards the end during rehydration differences were found at the end of the period between the rdi 1 and the rdi 2 treatments finally during 2019 fig 7c important differences were found at the end of the water stress period and at the beginning of rehydration the values of control were significantly lower than the rest and in general they tended to be lower during the water stress period in rdi 1 treatment values tended to be higher than in sdi and rdi 2 at the end of this period during the recovery the values of the sdi treatment were considerably higher than the rest also at the beginning and values of the rdi 2 treatment also tended to be greater the results for control and rdi 1 were similar in this period another range of tgr selected from fig 6 was between 0 and 0 1 mm day 1 the seasonal pattern of fr for this range during 2017 fig 8a presented considerable differences between the control trees and the rest mainly rdi 1 during the water stress and the rehydration periods rdi 1 tended to greater fr values than control almost during the entire season and mainly during rehydration when fr was near 80 sdi and rdi 2 tended to higher values than control but they were not always significant and usually stayed below the ones for rdi 1 during 2018 fig 8b the number of important differences decreased and all treatments were similar only during the water stress period sdi and for a few days control tended to higher values similarly also at the end of the rehydration period the values for the control and the rdi 1 treatments were significantly lower than sdi and rdi 2 ones during 2019 fig 8c the main differences were measured during the water stress period before this fr was similar and only in rdi 1 and on some dates the values tended to be higher in the water stress period the values in control treatment tended to be lower than the rest of treatments and rdi 1 showed the highest during rehydration the differences decreased although control tended to show the lowest values the last range of tgr values selected were higher than 0 3 mm day 1 during 2017 fig 9a the values for control treatment were clearly and significantly different from those of the rest of treatments during the water stress and the recovery periods the values for the rest of the treatments were very similar to each other in this season fr values tended to decrease with time and minimum values were found before rains the deficit irrigation treatments presented a fr almost equal to zero during the rehydration period during 2018 fig 9b there were a few significant differences only at the end of the season before rehydration fr was almost the same for all treatments during rehydration the values for rdi 1 and control treatments were significantly higher than those for sdi and rdi 2 the seasonal trend was similar to the previous season fig 9b vs 8a with maximum values near 80 around may and a continuous decrease from then on however during rehydration fr values sharply increased in control and rdi 1 treatments until frs similar to 2017 were reached during 2019 fig 9c the pattern changed and significant differences were measured only during the water stress period before the water stress values of fr were almost equal but then they decreased sharply for the deficit treatments when irrigation restrictions started in the recovery although no significant differences were found the values of control and rdi 1 tended to be higher than those of sdi and rdi 2 the seasonal pattern of continuous decrease in fr which was observed in 2017 fig 9a and 2018 fig 9b was not presented in this season dates when significant differences were found in swp and frs are included in fig 3 black stars and circles for clearer comparison swp presented more dates than frs in which significant differences were found fig 3 but frs presented differences in all the periods when swp indicated water stress in some seasons fr presented earlier dates than swp however not all frs considered were affected at the same time fig 10 shows that the differences between irrigation treatments seem to occur earlier in tgr values greater than 0 3 or between 0 and 0 1 and a few days later in the more negative ranges lower than 0 4 discussion swp was a clearer and more consistent water status measurement than tgr and mds figs 3 5 swp has been suggested as a useful tool for deficit irrigation scheduling in almond shackel 2011 in other fruit crops such as olive trees swp was also reported as more suitable tool in rdi than trunk diameter fluctuations indicators moriana et al 2010 however the possibility of continuous measurement could compensate this disadvantage mds is the most common indicator in fruit trees ortuño et al 2010 and widely suggested in almond goldhamer and fereres 2001 in the current work mds had a narrower range of variation in comparison with tgr fig 4 vs 5 though the mds vs swp relationship suggest clear differences fig 5 while some experimental conditions reported great differences in mds with water stress goldhamer and fereres 2004 others indicated that there were almost no changes martín palomo et al 2019 current data show that in three consecutive seasons mds presented a low drought sensitivity fig 4 likely related with low increase of mds with swp fig 5 the current orchard had a small canopy cover relative to the tree spacing table 1 which could suggest that the growth is an important process in the orchard goldhamer and fereres 2001 suggested that great growth could reduce mds values however mds data were quite similar between seasons figs 4 and 5 though 2017 presented greater growth than the rest table 1 the relationship between mds and swp suggested that the increase of mds was lower than expected fig 5 according to the literature goldhamer and fereres 2004 moreover control presented greater values than deficit treatments in some periods fig 4 on the other hand tgr values changed widely among days in all treatments but the pattern of these variations was related to the water stress full irrigated conditions presented a more frequent tgr greater than 0 but negative values were also measured in this treatment fig 6 this behaviour could be related with natural physiological response a similar pattern was reported in olive trees corell et al 2019 martín palomo et al 2021 part of this variability in olive trees was associated with vapour pressure deficit vpd girón et al 2016 corell et al 2019 but this relationship was not significant in the current work data not shown tgr negative values were less frequent in the current work than in olive trees fig 6 vs data of corell et al 2019 and martín palomo et al 2021 such differences would reflect the slightly greater resistance to drought of olive when compared to almond trees in these 50 of the leaf conductance reduction was reported with a water potential between 2 5 and 3 5 mpa garcía tejero et al 2018 while in olive trees the hydraulic conductivity was reduced by 50 with a water potential between 4 and 5 5 mpa díaz espejo et al 2018 positive tgr are also different in response to water stress for these two species figs 6 and 9 show that tgr values greater than 0 3 mm day 1 were the most sensitive to water stress with a sharp decrease when the swp was more negative in olive trees these values were associated to important recovery events in severe water stress conditions and increased steeply after irrigation corell et al 2019 martín palomo et al 2021 irrigation scheduling based on tgr frequencies would provide a continuous monitoring of the water status which would facilitate the deficit irrigation scheduling however variations between seasons would limit the identification of the frequencies values in full irrigated conditions figs 7 10 suggest that each range of tgr showed different physiological processes with could have different drought sensitivity values and improve the control of the water stress positive tgr values mainly greater than 0 3 mm day 1 are likely related to vegetative growth and occur at an earlier stage fig 10 the expansive growth is the most sensitive process to the water stress hsiao 1990 and it could be used to identify such conditions before swp in peaches goldhamer et al 1999 and olives moriana and fereres 2002 the trunk diameter fluctuations were earlier indicators than swp however these tgr frequencies greater than 0 3 mm day 1 were also affected by the orchard development the progressive reduction of frequencies greater than 0 3 mm day 1 in the three seasons of the experiment in fully irrigated conditions from around 60 in 2017 down to 20 in 2019 figs 6 and 9 was likely related to the increase of the crown volume from 2017 to 2018 table 1 and yield from 2018 to 2019 table 1 therefore the expected tgr frequencies of this range in mature almond orchards would be nearer the 2019 data around 20 in fully irrigated conditions fig 6 positive tgr values between 0 1 and 0 3 mm day 1 were not useful because they showed a wide variability between seasons in the frequencies and in the response to water stress fig 6 only values between 0 and 0 1 mm day 1 were more steady between 5 and 15 in full irrigated conditions and increased with the water stress until reaching fr values around 30 figs 6 and 8 this increase of frequencies in this range from 0 to 0 1 mm day 1 as a response to water stress was caused by the reduction of the highest tgr on the other hand the most negative tgr values lower than 0 1 mm day 1 were very variable with water stress in 2017 fig 6a but almost constant in 2019 fig 6c such tgr values could be related to water stress in conditions of low yield 2017 season but they would be associated also to a significant number of nuts 2019 season table 1 in other species high yield promoted the increase of photosynthesis and then leaf transpiration and their effects have been reported in other species as more negative swp i e hazelnut marsal et al 1997 peaches marsal et al 2006 olives martín vertedor et al 2011 tgr values between 0 1 and 0 mm day 1 presented a better seasonal pattern and water stress response in all seasons frequencies values were similar around 5 in full irrigated conditions and increased significantly until reaching values higher than 20 figs 6 and 7 such range of tgr would be more specifically related to the process of dehydration all negative tgr values implied a decrease in the water content of the bark phloem and cambial tissues brough et al 1986 simonneau et al 1993 but were affected by different physiological processes in each range mainly nut load irrigation scheduling protocols could include some of these frs to obtain a more accurate monitoring of water status deficit irrigation could be associated with change in frs of the range 0 3 mm day 1 between 0 and 0 1 mm day 1 and 0 1 0 mm day 1 the use of those ranges would decrease the uncertainty of water stress identification martín palomo et al 2021 suggested a similar approach in olive trees using a different range of tgr however the great changes of frs between seasons in the current work suppose still limited approach and more data for verifying threshold frs would be needed 5 conclusions swp was the best indicator for describing almond water status water stress conditions significantly affected trunk diameter fluctuation indicators but less so for mds than tgr positive and negative values of tgr were measured in all water status conditions but the weekly frequency of each range differed frequency of positive tgr values were more effective earlier indicators of water stress than negative values the former was associated with an expansive growth while the latter was related to dehydration processes both extreme ranges 0 3 mm day 1 and 0 1 mm day 1 were affected by inter season changes in tree size and productive level of the orchard only the intermediate tgr ranges between 0 1 and 0 and between 0 and 0 1 mm day 1 presented more steady frequencies for the different seasons frequencies of these ranges of tgr described water status of almond trees but more seasons are necessary to confirm their usefulness and to include in a continuum irrigation approach declaration of

9373,the continuous monitoring of water stress will increase the accuracy of the deficit irrigation scheduling almonds are very sensitive to water stress conditions and an important water consumer recently a novel approach to the use of trunk growth rate tgr data has been proposed for olive trees these works suggested the use of tgr frequencies to evaluate water status of the trees the aim of the current work was to compare the seasonal pattern of three different indicators derived from the daily curves of trunk diameter fluctuations with midday stem water potential during three consecutive seasons 2017 2019 an irrigation experiment was carried out in a mature almond orchard cv vairo at dos hermanas seville spain four irrigation treatments replicated in four blocks were evaluated using the daily curves of midday stem water potential and trunk diameter fluctuations the different irrigation treatments were control full irrigated conditions rdi 1 irrigation scheduling based on midday stem water potential with a deficit irrigation during kernel filling values around 1 2 mpa rdi 2 similar to rdi 1 but with a more severe water stress 2 mpa and incomplete recovery after harvest due to limitation of the seasonal amount of water around 100 mm sdi sustained deficit irrigation with a seasonal applied water equal to rdi 2 trunk diameter fluctuations were measured with a wireless band dendrometer the daily curves were processed to obtain three different indicators maximum daily shrinkage mds was the difference between the daily maximum and minimum trunk growth rate tgr was the difference between two consecutive daily maximums the frequencies of several ranges of tgr were compared with the midday stem water potential weekly frequencies of values greater than 0 3 mm day 1 decreased with the reduction of midday stem water potential but the pattern changed greatly in different seasons the weekly frequency of values between 0 1 and 0 and between 0 and 0 1 mm day 1 were steadier in different seasons differences between seasons were related to growth pattern and yield keywords deficit irrigation maximum daily shrinkage midday stem water potential trunk diameter fluctuations 1 introduction almond trees prunus dulcis mill da webb are a drought resistant fruit species traditionally cultivated in rainfed conditions in semi arid zones however it has important water needs with crop coefficients kc higher than 1 goldhamer and girona 2012 the yield is extremely sensitive to water stress girona et al 2005 and associated with crown volume goldhamer and fereres 2017 those authors assume that even with an optimum regulated deficit irrigation the water consumption is significant goldhamer and fereres 2017 the competition for water resources for different uses and the increase of drought periods due to climatic change goldhamer and fereres 2017 will drive an improvement of the water management accuracy in the short term this more effective irrigation scheduling will be strongly associated with automating the decision making process in this regard the digitalization of the agricultural activity will be extremely important and will involve the development of new low cost devices and the study of threshold values for actual management at farm level this digitalization process could be supported with different types of devices all of them useful for deficit irrigation scheduling one option is the trunk diameter fluctuations tdf which allows continuous monitoring and with non invasive measurements tdf are daily curves of shrinkage and swelling which occur in all plants such cycles were reported long ago klepper et al 1971 but when continuous monitoring devices became available in the 90 s these indicators were abundantly used ortuño et al 2010 daily curves provide two main indicators namely maximum daily shrinkage mds and trunk growth rate tgr the mds daily difference between maximum and minimum values goldhamer et al 1999 is the most common indicator used for irrigation scheduling ortuño et al 2010 while the tgr difference between two daily maximums moriana and fereres 2002 is not frequently used for such scheduling mds is strongly related to the evaporative demand herzog et al 1995 but its relationship with the stem water potential swp is parabolic showing different ranges of swp in which maximum values of mds are measured ortuño et al 2010 the former implies the need of using a baseline which varies between cultivars and even throughout the cycle ortuño et al 2010 the latter was reported as the reason for mds not to be a water stress indicator in some species such as olives girón et al 2016 it was established that tgr was an early indicator of water stress peaches goldhamer et al 1999 olive moriana and fereres 2002 and it was recommended for young orchards goldhamer and fereres 2001 however tgr changes greatly in different days almond martín palomo et al 2019 and in different phenological stages plum intrigliolo and castel 2006 recently several works in olive trees suggested that the weekly frequency of different ranges of tgr were related to water stress corell et al 2020 martín palomo et al 2021 in a three year experiment water stress conditions increased the weekly frequency of tgr values lower than 0 3 mm day 1 and decreased the frequency of tgr values between 0 1 0 3 mm day 1 this frequency approach reduced the variability and was independent of the evaporative demand and phenology corell et al 2020 martín palomo et al 2021 tdf in almond trees responded to water stress in a similar way to peaches with an important increase of mds goldhamer and fereres 2001 this fruit tree is probably the first one in which a deficit irrigation scheduling based on mds was proposed goldhamer and fereres 2004 however the estimation of the baseline for the management of mds under commercial conditions was not easy this was done at the beginning of the irrigation season egea et al 2009 but some works reported changes throughout the season mainly towards the end martín palomo et al 2019 moreover several works showed that there were no differences of mds in full and deficit irrigated trees nortes et al 2005 martín palomo et al 2019 possibly because of large growth that would reduce the mds values goldhamer and fereres 2001 on the other hand the usefulness of the tgr indicator was less studied in almonds trees it was only considered in young trees with a very active growth nortes et al 2005 however the tgr values changed with the age of the orchard egea et al 2009 and throughout the season martín palomo et al 2019 the current work hypothesized that the tgr frequencies could be useful as a water stress indicator because they could reduce in some tgr ranges the effect of age or nut load the aim of this work was to establish tgr range in which frequencies could be applied and to compare it with the pattern of traditional indicators such as the mds and the tgr 2 material and methods 2 1 site description the experiment was carried out during 3 consecutive seasons from 2017 2019 in a commercial orchard located in finca la florida 37 23ºn 5 91ºw dos hermanas seville spain orchard was 7 years old at the beginning of the experiment 2017 season with a vase training system trees were 6 m x 8 m apart in the orchard with coupled rows of 2 different cultivars cv guara and vairo on gf 677 rootstock to improve the pollination process the experimental plots were a rectangle of 4 3 trees 4 rows of 3 trees each central rows were cv vairo and measurements were taken from the two central trees of both rows of cv vairo trees around these two measured ones were guard lines the experimental design consisted of randomized complete blocks with 4 repetitions of 4 irrigated treatments each block was included in 4 rows because the main soil variability was between rows blocks were located in adjacent rows the irrigation system was a single line of drips 3 4 l h 1 located 0 4 m apart irrigation scheduling was performed weekly with a remote programming device ciclon c 146 v 3 53 maher almeria spain the soil was clay loam with over 1 m depth a high percentage of carbonate higher than 30 and ph around 8 the percentage of organic matter in the 0 30 cm layer was approximately 1 6 with adequate levels of phosphorus 10 4 ppm olsen phosphorus and potassium 161 ppm ammonium acatete extractable potassium according to delgado et al 2016 fertilizers and pest management were conducted by the owner following the common practise of the zone no deficient nutrient level in foliar analysis was detected during the 3 years of the experimental period data not shown climatic data were obtained from the andalusian weather station networks ifapa los palacios station siar 2022 this station is located approximately 6 km away from the experimental orchard the seasonal pattern of potential evapotranspiration eto and rainfall is common of mediterranean conditions fig 1 during the 3 years there was a dry period from mid spring until the end of summer season when maximum eto data were measured around 7 mm day 1 the seasonal amount of rainfall was very variable and two seasons 2017 366 3 mm and 2019 237 6 mm received lower rain than the average annual precipitation rate 589 mm aemet 2022 but 2018 had higher values 667 9 mm 2 2 description of the treatments four irrigation treatments were applied during the 3 years of the experiment these treatments considered the timing and the level of water stress throughout the season three phenological stages were considered for deficit irrigation scheduling simplified from nortes et al 2009 phase i from flowering to the beginning of kernel filling commonly february to mid may phase ii from kernel filling to harvest mid may to early august phase iii postharvest early august to mid october the irrigation scheduling was applied during each treatment weekly and in the case of the rdis treatments it was different for each plot control full irrigated conditions 100 of crop evapotranspiration etc was estimated according to the recommendations for almond goldhamer and girona 2012 and only a dry period a few weeks before harvest was applied crown volume was included in etc estimation with reduction coefficient kr according to steduto et al 2012 the midday stem water potential swp was also used to determine the irrigation scheduling the swp was compared to the mccutchan and shackel 1992 baseline and irrigation was increased to 125 etc when the measured values were lower than the estimated threshold regulated deficit irrigation 1 rdi 1 this treatment and the next one rdi 2 considered the mds and the swp for irrigation scheduling during 2017 described in martín palomo et al 2019 however the approach was changed to using only the swp due to a lack of results with the mds during this first season water stress conditions were applied from kernel filling to harvest phase ii irrigation scheduling considered a threshold value of 1 15 mpa in order to avoid values lower than 1 5 mpa which have been reported as limiting to yield the rest of the season irrigation scheduling was as in control treatment regulated deficit irrigation 2 rdi 2 the period of water stress was the same as in rdi 1 but the level of water stress was more severe because this treatment had seasonal limitation of the applied water 2017 and 2018 100 mm 2019 120 mm in order to adjust this low amount of water the water stress during phase ii was increased by moving the spw threshold down to 2 mpa also the rehydration during phase iii was stopped when seasonal amount of water was reached sustained deficit irrigation sdi the same amount of water as in rdi 2 was applied but with an almost constant rate throughout the pre harvest period phase i and phase ii crown volume yield and nut load increased from the first 2017 to the third 2019 seasons in all treatments table 1 the growth pattern was the same for all treatments data not shown first crown volume increased from 2017 to 2018 season with a steady value in 2019 then yield and nut load enhanced in 2019 season while was almost equal in the two first years 2017 and 2018 these changes meant that the water applied in all treatments was increased fig 2 the seasonal water applied in control trees was significantly greater than the rest and approximately 40 was applied during pre harvest period which included phases i and ii fig 2 the opposite approach was used in the rdis and most of the water was applied during the post harvest period conversely the irrigation was concentrated during pre harvest in the sdi 2 3 measurements water stress of the trees was measured using the midday stem water potential swp and the trunk diameter fluctuations tdf swp was measured at midday using the pressure chamber technique scholander et al 1965 two leaves near the main trunk were covered with aluminium bags two hours before measurements were taken with a pressure chamber model 1000 pms usa the daily cycles of tdf were measured using a band dendrometer d6 ums germany attached to the main trunk this device works like a beam when bending these data were recorded in a datalogger and wireless network sent them to a remote destination the sensor s metallic band rested on a part of the trunk circumference and their ends were connected by a metallic invar cable an alloy of ni and fe with a thermal expansion coefficient close to zero katerji et al 1994 that encircled the trunk a teflon net below the steel prevented friction with the bark surface each band dendrometer was plugged into a node widhoc smart solution sl spain near the sensor each node consisted of two different parts one being the measurement interface and the other the processing recording and communication system the nodes generated a stabilized power supply of 10vdc to the band dendrometer the data from each sensor node were sent wirelessly to the cloud averages of ten measurements of each band dendrometer were taken every fifteen minutes two different indicators were obtained from the tdf daily curves mds was calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum daily diameter tgr was the difference between two consecutive maximum diameters several ranges of tgr were considered to compare with swp the weekly frequency of these tgr ranges were calculated and compared to different ranges of swp according to previous works in olive trees corell et al 2020 martín palomo et al 2021 the range of swp variation identified was narrower than those for olive trees several threshold were selected in order to secure very different water status garcía tejero et al 2018 suggested 1 5 mpa as the threshold value for deficit irrigation this was considered severe water stress threshold according to the leaf conductance vs swp relationship reported by shackel et al 2021 a great reduction of the leaf conductance would be expected from 1 mpa in order to obtain distinct level of water stress two different intermediate threshold were considered the first 1 15 mpa of swp similar to the ones suggest in the current work was a moderate water stress level second 0 8 mpa of swp would be more positive that the one reported by shackel et al 2021 and near to mild or even full irrigated conditions then the different ranges of swp were more positive than 0 8 mpa considered mild water stress conditions between 0 8 and 1 15 mpa considered a moderate water stress level between 1 15 and 1 5 mpa considered as an intermediate water stress and more negative than 1 5 mpa severe water stress data analyses were performed using anova and the mean separation was calculated using a tukey s test with the statistix sx program 8 0 significant differences were considered when the p level 0 05 in both tests calculations of the p level were carried out considering the f test of variance equality 3 results the pattern of midday stem water potential swp throughout the three years of the experiment was similar fig 3 before water stress period swp values were similar and only a few significant differences were found between treatments in the deficit period only control trees were near the swp baseline with several weeks between 2 and 3 weeks of reduction due to the period of drying just before harvest in all seasons control trees showed values that were significantly more positive that those in rdi 2 which presented the lowest swp of the experiment the rdi 1 and sdi were intermediate treatments most the time with no significant differences between them and the rest of treatments sdi treatment was nearer to control group during 2017 fig 3a while rdi 1 was the closest during 2019 minimum swp values of the experiment were obtained between 2 and 2 5 mpa in the control group the minimum values were recorded only in the period of one to two weeks before harvest and oscillated between 1 2 mpa 2019 fig 3c and 1 6 mpa 2018 fig 3b in the recovery period after harvest the control was the first treatment in all the seasons that reached values near the baseline rdi 1 presented a similar pattern to the control in 2018 fig 3b and 2019 fig 3c but not during 2017 when the recovery was clearly delayed fig 3a during this period significant differences were measured mainly between sdi and control rdi 1 rehydration was partial in sdi with the lowest swp values in this period rdi 2 had an initial recovery and got near the control values at the beginning of the rehydration but showed an important decrease of swp during the second part of this period only when rains occurred at the end of the experiment swp in these two treatments sdi and rdi 2 was similar to that of control fig 3a and b the maximum daily shrinkage mds pattern was similar in different treatments fig 4 mds increased until harvest with maximum values around 2 mm except in 2017 when they were greater after harvest mds sharply decreased in all treatments although significant differences were found throughout the experiment in all seasons these were small and no clear patterns between treatments occurred in 2017 fig 4a noticeable differences occurred only during the recovery and between sdi and rdi 2 the latter showing the lowest value in 2018 fig 4b the highest mds values were obtained in rdi 2 and they were significantly different to those of sdi in this season rdi 2 after harvest was considerably different from sdi which presented a similar value to control and rdi 1 in the 2019 season fig 4c most of the differences were measured during the rehydration period for the sdi and the rdi 1 the general pattern for this parameter was not clear with very small variations in all seasons only during 2019 fig 4c rdi 1 and control showed a trend to values lower than those in sdi and rdi 2 from the beginning of the water stress period fig 4c the relationship between mds and swp is presented in fig 5 and table 2 in all seasons those relationships trended to be linear fig 5 though some of them were weak or even not significant table 2 in all seasons fit of control mds presented greater slope than the rest of treatments table 2 and then greater mds at moderate water stress conditions fig 5 relationships even considering the same treatment were different between seasons table 2 the pattern of the weekly frequencies of tgr fr changed with the water stress levels considered fig 6 fr of negative tgr values was lower than the positive ones in all seasons mainly for tgr 0 1 mm day 1 left column in all water stress levels the pattern of this range of values lower than 0 1 mm day 1 was erratic with water stress fr increased significantly with more negative values of swp during 2017 fig 6a but was almost constant around 20 in 2019 fig 6c on the contrary ranges between 0 1 and 0 second left column and between 0 and 0 1 mm day 1 third left column increased significantly in all seasons from full irrigated conditions until severe water stress the range of variations of these two latter frs was similar for the different seasons the ranges of tgr between 0 1 and 0 2 fourth left column and between 0 2 and 0 3 mm day 1 fifth left column did not present a clear pattern with water stress significant changes with water stress were only found in 2018 fig 6b both and 2019 fig 6c only the greatest tgr the fr of tgr 0 3 mm day 1 presented the greatest changes with water stress with an important reduction from fully irrigated conditions to severe water stress however frs values also varied considerably depending on the season with maximum values in 2017 from full irrigation around 60 30 fig 6a and 2019 from around 20 to less than 5 fig 6c the results shown in fig 6 allow selecting several tgr ranges to compare seasonal patterns of fr with the ones of swp fig 7 shows data of fr of tgr values between 0 1 and 0 grouped according to irrigation treatment significant differences were found only in water deficit treatments and during rehydration periods during 2017 fig 7a control trees tended to show lower values than the rest of the treatments while the rest of the trees were similar only on a few dates during the rehydration period the values of rdi 2 were clearly greater than rdi 1 during 2018 fig 7b there were few significant differences during the water stress period treatments were similar although the sdi tended to values higher than the rest towards the end during rehydration differences were found at the end of the period between the rdi 1 and the rdi 2 treatments finally during 2019 fig 7c important differences were found at the end of the water stress period and at the beginning of rehydration the values of control were significantly lower than the rest and in general they tended to be lower during the water stress period in rdi 1 treatment values tended to be higher than in sdi and rdi 2 at the end of this period during the recovery the values of the sdi treatment were considerably higher than the rest also at the beginning and values of the rdi 2 treatment also tended to be greater the results for control and rdi 1 were similar in this period another range of tgr selected from fig 6 was between 0 and 0 1 mm day 1 the seasonal pattern of fr for this range during 2017 fig 8a presented considerable differences between the control trees and the rest mainly rdi 1 during the water stress and the rehydration periods rdi 1 tended to greater fr values than control almost during the entire season and mainly during rehydration when fr was near 80 sdi and rdi 2 tended to higher values than control but they were not always significant and usually stayed below the ones for rdi 1 during 2018 fig 8b the number of important differences decreased and all treatments were similar only during the water stress period sdi and for a few days control tended to higher values similarly also at the end of the rehydration period the values for the control and the rdi 1 treatments were significantly lower than sdi and rdi 2 ones during 2019 fig 8c the main differences were measured during the water stress period before this fr was similar and only in rdi 1 and on some dates the values tended to be higher in the water stress period the values in control treatment tended to be lower than the rest of treatments and rdi 1 showed the highest during rehydration the differences decreased although control tended to show the lowest values the last range of tgr values selected were higher than 0 3 mm day 1 during 2017 fig 9a the values for control treatment were clearly and significantly different from those of the rest of treatments during the water stress and the recovery periods the values for the rest of the treatments were very similar to each other in this season fr values tended to decrease with time and minimum values were found before rains the deficit irrigation treatments presented a fr almost equal to zero during the rehydration period during 2018 fig 9b there were a few significant differences only at the end of the season before rehydration fr was almost the same for all treatments during rehydration the values for rdi 1 and control treatments were significantly higher than those for sdi and rdi 2 the seasonal trend was similar to the previous season fig 9b vs 8a with maximum values near 80 around may and a continuous decrease from then on however during rehydration fr values sharply increased in control and rdi 1 treatments until frs similar to 2017 were reached during 2019 fig 9c the pattern changed and significant differences were measured only during the water stress period before the water stress values of fr were almost equal but then they decreased sharply for the deficit treatments when irrigation restrictions started in the recovery although no significant differences were found the values of control and rdi 1 tended to be higher than those of sdi and rdi 2 the seasonal pattern of continuous decrease in fr which was observed in 2017 fig 9a and 2018 fig 9b was not presented in this season dates when significant differences were found in swp and frs are included in fig 3 black stars and circles for clearer comparison swp presented more dates than frs in which significant differences were found fig 3 but frs presented differences in all the periods when swp indicated water stress in some seasons fr presented earlier dates than swp however not all frs considered were affected at the same time fig 10 shows that the differences between irrigation treatments seem to occur earlier in tgr values greater than 0 3 or between 0 and 0 1 and a few days later in the more negative ranges lower than 0 4 discussion swp was a clearer and more consistent water status measurement than tgr and mds figs 3 5 swp has been suggested as a useful tool for deficit irrigation scheduling in almond shackel 2011 in other fruit crops such as olive trees swp was also reported as more suitable tool in rdi than trunk diameter fluctuations indicators moriana et al 2010 however the possibility of continuous measurement could compensate this disadvantage mds is the most common indicator in fruit trees ortuño et al 2010 and widely suggested in almond goldhamer and fereres 2001 in the current work mds had a narrower range of variation in comparison with tgr fig 4 vs 5 though the mds vs swp relationship suggest clear differences fig 5 while some experimental conditions reported great differences in mds with water stress goldhamer and fereres 2004 others indicated that there were almost no changes martín palomo et al 2019 current data show that in three consecutive seasons mds presented a low drought sensitivity fig 4 likely related with low increase of mds with swp fig 5 the current orchard had a small canopy cover relative to the tree spacing table 1 which could suggest that the growth is an important process in the orchard goldhamer and fereres 2001 suggested that great growth could reduce mds values however mds data were quite similar between seasons figs 4 and 5 though 2017 presented greater growth than the rest table 1 the relationship between mds and swp suggested that the increase of mds was lower than expected fig 5 according to the literature goldhamer and fereres 2004 moreover control presented greater values than deficit treatments in some periods fig 4 on the other hand tgr values changed widely among days in all treatments but the pattern of these variations was related to the water stress full irrigated conditions presented a more frequent tgr greater than 0 but negative values were also measured in this treatment fig 6 this behaviour could be related with natural physiological response a similar pattern was reported in olive trees corell et al 2019 martín palomo et al 2021 part of this variability in olive trees was associated with vapour pressure deficit vpd girón et al 2016 corell et al 2019 but this relationship was not significant in the current work data not shown tgr negative values were less frequent in the current work than in olive trees fig 6 vs data of corell et al 2019 and martín palomo et al 2021 such differences would reflect the slightly greater resistance to drought of olive when compared to almond trees in these 50 of the leaf conductance reduction was reported with a water potential between 2 5 and 3 5 mpa garcía tejero et al 2018 while in olive trees the hydraulic conductivity was reduced by 50 with a water potential between 4 and 5 5 mpa díaz espejo et al 2018 positive tgr are also different in response to water stress for these two species figs 6 and 9 show that tgr values greater than 0 3 mm day 1 were the most sensitive to water stress with a sharp decrease when the swp was more negative in olive trees these values were associated to important recovery events in severe water stress conditions and increased steeply after irrigation corell et al 2019 martín palomo et al 2021 irrigation scheduling based on tgr frequencies would provide a continuous monitoring of the water status which would facilitate the deficit irrigation scheduling however variations between seasons would limit the identification of the frequencies values in full irrigated conditions figs 7 10 suggest that each range of tgr showed different physiological processes with could have different drought sensitivity values and improve the control of the water stress positive tgr values mainly greater than 0 3 mm day 1 are likely related to vegetative growth and occur at an earlier stage fig 10 the expansive growth is the most sensitive process to the water stress hsiao 1990 and it could be used to identify such conditions before swp in peaches goldhamer et al 1999 and olives moriana and fereres 2002 the trunk diameter fluctuations were earlier indicators than swp however these tgr frequencies greater than 0 3 mm day 1 were also affected by the orchard development the progressive reduction of frequencies greater than 0 3 mm day 1 in the three seasons of the experiment in fully irrigated conditions from around 60 in 2017 down to 20 in 2019 figs 6 and 9 was likely related to the increase of the crown volume from 2017 to 2018 table 1 and yield from 2018 to 2019 table 1 therefore the expected tgr frequencies of this range in mature almond orchards would be nearer the 2019 data around 20 in fully irrigated conditions fig 6 positive tgr values between 0 1 and 0 3 mm day 1 were not useful because they showed a wide variability between seasons in the frequencies and in the response to water stress fig 6 only values between 0 and 0 1 mm day 1 were more steady between 5 and 15 in full irrigated conditions and increased with the water stress until reaching fr values around 30 figs 6 and 8 this increase of frequencies in this range from 0 to 0 1 mm day 1 as a response to water stress was caused by the reduction of the highest tgr on the other hand the most negative tgr values lower than 0 1 mm day 1 were very variable with water stress in 2017 fig 6a but almost constant in 2019 fig 6c such tgr values could be related to water stress in conditions of low yield 2017 season but they would be associated also to a significant number of nuts 2019 season table 1 in other species high yield promoted the increase of photosynthesis and then leaf transpiration and their effects have been reported in other species as more negative swp i e hazelnut marsal et al 1997 peaches marsal et al 2006 olives martín vertedor et al 2011 tgr values between 0 1 and 0 mm day 1 presented a better seasonal pattern and water stress response in all seasons frequencies values were similar around 5 in full irrigated conditions and increased significantly until reaching values higher than 20 figs 6 and 7 such range of tgr would be more specifically related to the process of dehydration all negative tgr values implied a decrease in the water content of the bark phloem and cambial tissues brough et al 1986 simonneau et al 1993 but were affected by different physiological processes in each range mainly nut load irrigation scheduling protocols could include some of these frs to obtain a more accurate monitoring of water status deficit irrigation could be associated with change in frs of the range 0 3 mm day 1 between 0 and 0 1 mm day 1 and 0 1 0 mm day 1 the use of those ranges would decrease the uncertainty of water stress identification martín palomo et al 2021 suggested a similar approach in olive trees using a different range of tgr however the great changes of frs between seasons in the current work suppose still limited approach and more data for verifying threshold frs would be needed 5 conclusions swp was the best indicator for describing almond water status water stress conditions significantly affected trunk diameter fluctuation indicators but less so for mds than tgr positive and negative values of tgr were measured in all water status conditions but the weekly frequency of each range differed frequency of positive tgr values were more effective earlier indicators of water stress than negative values the former was associated with an expansive growth while the latter was related to dehydration processes both extreme ranges 0 3 mm day 1 and 0 1 mm day 1 were affected by inter season changes in tree size and productive level of the orchard only the intermediate tgr ranges between 0 1 and 0 and between 0 and 0 1 mm day 1 presented more steady frequencies for the different seasons frequencies of these ranges of tgr described water status of almond trees but more seasons are necessary to confirm their usefulness and to include in a continuum irrigation approach declaration of

9374,a pot experiment with two potassium k levels 0 15 k and 0 k g k2o kg 1 soil and two irrigation regimes well watered ww and water deficit wd imposed on two rice genotypes drought sensitive cr and drought resistant wdr was conducted to explore the effects of k deficiency on water use efficiency leaf water status osmotic adjustment gas exchange traits and stomatal characteristics of rice under water deficit the results showed that k deficiency broke water balance of plants under deficit irrigation by reducing relative water content and water potential of leaf thereby limited water deficit tolerance of both rice genotypes in addition k deficiency resulted in a reduction in stomatal area and conductance which aggravated the negative impact of water deficit on leaf gas exchange thereby reduced grain yield and water use efficiency of rice it should be noted that sufficient k is an important prerequisite for wdr to show water deficit tolerance the decrease of leaf water potential and stomatal area was the main reason for the limited water deficit tolerance of wdr caused by k deficiency our results indicated that k plays an important role in maintaining water deficit tolerance of rice which provides scientific basis for the breeding of drought resistant genotypes and management of water and k in paddy fields keywords potassium drought resistance water use efficiency leaf water

water consuming crop in china compared with other cereal crops rice plantings often require higher water inputs pimentel et al 2004 carrijo et al 2017 agricultural water use accounts for 70 of total water use in china and rice production accounts for 70 of agricultural water use zhang 2007 xiong et al 2010 however with the increasing scarcity of global water resources water for rice field irrigation has become increasingly scarce mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 water deficit reduces photosynthetic capacity causes oxidative damage to chloroplasts limits metabolic reactions and reduces dry

these facts in mind the specific objective of this study was to evaluate the importance of k for different drought tolerant genotypes with a particular focus on leaf water status gas exchange traits

consisted of two k levels 0 15 k and 0 k g k2o kg 1 soil with two irrigation regimes well watered ww and water deficit wd imposed on two rice genotypes drought sensitive cr and drought resistant wdr the experiment had 8 treatments with 6 pots per treatment for a total of 48 pots in ww treatment soil water remained above 80 θf controlled by weighing method and the soil surface water layer not exceeding 50 mm the wd treatment received supplementary irrigation at the same times as the ww irrigation regime but the irrigation amount was 50 of that applied to ww supplemental irrigation was applied when there no visible water layer in ww treatment in addition when the soil water status of any treatment of the four treatments k cr k wdr k cr and k wdr had half of the pots under ww was close to 80 θf irrigation was also supplemented to ensure that the plants were not suffer from water deficit when the soil surface water layer of any treatment of the four treatments had half of the pots under ww had reached 50 mm then irrigation ended the maximum irrigation volume per time was no more than 50 mm all pots in ww treatment were weighted according to weighing method liu et al 2021 every day around 18 00 to determine plant water status and guide the irrigation both irrigation regimes received supplementary irrigation simultaneously a 1000 ml precision 10 ml graduated cylinder

23 transplanted on july 9 and the greening period was from july 9 to 16 controlled irrigation was started on july 26 and ended on october 12 and harvested on october 22 the rice seeds were soaked to accelerate germination and then cultivated in soil three seedlings of similar size were selected and moved to a pot when the seedlings had three leaves a 3 5 cm water layer was left in each pot during the regreening period the soil surface of more than half of the pots treated with ww was no visible water layer 17 d after transplanting at this time two irrigation regimes were started to control water until 10 d before harvest overall post transplant trials lasted a total of 105 d with controlled irrigation for a total of 78 d pests and diseases were controlled with chemical pesticides 2 3 sampling and measurements the measurement of agronomic and physiological parameters was done at the booting stage september 11 25 and each sampling was carried out on the day of irrigation before irrigation on the current day two days after the last irrigation after transplanting 66 d from 11 00 13 00 on a sunny day four fully expanded canopy leaves from three rice plants were harvested and brought back indoors to measure fresh weight leaf area was measured with li 3100 c li cor usa leaves were then completely immersed in water for 24 h and filter paper was used to blot excess moisture from the leaf surface before obtaining the water absorption weight leaves were dried in a 60 oven to a constant weight the leaf water content n 4 relative water content n 4 and leaf mass per area lma n 4 were calculated as water content w1 w3 w1 100 relative water content w1 w3 w2 w3 100 lma w3 s1 where w1 w2 and w3 are leaf fresh weight g water absorption weight g and dry weight g respectively lma is leaf mass per area s1 is the area of the leaf used to calculate leaf mass per area meanwhile eight fully expanded leaves from the same three rice plants were used to measure leaf free water

transplanting anthrone zhou 2000 was used to determine the soluble sugar concentration fresh rice leaf 0 1 g was weighed into a 10 ml centrifuge tube 5 ml 80 ethanol was added and the mixture was extracted in a water bath at 80 c for 30 min after centrifugation at 6000 r 3940 g for 5 min the supernatant was transferred to a 100 ml volumetric flask the extraction was repeated three times 10 min each for the second and third extractions the three supernatants were combined and distilled water was added to make up the volume anthrone reagent was added to the supernatants and the absorbance was measured at 620 nm after 20 min of color development sulfosalicylic acid zhou 2000 was used to determine the proline content at the booting stage we weighed 0 3 g of chopped and mixed fresh rice leaf from which the main veins had been removed and placed the leaf in a tube with 5 ml 3 sulfosalicylic acid capped tubes were placed in a boiling water bath for 10 min 2 ml extract was removed and combined with 2 ml glacial acetic acid and 3 ml acid ninhydrin the mixture was placed in a boiling water bath for 1 h and the solution became red after cooling 4 ml toluene was added to each tube and the tubes were oscillated for 30 s the tubes were allowed to stand for a while before gently absorbing the upper red proline layer and measuring its absorbance at 520 nm after leaf area measurement three leaves were placed into a plastic bag and sealed at low temperature then used for wax extraction wax was extracted by the heating method using chloroform as the solvent broun et al 2004 before wax extraction petri dishes were washed and dried placed at room temperature and numbered after temperature equilibration their weights were measured with an electronic balance precision 0 01 mg large and small stainless steel mesh covers for wax extraction were placed in each weighed petri dish with the large one underneath the leaves were cut into 3 cm pieces and placed on the large cover the small cover was pressed onto the leaves and 30 ml of chloroform at 60 was poured into the petri dish after 30 s the two mesh covers were lifted out along with all the leaves the leaf material was discarded and the waxy chloroform could completely evaporate and dry the petri dishes were weighed again with the electronic balance thus leaf cuticular wax content was calculated as leaf cuticular

which was more pronounced at k table 2 despite the relative water content of wdr was higher than that of cr under wd but was significant only when plants at k k deficiency resulted in a reduction in relative water content in both genotypes and both under ww and wd it showed that k plays an important role in maintaining the water balance of plants under water deficit compared with ww the free

in a reduction in bound water content in both genotypes and both under ww and wd which was more pronounced at wd the lower of free water content was the main reason for the reduction of leaf water

drought resistance rice genotypes differ in their tolerance of water deficit shankar et al 2016 and we tested two rice genotypes drought sensitive cr and drought resistant wdr to explore the effects of k deficiency on water use efficiency leaf water status osmotic adjustment gas exchange traits and stomatal characteristics of rice under water deficit the results of this study showed that k application improved the water deficit tolerance of rice zain et al 2014 and played an important role in the drought resistance of wdr despite wdr has higher water use efficiency compared to cr whereas k deficiency limited the ability of wdr to use water efficiently fig 2b under water deficit rice accumulates large amounts of osmotic adjustment substances such as soluble sugar proline and k to improve cellular water retention capacity and adapt to water deficit conditions xiong et al 2012 y wang et al 2013 m wang et al 2013 dien et al 2019 in this study k promoted the accumulation of soluble sugar in rice leaves to alleviate the negative effects of water deficit fig 3a oddo et al 2020 in addition the application of k sustained high k concentration in rice leaves and stems fig 3c d bhattacharyya et al 2012 especially under water deficit giving the plant sufficient k for export to new leaves which was beneficial for cell and leaf expansion m wang and wu 2013 y wang and wu 2013 proline content is often used as a physiological indicator of drought resistant breeding rensburg and krüger 1994 it is generally believed that genotypes with stronger drought resistance can accumulate more proline ozturk et al 2020 however in this study the proline content was lower in the k treatment than in the k treatment under water deficit fig 3b a possible explanation is that the soluble sugar and k accumulation capacity of drought resistant genotype was stronger and was sufficient to sustain resistance to water deficit du et al 2020 ozturk et al 2020 compared with ww drought resistant genotype under wd was more dependent on the supply of k to sustain a higher k content the k treatment not only reduced k absorption by drought resistant genotype but also limited their

fertilization on gas exchange traits and water use efficiency of two rice genotypes with different drought resistance stomatal regulation is an important means by which rice controls water loss under water deficit caine et al 2019 stomatal density increased under water deficit whereas stomatal area decreased ouyang et al 2017 the effect of k on rice stomatal characteristics was opposite to that of water deficit the k treatment reduced stomatal density but increased stomatal area fig 5a b c d rice absorbs co2 for photosynthesis through the stomata and the opening of stomata is therefore beneficial for assimilate synthesis while stomatal opening inevitably causes transpiration and increases the risk of water loss caine et al 2019 under water deficit rice reduced the stomatal area to reduce water loss and increase plant water status although this behavior occurred at the expense of yield potential wang et al 2013 for drought resistant rice genotypes k application under water deficit alleviated water restriction and maintaining a larger open stomatal area was more conducive to the synergistic improvement of yield and water use efficiency k deficiency aggravated water deficit and drought resistant rice genotype did not exhibit tolerance to water deficit under these conditions under the stress of k deficiency the photosynthetic rate transpiration rate and stomatal conductance were significantly lower restricting the photosynthesis of drought resistant rice genotypes fig 4a b d the epidermal waxy layer is the first barrier between the plant and the external environment and can effectively reduce transpiration water loss seo and park 2014 while its contribution to water loss reduction remains to be evaluated this study showed that the wax content per unit leaf area of rice increased markedly under water deficit presumably reducing water loss li et al 2020 and the application of k promoted this behavior fig 5e although the wax content under wd was higher than that under ww for drought resistant genotype their wax accumulation was limited by k deficiency this result was consistent with the gas exchange results above k increased the leaf relative water content under water deficit to maintain plant water status and improve tolerance to water deficit in rice table 2 ortiz et al 2015 under water deficit the water potential of rice leaves was significantly reduced to enhance the water absorption capacity of the root system chen et al 2016 at the same time a sharp drop in leaf water potential induces stomatal closure liu et al 2020 which was not conducive to photosynthetic gas exchange to a certain extent the drop in leaf water potential represents the degree of plant water deficit núria 2017 the root system plays an important role in the absorption and transportation of water and nutrients in the plant and the root system is also the greatest resistance to water flow maurel and nacry 2020 the decrease of water content and water potential in rice leaves caused by potassium deficiency may be related to the decrease of root hydraulic conductance table 2 de luca et al 2021 in this study there is a lack of research on the characteristics of root water uptake and structural development under potassium deficiency stress it is an important way to explore how the water supply of the root system responds to the water demand of the shoot which is an important way to explore the coordination of potassium nutrition in the water relationship of rice in addition although the irrigation amount of each treatment under ww was the same in this study the soil water status was different among different treatments due to the different canopy evaporation area sizes thus affecting the availability of root water water deficit reduced rice yield above ground biomass and leaf area table 1 pantuwan et al 2002 and k deficiency exacerbated these negative effects zahoor et al 2017 on both genotypes compared with ww k was more effective in relieving water deficit under wd primarily because the osmotic adjustment ability and photosynthetic ability of the drought resistant genotype wdr was more dependent on the supply of k although the mechanism by which k deficiency stress restricts the ability of wdr to use water efficiently remains to be determined it is clear that k plays an important role in the water deficit tolerance of a water efficient genotype and this result provides guidance for the breeding of drought resistant genotypes and management of water and k in paddy fields 5 conclusion k played an important role in improving water deficit tolerance and water use efficiency of rice k deficiency weakened the water holding capacity of plants under water deficit by reducing leaf relative water content and water potential and restricted gas exchange by reducing stomatal area and conductance which limited the synthesis of assimilates thereby reduced grain yield and water use efficiency of rice sufficient k was an important prerequisite for drought resistant rice genotype wdr to show water deficit tolerance and the decrease of leaf water potential and stomatal area was the main reason for the reduction of water use efficiency of wdr caused by k deficiency this work provides important guidance for the breeding of drought resistant genotypes and management of water and k in paddy

9374,a pot experiment with two potassium k levels 0 15 k and 0 k g k2o kg 1 soil and two irrigation regimes well watered ww and water deficit wd imposed on two rice genotypes drought sensitive cr and drought resistant wdr was conducted to explore the effects of k deficiency on water use efficiency leaf water status osmotic adjustment gas exchange traits and stomatal characteristics of rice under water deficit the results showed that k deficiency broke water balance of plants under deficit irrigation by reducing relative water content and water potential of leaf thereby limited water deficit tolerance of both rice genotypes in addition k deficiency resulted in a reduction in stomatal area and conductance which aggravated the negative impact of water deficit on leaf gas exchange thereby reduced grain yield and water use efficiency of rice it should be noted that sufficient k is an important prerequisite for wdr to show water deficit tolerance the decrease of leaf water potential and stomatal area was the main reason for the limited water deficit tolerance of wdr caused by k deficiency our results indicated that k plays an important role in maintaining water deficit tolerance of

in a reduction in bound water content in both genotypes and both under ww and wd which was more pronounced at wd the lower of free water content was the main reason for the reduction of leaf water

drought resistance rice genotypes differ in their tolerance of water deficit shankar et al 2016 and we tested two rice genotypes drought sensitive cr and drought resistant wdr to explore the effects of k deficiency on water use efficiency leaf water status osmotic adjustment gas exchange traits and stomatal characteristics of rice under water deficit the results of this study showed that k application improved the water deficit tolerance of rice zain et al 2014 and played an important role in the drought resistance of wdr despite wdr has higher water use efficiency compared to cr whereas k deficiency limited the ability of wdr to use water efficiently fig 2b under water deficit rice accumulates large amounts of osmotic adjustment substances such as soluble sugar proline and k to improve cellular water retention capacity and adapt to water deficit conditions xiong et al 2012 y wang et al 2013 m wang et al 2013 dien et al 2019 in this study k promoted the accumulation of soluble sugar in rice leaves to alleviate the negative effects of water deficit fig 3a oddo et al 2020 in addition the application of k sustained high k concentration in rice leaves and stems fig 3c d bhattacharyya et al 2012 especially under water deficit giving the plant sufficient k for export to new leaves which was beneficial for cell and leaf expansion m wang and wu 2013 y wang and wu 2013 proline content is often used as a physiological indicator of drought resistant breeding rensburg and krüger 1994 it is generally believed that genotypes with stronger drought resistance can accumulate more proline ozturk et al 2020 however in this study the proline content was lower in the k treatment than in the k treatment under water deficit fig 3b a possible explanation is that the soluble sugar and k accumulation capacity of drought resistant genotype was stronger and was sufficient to sustain resistance to water deficit du et al 2020 ozturk et al 2020 compared with ww drought resistant genotype under wd was more dependent on the supply of k to sustain a higher k content the k treatment not only reduced k absorption by drought resistant genotype but also limited their soluble sugar accumulation wu et al 2014 indicating that the expression of drought resistance in these genotypes may be limited by k deficiency stress 4 2 effect of deficit irrigation and k fertilization on gas exchange traits and water use efficiency of two rice genotypes with different drought resistance stomatal regulation is an important means by which rice controls water loss under water deficit caine et al 2019 stomatal density increased under water deficit whereas stomatal area decreased ouyang et al 2017 the effect of k on rice stomatal characteristics was opposite to that of water deficit the k treatment reduced stomatal density but increased stomatal area fig 5a b c d rice absorbs co2 for photosynthesis through the stomata and the opening of stomata is therefore beneficial for assimilate synthesis while stomatal opening inevitably causes transpiration and increases the risk of water loss caine et al 2019 under water deficit rice reduced the stomatal area to reduce water loss and increase plant water status although this behavior occurred at the expense of yield potential wang et al 2013 for drought resistant rice genotypes k application under water deficit alleviated water restriction and maintaining a larger open stomatal area was more conducive to the synergistic improvement of yield and water use efficiency k deficiency aggravated water deficit and drought resistant rice genotype did not exhibit tolerance to water deficit under these conditions under the stress of k deficiency the photosynthetic rate transpiration rate and stomatal conductance were significantly lower restricting the photosynthesis of drought resistant rice genotypes fig 4a b d the epidermal waxy layer is the first barrier between the plant and the external environment and can effectively reduce transpiration water loss seo and park 2014 while its contribution to water loss reduction remains to be evaluated this study showed that the wax content per unit leaf area of rice increased markedly under water deficit presumably reducing water loss li et al 2020 and the application of k promoted this behavior fig 5e although the wax content under wd was higher than that under ww for drought resistant genotype their wax accumulation was limited by k deficiency this result was consistent with the gas exchange results above k increased the leaf relative water content under water deficit to maintain plant water status and improve tolerance to water deficit in rice table 2 ortiz et al 2015 under water deficit the water potential of rice leaves was significantly reduced to enhance the water absorption capacity of the root system chen et al 2016 at the same time a sharp drop in leaf water potential induces stomatal closure liu et al 2020 which was not conducive to photosynthetic gas exchange to a certain extent the drop in leaf water potential represents the degree of plant water deficit núria 2017 the root system plays an important role in the absorption and transportation of water and nutrients in the plant and the root system is also the greatest resistance to water flow maurel and nacry 2020 the decrease of water content and water potential in rice leaves caused by potassium deficiency may be related to the decrease of root hydraulic conductance table 2 de luca et al 2021 in this study there is a lack of research on the characteristics of root water uptake and structural development under potassium deficiency stress it is an important way to explore how the water supply of the root system responds to the water demand of the shoot which is an important way to explore the coordination of potassium nutrition in the water relationship of rice in addition although the irrigation amount of each treatment under ww was the same in this study the soil water status was different among different treatments due to the different canopy evaporation area sizes thus affecting the availability of root water water deficit reduced rice yield above ground biomass and leaf area table 1 pantuwan et al 2002 and k deficiency exacerbated these negative effects zahoor et al 2017 on both genotypes compared with ww k was more effective in relieving water deficit under wd primarily because the osmotic adjustment ability and photosynthetic ability of the drought resistant genotype wdr was more dependent on the supply of k although the mechanism by which k deficiency stress restricts the ability of wdr to use water efficiently remains to be determined it is clear that k plays an important role in the water deficit tolerance of a water efficient genotype and this result provides guidance for the breeding of drought resistant genotypes and management of water and k in paddy fields 5 conclusion k played an important role in improving water deficit tolerance and water use efficiency of rice k deficiency weakened the water holding capacity of plants under water deficit by reducing leaf relative water content and water potential and restricted gas exchange by reducing stomatal area and conductance which limited the synthesis of assimilates thereby reduced grain yield and water use efficiency of rice sufficient k was an important prerequisite for drought resistant rice genotype wdr to show water deficit tolerance and the decrease of leaf water potential and stomatal area was the main reason for the reduction of water use efficiency of wdr caused by k deficiency this work provides important guidance for the breeding of drought resistant genotypes and management of water and k in paddy
