6790,three hydroelectric reservoirs kralkızı dicle and batman in the tigris river basin turkey were sampled monthly during one year in order to reveal spatial and seasonal changes in aqueous partial pressure of co2 pco2 and to estimate diffusive fluxes of co2 from the reservoirs surface water pco2 concentrations did not show significant spatial differences while they showed significant seasonal variations temperature precipitation and biological co2 uptake through photosynthesis controlled pco2 seasonality in the reservoirs with maximal concentrations in the winter ranging from 516 9 µatm in kralkızı to 1299 2 µatm in dicle and minimal concentrations in the spring ranging from 47 7 µatm in batman to 140 7 µatm in kralkızı most studies reported that reservoirs worldwide are net sources of co2 to the atmosphere however the reservoirs in this study were sinks for atmospheric co2 during the spring summer and autumn seasons while they were co2 sources to the atmosphere during the winter air water co2 fluxes in kralkızı dicle and batman dam reservoirs were 2 39 32 88 and 8 12 mmol m2 day in the winter respectively on an annual basis all three reservoirs acted as a sink for atmospheric co2 these estimated co2 fluxes were in the lower range for temperate reservoirs despite the potential for winter conditions that shifted the reservoirs from sink to net source for atmospheric co2 keywords greenhouse gases co2 diffusion fluxes hydroelectric reservoirs carbon emissions semi arid region 1 introduction although hydroelectric reservoirs are often considered green or carbon neutral sources of energy recent researches indicated that they are potentially important sources of greenhouse gases ghgs carbon dioxide co2 and methane ch4 st louis et al 2000 tranvik et al 2009 abril et al 2005 barros et al 2011 li and zhang 2014a deemer et al 2016 the researches on ghg from hydroelectric reservoirs particularly in tropical regions demonstrated quite high co2 emission fluxes from surface water to atmosphere abril et al 2005 dos santos et al 2006 kemenes et al 2011 for example some hydroelectric reservoirs such as curua una samuel barra bonita and tres marias in tropical regions were reported emitting higher ghg emissions than those from alternative thermal power plants fearnside 2005 dos santos et al 2006 ghg emissions from artifical reservoirs are different from natural systems such as lakes and rivers because the impoundment of reservoirs has resulted in flooding of large areas of terrestrial ecosystems decomposition of flooded vegetation and soil organic matter are potentially important sources of co2 and ch4 in reservoirs the initial flooding phase is associated with high rates of bacterial activity and greenhouse gas production while this effect decreases with the ageing of the reservoir barros et al 2011 yang et al 2014 st louis et al 2000 first estimated that reservoirs globally emitted 272 7 tg c as co2 and 52 5 tg c as ch4 per year based on the data from 22 globally distributed reservoirs in temperate and tropical regions they also reported that co2 and ch4 fluxes from reservoir surfaces were equal to 4 of other anthropogenic fluxes of carbon as co2 and ch4 barros et al 2011 estimated that hydroelectric reservoirs emitted 48 tg c year as co2 and 3 tg c year as ch4 corresponding to 4 of global carbon emissions from inland waters the estimate was based on emissions from 85 globally distributed hydroelectric reservoirs from the americas and northern europe hertwich 2013 also estimated the carbon emissions to be 76 tg c year as co2 and 7 3 tg c year as ch4 from global hydroelectric reservoirs recently li and zhang 2014b reported that 82 tg c as co2 and 14 tg c as ch4 per year were released from global hydroelectric reservoirs while deemer et al 2016 estimated that reservoirs emitted 13 4 tg ch4 c and 36 8 tg co2 c per year these results indicated that there are still large uncertainties in these quantifications of global emissions due to the high variability of gas emissions from different reservoirs and limited available data zhao et al 2015 therefore more data at the regional level are needed for accurate estimation of global emissions from hydroelectric reservoirs li et al 2017 the co2 emission accounts for the largest share of ghgs equivalent of 80 85 of the emissions wang et al 2015 since the onset of the industrial revolution around 1750 the atmospheric co2 concentration has increased by 42 9 from 280 ppm to 400 ppm in 2015 noaa 2017 primarilydue to fossil fuel combustion and deforestation ofterrestrial environments landry and matthews 2016 in addition the co2 emission from reservoirs is the largest item among greenhouse gas emissions yang et al 2014 the geographic locations of reservoirs have an impact on the organic matter storage and water temperature and influence on co2 emissions subsequently in addition co2 emissions from reservoirs are influenced by ph chlorophyll a and dissolved organic carbon levels in the reservoir water reservoir age wind speed and precipitation yang et al 2014 saidi and koschorreck 2017 barros et al 2011 guerin et al 2007 li and zhang 2014a in hydroelectric reservoirs co2 is released into the atmosphere through four main pathways 1 diffusive fluxes at the reservoir surface area which occur in the air water interface of the reservoir 2 ebullitive emissions bubbling in the shallow zones of the reservoir co2 concentrations in the bubbles are low due to the higher solubility of co2 in the water 3 degassing emissions at the outlet of the dam downstream of turbines and spillways 4 diffusive and ebullitive emissions in the river downstream of the dam yang et al 2014 demarty et al 2011 li et al 2015 while the first two and last pathways of co2 emissions into the atmosphere are also observed in natural waterbodies the third process is typical of reservoirs only bastien et al 2011 diffusion is the dominant pathway for co2 emission from the reservoirs while ebullition is of minor importance for co2 emission and even could be ignored in temperate reservoirs compared with the co2 diffusive emission of a reservoir the co2 degassing fluxes at the turbines and spillways have relatively small contribution to the total co2 emission prior studies showed that co2 degassing emissions at the turbines and spillways contribute 0 16 to the total emission yang et al 2014 downstream rivers from hydroelectric reservoirs are also important source of co2 emission current studies demonstrated that co2 emission from the downstream rivers contributed to 2 32 of the total co2 emissions from the reservoirs li et al 2015 yang et al 2014 therefore in this study it was focused on only diffusive fluxes hydropower is currently the most common renewable energy source and plays an important part in turkey s electricity sector hydroelectricity production of turkey was 67 3 109 kwh y in 2016 contributing 24 7 to the total national electricity production turkey has 727 dam reservoirs of which 597 are hydroelectric reservoirs in addition the construction of 727 dam reservoirs is planned between 2018 and 2023 however there are no studies reporting co2 emissions from reservoirs in turkey therefore data on co2 emissions from turkey s hydroelectric reservoirs were unavailable for global quantification it is accepted that more data covering detailed spatial and temporal dynamics of co2 emissions from reservoirs are required for more accurate estimations of regional and global emissions particularly in developing countries such as turkey where data on co2 emissions are unavailable in this study three hydroelectric dam reservoirs kralkızı dicle and batman in the tigris river basin turkey were selected to perform a preliminary investigation on aqueous partial pressure of co2 pco2 through monthly sampling during one year the main objectives of this study are to evaluate spatial and seasonal variations of pco2 examine the environmental factors controlling the variability of pco2 and quantify the water air interface co2 fluxes in the dam reservoirs 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the kralkızı dam reservoir kdr dicle dam reservoir ddr and batman dam reservoir bdr are located in the tigris river basin of the southeastern anatolia region of turkey which is a semi arid region fig 1 these dam reservoirs were primarily constructed for hydroelectric power generation the kdr is fed by the tigris river the ddr is fed by the water released from the kdr and dipni stream the bdr is fed by the kulp sason and sorkan streams the main features of three dam reservoirs are given in table 1 the water surface area and water volume of the kdr are larger followed by the bdr and ddr they are warm monomictic reservoirs thermal stratification is observed in the dam reservoirs maximum flows in the tigris river were recorded from february through april while minimum flows were recorded from august through october the river discharge showed an increasing trend towards its downstream region due to water inputs from its tributaries batman garzan botan and hezil streams the annual mean flow in cizre downstream was 211 8 m3 sn the continental climate of the basin is similar to that of the mediterranean region the annual mean air temperature varied between 16 2 c and 17 3 c with the highest and the lowest temperature of 32 7 c in august and 1 1 c in january respectively average annual total precipitation was 397 5 mm of which 2 7 fell in the summer 19 6 in the spring 38 1 in the autumn and 39 5 in the winter table s1 sedimentary and karstic carbonate rocks of paleozoic to tertiary origin cover the basin varol and li 2017 varol et al 2012 2 2 water sampling and analyses ten sampling sites were selected on the reservoirs four sites k 1 k 2 k 3 and k 4 were located in the kdr three sites d 1 d 2 and d 3 were located in the ddr and three sites b 1 b 2 and b 3 were located in the bdr fig 1 water samples were collected at monthly intervals between february 2008 and january 2009 from the sampling sites duplicate grab samples were taken from 10 to 30 cm depth below water surface using acid washed polypropylene bottles preservation and transportation of the water samples to the laboratory were performed according to standard methods apha 1999 the water samples were analysed

dichromate reflux method apha 1999 sd was measured using a standard secchi disk in addition vertical water samples were taken with a ruttner sampler at 2 m intervals to assess the vertical distribution of wt and do in the water column and so to determine the mixing regimes of the reservoirs 2 3 pco2 calculations the program co2sys based on measured alkalinity ph and water temperature was used to calculate pco2 in this study this program is commonly used for its reliability alin and johnson 2007 lewis and wallace 1998 butman and raymond 2011 li and zhang 2014a 2 4 data quality because alkalinity and ph are critical for pco2 calculations the values of these two variables were carefully scrutinized as follows 1 the ph probes were carefully calibrated with standard ph buffer solutions 4 01 7 00 and 10 01 prior to each sampling event 2 in situ ph values were recorded when the ph levels stabilized in 0 01 units for 2 3 min 3 triple measurements were performed with a precision of 0 01 unit for ph 4 duplicates for individual samples were determined for alkalinity and the mean values were taken alkalinity in this study was determined using a fixed endpoint titration method with 0 02 n sulfuric acid which was standardized by titration with 0 05 n sodium carbonate solution precision based on replicate analyses were 4 µeq l for alkalinity 2 5 water air co2 flux calculations the flux of co2 f units in mmol m2 d across the water air interface was estimated based on a theoretical diffusion model 1 f k p co 2 water p co 2 air k h 2 k h 10 1 11 0 016 t 0 00007 t

widely used wang et al 2011 li and zhang 2014a li et al 2016 because piston velocity k was not determined directly k kt was estimated as an empirical function of wind speed and normalized to a schmidt

waters m s in this study wind speed was not directly determined monthly mean wind speed values from the tigris basin were used here these values in the basin varied from 1 8 to 3 m s with an annual mean value of 2 2 m s table s1 the calculated k600 values were 2 85 cm h in the spring 3 24 cm h in the summer 2 92 cm h in the autumn and 2 58 cm h in the winter table 2 2 6 trophic assessment

data before statistical analyses variables that did not have a normal distribution were transformed by natural logarithm multivariate statistics such as correlation analysis and analysis of variance anova were performed in this study correlation analysis was made using pearson s coefficient for relationships between pco2 and other considered environmental parameters and basin characteristics in addition anova was performed for temporal and spatial differences of the dic system and key water quality parameters with significance at p 0 05 the statistical analyses were conducted using spss 11 5 for windows 3 results 3 1 spatial variability of wt do ph and alkalinity spatial variations of water temperature wt ph dissolved oxygen do and total alkalinity in the dam reservoirs are presented in

winter season fco2 ranged from 2 39 mmol m2 d kralkızı to 32 88 mmol m2 d dicle table 2 during the spring summer and autumn seasons the surfaces of kralkızı dicle and batman tended to be a co2 sink these results indicated the reservoirs emit co2 to atmopshere in the winter and absorb co2 from atmosphere in other seasons the highest emission rates came from dicle followed by batman and kralkızı the results indicated that dicle surface area emitted 288 06 106 mol co2 during the winter and absorbed 217 21 204 97 and 166 39 106 mol co2 during the summer spring and autumn respectively while

state index tsi values 40 40 50 and 50 indicate oligotrophic mesotrophic and eutrophic status respectively trophic evaluation using tsi indicated that tsi levels of sd and chl a in three dam reservoirs were included in the mesotrophic ranges while tsi levels of tp were in the range of eutrophic status according to the tsi levels of tn the kdr and bdr were in the eutrophic class while the ddr was in the mesotrophic class these results indicated that tsi levels of tp in three dam reservoirs were substantially higher than tsi levels of sd chl a and tn in similar cases carlson 1977 suggested that priority is given to chl a because it is a more direct measure of phytoplankton biomass therefore tsi values based on chl a will provide a better predictor for trophic state than tsi values based on sd tp and or tn thus the kdr ddr and bdr could be regarded as mesotrophic table s7 correlations between pco2 and water quality parameters were examined table 3 pco2 was significantly

chl a 4 discussion 4 1 controls on aqueous pco2 the aqueous pco2 is mainly controlled by both internal carbon dynamics and external biogeochemical processes influx of soil co2 via runoff and in situ aquatic respiration of terrestrially derived organic carbon within the aquatic system produce co2 and contribute aquatic pco2 increase while co2 evasion from water to air and photosynthesis decrease the aqueous pco2 levels saidi and koshorreck 2017 varol and li 2017 li and zhang 2014a wang et al 2011 adamczyk and shurin 2015 seasonal variability of temperature and precipitation were closely related to biogeochemical processes in the surrounding soils and thus had important effects on aqueous pco2 levels in the dam reservoirs this was corroborated by distinct seasonal variations of pco2 fig 6 initial rainfall in february enhanced the export of soil co2 to the reservoirs after february the pco2 levels in the reservoirs decreased until may because subsequent rainfall in march and april reduced soil permeability and thus diluted aqueous pco2 levels fig 6 table s1 li and zhang 2014a in may proper temperature mean 19 2 c table s1 and rainfall mean 27 8 mm table s1 enhanced the export of soil co2 to reservoirs by rain runoff leading a slight increase in pco2 levels the development of thermal stratification in the summer resulted in a decrease in co2 levels in the epilimnion and an accumulation of co2 in the hypolimnion jones et al 2016 saidi and koshorreck 2017 li et al 2017 however in july pco2 levels showed a slight increase at all sites of the kdr and at site d 1 of the ddr possibly agricultural practices in the surrounding farmlands facilitated the transport of soil co2 by rivers to the reservoirs and thus contributed to higher pco2 levels at these sites in addition a decrease in do concentrations in the reservoirs was observed in the summer as water temperatures increased r 2 0 60 p 0 01 in the basin rains started at the end of september after a a long dry period table s1 thus wetted soils by rainfall and proper temperature promoted bacterial activities in soils and thus higher soil co2 content and export of soil co2 to reservoirs via runoff consequently resulting in a sudden rise in aqueous pco2 levels in october and november fig 6 varol and li 2017 the significant relationships between pco2 and tn and no3 n in the reservoirs implied external inputs table 3 in addition co2 previously accumulated in the hypolimnion during stratification lead to an increase in the co2 levels at the surface layers of the reservoirs when mixing occurred in the autumn jones et al 2016 because of these reasons the lowest mean do levels in the reservoirs were recorded in the autumn table s4 the highest pco2 levels in the reservoirs were recorded in the winter table s5 fig 6 primary production is expected be lowest in the winter due to greater light limitation shorther day length and lower temperatures thus heterotrophic respiration exceeded photosynthesis by phytoplankton resulting in higher co2 concentrations lower ph and do saturation levels and higher pco2 levels in the winter table s4 li et al 2017 adamczyk and shurin 2015 in addition surface water inputs are highest in the winter when precipitation occurs potentially introducing new sources of allochthonous materials thus bacteria degrading organic matter also increased during the winter months and have contributed to higher respiration and greater pco2 reflected by positive relationships between pco2 and cod and negative relationships between pco2 and do and do saturation table 3 adamczyk and shurin 2015 in three dam reservoirs chl a concentrations in the winter were higher than other seasons chl a is an indicator of phytoplankton biomass in aquatic ecosystems generally photosynthesis by phytoplankton takes up co2 in water resulting in a fall in aquatic pco2 whereas respiration and degradation of organic matter release co2 making pco2 increase in water in this study relative dominance of in situ respiration and degradation of organic matter versus photosynthesis by phytoplankton in the winter made pco2 rise in the reservoirs during the winter there was no ice formed in the reservoirs therefore the reservoirs generally had uniforms conditions along water column both in temperature and do because the water was mixed homogeneously in the winter thus buried organic matter and nutrients could be transferred from the bottom of the reservoirs to the surface via mixing and potentially decomposed by pelagic bacteria resulting in higher pco2 in the reservoirs adamczyk and shurin 2015 li et al 2017 in this study pco2 levels did not show significant spatial differences p 0 05 by anova table s3 however the average pco2 levels were found higher in the ddr while they were found lower in the bdr table s2 substantial heterogeneity in catchment characteristics such as land use soil type and vegetation cover and climatic characteristics such as temperature and precipitation contribute to the spatial differences that were observed for pco2 li et al 2018 for example when compared with the kdr and ddr regions annual total precipitation was much lower in the bdr region table s1 in addition the bdr was surrounded by bare hills with little vegetation however land use type around site d 1 of the ddr is farmland with abundant organic matter which supply allochthonous organic carbon to the ddr further the mean concentrations of tn and cod were higher in the ddr table s2 reflecting allochthonous inputs they may be important reasons to support the spatial pco2 differences between reservoirs many studies showed that trophic status is important predictor of pco2 in lakes and reservoirs some authors reported that eutrophic lakes and reservoirs have lower levels of pco2 than oligotrophic lakes and reservoirs due to high phytoplankton productivity balmer and downing 2011 duarte and prairie 2005 lazzarino et al 2009 whereas other studies reported that eutrophic lakes and reservoirs have higher pco2 levels compared with oligotrophic lakes and reservoirs due to high respiration rates huttunen et al 2003 wen et al 2017 kortelainen et al 2006 in this study because the trophic states of three reservoirs were found to be same mesotrophic a relation between pco2 levels and trophic states of the reservoirs was not identified 4 2 correlations between pco2 and environmental variables a notable positive correlation was found between precipitation and pco2 while a strong negative correlation between pco2 and air temperature was identified fig s2 as explained in section 4 1 precipitation enhanced the export of soil co2 and allochthonous organic carbon to the reservoirs resulting in higher pco2 einola et al 2011 knoll et al 2013 marotta et al 2010 increasing temperature lead to an increase in phytoplankton biomass and thus biological co2 uptake through photosynthesis reduced aquatic pco2 saidi and koschorreck 2017 wang et al 2015 in this study pco2 was positively correlated with tn and no3 n in the autumn and cod in the winter while negatively correlated with do saturation in both seasons table 3 these relations indicated allochthonous organic carbon inputs to the reservoirs bacterial respiration and degradation of organic carbon led to increase in pco2 levels while do was consumed simultaneously in addition pco2 was negatively correlated with tp and po4 p in the winter table 3 when the highest chl a concentrations were recorded in the reservoirs table s4 phosphorus is the limiting nutrient for phytoplankton in freshwater reservoirs therefore elevated phosphorus concentrations could increase aquatic photosynthesis however dominance of in situ respiration or heterotrophic processes versus photosynthesis resulted in a rise in pco2 in the winter 4 3 comparison with other reservoirs seasonally three reservoirs in the tigris river basin were co2 sources to the atmosphere in the winter while they were sinks for atmospheric co2 in other seasons table 2 however on an annual basis these reservoirs acted as a sink for atmospheric co2 in contrast with reservoirs in heavily vegetated boreal and tropical environments that are net sources of co2 to the atmosphere table 4 similary knoll et al 2013 adamczyk and shurin 2015 and soumis et al 2004 reported that temperate reservoirs in usa were small co2 sources to the atmosphere and large carbon sinks as shown in table 4 most reservoirs worldwide emit co2 to the atmosphere when compared to these reservoirs the average diffusive co2 fluxes from the kdr ddr and bdr found in the winter were comparable to some temperate reservoirs e g acton shasta besko and klimkowka boreal reservoirs e g mcarthur falls subtropical reservoirs e g xinanjiang danjiangkou and king talal and global temperate reservoirs 8 8 31 8 mmol m2 d tables 2 and 4 however winter co2 fluxes from the reservoirs in this study were much lower than those from tropical reservoirs for instance co2 fluxes from the kdr ddr and bdr were only 0 25 3 37 and 0 83 of co2 flux from samuel reservoir in brazil respectively tables 2 and 4 on an annual basis estimated negative diffusive co2 fluxes from the kdr ddr and bdr were comparable to some temperate reservoirs such as wallula new melones dworkshak and san diego reservoirs in usa table 4 these reservoirs are also located in semi arid regions where allochthonous organic matter inputs are much lower than in the tropical and boreal regions soumis et al 2004 adamczyk and shurin 2015 co2 emission from global hydroelectric reservoirs has been revised from 48 to 82 tg c as co2 per year barros et al 2011 li and zhang 2014b however more recent work has indicated 36 8 tg c co2 y from all reservoirs deemer et al 2016 this large uncertainty is primarily due to incomplete spatial coverage of the data to our best knowledge there are no studies on co2 fluxes from turkey s hydroelectric reservoirs therefore data on co2 emissions from turkey s reservoirs were unavailable for the global estimates barros et al 2011 aufdenkampe et al 2011 li and zhang 2014b mccully 2006 st louis et al 2000 hertwich 2013 deemer et al 2016 this indicates that current global estimation of co2 emission from reservoirs could be misestimated therefore to improve the estimation of global co2 emissions from hydroelectric reservoirs more data are required particularly in turkey where a large number of hydroelectric reservoirs exist with many planned for the future co2 emissions from reservoirs have been gaining increased attention recently however available data still remain scarce due to limited studies at local and regional scale data scarcity leads to large uncertainties in regional and global co2 emission estimates therefore this study is significant because it contributes to increases in the spatial coverage of co2 emissions from hydroelectric reservoirs in this study the data obtained ten years ago were used to calculate co2 areal fluxes from the reservoirs after ten years in 2018 some changes in the co2 fluxes can occur barros et al 2011 reported that there was a significantly negative correlation between reservoir age and co2 areal fluxes from hydroelectric reservoirs therefore the co2 fluxes from the reservoirs can decrease during the aging process 4 4 water quality of the dam reservoirs according to ph values waters of three reservoirs were mildly alkaline ca2 was the most abundant cation while hco3 was the most abundant anion in the reservoirs due to the abundance of carbonate rocks in the basin varol and li 2017 water quality status of the reservoirs was evaluated by comparing the mean concentrations of water quality variables with the standards for drinking water and surface water quality the mean values of ec no3 cl so4 2 and na were lower than the threshold values set by european drinking water standards ceu 1998 table s8 compared with turkish surface water quality standards mfwa 2012 the reservoirs had high quality waters class i in terms of the mean values of do ph ec cod tn no3 n nh4 n tp and po4 p table s8 5 conclusions in this study pco2 concentrations did not show significant differences between sites in each reservoir and between reservoirs while they showed significant differences between seasons pco2 concentrations were higher in the winter and autumn in three reservoirs while they were lower in the spring and summer strong seasonality of pco2 was controlled by biological co2 uptake through photosynthesis and seasonal variability of temperature and precipitation pco2 had strong positive correlations with secchi disk and cod negative correlations with chl a and do in the winter the reservoirs in this study were undersaturated with co2 in the spring summer and autumn while they were supersaturated with co2 in the winter co2 diffusion fluxes ranged from 2 39 mmol m2 d kralkızı to 32 88 mmol m2 d dicle in the winter season these co2 fluxes in the winter were within global averages for temperate reservoirs while they were lower than global averages for hydroelectric reservoirs the annual negative diffusive

6790,three hydroelectric reservoirs kralkızı dicle and batman in the tigris river basin turkey were sampled monthly during one year in order to reveal spatial and seasonal changes in aqueous partial pressure of co2 pco2 and to estimate diffusive fluxes of co2 from the reservoirs surface water pco2 concentrations did not show significant spatial differences while they showed significant seasonal variations temperature precipitation and biological co2 uptake through photosynthesis controlled pco2 seasonality in the reservoirs with maximal concentrations in the winter ranging from 516 9 µatm in kralkızı to 1299 2 µatm in dicle and minimal concentrations in the spring ranging from 47 7 µatm in batman to 140 7 µatm in kralkızı most studies reported that reservoirs worldwide are net sources of co2 to the atmosphere however the reservoirs in this study were sinks for atmospheric co2 during the spring summer and autumn seasons while they were co2 sources to the atmosphere during the winter air water co2 fluxes in kralkızı dicle and batman dam reservoirs were 2 39 32 88 and 8 12 mmol m2 day in the winter respectively on an annual basis all three reservoirs acted as a sink for atmospheric co2 these estimated co2 fluxes were in the lower range for temperate reservoirs despite the potential for winter conditions that shifted the reservoirs from sink to net source for atmospheric co2 keywords greenhouse gases co2 diffusion fluxes hydroelectric reservoirs carbon emissions semi arid region 1 introduction although hydroelectric reservoirs are often considered green or carbon neutral sources of energy recent researches indicated that they are potentially important sources of greenhouse gases ghgs carbon dioxide co2 and methane ch4 st louis et al 2000 tranvik et al 2009 abril et al 2005 barros et al 2011 li and zhang 2014a deemer et al 2016 the researches on ghg from hydroelectric reservoirs particularly in tropical regions demonstrated quite high co2 emission fluxes from surface water to atmosphere abril et al 2005 dos santos et al 2006 kemenes et al 2011 for example some hydroelectric reservoirs such as curua una samuel barra bonita and tres marias in tropical regions were reported emitting higher ghg emissions than those from alternative thermal power plants fearnside 2005 dos santos et al 2006 ghg emissions from artifical reservoirs are different from natural systems such as lakes and rivers because the impoundment of reservoirs has resulted in flooding of large areas of terrestrial ecosystems decomposition of flooded vegetation and soil organic matter are potentially important sources of co2 and ch4 in reservoirs the initial flooding phase is associated with high rates of bacterial activity and greenhouse gas production while this effect decreases with the ageing of the reservoir barros et al 2011 yang et al 2014 st louis et al 2000 first estimated that reservoirs globally emitted 272 7 tg c as co2 and 52 5 tg c as ch4 per year based on the data from 22 globally distributed reservoirs in temperate and tropical regions they also reported that co2 and ch4 fluxes from reservoir surfaces were equal to 4 of other anthropogenic fluxes of carbon as co2 and ch4 barros et al 2011 estimated that hydroelectric reservoirs emitted 48 tg c year as co2 and 3 tg c year as ch4 corresponding to 4 of global carbon emissions from inland waters the estimate was based on emissions from 85 globally distributed hydroelectric reservoirs from the americas and northern europe hertwich 2013 also estimated the carbon emissions to be 76 tg c year as co2 and 7 3 tg c year as ch4 from global hydroelectric reservoirs recently li and zhang 2014b reported that 82 tg c as co2 and 14 tg c as ch4 per year were released from global hydroelectric reservoirs while deemer et al 2016 estimated that reservoirs emitted 13 4 tg ch4 c and 36 8 tg co2 c per year these results indicated that there are still large uncertainties in these quantifications of global emissions due to the high variability of gas emissions from different reservoirs and limited available data zhao et al 2015 therefore more data at the regional level are needed for accurate estimation of global emissions from hydroelectric reservoirs li et al 2017 the co2 emission accounts for the largest share of ghgs equivalent of 80 85 of the emissions wang et al 2015 since the onset of the industrial revolution around 1750 the atmospheric co2 concentration has increased by 42 9 from 280 ppm to 400 ppm in 2015 noaa 2017 primarilydue to fossil fuel combustion and deforestation ofterrestrial environments landry and matthews 2016 in addition the co2 emission from reservoirs is the largest item among greenhouse gas emissions yang et al 2014 the geographic locations of reservoirs have an impact on the organic matter storage and water temperature and influence on co2 emissions subsequently in addition co2 emissions from reservoirs are influenced by ph chlorophyll a and dissolved organic carbon levels in the reservoir water reservoir age wind speed and precipitation yang et al 2014 saidi and koschorreck 2017 barros et al 2011 guerin et al 2007 li and zhang 2014a in hydroelectric reservoirs co2 is released into the atmosphere through four main pathways 1 diffusive fluxes at the reservoir surface area which occur in the air water interface of the reservoir 2 ebullitive emissions bubbling in the shallow zones of the reservoir co2 concentrations in the bubbles are low due to the higher solubility of co2 in the water 3 degassing emissions at the outlet of the dam downstream of turbines and spillways 4 diffusive and ebullitive emissions in the river downstream of the dam yang et al 2014 demarty et al 2011 li et al 2015 while the first two and last pathways of co2 emissions into the atmosphere are also observed in natural waterbodies the third process is typical of reservoirs only bastien et al 2011 diffusion is the dominant pathway for co2 emission from the reservoirs while ebullition is of minor importance for co2 emission and even could be ignored in temperate reservoirs compared with the co2 diffusive emission of a reservoir the co2 degassing fluxes at the turbines and spillways have relatively small contribution to the total co2 emission prior studies showed that co2 degassing emissions at the turbines and spillways contribute 0 16 to the total emission yang et al 2014 downstream rivers from hydroelectric reservoirs are also important source of co2 emission current studies demonstrated that co2 emission from the downstream rivers contributed to 2 32 of the total co2 emissions from the reservoirs li et al 2015 yang et al 2014 therefore in this study it was focused on only diffusive fluxes hydropower is currently the most common renewable energy source and plays an important part in turkey s electricity sector hydroelectricity production of turkey was 67 3 109 kwh y in 2016 contributing 24 7 to the total national electricity production turkey has 727 dam reservoirs of which 597 are hydroelectric reservoirs in addition the construction of 727 dam reservoirs is planned between 2018 and 2023 however there are no studies reporting co2 emissions from reservoirs in turkey therefore data on co2 emissions from turkey s hydroelectric reservoirs were unavailable for global quantification it is accepted that more data covering detailed spatial and temporal dynamics of co2 emissions from reservoirs are required for more accurate estimations of regional and global emissions particularly in developing countries such as turkey where data on co2 emissions are unavailable in this study three hydroelectric dam reservoirs kralkızı dicle and batman in the tigris river basin turkey were selected to perform a preliminary investigation on aqueous partial pressure of co2 pco2 through monthly sampling during one year the main objectives of this study are to evaluate spatial and seasonal variations of pco2 examine the environmental factors controlling the variability of pco2 and quantify the water air interface co2 fluxes in the dam reservoirs 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the kralkızı dam reservoir kdr dicle dam reservoir ddr and batman dam reservoir bdr are located in the tigris river basin of the southeastern anatolia region of turkey which is a semi arid region fig 1 these dam reservoirs were primarily constructed for hydroelectric power generation the kdr is fed by the tigris river the ddr is fed by the water released from the kdr and dipni stream the bdr is fed by the kulp sason and sorkan streams the main features of three dam reservoirs are given in table 1 the water surface area and water volume of the kdr are larger followed by the bdr and ddr they are warm monomictic reservoirs thermal stratification is observed in the dam reservoirs maximum flows in the tigris river were recorded from february through april while minimum flows were recorded from august through october the river discharge showed an increasing trend towards its downstream region due to water inputs from its tributaries batman garzan botan and hezil streams the annual mean flow in cizre downstream was 211 8 m3 sn the continental climate of the basin is similar to that of the mediterranean region the annual mean air temperature varied between 16 2 c and 17 3 c with the highest and the lowest temperature of 32 7 c in august and 1 1 c in january respectively average annual total precipitation was 397 5 mm of which 2 7 fell in the summer 19 6 in the spring 38 1 in the autumn and 39 5 in the winter table s1 sedimentary and karstic carbonate rocks of paleozoic to tertiary origin cover the basin varol and li 2017 varol et al 2012 2 2 water sampling and analyses ten sampling sites were selected on the reservoirs four sites k 1 k 2 k 3 and k 4 were located in the kdr three sites d 1 d 2 and d 3 were located in the ddr and three sites b 1 b 2 and b 3 were located in the bdr fig 1 water samples were collected at monthly intervals between february 2008 and january 2009 from the sampling sites duplicate grab samples were taken from 10 to 30 cm depth below water surface

dichromate reflux method apha 1999 sd was measured using a standard secchi disk in addition vertical water samples were taken with a ruttner sampler at 2 m intervals to assess the vertical distribution of wt and do in the water column and so to determine the mixing regimes of the reservoirs 2 3 pco2 calculations the program co2sys based on measured alkalinity ph and water temperature was used to calculate pco2 in this study this program is commonly used for its reliability alin and johnson 2007 lewis and wallace 1998 butman and raymond 2011 li and zhang 2014a 2 4 data quality because alkalinity and ph are critical for pco2 calculations the values of these two variables were carefully scrutinized as follows 1 the ph probes were carefully calibrated with standard ph buffer solutions 4 01 7 00 and 10 01 prior to each sampling event 2 in situ ph values were recorded when the ph levels stabilized in 0 01 units for 2 3 min 3 triple measurements were performed with a precision of 0 01 unit for ph 4 duplicates for individual samples were determined for alkalinity and the mean values were taken alkalinity in this study was determined using a fixed endpoint titration method with 0 02 n sulfuric acid which was standardized by titration with 0 05 n sodium carbonate solution precision based on replicate analyses were 4 µeq l for alkalinity 2 5 water air co2 flux

data before statistical analyses variables that did not have a normal distribution were transformed by natural logarithm multivariate statistics such as correlation analysis and analysis of variance anova were performed in this study correlation analysis was made using pearson s coefficient for relationships between pco2 and other considered environmental parameters and basin characteristics in addition anova was performed for temporal and spatial differences of the dic system and key water quality parameters with significance at p 0 05 the statistical analyses were conducted using spss 11 5 for windows 3 results 3 1 spatial variability of wt do ph and alkalinity spatial variations of water temperature wt ph dissolved oxygen do and total alkalinity in the dam reservoirs are presented in

fco2 showed remarkable seasonal variations p 0 01 by anova while they did not show significant differences between sites in each reservoir and between reservoirs p 0 05 by anova spatial fco2 ranged from 28 88 to 14 50 mmol m2 d in kralkızı 41 41 to 96 99 mmol m2 d in dicle and 42 85 to 25 99 mmol m2 d in batman table s6 the highest fco2 in three reservoirs appeared in december while the lowest

winter season fco2 ranged from 2 39 mmol m2 d kralkızı to 32 88 mmol m2 d dicle table 2 during the spring summer and autumn seasons the surfaces of kralkızı dicle and batman tended to be a co2 sink these results indicated the reservoirs emit co2 to atmopshere in the winter and absorb co2 from atmosphere in other seasons the highest emission rates came from dicle followed by batman and kralkızı the results indicated that dicle surface area emitted 288 06 106 mol co2 during the winter and absorbed 217 21 204 97 and 166 39 106 mol co2 during the summer spring and autumn respectively while batman emitted 145 27 106 mol co2 during the winter and absorbed 690 95 644 10 and 315 39 106 mol co2 during the summer spring and autumn respectively data also showed that kralkızı emitted 50 53 106 mol co2 during the winter and absorbed 505 52 498 36 and 309 68 106 mol co2 during the spring summer and autumn respectively table 2 3 5 ancillary data water quality variables spatial and seasonal

state index tsi values 40 40 50 and 50 indicate oligotrophic mesotrophic and eutrophic status respectively trophic evaluation using tsi indicated that tsi levels of sd and chl a in three dam reservoirs were included in the mesotrophic ranges while tsi levels of tp were in the range of eutrophic status according to the tsi levels of tn the kdr and bdr were in the eutrophic class while the ddr was in the mesotrophic class these results indicated that tsi levels of tp in three dam reservoirs were substantially higher than tsi levels of sd chl a and tn in similar cases carlson 1977 suggested that priority is given to chl a because it is a more direct measure of phytoplankton biomass therefore tsi values based on chl a will provide a better predictor for trophic state than tsi values based on sd tp and or tn thus the kdr ddr and bdr could be regarded as mesotrophic table s7 correlations between pco2 and water quality parameters were examined table 3 pco2 was significantly and positively correlated with ec so4 2 ca2 and mg2 and negatively with sd in the spring and summer pco2 was significantly and negatively related to wt do saturation nh4 n and cod and positively to tn no3 n ec so4 2 na k and ca2 in the autumn in the winter pco2 showed significant positive relationships with wt cod and sd and negative relationships with do do saturation tss ca2 nh4 n tp po4 p and chl a 4 discussion 4 1 controls on aqueous pco2 the aqueous pco2 is mainly controlled by both internal carbon dynamics and external biogeochemical processes influx of soil co2 via runoff and in situ aquatic respiration of terrestrially derived organic carbon within the aquatic system produce co2 and contribute aquatic pco2 increase while co2 evasion from water to air and photosynthesis decrease the aqueous pco2 levels saidi and koshorreck 2017 varol and li 2017 li and zhang 2014a wang et al 2011 adamczyk and shurin 2015 seasonal variability of temperature and precipitation were closely related to biogeochemical processes in the surrounding soils and thus had important effects on aqueous pco2 levels in the dam reservoirs this was corroborated by distinct seasonal variations of pco2 fig 6 initial rainfall in february enhanced the export of soil co2 to the reservoirs after february the pco2 levels in the reservoirs decreased until may because subsequent rainfall in march and april reduced soil permeability and thus diluted aqueous pco2 levels fig 6 table s1 li and zhang 2014a in may proper temperature mean 19 2 c table s1 and rainfall mean 27 8 mm table s1 enhanced the export of soil co2 to reservoirs by rain runoff leading a slight increase in pco2 levels the development of thermal stratification in the summer resulted in a decrease in co2 levels in the epilimnion and an accumulation of co2 in the hypolimnion jones et al 2016 saidi and koshorreck 2017 li et al 2017 however in july pco2 levels showed a slight increase at all sites of the kdr and at site d 1 of the ddr possibly agricultural practices in the surrounding farmlands facilitated the transport of soil co2 by rivers to the reservoirs and thus contributed to higher pco2 levels at these sites in addition a decrease in do concentrations in the reservoirs was observed in the summer as water temperatures increased r 2 0 60 p 0 01 in the basin rains started at the end of september after a a long dry period table s1 thus wetted soils by rainfall and proper temperature promoted bacterial activities in soils and thus higher soil co2 content and export of soil co2 to reservoirs via runoff consequently resulting in a sudden rise in aqueous pco2 levels in october and november fig 6 varol and li 2017 the significant relationships between pco2 and tn and no3 n in the reservoirs implied external inputs table 3 in addition co2 previously accumulated in the hypolimnion during stratification lead to an increase in the co2 levels at the surface layers of the reservoirs when mixing occurred in the autumn jones et al 2016 because of these reasons the lowest mean do levels in the reservoirs were recorded in the autumn table s4 the highest pco2 levels in the reservoirs were recorded in the winter table s5 fig 6 primary production is expected be lowest in the winter due to greater light limitation shorther day length and lower temperatures thus heterotrophic respiration exceeded photosynthesis by phytoplankton resulting in higher co2 concentrations lower ph and do saturation levels and higher pco2 levels in the winter table s4 li et al 2017 adamczyk and shurin 2015 in addition surface water inputs are highest in the winter when precipitation occurs potentially introducing new sources of allochthonous materials thus bacteria degrading organic matter also increased during the winter months and have contributed to higher respiration and greater pco2 reflected by positive relationships between pco2 and cod and negative relationships between pco2 and do and do saturation table 3 adamczyk and shurin 2015 in three dam reservoirs chl a concentrations in the winter were higher than other seasons chl a is an indicator of phytoplankton biomass in aquatic ecosystems generally photosynthesis by phytoplankton takes up co2 in water resulting in a fall in aquatic pco2 whereas respiration and degradation of organic matter release co2 making pco2 increase in water in this study relative dominance of in situ respiration and degradation of organic matter versus photosynthesis by phytoplankton in the winter made pco2 rise in the reservoirs during the winter there was no ice formed in the reservoirs therefore the reservoirs generally had uniforms conditions along water column both in temperature and do because the water was mixed homogeneously in the winter thus buried organic matter and nutrients could be transferred from the bottom of the reservoirs to the surface via mixing and potentially decomposed by pelagic bacteria resulting in higher pco2 in the reservoirs adamczyk and shurin 2015 li et al 2017 in this study pco2 levels did not show significant spatial differences p 0 05 by anova table s3 however the average pco2 levels were found higher in the ddr while they were found lower in the bdr table s2 substantial heterogeneity in catchment characteristics such as land use soil type and vegetation cover and climatic characteristics such as temperature and precipitation contribute to the spatial differences that were observed for pco2 li et al 2018 for example when compared with the kdr and ddr regions annual total precipitation was much lower in the bdr region table s1 in addition the bdr was surrounded by bare hills with little vegetation however land use type around site d 1 of the ddr is farmland with abundant organic matter which supply allochthonous organic carbon to the ddr further the mean concentrations of tn and cod were higher in the ddr table s2 reflecting allochthonous inputs they may be important reasons to support the spatial pco2 differences between reservoirs many studies showed that trophic status is important predictor of pco2 in lakes and reservoirs some authors reported that eutrophic lakes and reservoirs have lower levels of pco2 than oligotrophic lakes and reservoirs due to high phytoplankton productivity balmer and downing 2011 duarte and prairie 2005 lazzarino et al 2009 whereas other studies reported that eutrophic lakes and reservoirs have higher pco2 levels compared with oligotrophic lakes and reservoirs due to high respiration rates huttunen et al 2003 wen et al 2017 kortelainen et al 2006 in this study because the trophic states of three reservoirs were found to be same mesotrophic a relation between pco2 levels and trophic states of the reservoirs was not identified 4 2 correlations between pco2 and environmental variables a notable positive correlation was found between precipitation and pco2 while a strong negative correlation between pco2 and air temperature was identified fig s2 as explained in section 4 1 precipitation enhanced the export of soil co2 and allochthonous organic carbon to the reservoirs resulting in higher pco2 einola et al 2011 knoll et al 2013 marotta et al 2010 increasing temperature lead to an increase in phytoplankton biomass and thus biological co2 uptake through photosynthesis reduced aquatic pco2 saidi and koschorreck 2017 wang et al 2015 in this study pco2 was positively correlated with tn and no3 n in the autumn and cod in the winter while negatively correlated with do saturation in both seasons table 3 these relations indicated allochthonous organic carbon inputs to the reservoirs bacterial respiration and degradation of organic carbon led to increase in pco2 levels while do was consumed simultaneously in addition pco2 was negatively correlated with tp and po4 p in the winter table 3 when the highest chl a concentrations were recorded in the reservoirs table s4 phosphorus is the limiting nutrient for phytoplankton in freshwater reservoirs therefore elevated phosphorus concentrations could increase aquatic photosynthesis however dominance of in situ respiration or heterotrophic processes versus photosynthesis resulted in a rise in pco2 in the winter 4 3 comparison with other reservoirs seasonally three reservoirs in the tigris river basin were co2 sources to the atmosphere in the winter while they were sinks for atmospheric co2 in other seasons table 2 however on an annual basis these reservoirs acted as a sink for atmospheric co2 in contrast with reservoirs in heavily vegetated boreal and tropical environments that are net sources of co2 to the atmosphere table 4 similary knoll et al 2013 adamczyk and shurin 2015 and soumis et al 2004 reported that temperate reservoirs in usa were small co2 sources to the atmosphere and large carbon sinks as shown in table 4 most reservoirs worldwide emit co2 to the atmosphere when compared to these reservoirs the average diffusive co2 fluxes from the kdr ddr and bdr found in the winter were comparable to some temperate reservoirs e g acton shasta besko and klimkowka boreal reservoirs e g mcarthur falls subtropical reservoirs e g xinanjiang danjiangkou and king talal and global temperate reservoirs 8 8 31 8 mmol m2 d tables 2 and 4 however winter co2 fluxes from the reservoirs in this study were much lower than those from tropical reservoirs for instance co2 fluxes from the kdr ddr and bdr were only 0 25 3 37 and 0 83 of co2 flux from samuel reservoir in brazil respectively tables 2 and 4 on an annual basis estimated negative diffusive co2 fluxes from the kdr ddr and bdr were comparable to some temperate reservoirs such as wallula new melones dworkshak and san diego reservoirs in usa table 4 these reservoirs are also located in semi arid regions where allochthonous organic matter inputs are much lower than in the tropical and boreal regions soumis et al 2004 adamczyk and shurin 2015 co2 emission from global hydroelectric reservoirs has been revised from 48 to 82 tg c as co2 per year barros et al 2011 li and zhang 2014b however more recent work has indicated 36 8 tg c co2 y from all reservoirs deemer et al 2016 this large uncertainty is primarily due to incomplete spatial coverage of the data to our best knowledge there are no studies on co2 fluxes from turkey s hydroelectric reservoirs therefore data on co2 emissions from turkey s reservoirs were unavailable for the global estimates barros et al 2011 aufdenkampe et al 2011 li and zhang 2014b mccully 2006 st louis et al 2000 hertwich 2013 deemer et al 2016 this indicates that current global estimation of co2 emission from reservoirs could be misestimated therefore to improve the estimation of global co2 emissions from hydroelectric reservoirs more data are required particularly in turkey where a large number of hydroelectric reservoirs exist with many planned for the future co2 emissions from reservoirs have been gaining increased attention recently however available data still remain scarce due to limited studies at local and regional scale data scarcity leads to large uncertainties in regional and global co2 emission estimates therefore this study is significant because it contributes to increases in the spatial coverage of co2 emissions from hydroelectric reservoirs in this study the data obtained ten years ago were used to calculate co2 areal fluxes from the reservoirs after ten years in 2018 some changes in the co2 fluxes can occur barros et al 2011 reported that there was a significantly negative correlation between reservoir age and co2 areal fluxes from hydroelectric reservoirs therefore the co2 fluxes from the reservoirs can decrease during the aging process 4 4 water quality of the dam reservoirs according to ph values waters of three reservoirs were mildly alkaline ca2 was the most abundant cation while hco3 was the most abundant anion in the reservoirs due to the abundance of carbonate rocks in the basin varol and li 2017 water quality status of the reservoirs was evaluated by comparing the mean concentrations of water quality variables with the standards for drinking water and surface water quality the mean values of ec no3 cl so4 2 and na were lower than the threshold values set by european drinking water standards ceu 1998 table s8 compared with turkish surface water quality standards mfwa 2012 the reservoirs had high quality waters class i in terms of the mean values of do ph ec cod tn no3 n nh4 n tp and po4 p table s8 5 conclusions in this study pco2 concentrations did not show significant differences between sites in each reservoir and between reservoirs while they showed significant differences between seasons pco2 concentrations were higher in the winter and autumn in three reservoirs while they were lower in the spring and summer strong seasonality of pco2 was controlled by biological co2 uptake through photosynthesis and seasonal variability of temperature and precipitation pco2 had strong positive correlations with secchi disk and cod negative correlations with chl a and do in the winter the reservoirs in this study were undersaturated with co2 in the spring summer and autumn while they were supersaturated with co2 in the winter co2 diffusion fluxes ranged from 2 39 mmol m2 d kralkızı to 32 88 mmol m2 d dicle in the winter season these co2 fluxes in the winter were within global averages for temperate reservoirs while they were lower than global averages for hydroelectric reservoirs the annual negative diffusive

6791,we report evaporation characteristics due to higher heating from above from surfaces having an array of line sources the line sources are created by vertically stacked rectangular plates in a box with water two different types of plates were used in one case line source or film thickness was 66 µm and open area ratio was 4 and in the second case film thickness was 28 µm and 20 was the open area ratio even at the 4 open area ratio the evaporation rate was 85 compared to a bare water surface at the same heat flux lateral conduction of heat from the impervious hotter regions to the line sources and the 2 d nature of diffusion near these tiny line sources enhances the evaporative flux owing to increase in the concentration gradient of water vapour explains the high evaporation rate observed in the present work this system bridges the gap between the understanding of evaporation from bare water surfaces 1 d vapour diffusion and leaf surfaces 3 d vapour diffusion evaporation rates for the fully saturated conditions are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions of suzuki and maeda 1968 and schlünder 1988 the computed surface temperatures and its width wise variation match well with the experimental values we also propose a simple film model for the unsaturated condition of the porous medium and show that the temperature distribution obtained using this model is in reasonably good agreement with the measured values keywords evaporation low open area surfaces line source ir heating capillary film 1 introduction evaporation is an important phenomenon because of its occurrence in diverse fields evaporation may occur from bare water surfaces such as lakes from porous surfaces such as soils and from plants which is known as transpiration in many cases evaporation may not occur from the entire surface but from wet patches that can be of different scales for example transpiration from a plant occurs mainly from stomata on the leaves stomata are tiny holes on a leaf surface and it is believed that in most of the plants they contribute nearly 90 to the total transpiration the total open area of stomata on a leaf surface in majority of the plants is approximately 5 of the leaf area even at such a low area ratio the transpiration from these tiny holes has been reported comparable to a bare water surface there have been many studies related to different aspects of evaporation from stomata see bange 1953 schymanski et al 2017 in particular to understand the evaporation from such low area ratio wet surfaces partially wet surfaces also occur during the evaporation from surfaces of porous media like soils the aim of the present work is to experimentally study evaporation from a surface having water sources in the form of lines the important considerations in evaporation from partially wet surfaces are the size of the opening d the spacing between openings s figs 1 and 2 a whether the mass transfer is to still ambient or a flowing one and whether the surface is heated say by radiation in the case of external flow or heated surface the concentration boundary layer thickness δ m would be a parameter the important non dimensional geometrical parameters are s d and s δ m related to s d is open area ratio θ wet area to total area other parameters enter during drying when some of the liquid vapour menisci leave the pore and settle below the surface while at few other locations the menisci remain at the open end fig 1c the starting point in study of evaporation from stomata is the mass transfer rate from a single and array of circular openings stefan 1881 theoretically showed that mass transfer rate due to diffusion into still ambient from a single circular source was not proportional to its exposed surface area as expected but rather to its the diameter stefan diameter law for an array of sources an important parameter is ratio of the spacing between adjacent sources to the source diameter s d fig 2a shows equiconcentration vapour lines along with the concentration vapour gradient for line 2 d sources for a multi perforate system the experimental results reported in brown and escombe 1900 suggest that the individual vapour shells did not interact with one another when s d 10 ting and loomis 1963 however reported a drastic reduction for s d 10 in the evaporative loss per hole compared to a single hole cooke 1967 assumed still ambient condition in his numerical simulations and found the evaporative flux to decrease with increasing separation parlange and waggoner 1970 reported that the adjacent stomatal influence can be ignored till certain nearly equal to the stomatal spacing distance away from the leaf and further argued that the convective effects in this zone are negligible given the boundary layer thickness is much larger than the stomatal spacing s δ m 1 vesala 1998 reported the 3 d nature of diffusion near the stomatal openings and argued that the effect of wind cannot be ignored in multiple openings and interference caused by surrounding openings is important schlünder 1988 numerically solved the evaporation from a square array of discontinuous hemispherical liquid sources in the presence of wind characterized by a boundary layer thickness recently the ellipsoidal nature of the equiconcentration lines even without the wind over a stoma was captured in the simulations of roth nebelsick 2007 suzuki and maeda 1968 hereafter sm numerically solved the steady mass transfer equation from a periodic array of 2 d sources separated by a fixed distance which they termed as the granular particle size in the context of soils into static fluid the geometry studied by sm is similar to the plate based unconventional porous medium pbpm in the present study they found that with decreasing diameter of the granular particle and increasing number of evaporation sites the evaporation ratio ξ for a fixed open area ratio increases and moves closer to a value of 1 ξ is defined as the ratio of evaporation rate from a partially wet surface such as soil or leaf to that from the bare water surface shahraeeni et al 2012 numerically extended the work of sm and lehmann et al 2008 and investigated the effect of boundary layer and the advection term in evaporation from leaf like surfaces in the presence of wind from a matrix of interconnected capillaries with variable diameter they reported that in case of a stefan tube type evaporation scenario where liquid level receded in selected capillaries contribution of the diffusion term becomes important and therefore cannot be neglected in the formulation besides soils soil like surfaces kumar and arakeri 2018a b and leaves evaporation from partially wet surfaces occurs in other contexts such as the unique ones considered in kumar and arakeri 2018c d perforated systems are widely used in order to reduce the amount of water loss from bare water bodies such as lakes and swimming pools these systems employ partial covers where most of the water surface is covered with the impervious solid surfaces while leaving out a small fraction of total area in order to allow diffusion of air into the water bodies covers used to minimize evaporation include reflective surfaces cooley and myers 1973 an array of square holes assouline et al 2010 2011 cylindrical floats burston 2002 wire nets alvarez et al 2006 and more recently floating discs and spheres even the more recent experiments assouline et al 2010 were carried in the laboratory in the absence of any heat source mean wind speed based haghighi and or 2013 concentration boundary layer thickness turns out to be about 4 mm and 3 5 cm for mean speeds of 1 m s and 0 1 m s respectively by keeping the open area same assouline et al 2010 replaced a single hole by a distributed pattern of holes they also studied the effect of varying exposed area fraction one important inference from their study was higher mass loss from a distributed pattern of holes compared to a single hole for the same exposed area fraction in another set of experiments they observed that nearly 87 58 and 29 of water is lost from the distributed square hole patterns having exposed area fractions of about 69 33 and 10 respectively note that for these values of area fractions the edge length of the square hole size was respectively about 6 0 cm 4 1 cm and 2 2 cm these experimentally observed data suggest two major points first the mass loss is not directly proportional to the exposed surface area second stefan diameter law seems to be followed since the mass loss is nearly proportional to the edge length of the square holes interestingly even when the hole sizes are relatively large stefan diameter law is still valid note that for lower wind speeds δ m is of the same order as the edge length of the holes now we present some relevant analytical results in the absence of the boundary layer analytical solution for the latent heat loss q evap w from a single circular opening with a m as its radius placed in an infinite plane is given following cooke 1967 and birdi et al 1989 by 1 q evap 4 a λ d a c s where λ kj kg is the latent heat of vaporization of the liquid d a m2 s is the binary diffusivity of liquid vapour c s kg m3 is the concentration of liquid vapour at the liquid vapour interface note that eq 1 gives the mass loss from an opening in an infinite plane to be directly proportional to its diameter rather than the area for a square periodic array of openings having a spacing of s m between the holes the evaporative flux per opening q evap o p e n i n g in the presence of wind is given schlünder 1988 by 2 q evap o p e n i n g d a c s c a λ θ δ m 2 π a π 4 θ π 4 θ 1 where θ m2 m2 is the surface water content given as the ratios of the opening area to the unit cell area c a kg m3 is the concentration of liquid vapour in the medium and δ m m is the concentration boundary layer thickness the second term in the denominator of eq 2 essentially represents the interference term caused by the neighbouring openings this term is always positive and hence eq 2 cannot be used when θ π 4 since it becomes negative note that eq 2 is valid only when the opening diameter is much higher than the mean free path 10 7 m of the vapours phase the evaporative flux over the unit cell q evap can be obtained as 3 q evap θ q evap o p e n i n g d a c s c a λ δ m 2 π a π 4 θ π 4 θ 1 thus for a given area ratio θ the evaporative flux from a surface containing a periodic array of sources depends on the source radius a and relative boundary layer thickness lower a yields higher flux for finite θ but a δ m 0 eq 3 becomes 4 lim a δ m 0 q evap d a c s c a λ δ m eq 4 is also valid for a bare water surface a leaf is a classic example of such a case where the stomatal dimension 20 μ m is negligible compared to δ m the above equations were proposed for an isothermal case i e in absence of any external heating recently a few studies aminzadeh and or 2014 2017 have extended the above relations for cases with heating in these studies δ m was determined by the wind while c s was governed by the incoming heat most of the earlier studies have been with finite circular or square sources except sm which considered 2 d sources the present work reports an experimental study of evaporation from an array of line sources the line sources are created by a packed stack of vertical glass plates containing water in between them for one set of experiments 1 8 mm glass plates were used and in the second set 0 13 mm thick cover slips were used in both cases the width of the source d δ m whereas θ in the former is 4 and is 20 in the latter the glass plate case thus represents a leaf like situation except that the source is a line and not circular one aim of the present study is to characterize the evaporation from such a low open area ratio surface the stack of vertical plates may be considered to be a porous medium which is very different from the usual porous media consisting of 3 d tortuous pores for example as found in soils a second aim of the present study is to measure the evaporation rate characteristics with time of an initially saturated pbpm and compare them with those found in a standard porous medium the 1 d pore geometry in pbpm is clearly much simpler compared to the pore structure in a porous medium consisting of spheres further the evaporated vapours in a pbpm can only diffuse in two directions vertically above and across the plate thickness the vapour diffusion is thus 2 d this simpler model porous system at higher saturation values can be considered as a bridge between understanding evaporation from a bare water surface and a leaf surface where vapour diffusion is 1 d and 3 d respectively the unique elements of the present study are characterizing evaporation from a periodic array of thin line sources of water under controlled heating from above using infrared radiation such a study has not been reported in the literature and one important contribution is comparison of evaporation characteristics of pbpm and conventional porous media 2 experimental methodology we used vertically stacked smooth glass plates gp and cover slips cs space between two consecutive surfaces forming the line sources of water and study the transient evaporation from this plate based porous medium pbpm the stacks can be seen in fig 2c d consisting of gp and cs respectively the important parameters of the present study are given in table 1 the porosity ϕ 4th column of table 1 is calculated by measuring the total water mass in the fully saturated pbpm water is essentially trapped in between the plates and between the plates and the container boundaries the obtained average water film thicknesses d in case of gp and cs were nearly 66 μ m and 28 μ m and the average inter pore spacing s is about 28 and 5 times d respectively covering an order of magnitude also we chose the material thicknesses last column of table 1 such as to cover an order of magnitude variation in this length scale fig 2b shows a schematic of the experimental setup evaporation from the porous medium was boosted by the infrared ir heating from the top a precision weighing balance sartorius gpa5202 measured the mass loss with an accuracy of 0 01 g temperature of the ambient t a and the container bottom surface t bot was measured using t type thermocouples relative humidity was measured using a sensor honeywell hih 4000 ambient temperature and relative humidity were measured away from the experiment zone in order to avoid any radiation effects to minimize heat loss the container was insulated on the four sides and at the bottom the top surface temperature was measured with an ir camera the ir images were taken after blocking the radiation for a few seconds in order to measure the true temperature this procedure avoids the reflected ir component if the radiation is not blocked the reflected radiation from the surface results in an increase of 5 6 c in the measured temperature of the ir camera for the case of glass which has an emissivity of 0 92 the experiments were performed in the laboratory conditions we measured the evaporation rate in case of a bare water surface by putting extra water 2 3 mm on top of the fully saturated stack of plates the rest of the paper is organised as follows we discuss results from isothermal evaporation of a single water film trapped between two smooth plates in section 3 1 this is to understand the movement of the water air interface in the film the main experiments are with stacks of vertical plates with the ir heating from above the results of evaporation and the surface temperature distribution captured using ir camera from this set of experiments are discussed in sections 3 2 and 3 3 respectively they are also compared with the existing results in literature on standard porous media numerical investigation is discussed in section 3 4 which is split in two parts viz fully saturated and unsaturated cases we conclude in section 4 3 results and discussion 3 1 isothermal evaporation from a film between two glass plates we first discuss the isothermal case where evaporation occurs in absence of any external heat source for this purpose we selected commercially available standard glass micro slides 25 mm 75 mm with an average thickness of 1 3 mm these glass micro slides are very smooth with an average roughness 100 nm as quoted by the manufacturer blue star the slides were cleaned prior to the experiment water is introduced from one of the shorter faces in between the two slides which are pressed tightly against each other the final configuration obtained is a thin film of water sandwiched between the two slides for better contrast water is coloured using kmno4 particles which turns it pink the slide film slide sfs system was kept vertical and was photographed during evaporation this system is the simplest configuration for study of evaporation from a film between smooth plates experiments were done with two configurations one in which only the top is open and the sides and bottom are sealed and the second where all the four sides are open fig 3 a shows the progress of the drying front for only the top open case where mass transfer to the ambient can happen only from the top mass of the trapped water in this case is nearly 17 mg which corresponds to d 9 μ m for this experiment the bottom face was sealed after the water had risen to the top completely during the sealing process a small amount of water evaporates the instance chosen as t 0 corresponds to the time just after sealing with time the interface which is curved moves away from the left face and downwards but all along with part of the interface remaining at the top right corner thus there is always hydraulic connectivity shown with arrows fig 3a to the top open face from the bulk the rate at which the bulk recedes is seen much faster compared to the film shrinkage for bare water surface an evaporation rate of 2 3 mm d is expected in these conditions with no external heat source in the present evaporating film case a 75 mm water column evaporates in approximately 3 h taking into account only the film area 9 µm 25 mm the average evaporation rate turns out to be 600 mm d but if we include the plate thickness in the area 2 6 mm 25 mm for estimating evaporation we get an average evaporation rate of about 2 mm d an important observation is that the film extends to the top till almost all the water gets evaporated films reaching to the top are also observed in drying of initially saturated soils during the so called constant rate period crp of course geometries of the films are much more complex in the latter for the case where all the four sides are open we see the drying interface moves predominantly from left to right for that particular experiment fig 3b the bottom face is on the ground which would have inhibited mass loss from this face evaporation must be happening from the whole water air interface but mostly from the right side where the interface is directly in contact with the ambient for the interface within the system the vapour has to diffuse from inside to the ambient leading to a lower rate of evaporation there water would be flowing towards the higher evaporating faces as shown by arrows in the figure at t 15 min the film width decreases continuously and at t 90 min the film becomes very thin stretched throughout the slide length 75 mm the film then ruptures as seen at t 95 min and liquid trails are seen collapsing and moving towards the top and bottom faces simultaneously access to a fast video showing the full process has been mentioned in the acknowledgement section rupture occurred within 4 s suggesting that the liquid velocity was very high 2 cm s at the time of rupture compared to the evaporation rate the evaporation rate is about two times higher for the case with all the sides open compared to the case with only top side open 90 min versus 170 min for complete evaporation the experiments were repeated several times for both the cases and in all the attempts similar movements of the film were observed in evaporation from conventional porous media cpm film rupture is believed to lead to stage 2 of evaporation or the receding front period rfp recently thiery et al 2017 have shown that stage 2 in a cpm is a result of vanishing surface water content as the film simply recedes within the medium rather than breaking up the experiments of the evaporating film between glass plates is somewhat similar to the stefan problem of an evaporating liquid evaporating in a vertical tube with the liquid meniscus going down with time in both the stefan tube and our experiments the latent heat required for phase change at the lv meniscus comes from the ambient via conduction through the walls 3 2 non isothermal evaporation from a stack of smooth plates characteristic curves in this section we present the evaporation characteristics in the presence of ir heating of the pbpm i e vertically stacked plates with the water films between plates forming the thin line sources two significant differences between the single film isothermal and the pbpm non isothermal experiments apart from the external heating are 1 d 50 µm in non isothermal is larger compared to the isothermal case where d 10 µm and 2 the presence of a container which helps in maintaining the hydraulic connectivity between two or more thin films at the container bottom surface the first point changes the ratio θ d s which is expected to affect the evaporation contribution from each of the sources the second point can be related to the theoretical model by lehmann et al 2008 where two dissimilar capillaries were shown to be hydraulically connected note that even for the case with external heat load e g of about 1000 w m2 since open area ratio is small most of the heat gets transferred to the lv menisci between the plates from the top surface of the plates by lateral conduction will be discussed in detail in the numerical results section water receives only a small portion of the ir heat directly for the experiments a fully saturated pbpm was prepared initially after which a thin 2 3 mm layer of water was added to its top this extra layer gives the evaporation rate of a bare water surface or the potential evaporation rate fig 4 a shows the measured evaporation rates versus the degree of saturation s s is the ratio of mass of water at any instant to the mass of water when the pbpm is fully saturated the bare water evaporation rate under the ir radiation was 21 5 mm d the evaporation rates at s 1 were 20 mm d and 19 5 mm d for the cs and gp cases respectively the reduction in the evaporation rate compared to when water was exposed is due to reduced surface area for evaporation since the solid surfaces are now exposed and partially because some of ir radiation gets reflected by the top surface of plates the reflected ir radiation component is slightly more than for the bare water surface 3 2 1 initial evaporation leaf like behaviour it is important to note that at s 1 the evaporation rates are nearly same although open area ratios for the two pbpm are different θ 0 035 and 0 2 in gp and cs cases respectively this essentially means that the contribution of each line source in the gp case is much higher than their cs counterpart we see thus that a small exposed area 4 in gp of water is able to evaporate at a rate almost equal to that of bare water however with increased exposed area 20 in cs the evaporation rate does not increase 5 times the vapour shells in this case start interacting with one another increasing the resistance to vapour diffusion these results of 2 d vapour diffusion are similar to those obtained from 3 d vapour diffusion from leaves and leaf like surfaces bange 1953 kumar and arakeri 2017 two similarities between a pbpm and a leaf are a similar open area fractions about 5 and b similar length scales line source widths and stomatal size one main difference is that in leaves the pores are point sources whereas in the present case we have line sources 3 2 2 evaporation with time different stages the initial evaporation rates for the two cases gp and cs are nearly same as that from a bare water surface with time the evaporation rates for the two cases show different behaviours fig 4a the cs case shows the existence of the three typical stages of evaporation found in a cpm viz a stage 1 where evaporation rates remain high and comparable to bare water bodies b transition regime and c stage 2 where drastic reduction in the evaporation rates are clearly seen these stages have been observed established and well documented lehmann et al 2008 kumar and arakeri 2018a in cpm like soils for the gp case also three stages are observed but with one main difference during stage 1 the evaporation rate is not nearly constant but reduces gradually followed by the transition regime where a drastic drop in evaporation rate is observed during stage 1 the lower evaporation rate in case of the gp is partly due to much lower open area fraction of 4 compared to 20 in the cs case however ratio of the rates of evaporation from 1 to 0 6 in gp and cs cases in stage 1 is higher than their porosity ratio 0 22 this high evaporation rate in gp case is due to the diminished interference and thus reduced resistance to the vapours motion between the individual vapour shells compared to the cs case where it is significantly higher mainly because the cover slips are thin additional complications arise when the concentration boundary layer thickness is of the order of d o r s whichever is larger the liquid vapour interface or the drying front between each pair of glass plates can evolve with time in different ways one possibility a is part of the interface can be always at the top and rest of the interface being curved and receding down with time as was observed in sfs case fig 3a the second possibility b is the interfaces are horizontal and move down at different rates it is also possible that some of the interfaces are at the top during stage 1 while the other interfaces recede with time the main difference between sfs and pbpm is that in the latter the films between the plates are interconnected through the sides and bottom of the container a water film can feed another which can happen when the gap between one set of glass plates is smaller than the gap between another set water can then flow from the wider gap to the narrower gap due to capillary forces as had been proposed by lehmann et al 2008 for movement of water from wider to narrower gaps in cpm in both the cases a and b the locally higher pore size s acts as the source of water for the locally smaller pore size and in turn reduces the total effective open area for evaporation as the thicker films recede away from the exposed surface in case a the pore size variation is across a single gap whereas in case b the pore size difference comes from different gap sizes saturation values at the end of the stage 1 are approximately 0 3 and 0 4 for the gp and cs cases respectively these values correspond to an average depth liquid gas interface of 70 mm and 36 mm respectively this difference may be due to 1 smoother and hence lower film thicknesses gp compared to the cs and 2 significant variation in the value of d across multiple films in both the cases we now discuss the temperature characteristics of both the pbpm which is needed to make the study complete in relation to the evaporation rate fig 5 shows ir images at different times for the experiments with the two pbpm such images are used to get the average temperature of the pbpm top surface first we will discuss the average surface temperature t s k temperature averaged over the entire exposed top surface information in the next section we will discuss some aspects of the spatial variation of the surface temperature fig 4b shows the variation of t s with s we see that t s in stage 1 for cs is lower than gp case while the evaporation rate fig 4a was higher the incident ir heat flux of 940 w m2 goes into latent heat of evaporation sensible heat storage in the porous medium and losses to the ambient due to reflection convection and radiation the storage component is small compared to the other components at least in stage 1 thus any reduction in evaporation rate must be accompanied by an increase in surface temperature to increase the radiative and convective losses kumar and arakeri 2018b this trend is observed in fig 4b for the cs case during stage 1 there is small reduction in evaporation rate and correspondingly a small increase in t s comparatively for the gp case during stage 1 there is larger increase in t s corresponding to the large reduction in evaporation rate during the transition period for both gp and cs cases large increase in t s are observed due to the drastic fall in the evaporation rates in stage 2 the evaporation rates are very low and t s reach about 54 c when almost all the incident ir energy is lost to the ambient in comparison t s 37 c at the beginning of the experiment a similar inverse relationship between evaporation rate and t s has been observed in experiments with cpm kumar and arakeri 2018a b the difference in the values of t s in stages 1 and 2 reduces with lower incident heat flux and is thus very small in isothermal cases note that in case of bare water surface its t s will be fixed for a constant incident heat while in case of a porous medium it changes not only during the stages but also within stage 1 it is thus clear that ξ cannot be simply estimated by taking the ratio of its instantaneous evaporation rate to that of the bare water we will discuss this point in the next section in detail 3 2 3 non isothermal evaporation from a stack of smooth plates ir images we now discuss the spatial distributions of the surface temperature captured using the ir camera shown in fig 5 the images are shown at three different values of s viz 1 0 60 and 0 20 for both the cs and pbpm cases both were in stage 1 at s 0 60 and in stage 2 at s 0 20 see fig 4a colours representing different temperatures in increasing order are magenta blue cyan green yellow orange red white colour in the images represents surface of vertical walls of the container even at s 1 we see that the near wall regions are slightly hotter than the inner regions as seen in fig 5a and d however in both of these images most of the top surface has uniform colder temperatures t s 36 5 c 37 c these regions directly correlate to the presence of water as discussed above with time the films can recede in different ways at similar saturation s 0 60 in case of cs the wet region still occupies a large portion of the surface the evaporation rate is higher and temperatures are lower as compared to the gp case see fig 5e for both the gp and cs cases the portion occupied by the wet regions slowly decreases and eventually vanishes during the transition after which in stage 2 much higher values of t s can be seen in fig 5c and f as discussed above the water level can vary within the gap between adjacent plates and across plate gaps surface temperature is an indirect indication of the water level a lower surface temperature indicates that the water level locally is closer to the top surface we look at variations of surface temperature along five lines shown in fig 5b this is for the gp case at s 0 6 three of the lines hc hb and ht are horizontal in the image along the plates and two lines vc vr are drawn vertical across the thicknesses of the plates pixels increase from left to right and top to bottom along the horizontal and vertical lines respectively at this instant s 0 59 the region near the bottom left corner of the image is relatively colder by about 1 c than the rest of the area and is reflected in the temperatures along the various lines in fig 5g we expect the water level to be closer to the surface in the colder region where locally the evaporation rate would be higher the higher temperature along ht implies a lower water level in the right half of hc the temperature is seen higher and approaching that of ht suggesting this region of hc is drained this situation is similar to the single void case fig 3 where one part of the gap gets drained first note that once preferential evaporation begins in a single line source of water diffusion of water vapours is possible along the plate widths also we see that there are fluctuations 0 2 c in temperature over small spatial scale of the order of few pixels more so along the vertical lines the number of pixels is between 3 and 4 along the thickness 1 85 mm of the glass plates to make the spatial variation clearer the data points are marked along vc in fig 5h temperature away from the line source and towards the centre of the plate is expected to increase since the rate of mass transfer decreases along this direction temperature should be the highest at the centre of the glass plate all the temperature peaks are not clear in fig 5h however most of these peaks are seen along vc in the wet low temperature region at locations with pixel numbers 24 31 37 42 45 48 52 55 58 64 67 75 79 82 and 88 3 3 comparison with results of suzuki and maeda 1968 s 1 we compare our experimental results with predictions of suzuki and maeda 1968 and of schlünder 1988 both of which assumed isothermal conditions in the present investigation because of the incident ir heating the surface temperature is higher than the ambient temperature and the models have to incorporate relevant changes for the non isothermal conditions we use results from a heated plate kept horizontally for this purpose the relevant rayleigh number ra is given as 5 ra g δ ρ ρ l ν α where δ ρ kg m3 is the difference in density of the gas phase air water vapour at the surface and in the ambient ρ kg m3 is the average gas phase density l m is a length scale equal to the ratio of area to the perimeter of the evaporating surface ν m2 s and α m2 s are the kinematic and thermal diffusivities of the gas phase respectively water vapours were assumed to follow the ideal gas law for calculating the density saturated vapour pressure was estimated using antoine equation in the present study ra is around 103 nusselt number nu is calculated using the standard nu ra correlation of lloyd and moran 1974 6 nu 0 59 r a 0 25 200 r a 10 4 the average thermal δ t m and mass δ m m boundary layer thicknesses are given as 7 δ t l nu δ m δ t l e 1 3 where le is lewis number defined as the ratio of thermal and mass diffusivities it is important to note that δ m using eq 7 takes values which are very different than the isothermal cases in the experiments presented here there is no mean wind in the plane of the evaporating medium we now discuss in brief the work of suzuki and maeda 1968 sm hereafter who numerically considered the problem of evaporation essentially a 2 d diffusion problem from periodically spaced discontinuous sources of water as sketched in fig 6 a unit cell is shown which considers half of the dry and half wet surfaces they solved for the concentration in the unit cell of the evaporated vapours while considering various cases such as stagnant boundary layer uniform flow within the boundary layer etc our experimental condition is similar to that of a stagnant boundary layer and can be treated as an extension of sm with the addition of temperature effects mass loss is obtained by solving the 2 d concentration diffusion equation which in steady state is given as 8 2 c x 2 2 c z 2 0 where c is vapour concentration x is taken across the plates and z is taken vertically upwards against the gravity the boundary conditions required to solve eq 8 are 9a c c s a t z 0 s 2 x s d 2 9b c c a a t z δ m 9c c z 0 a t z 0 0 x s 2 9d c x 0 a t x 0 a n d s d 2 eqs 9a and 9b represent the constant vapour concentration conditions for the lv interface and in the ambient respectively non penetrative condition eq 9c is used at the dry surface while periodic boundary condition eq 9d is used for mid planes of the dry and wet surfaces solving eq 8 with the boundary conditions eq 9 the evaporation ratios ξ is given following sm by 10 ξ 2 δ m s d 1 c s c a 0 s d 2 c z z 0 d x we now compare our experimental results with the numerical predictions of sm in the present set of parameters note that we have estimated the evaporation rate of a bare water surface at the measured t s and ambient conditions following kumar and arakeri 2015 for both the experiments corresponding to the values of θ and δ m s d value of ξ was extracted fig 4 in sm this value is seen in 9th column of table 2 where the experimentally obtained values of ξ are also seen both solutions of sm and the present experimental results indicates that the evaporation ratio for thicker gp at s 1 is lower than the thinner cs for the case of cs the value is in close agreement with sm however for gp case we obtained higher ξ compared to the prediction by sm this possibly could be due to the nature of the boundary layer in the present experiments clearly the local perforations affect the equiconcentration lines depending on their size and spacing we can further use schlunder s solution eq 3 to evaluate ξ 11 ξ 1 1 2 π a δ m π 4 θ π 4 θ 1 experimentally obtained values of ξ agrees very well with the solution eq 11 proposed by schlünder 1988 although the solution was proposed for equally spaced square array of circular openings using eq 2 we estimated q evap o p e n i n g to be about 14106 1 w m2 and 2996 7 w m2 for gp and cs respectively mass transfer from 66 µm line source in gp is about 4 7 times more than from 28 µm line source in cs this difference is attributed mainly to the higher thickness of the gp which allowed more space for 2 d diffusion assuming diffusion to be specular the vapour shells from the line sources need to travel s 2 across the plate thickness in order to interact with one another if δ m s 0 5 then the vapour shells interact in both pbpm this criterion is satisfied note that this interference occurs earlier for cs case which resulted in lower q evap o p e n i n g evaporation is expected to be 2 d till a vertical distance away from the plate s top surface of s 2 after which the diffusion lines approach 1 d due to the interference until the boundary layer beyond the boundary layer convection takes over as the primary mode of mass and heat transport we have discussed mass transport from discontinuous sources when the liquid vapour menisci are at the top s 1 we shift our attention to the transient behaviour of evaporation fig 4a when the open area fraction reduces during stage 1 recently shahraeeni et al 2012 extended the model by sm to capture the effect contribution towards total evaporation of receding lv menisci in chosen locations where locally d is higher 3 4 numerical investigations the numerical investigations were done on a model system primarily to get an idea of the heat budget and to understand the observed surface temperatures we do two types of simulations one for the case s 1 and the other for s 1 some of the incoming radiation is lost to the ambient reflected radiation radiative and convective losses some goes into latent heat and some is conducted down through the plates heat transfer within the plate for the case when s 1 happens as follows plate s top surface receives heat a part of which gets conducted to the lv meniscus leading to phase change rest of the heat is conducted along the plate height and is consumed as sensible heat leading to increase in the overall temperature of the system one important question is related to the temperature variation within the glass plate we have used comsol multiphysics a commercial package in order to model evaporation from lv menisci for s 1 fully saturated case and from the film for s 1 unsaturated cases the formulation details are given in the appendix fig 7 3 4 1 s 1 fully saturated case we use the measured evaporation rates fig 4 to give q out using eqs a7 and 2 which is assumed to happen over a finite film length l f assumed to be 1 mm note that the value of l f is reasonable jasvanth et al 2016 and the results are not very sensitive to the actual value fig 8 a shows the sub surface temperature distribution in the unit cell and fig 8b shows the isotemperature contours the 0 location in fig 8 denotes the middle of the plate while 0 9 represents the heat sink region where phase change occurs two major conclusions can be drawn from fig 8 first the temperature difference between the coldest and the hottest point on the plate surface is only about 0 15 c for lower plate thicknesses like cover slips this difference will be even smaller second the lateral heat conduction which is confined to a vertical distance of about l f provides the path way for the final evaporation that happens in the film this lateral conduction of the heat is the major reason behind sustained high evaporation rates from these low porosity surfaces the numerical simulation results also confirm the experimental observation of 1 c variation of t s when s 1 the experimental data fig 5h agrees reasonably well with the numerical simulation results we now shift our attention towards modelling the unsaturated cases where s 1 3 4 2 s 1 case in order to capture the temperature distributions on the surface and in the sub surface regions of pbpm 3 d simulations were performed in the unsaturated conditions s 1 fig 9 a shows a schematic picture of a typical film for s 1 case between two plates most of the evaporation is likely to occur from the film that is at the top isothermal investigation suggests that evaporation contribution from the receded part of the film reduces drastically with its distance from the top open end shahraeeni et al 2012 further chauvet et al 2009 and keita et al 2016 have suggested that most of the mass loss is contributed by a finite layer 1 cm near the open end for modelling purpose we replace the curved film with a vertical one fig 9b the width of the film region b y 0 is assumed to be equal to s 12 y 0 b 1 s where b is the plate width and y o is the distance of the wet region from the dry plate end in the vertical film model vfm all the evaporation occurs over this width b y 0 and the vertical extent l f fig 9b as in the formulation for s 1 case we assume l f to be 1 mm change in l f value has little impact on the temperature distribution using mass loss data obtained experimentally q evap o p e n i n g is calculated as 13 q evap o p e n i n g 1 86 4 λ θ e where e mm day is the evaporation rate note that in our model the film width reduces with time this reduces evaporation area and q out is given by 14 q out l f b y 0 q evap o p e n i n g d 2 b using eqs 12 and 14 we get 15 q out q evap o p e n i n g d 2 1 l f 1 s boundary conditions at the top face are given by eqs a3 and a6 while at the face replacing the film is given by eq 15 we perform transient simulations considering the full plate length note that vfm is a 3 d transient model the initial temperature of the plate full is fixed at 26 7 c the ambient temperature we first look at the average surface temperature t s obtained from the model and compare with the experimental calibrated with an accuracy of 1 temperature averaged over the entire pbpm surface table 3 lists the parameters required for the individual models along with the respective predicted surface temperature data t s averaged over the unit cell for the glass plate s case also listed is the experimentally obtained last column surface temperature t s averaged over the entire pbpm the heat transfer coefficient h does not vary significantly from about 8 5 w m2k at s 1 to about 10 5 w m2k at s 0 1 during the entire evaporation process the evaporation rate obtained in the experiment is in good agreement with the theory eq 2 at s 1 column 2 table 3 fig 10 shows the t s obtained from the model and from experiments at different s values from the table 3 and fig 10 the very simple model predicts the surface temperature well note that at s 0 26 stage 1 is about to end fig 4a while s 0 1 belongs to the 2nd stage of evaporation an assumption made in the model is that evaporation occurs only from the exposed film at the top and not from the interior interface this assumption is valid chauvet et al 2009 keita et al 2016 as evaporation contribution from deeper regions of lv menisci reduces drastically since these regions are exposed to nearly saturated conditions within the pore in stage 2 i e after the transition the lv meniscus would recede from the exposed surface and be near horizontal in this simplified 1 d pore geometry and the vfm is inappropriate a modified formulation of the stefan problem shahraeeni et al 2012 would better represent the physical situation we have also observed in the simulations that if q in o r i is changed by 5 t s changes by 2 c respectively we now discuss the spatial temperature distribution on the surface and below the surface fig 11 a shows the variation of surface temperature along the plate width direction for different s values the film moves from left to right as s reduces with its value given by eq 14 the arrows in fig 11a indicate the vertical film location at s 1 the temperature is constant 37 5 c with time as s reduces and the vertical interface moves to the right the surface temperature becomes non uniform with dry portion 0 y y 0 having higher temperatures compared to the wet portion y 0 y b and wet affected zones the maximum difference in the hottest and the coldest location is initially small 25 c at s 0 90 and increases to about 5 c at s 0 40 and 0 26 with time as noted above the average surface temperature increases as may be seen in fig 11a at s 0 1 the temperature is again nearly uniform and equal to approximately 52 c simulations for smaller plate thickness show that this temperature difference reduces at s 0 40 for cs it was 1 5 c compared to 6 5 c for gp case from the transient simulations we get the sub surface temperature distribution with time fig 11b shows the height wise variation of the local temperature at different s values obtained from vfm we chose to show t z curves at the mid plate y 20 5 mm position note that z 100 mm represents the bottom of the plates the variation in temperature in the vertical direction is much smaller than the variation on the surface the measured immediately after the container bottom wall temperature values are mentioned in the caption at lower s values vfm predicts much higher values for t bot compared to the measurements for ex at s 0 60 obtained t bot is about 41 c and 36 5 c from vfm and experiments respectively the simulations are performed with an initial condition where full plate was at the ambient temperature t a the simple model does not capture all the dynamics and boundary conditions of the actual system and may account for the discrepancy between prediction and measurement of t bot we conclude that the model predicted the top surface temperature accurately but failed to predict the bottom surface temperature we finally try to understand the impact of film positioning on the plate surface temperature in the vfm we assumed the film to recede starting from the left part of the plate in the experiments however the films in adjacent gaps can recede in different ways for example in one gap the film may recede on the left hand side and in an adjacent gap it may recede on the right hand side to model this situation we consider two cases of two adjacent films fig 12 for case a both the films recede from the left side same as the case considered above with a single film in the other configuration case b the films are on the opposite sides the resulting surface temperature variation along the plate width is seen in fig 12 the value of s 0 6 the maximum and minimum temperatures in case a are about 44 c and 39 c respectively the temperature difference is thus nearly 5 c in contrast for case b the temperature variation has evened out and the difference is reduced to only about 1 c the maximum temperature has reduced by 2 c while the minimum temperature increases by 2 c compared to case a as expected the temperature minimum occurs at the centre of the plate since this is the region where there is overlap of the films it is important to mention that t s remained same for both case a and case b fig 12 also shows an experimental t s curve at s 0 60 the ir image fig 5b is converted to an array of temperature data 320 data points in the horizontal direction and 240 data points in the vertical we then limited our data points such that only the pbpm top surface is analyzed temperature is averaged vertically corresponding to all the horizontal positions we finally obtain the vertically averaged t s which is seen plotted versus the plate width in fig 12 the obtained temperature profile is similar to that of case b 4 conclusions we experimentally investigated evaporation from thin line sources of water while heating from above the aim of the study was to understand the high evaporation rates found from porous surfaces such as leaves having low open area ratios the present study where the vapour diffusion is 2 d can be thought as the bridge between 1 d diffusion of vapours in case of bare water bodies and 3 d diffusion in case of leaves the porous medium in the present study consisted of thin line sources of water formed between adjacent smooth and flat plates the diffusion of vapours in these cases were 2 d the plates were stacked close to one another such that the space between the two plates is of the order of a few microns two different plates were studied having 4 and 20 as the exposed percentage area further we studied the effect of evaporating dimensions and dry width in such systems the sub surface temperature distribution has been obtained numerically using intuitive models even with the simplest possible void with a water film between two smooth glass plates the evaporation process is complex the periodic array of line sources formed with stack of glass plates pbpm is more complicated compared to the single film the parameter θ ratio of film width to the dry width is important in deciding the total evaporation rate at least when s 1 a higher value of this ratio cover slips case yields evaporation rates which are nearly equal to that of a bare water surface even with a lower θ evaporation rate was higher at least near high saturations lateral conduction of heat from hotter dry regions to the evaporating locations is the reason for this high evaporation rate with a constant incident flux we have shown that the surface temperature is coupled with the evaporation rate sustained a lower evaporation rate always meaning a higher surface temperature the evaporation ratios ξ for the two different types of pbpm at s 1 agreed well with the theory for an array of circular holes and reasonably well with the numerical simulations of suzuki and maeda 1968 this case of high saturation values of a pbpm may also be considered as a 2 d leaf note that ξ has been estimated based on the average surface temperature and not on the incident heat flux on the exposed surface it would be interesting to investigate the case where the porosities are even lower such that half of the plate width would exceed the concentration boundary layer thickness in connection to the soils where capillary films form due to difference in the void sizes between the particles here also the films formed due to tiny differences in the 1 d void sizes between different plates the flatness and roughness of the plates in a pbpm is therefore crucial further in pbpm three stages of evaporation were observed similar to that of a conventional porous medium stage 1 higher evaporation rate at s 1 was supported by the presence of water near the exposed surface which were colder as seen in ir images stage 1 is sustained due to the formation of film s which was simulated using a simplified model vfm the model predicted the average surface temperature accurately vfm also showed that the temperature variation across the plate width is very small for the given heat input the present vfm model can be in future extended to a purely 3 d model where a 3 d film as in soils can be considered the film width investigated in the present study is between 10 µm and 66 µm these dimensions strongly supported the formation of capillary films if the film width is 1 mm such dominant films will not form evaporation from such a unit cell is similar to stefan tube like situation shahraeeni et al 2012 where the rate of mass loss decays rapidly in stacks of such unit cells film can still form as a result of differences in the neighbouring film widths lehmann et al 2008 and relatively higher evaporation rates can still be expected declaration of interest we declare that the research in the

s 1 case fig 7 a shows a 2d schematic side view of the pbpm at s 1 similar to sm we perform 2 d simulations while considering the full height h of the plates and discuss the results for gp case cs case can be extended easily since the film area is small compared to the solid area θ 4 we assume that the films do not receive heat directly via radiation from the ir heater but via conduction through the solid surfaces plates in the unit cell the top side receives intercepts ir radiations and get heated which then conducts to different sub surface regions of the plate and eventually to the lv menisci through the liquid where evaporation phase change occurs the problem is thus heat conduction within the plates and mass transfer at the menisci in the steady state 2 d heat conduction equation is a1 2 t 2 x 2 t 2 z 0 the unit cell in fig 7a is simplified and is shown in fig 7b latent heat released at the lv interface is treated as a heat release term from the nearest boundary right side of the control volume dashed line in fig 7b represents the location of the lv meniscus not scaled to true dimensions ideally at s 1 the lv meniscus would be flat but for simplicity we consider the situation where s 1 for example 0 999 0 99 etc since meniscus depth or film length l f m is manually defined seen in fig 7a it is important to study its effect the boundary conditions used for the model are 1 top side q in h since heat is intercepted here and is also exposed to the ambient two conditions each for heat flux and heat transfer coefficient are required in order to define this side a heat flux condition for this side can be written in terms of conservation of surface energy eq a2 in the steady state as a2 i q cond q conv q rad q ref q in q rad q ref where i w m2 is the incoming heat flux q cond w m2 is the heat flux conducted from the surface to the sub surface regions q conv w m2 and q rad w m2 are respectively the convective and radiative heats from the surface into the ambient and q ref w m2 is the reflected heat flux from the surface which depends on its emissivity q ref 1 s i note that q in w m2 is the amount of heat flux incident on the exposed top surface eq a2 can also be written as a3 q in s i q rad where s is the emissivity estimated with an accuracy of 0 01 of the material eq a3 is used as an inflow heat flux term for the top side in terms of fluid

correlation is accurate within 5 condition used in the simulation is horizontal plate placed upside with external natural convection note that ra is based on δ t t s t a however in actual case it should also include density variation due to change in water vapour concentration near the evaporating surface and in the ambient 2 left side t x since it cuts the plate in two equal halves a symmetry

6791,we report evaporation characteristics due to higher heating from above from surfaces having an array of line sources the line sources are created by vertically stacked rectangular plates in a box with water two different types of plates were used in one case line source or film thickness was 66 µm and open area ratio was 4 and in the second case film thickness was 28 µm and 20 was the open area ratio even at the 4 open area ratio the evaporation rate was 85 compared to a bare water surface at the same heat flux lateral conduction of heat from the impervious hotter regions to the line sources and the 2 d nature of diffusion near these tiny line sources enhances the evaporative flux owing to increase in the concentration gradient of water vapour explains the high evaporation rate observed in the present work this system bridges the gap between the understanding of evaporation from bare water surfaces 1 d vapour diffusion and leaf surfaces 3 d vapour diffusion evaporation rates for the fully saturated conditions are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions of suzuki and maeda 1968 and schlünder 1988 the computed surface temperatures and its width wise variation match well with the experimental values we also propose a simple film model for the unsaturated condition of the porous medium and show that the temperature distribution obtained using this model is in reasonably good agreement with the measured values keywords evaporation low open area surfaces line source ir heating capillary film 1 introduction evaporation is an important phenomenon because of its occurrence in diverse fields evaporation may occur from bare water surfaces such as lakes from porous surfaces such as soils and from plants which is known as transpiration in many cases evaporation may not occur from the entire surface but from wet patches that can be of different scales for example transpiration from a plant occurs mainly from stomata on the leaves stomata are tiny holes on a leaf surface and it is believed that in most of the plants they contribute nearly 90 to the total transpiration the total open area of stomata on a leaf surface in majority of the plants is approximately 5 of the leaf area even at such a low area ratio the transpiration from these tiny holes has been reported comparable to a bare water surface there have been many studies related to different aspects of evaporation from stomata see bange 1953 schymanski et al 2017 in particular to understand the evaporation from such low area ratio wet surfaces partially wet surfaces also occur during the evaporation from surfaces of porous media like soils the aim of the present work is to experimentally study evaporation from a surface having water sources in the form of lines the important considerations in evaporation from partially wet surfaces are the size of the opening d the spacing between openings s figs 1 and 2 a whether the mass transfer is to still ambient or a flowing one and whether the surface is heated say by radiation in the case of external flow or heated surface the concentration boundary layer thickness δ m would be a parameter the important non dimensional geometrical parameters are s d and s δ m related to s d is open area ratio θ wet area to total area other parameters enter during drying when some of the liquid vapour menisci leave the pore and settle below the surface while at few other locations the menisci remain at the open end fig 1c the starting point in study of evaporation from stomata is the mass transfer rate from a single and array of circular openings stefan 1881 theoretically showed that mass transfer rate due to diffusion into still ambient from a single circular source was not proportional to its exposed surface area as expected but rather to its the diameter stefan diameter law for an array of sources an important parameter is ratio of the spacing between adjacent sources to the source diameter s d fig 2a shows equiconcentration vapour lines along with the concentration vapour gradient for line 2 d sources for a multi perforate system the experimental results reported in brown and escombe 1900 suggest that the individual vapour shells did not interact with one another when s d 10 ting and loomis 1963 however reported a drastic reduction for s d 10 in the evaporative loss per hole compared to a single hole cooke 1967 assumed still ambient condition in his numerical simulations and found the evaporative flux to decrease with increasing separation parlange and waggoner 1970 reported that the adjacent stomatal influence can be ignored till certain nearly equal to the stomatal spacing distance away from the leaf and further argued that the convective effects in this zone are negligible given the boundary layer thickness is much larger than the stomatal spacing s δ m 1 vesala 1998 reported the 3 d nature of diffusion near the stomatal openings and argued that the effect of wind cannot be ignored in multiple openings and interference caused by surrounding openings is important schlünder 1988 numerically solved the evaporation from a square array of discontinuous hemispherical liquid sources in the presence of wind characterized by a boundary layer thickness recently the ellipsoidal nature of the equiconcentration lines even without the wind over a stoma was captured in the simulations of roth nebelsick 2007 suzuki and maeda 1968 hereafter sm numerically solved the steady mass transfer equation from a periodic array of 2 d sources separated by a fixed distance which they termed as the granular particle size in the context of soils into static fluid the geometry studied by sm is similar to the plate based unconventional porous medium pbpm in the present study they found that with decreasing diameter of the granular particle and increasing number of evaporation sites the evaporation ratio ξ for a fixed open area ratio increases and moves closer to a value of 1 ξ is defined as the ratio of evaporation rate from a partially wet surface such as soil or leaf to that from the bare water surface shahraeeni et al 2012 numerically extended the work of sm and lehmann et al 2008 and investigated the effect of boundary layer and the advection term in evaporation from leaf like surfaces in the presence of wind from a matrix of interconnected capillaries with variable diameter they reported that in case of a stefan tube type evaporation scenario where liquid level receded in selected capillaries contribution of the diffusion term becomes important and therefore cannot be neglected in the formulation besides soils soil like surfaces kumar and arakeri 2018a b and leaves evaporation from partially wet surfaces occurs in other contexts such as the unique ones considered in kumar and arakeri 2018c d perforated systems are widely used in order to reduce the amount of water loss from bare water bodies such as lakes and swimming pools these systems employ partial covers where most of the water surface is covered with the impervious solid surfaces while leaving out a small fraction of total area in order to allow diffusion of air into the water bodies covers used to minimize evaporation include reflective surfaces cooley and myers 1973 an array of square holes assouline et al 2010 2011 cylindrical floats burston 2002 wire nets alvarez et al 2006 and more recently floating discs and spheres even the more recent experiments assouline et al 2010 were carried in the laboratory in the absence of any heat source mean wind speed based haghighi and or 2013 concentration boundary layer thickness turns out to be about 4 mm and 3 5 cm for mean speeds of 1 m s and 0 1 m s respectively by keeping the open area same assouline et al 2010 replaced a single hole by a distributed pattern of holes they also studied the effect of varying exposed area fraction one important inference from their study was higher mass loss from a distributed pattern of holes compared to a single hole for the same exposed area fraction in another set of experiments they observed that nearly 87 58 and 29 of water is lost from the distributed square hole patterns having exposed area fractions of about 69 33 and 10 respectively note that for these values of area fractions the edge length of the square hole size was respectively about 6 0 cm 4 1 cm and 2 2 cm these experimentally observed data suggest two major points first the mass loss is not directly proportional to the exposed surface area second stefan diameter law seems to be followed since the mass loss is nearly proportional to the edge length of the square holes interestingly even when the hole sizes are relatively large stefan diameter law is still valid note that for lower wind speeds δ m is of the same order as the edge length of the holes now we present some relevant analytical results in the absence of the boundary layer analytical solution for the latent heat loss q evap w from a single circular opening with a m as its radius placed in an infinite plane is given following cooke 1967 and birdi et al 1989 by 1 q evap 4 a λ d a c s where λ kj kg is the latent heat of vaporization of the liquid d a m2 s is the binary diffusivity of liquid vapour c s kg m3 is the concentration of liquid vapour at the liquid vapour interface note that eq 1 gives the mass loss from an opening in an infinite plane to be directly proportional to its diameter rather than the area for a square periodic array of openings having a spacing of s m between the holes the evaporative flux per opening q evap o p e n i n g in the presence of wind is given schlünder 1988 by 2 q evap o p e n i n g d a c s c a λ θ δ m 2 π a π 4 θ π 4 θ 1 where θ m2 m2 is the surface water content given as the ratios of the opening area to the unit cell area c a kg m3 is the concentration of liquid vapour in the medium and δ m m is the concentration boundary layer thickness the second term in the denominator of eq 2 essentially represents the interference term caused by the neighbouring openings this term is always positive and hence eq 2 cannot be used when θ π 4 since it becomes negative note that eq 2 is valid only when the opening diameter is much higher than the mean free path 10 7 m of the vapours phase the evaporative flux over the unit cell q evap can be obtained as 3 q evap θ q evap o p e n i n g d a c s c a λ δ m 2 π a π 4 θ π 4 θ 1 thus for a given area ratio θ the evaporative flux from a surface containing a periodic array of sources depends on the source radius a and relative boundary layer thickness lower a yields higher flux for finite θ but a δ m 0 eq 3 becomes 4 lim a δ m 0 q evap d a c s c a λ δ m eq 4 is also valid for a bare water surface a leaf is a classic example of such a case where the stomatal dimension 20 μ m is negligible compared to δ m the above equations were proposed for an isothermal case i e in absence of any external heating recently a few studies aminzadeh and or 2014 2017 have extended the above relations for cases with heating in these studies δ m was determined by the wind while c s was governed by the incoming heat most of the earlier studies have been with finite circular or square sources except sm which considered 2 d sources the present work reports an experimental study of evaporation from an array of line sources the line sources are created by a packed stack of vertical glass plates containing water in between them for one set of experiments 1 8 mm glass plates were used and in the second set 0 13 mm thick cover slips were used in both cases the width of the source d δ m whereas θ in the former is 4 and is 20 in the latter the glass plate case thus represents a leaf like situation except that the source is a line and not circular one aim of the present study is to characterize the evaporation from such a low open area ratio surface the stack of vertical plates may be considered to be a porous medium which is very different from the usual porous media consisting of 3 d tortuous pores for example as found in soils a second aim of the present study is to measure the evaporation rate characteristics with time of an initially saturated pbpm and compare them with those found in a standard porous medium the 1 d pore geometry in pbpm is clearly much simpler compared to the pore structure in a porous medium consisting of spheres further the evaporated vapours in a pbpm can only diffuse in two directions vertically above and across the plate thickness the vapour diffusion is thus 2 d this simpler model porous system at higher saturation values can be considered as a bridge between understanding evaporation from a bare water surface and a leaf surface where vapour diffusion is 1 d and 3 d respectively the unique elements of the present study are characterizing evaporation from a periodic array of thin line sources of water under controlled heating from above using infrared radiation such a study has not been reported in the literature and one important contribution is comparison of evaporation characteristics of pbpm and conventional porous media 2 experimental methodology we used vertically stacked smooth glass plates gp and cover slips cs space between two consecutive surfaces forming the line sources of water and study the transient evaporation from this plate based porous medium pbpm the stacks can be seen in fig 2c d consisting of gp and cs respectively the important parameters of the present study are given in table 1 the porosity ϕ 4th column of table 1 is calculated by measuring the total water mass in the fully saturated pbpm water is essentially trapped in between the plates and between the plates and the container boundaries the obtained average water film thicknesses d in case of gp and cs were nearly 66 μ m and 28 μ m and the average inter pore spacing s is about 28 and 5 times d respectively covering an order of magnitude also we chose the material thicknesses last column of table 1 such as to cover an order of magnitude variation in this length scale fig 2b shows a schematic of the experimental setup evaporation from the porous medium was boosted by the infrared ir heating from the top a precision weighing balance sartorius gpa5202 measured the mass loss with an accuracy of 0 01 g temperature of the ambient t a and the container bottom surface t bot was measured using t type thermocouples relative humidity was measured using a sensor honeywell hih 4000 ambient temperature and relative humidity were measured away from the experiment zone in order to avoid any radiation effects to minimize heat loss the container was insulated on the four sides and at the bottom the top surface temperature was measured with an ir camera the ir images were taken after blocking the radiation for a few seconds in order to measure the true temperature this procedure avoids the reflected ir component if the radiation is not blocked the reflected radiation from the surface results in an increase of 5 6 c in the measured temperature of the ir camera for the case of glass which has an emissivity of 0 92 the experiments were performed in the laboratory conditions we measured the evaporation rate in case of a bare water surface by putting extra water 2 3 mm on top of the fully saturated stack of plates the rest of the paper is organised as follows we discuss results from isothermal evaporation of a single water film trapped between two smooth plates in section 3 1 this is to understand the movement of the water air interface in the film the main experiments are with stacks of vertical plates with the ir heating from above the results of evaporation and the surface temperature distribution captured using ir camera from this set of experiments are discussed in sections 3 2 and 3 3 respectively they are also compared with the existing results in literature on standard porous media numerical investigation is discussed in section 3 4 which is split in two parts viz fully saturated and unsaturated cases we conclude in section 4 3 results and discussion 3 1 isothermal evaporation from a film between two glass plates we first discuss the isothermal case where evaporation occurs in absence of any external heat source for this purpose we selected commercially available standard glass micro slides 25 mm 75 mm with an average thickness of 1 3 mm these glass micro slides are very smooth with an average roughness 100 nm as quoted by the manufacturer blue star the slides were cleaned prior to the experiment water is introduced from one of the shorter faces in between the two slides which are pressed tightly against each other the final configuration obtained is a thin film of water sandwiched between the two slides for better contrast water is coloured using kmno4 particles which turns it pink the slide film slide sfs system was kept vertical and was photographed during evaporation this system is the simplest configuration for study of evaporation from a film between smooth plates experiments were done with two configurations one in which only the top is open and the sides and bottom are sealed and the second where all the four sides are open fig 3 a shows the progress of the drying front for only the top open case where mass transfer to the ambient can happen only from the top mass of the trapped water in this case is nearly 17 mg which corresponds to d 9 μ m for this experiment the bottom face was sealed after the water had risen to the top completely during the sealing process a small amount of water evaporates the instance chosen as t 0 corresponds to the time just after sealing with time the interface which is curved moves away from the left face and downwards but all along with part of the interface remaining at the top right corner thus there is always hydraulic connectivity shown with arrows fig 3a to the top open face from the bulk the rate at which the bulk recedes is seen much faster compared to the film shrinkage for bare water surface an evaporation rate of 2 3 mm d is expected in these conditions with no external heat source in the present evaporating film case a 75 mm water column evaporates in approximately 3 h taking into account only the film area 9 µm 25 mm the average evaporation rate turns out to be 600 mm d but if we include the plate thickness in the area 2 6 mm 25 mm for estimating evaporation we get an average evaporation rate of about 2 mm d an important observation is that the film extends to the top till almost all the water gets evaporated films reaching to the top are also observed in drying of initially saturated soils during the so called constant rate period crp of course geometries of the films are much more complex in the latter for the case where all the four sides are open we see the drying interface moves predominantly from left to right for that particular experiment fig 3b the bottom face is on the ground which would have inhibited mass loss from this face evaporation must be happening from the whole water air interface but mostly from the right side where the interface is directly in contact with the ambient for the interface within the system the vapour has to diffuse from inside to the ambient leading to a lower rate of evaporation there water would be flowing towards the higher evaporating faces as shown by arrows in the figure at t 15 min the film width decreases continuously and at t 90 min the film becomes very thin stretched throughout the slide length 75 mm the film then ruptures as seen at t 95 min and liquid trails are seen collapsing and moving towards the top and bottom faces simultaneously access to a fast video showing the full process has been mentioned in the acknowledgement section rupture occurred within 4 s suggesting that the liquid velocity was very high 2 cm s at the time of rupture compared to the evaporation rate the evaporation rate is about two times higher for the case with all the sides open compared to the case with only top side open 90 min versus 170 min for complete evaporation the experiments were repeated several times for both the cases and in all the attempts similar movements of the film were observed in evaporation from conventional porous media cpm film rupture is believed to lead to stage 2 of evaporation or the receding front period rfp recently thiery et al 2017 have shown that stage 2 in a cpm is a result of vanishing surface water content as the film simply recedes within the medium rather than breaking up the experiments of the evaporating film between glass plates is somewhat similar to the stefan problem of an evaporating liquid evaporating in a vertical tube with the liquid meniscus going down with time in both the stefan tube and our experiments the latent heat required for phase change at the lv meniscus comes from the ambient via conduction through the walls 3 2 non isothermal evaporation from a stack of smooth plates characteristic curves in this section we present the evaporation characteristics in the presence of ir heating of the pbpm i e vertically stacked plates with the water films between plates forming the thin line sources two significant differences between the single film isothermal and the pbpm non isothermal experiments apart from the external heating are 1 d 50 µm in non isothermal is larger compared to the isothermal case where d 10 µm and 2 the presence of a container which helps in maintaining the hydraulic connectivity between two or more thin films at the container bottom surface the first point changes the ratio θ d s which is expected to affect the evaporation contribution from each of the sources the second point can be related to the theoretical model by lehmann et al 2008 where two dissimilar capillaries were shown to be hydraulically connected note that even for the case with external heat load e g of about 1000 w m2 since open area ratio is small most of the heat gets transferred to the lv menisci between the plates from the top surface of the plates by lateral conduction will be discussed in detail in the numerical results section water receives only a small portion of the ir heat directly for the experiments a fully saturated pbpm was prepared initially after which a thin 2 3 mm layer of water was added to its top this extra layer gives the evaporation rate of a bare water surface or the potential evaporation rate fig 4 a shows the measured evaporation rates versus the degree of saturation s s is the ratio of mass of water at any instant to the mass of water when the pbpm is fully saturated the bare water evaporation rate under the ir radiation was 21 5 mm d the evaporation rates at s 1 were 20 mm d and 19 5 mm d for the cs and gp cases respectively the reduction in the evaporation rate compared to when water was exposed is due to reduced surface area for evaporation since the solid surfaces are now exposed and partially because some of ir radiation gets reflected by the top surface of plates the reflected ir radiation component is slightly more than for the bare water surface 3 2 1 initial evaporation leaf like behaviour it is important to note that at s 1 the evaporation rates are nearly same although open area ratios for the two pbpm are different θ 0 035 and 0 2 in gp and cs cases respectively this essentially means that the contribution of each line source in the gp case is much higher than their cs counterpart we see thus that a small exposed area 4 in gp of water is able to evaporate at a rate almost equal to that of bare water however with increased exposed area 20 in cs the evaporation rate does not increase 5 times the vapour shells in this case start interacting with one another increasing the resistance to vapour diffusion these results of 2 d vapour diffusion are similar to those obtained from 3 d vapour diffusion from leaves and leaf like surfaces bange 1953 kumar and arakeri 2017 two similarities between a pbpm and a leaf are a similar open area fractions about 5 and b similar length scales line source widths and stomatal size one main difference is that in leaves the pores are point sources whereas in the present case we have line sources 3 2 2 evaporation with time different stages the initial evaporation rates for the two cases gp and cs are nearly same as that from a bare water surface with time the evaporation rates for the two cases show different behaviours fig 4a the cs case shows the existence of the three typical stages of evaporation found in a cpm viz a stage 1 where evaporation rates remain high and comparable to bare water bodies b transition regime and c stage 2 where drastic reduction in the evaporation rates are clearly seen these stages have been observed established and well documented lehmann et al 2008 kumar and arakeri 2018a in cpm like soils for the gp case also three stages are observed but with one main difference during stage 1 the evaporation rate is not nearly constant but reduces gradually followed by the transition regime where a drastic drop in evaporation rate is observed during stage 1 the lower evaporation rate in case of the gp is partly due to much lower open area fraction of 4 compared to 20 in the cs case however ratio of the rates of evaporation from 1 to 0 6 in gp and cs cases in stage 1 is higher than their porosity ratio 0 22 this high evaporation rate in gp case is due to the diminished interference and thus reduced resistance to the vapours motion between the individual vapour shells compared to the cs case where it is significantly higher mainly because the cover slips are thin additional complications arise when the concentration boundary layer thickness is of the order of d o r s whichever is larger the liquid vapour interface or the drying front between each pair of glass plates can evolve with time in different ways one possibility a is part of the interface can be always at the top and rest of the interface being curved and receding down with time as was observed in sfs case fig 3a the second possibility b is the interfaces are horizontal and move down at different rates it is also possible that some of the interfaces are at the top during stage 1 while the other interfaces recede with time the main difference between sfs and pbpm is that in the latter the films between the plates are interconnected through the sides and bottom of the container a water film can feed another which can happen when the gap between one set of glass plates is smaller than the gap between another set water can then flow from the wider gap to the narrower gap due to capillary forces as had been proposed by lehmann et al 2008 for movement of water from wider to narrower gaps in cpm in both the cases a and b the locally higher pore size s acts as the source of water for the locally smaller pore size and in turn reduces the total effective open area for evaporation as the thicker films recede away from the exposed surface in case a the pore size variation is across a single gap whereas in case b the pore size difference comes from different gap sizes saturation values at the end of the stage 1 are approximately 0 3 and 0 4 for the gp and cs cases respectively these values correspond to an average depth liquid gas interface of 70 mm and 36 mm respectively this difference may be due to 1 smoother and hence lower film thicknesses gp compared to the cs and 2 significant variation in the value of d across multiple films in both the cases we now discuss the temperature characteristics of both the pbpm which is needed to make the study complete in relation to the evaporation rate fig 5 shows ir images at different times for the experiments with the two pbpm such images are used to get the average temperature of the pbpm top surface first we will discuss the average surface temperature t s k temperature averaged over the entire exposed top surface information in the next section we will discuss some aspects of the spatial variation of the surface temperature fig 4b shows the variation of t s with s we see that t s in stage 1 for cs is lower than gp case while the evaporation rate fig 4a was higher the incident ir heat flux of 940 w m2 goes into latent heat of evaporation sensible heat storage in the porous medium and losses to the ambient due to reflection convection and radiation the storage component is small compared to the other components at least in stage 1 thus any reduction in evaporation rate must be accompanied by an increase in surface temperature to increase the radiative and convective losses kumar and arakeri 2018b this trend is observed in fig 4b for the cs case during stage 1 there is small reduction in evaporation rate and correspondingly a small increase in t s comparatively for the gp case during stage 1 there is larger increase in t s corresponding to the large reduction in evaporation rate during the transition period for both gp and cs cases large increase in t s are observed due to the drastic fall in the evaporation rates in stage 2 the evaporation rates are very low and t s reach about 54 c when almost all the incident ir energy is lost to the ambient in comparison t s 37 c at the beginning of the experiment a similar inverse relationship between evaporation rate and t s has been observed in experiments with cpm kumar and arakeri 2018a b the difference in the values of t s in stages 1 and 2 reduces with lower incident heat flux and is thus very small in isothermal cases note that in case of bare water surface its t s will be fixed for a constant incident heat while in case of a porous medium it changes not only during the stages but also within stage 1 it is thus clear that ξ cannot be simply estimated by taking the ratio of its instantaneous evaporation rate to that of the bare water we will discuss this point in the next section in detail 3 2 3 non isothermal evaporation from a stack of smooth plates ir images we now discuss the spatial distributions of the surface temperature captured using the ir camera shown in fig 5 the images are shown at three different values of s viz 1 0 60 and 0 20 for both the cs and pbpm cases both were in stage 1 at s 0 60 and in stage 2 at s 0 20 see fig 4a colours representing different temperatures in increasing order are magenta blue cyan green yellow orange red white colour in the images represents surface of vertical walls of the container even at s 1 we see that the near wall regions are slightly hotter than the inner regions as seen in fig 5a and d however in both of these images most of the top surface has uniform colder temperatures t s 36 5 c 37 c these regions directly correlate to the presence of water as discussed above with time the films can recede in different ways at similar saturation s 0 60 in case of cs the wet region still occupies a large portion of the surface the evaporation rate is higher and temperatures are lower as compared to the gp case see fig 5e for both the gp and cs cases the portion occupied by the wet regions slowly decreases and eventually vanishes during the transition after which in stage 2 much higher values of t s can be seen in fig 5c and f as discussed above the water level can vary within the gap between adjacent plates and across plate gaps surface temperature is an indirect indication of the water level a lower surface temperature indicates that the water level locally is closer to the top surface we look at variations of surface temperature along five lines shown in fig 5b this is for the gp case at s 0 6 three of the lines hc hb and ht are horizontal in the image along the plates and two lines vc vr are drawn vertical across the thicknesses of the plates pixels increase from left to right and top to bottom along the horizontal and vertical lines respectively at this instant s 0 59 the region near the bottom left corner of the image is relatively colder by about 1 c than the rest of the area and is reflected in the temperatures along the various lines in fig 5g we expect the water level to be closer to the surface in the colder region where locally the evaporation rate would be higher the higher temperature along ht implies a lower water level in the right half of hc the temperature is seen higher and approaching that of ht suggesting this region of hc is drained this situation is similar to the single void case fig 3 where one part of the gap gets drained first note that once preferential evaporation begins in a single line source of water diffusion of water vapours is possible along the plate widths also we see that there are fluctuations 0 2 c in temperature over small spatial scale of the order of few pixels more so along the vertical lines the number of pixels is between 3 and 4 along the thickness 1 85 mm of the glass plates to make the spatial variation clearer the data points are marked along vc in fig 5h temperature away from the line source and towards the centre of the plate is expected to increase since the rate of mass transfer decreases along this direction temperature should be the highest at the centre of the glass plate all the temperature peaks are not clear in fig 5h however most of these peaks are seen along vc in the wet low temperature region at locations with pixel numbers 24 31 37 42 45 48 52 55 58 64 67 75 79 82 and 88 3 3 comparison with results of suzuki and maeda 1968 s 1 we compare our experimental results with predictions of suzuki and maeda 1968 and of schlünder 1988 both of which assumed isothermal conditions in the present investigation because of the incident ir heating the surface temperature is higher than the ambient temperature and the models have to incorporate relevant changes for the non isothermal conditions we use results from a heated plate kept horizontally for this purpose the relevant rayleigh number ra is given as 5 ra g δ ρ ρ l ν α where δ ρ kg m3 is the difference in density of the gas phase air water vapour at the surface and in the ambient ρ kg m3 is the average gas phase density l m is a length scale equal to the ratio of area to the perimeter of the evaporating surface ν m2 s and α m2 s are the kinematic and thermal diffusivities of the gas phase respectively water vapours were assumed to follow the ideal gas law for calculating the density saturated vapour pressure was estimated using antoine equation in the present study ra is around 103 nusselt number nu is calculated using the standard nu ra correlation of lloyd and moran 1974 6 nu 0 59 r a 0 25 200 r a 10 4 the average thermal δ t m and mass δ m m boundary layer thicknesses are given as 7 δ t l nu δ m δ t l e 1 3 where le is lewis number defined as the ratio of thermal and mass diffusivities it is important to note that δ m using eq 7 takes values which are very different than the isothermal cases in the experiments presented here there is no mean wind in the plane of the evaporating medium we now discuss in brief the work of suzuki and maeda 1968 sm hereafter who numerically considered the problem of evaporation essentially a 2 d diffusion problem from periodically spaced discontinuous sources of water as sketched in fig 6 a unit cell is shown which considers half of the dry and half wet surfaces they solved for the concentration in the unit cell of the evaporated vapours while considering various cases such as stagnant boundary layer uniform flow within the boundary layer etc our experimental condition is similar to that of a stagnant boundary layer and can be treated as an extension of sm with the addition of temperature effects mass loss is obtained by solving the 2 d concentration diffusion equation which in steady state is given as 8 2 c x 2 2 c z 2 0 where c is vapour concentration x is taken across the plates and z is taken vertically upwards against the gravity the boundary conditions required to solve eq 8 are 9a c c s a t z 0 s 2 x s d 2 9b c c a a t z δ m 9c c z 0 a t z 0 0 x s 2 9d c x 0 a t x 0 a n d s d 2 eqs 9a and 9b represent the constant vapour concentration conditions for the lv interface and in the ambient respectively non penetrative condition eq 9c is used at the dry surface while periodic boundary condition eq 9d is used for mid planes of the dry and wet surfaces solving eq 8 with the boundary conditions eq 9 the evaporation ratios ξ is given following sm by 10 ξ 2 δ m s d 1 c s c a 0 s d 2 c z z 0 d x we now compare our experimental results with the numerical predictions of sm in the present set of parameters note that we have estimated the evaporation rate of a bare water surface at the measured t s and ambient conditions following kumar and arakeri 2015 for both the experiments corresponding to the values of θ and δ m s d value of ξ was extracted fig 4 in sm this value is seen in 9th column of table 2 where the experimentally obtained values of ξ are also seen both solutions of sm and the present experimental results indicates that the evaporation ratio for thicker gp at s 1 is lower than the thinner cs for the case of cs the value is in close agreement with sm however for gp case we obtained higher ξ compared to the prediction by sm this possibly could be due to the nature of the boundary layer in the present experiments clearly the local perforations affect the equiconcentration lines depending on their size and spacing we can further use schlunder s solution eq 3 to evaluate ξ 11 ξ 1 1 2 π a δ m π 4 θ π 4 θ 1 experimentally obtained values of ξ agrees very well with the solution eq 11 proposed by schlünder 1988 although the solution was proposed for equally spaced square array of circular openings using eq 2 we estimated q evap o p e n i n g to be about 14106 1 w m2 and 2996 7 w m2 for gp and cs respectively mass transfer from 66 µm line source in gp is about 4 7 times more than from 28 µm line source in cs this difference is attributed mainly to the higher thickness of the gp which allowed more space for 2 d diffusion assuming diffusion to be specular the vapour shells from the line sources need to travel s 2 across the plate thickness in order to interact with one another if δ m s 0 5 then the vapour shells interact in both pbpm this criterion is satisfied note that this interference occurs earlier for cs case which resulted in lower q evap o p e n i n g evaporation is expected to be 2 d till a vertical distance away from the plate s top surface of s 2 after which the diffusion lines approach 1 d due to the interference until the boundary layer beyond the boundary layer convection takes over as the primary mode of mass and heat transport we have discussed mass transport from discontinuous sources when the liquid vapour menisci are at the top s 1 we shift our attention to the transient behaviour of evaporation fig 4a when the open area fraction reduces during stage 1 recently shahraeeni et al 2012 extended the model by sm to capture the effect contribution towards total evaporation of receding lv menisci in chosen locations where locally d is higher 3 4 numerical investigations the numerical investigations were done on a model system primarily to get an idea of the heat budget and to understand the observed surface temperatures we do two types of simulations one for the case s 1 and the other for s 1 some of the incoming radiation is lost to the ambient reflected radiation radiative and convective losses some goes into latent heat and some is conducted down through the plates heat transfer within the plate for the case when s 1 happens as follows plate s top surface receives heat a part of which gets conducted to the lv meniscus leading to phase change rest of the heat is conducted along the plate height and is consumed as sensible heat leading to increase in the overall temperature of the system one important question is related to the temperature variation within the glass plate we have used comsol multiphysics a commercial package in order to model evaporation from lv menisci for s 1 fully saturated case and from the film for s 1 unsaturated cases the formulation details are given in the appendix fig 7 3 4 1 s 1 fully saturated case we use the measured evaporation rates fig 4 to give q out using eqs a7 and 2 which is assumed to happen over a finite film length l f assumed to be 1 mm note that the value of l f is reasonable jasvanth et al 2016 and the results are not very sensitive to the actual value fig 8 a shows the sub surface temperature distribution in the unit cell and fig 8b shows the isotemperature contours the 0 location in fig 8 denotes the middle of the plate while 0 9 represents the heat sink region where phase change occurs two major conclusions can be drawn from fig 8 first the temperature difference between the coldest and the hottest point on the plate surface is only about 0 15 c for lower plate thicknesses like cover slips this difference will be even smaller second the lateral heat conduction which is confined to a vertical distance of about l f provides the path way for the final evaporation that happens in the film this lateral conduction of the heat is the major reason behind sustained high evaporation rates from these low porosity surfaces the numerical simulation results also confirm the experimental observation of 1 c variation of t s when s 1 the experimental data fig 5h agrees reasonably well with the numerical simulation results we now shift our attention towards modelling the unsaturated cases where s 1 3 4 2 s 1 case in order to capture the temperature distributions on the surface and in the sub surface regions of pbpm 3 d simulations were performed in the unsaturated conditions s 1 fig 9 a shows a schematic picture of a typical film for s 1 case between two plates most of the evaporation is likely to occur from the film that is at the top isothermal investigation suggests that evaporation contribution from the receded part of the film reduces drastically with its distance from the top open end shahraeeni et al 2012 further chauvet et al 2009 and keita et al 2016 have suggested that most of the mass loss is contributed by a finite layer 1 cm near the open end for modelling purpose we replace the curved film with a vertical one fig 9b the width of the film region b y 0 is assumed to be equal to s 12 y 0 b 1 s where b is the plate width and y o is the distance of the wet region from the dry plate end in the vertical film model vfm all the evaporation occurs over this width b y 0 and the vertical extent l f fig 9b as in the formulation for s 1 case we assume l f to be 1 mm change in l f value has little impact on the temperature distribution using mass loss data obtained experimentally q evap o p e n i n g is calculated as 13 q evap o p e n i n g 1 86 4 λ θ e where e mm day is the evaporation rate note that in our model the film width reduces with time this reduces evaporation area and q out is given by 14 q out l f b y 0 q evap o p e n i n g d 2 b using eqs 12 and 14 we get 15 q out q evap o p e n i n g d 2 1 l f 1 s boundary conditions at the top face are given by eqs a3 and a6 while at the face replacing the film is given by eq 15 we perform transient simulations considering the full plate length note that vfm is a 3 d transient model the initial temperature of the plate full is fixed at 26 7 c the ambient temperature we first look at the average surface temperature t s obtained from the model and compare with the experimental calibrated with an accuracy of 1 temperature averaged over the entire pbpm surface table 3 lists the parameters required for the individual models along with the respective predicted surface temperature data t s averaged over the unit cell for the glass plate s case also listed is the experimentally obtained last column surface temperature t s averaged over the entire pbpm the heat transfer coefficient h does not vary significantly from about 8 5 w m2k at s 1 to about 10 5 w m2k at s 0 1 during the entire evaporation process the evaporation rate obtained in the experiment is in good agreement with the theory eq 2 at s 1 column 2 table 3 fig 10 shows the t s obtained from the model and from experiments at different s values from the table 3 and fig 10 the very simple model predicts the surface temperature well note that at s 0 26 stage 1 is about to end fig 4a while s 0 1 belongs to the 2nd stage of evaporation an assumption made in the model is that evaporation occurs only from the exposed film at the top and not from the interior interface this assumption is valid chauvet et al 2009 keita et al 2016 as evaporation contribution from deeper regions of lv menisci reduces drastically since these regions are exposed to nearly saturated conditions within the pore in stage 2 i e after the transition the lv meniscus would recede from the exposed surface and be near horizontal in this simplified 1 d pore geometry and the vfm is inappropriate a modified formulation of the stefan problem shahraeeni et al 2012 would better represent the physical situation we have also observed in the simulations that if q in o r i is changed by 5 t s changes by 2 c respectively we now discuss the spatial temperature distribution on the surface and below the surface fig 11 a shows the variation of surface temperature along the plate width direction for different s values the film moves from left to right as s reduces with its value given by eq 14 the arrows in fig 11a indicate the vertical film location at s 1 the temperature is constant 37 5 c with time as s reduces and the vertical interface moves to the right the surface temperature becomes non uniform with dry portion 0 y y 0 having higher temperatures compared to the wet portion y 0 y b and wet affected zones the maximum difference in the hottest and the coldest location is initially small 25 c at s 0 90 and increases to about 5 c at s 0 40 and 0 26 with time as noted above the average surface temperature increases as may be seen in fig 11a at s 0 1 the temperature is again nearly uniform and equal to approximately 52 c simulations for smaller plate thickness show that this temperature difference reduces at s 0 40 for cs it was 1 5 c compared to 6 5 c for gp case from the transient simulations we get the sub surface temperature distribution with time fig 11b shows the height wise variation of the local temperature at different s values obtained from vfm we chose to show t z curves at the mid plate y 20 5 mm position note that z 100 mm represents the bottom of the plates the variation in temperature in the vertical direction is much smaller than the variation on the surface the measured immediately after the container bottom wall temperature values are mentioned in the caption at lower s values vfm predicts much higher values for t bot compared to the measurements for ex at s 0 60 obtained t bot is about 41 c and 36 5 c from vfm and experiments respectively the simulations are performed with an initial condition where full plate was at the ambient temperature t a the simple model does not capture all the dynamics and boundary conditions of the actual system and may account for the discrepancy between prediction and measurement of t bot we conclude that the model predicted the top surface temperature accurately but failed to predict the bottom surface temperature we finally try to understand the impact of film positioning on the plate surface temperature in the vfm we assumed the film to recede starting from the left part of the plate in the experiments however the films in adjacent gaps can recede in different ways for example in one gap the film may recede on the left hand side and in an adjacent gap it may recede on the right hand side to model this situation we consider two cases of two adjacent films fig 12 for case a both the films recede from the left side same as the case considered above with a single film in the other configuration case b the films are on the opposite sides the resulting surface temperature variation along the plate width is seen in fig 12 the value of s 0 6 the maximum and minimum temperatures in case a are about 44 c and 39 c respectively the temperature difference is thus nearly 5 c in contrast for case b the temperature variation has evened out and the difference is reduced to only about 1 c the maximum temperature has reduced by 2 c while the minimum temperature increases by 2 c compared to case a as expected the temperature minimum occurs at the centre of the plate since this is the region where there is overlap of the films it is important to mention that t s remained same for both case a and case b fig 12 also shows an experimental t s curve at s 0 60 the ir image fig 5b is converted to an array of temperature data 320 data points in the horizontal direction and 240 data points in the vertical we then limited our data points such that only the pbpm top surface is analyzed temperature is averaged vertically corresponding to all the horizontal positions we finally obtain the vertically averaged t s which is seen plotted versus the plate width in fig 12 the obtained temperature profile is similar to that of case b 4 conclusions we experimentally investigated evaporation from thin line sources of water while heating from above the aim of the study was to understand the high evaporation rates found from porous surfaces such as leaves having low open area ratios the present study where the vapour diffusion is 2 d can be thought as the bridge between 1 d diffusion of vapours in case of bare water bodies and 3 d diffusion in case of leaves the porous medium in the present study consisted of thin line sources of water formed between adjacent smooth and flat plates the diffusion of vapours in these cases were 2 d the plates were stacked close to one another such that the space between the two plates is of the order of a few microns two different plates were studied having 4 and 20 as the exposed percentage area further we studied the effect of evaporating dimensions and dry width in such systems the sub surface temperature distribution has been obtained numerically using intuitive models even with the simplest possible void with a water film between two smooth glass plates the evaporation process is complex the periodic array of line sources formed with stack of glass plates pbpm is more complicated compared to the single film the parameter θ ratio of film width to the dry width is important in deciding the total evaporation rate at least when s 1 a higher value of this ratio cover slips case yields evaporation rates which are nearly equal to that of a bare water surface even with a lower θ evaporation rate was higher at least near high saturations lateral conduction of heat from hotter dry regions to the evaporating locations is the reason for this high evaporation rate with a constant incident flux we have shown that the surface temperature is coupled with the evaporation rate sustained a lower evaporation rate always meaning a higher surface temperature the evaporation ratios ξ for the two different types of pbpm at s 1 agreed well with the theory for an array of circular holes and reasonably well with the numerical simulations of suzuki and maeda 1968 this case of high saturation values of a pbpm may also be considered as a 2 d leaf note that ξ has been estimated based on the average surface temperature and not on the incident heat flux on the exposed surface it would be interesting to investigate the case where the porosities are even lower such that half of the plate width would exceed the concentration boundary layer thickness in connection to the soils where capillary films form due to difference in the void sizes between the particles here also the films formed due to tiny differences in the 1 d void sizes between different plates the flatness and roughness of the plates in a pbpm is therefore crucial further in pbpm three stages of evaporation were observed similar to that of a conventional porous medium stage 1 higher evaporation rate at s 1 was supported by the presence of water near the exposed surface which were colder as seen in ir images stage 1 is sustained due to the formation of film s which was simulated using a simplified model vfm the model predicted the average surface temperature accurately vfm also showed that the temperature variation across the plate width is very small for the given heat input the present vfm model can be in future extended to a purely 3 d model where a 3 d film as in soils can be considered the film width investigated in the present study is between 10 µm and 66 µm these dimensions strongly supported the formation of capillary films if the film width is 1 mm such dominant films will not form evaporation from such a unit cell is similar to stefan tube like situation shahraeeni et al 2012 where the rate of mass loss decays rapidly in stacks of such unit cells film can still form as a result of differences in the neighbouring film widths lehmann et al 2008 and relatively higher evaporation rates can still be expected declaration of interest we declare that the research in the manuscript has been sent only to the journal of hydrology the research is original and was carried in the fluid mechanics lab of mechanical engineering at iisc bangalore upon publication the journal

than the actual recorded speed showing the capillary film break up of coloured water between a slide film slide system can be found at 10 6084 m9 figshare 7390280 v1 appendix a formulation for vfm for s 1 case fig 7 a shows a 2d schematic side view of the pbpm at s 1 similar to sm we perform 2 d simulations while considering the full height h of the plates and discuss the results for gp case cs case can be extended easily since the film area is small compared to the solid area θ 4 we assume that the films do not receive heat directly via radiation from the ir heater but via conduction through the solid surfaces plates in the unit cell the top side receives intercepts ir radiations and get heated which then conducts to different sub surface regions of the plate and eventually to the lv menisci through the liquid where evaporation phase change occurs the problem is thus heat conduction within the plates and mass transfer at the menisci in the steady state 2 d heat conduction equation is a1 2 t 2 x 2 t 2 z 0 the unit cell in fig 7a is simplified and is shown in fig 7b latent heat released at the lv interface is treated as a heat release term from the nearest boundary right side of the control volume dashed line in fig 7b represents the location of the lv meniscus not scaled to true dimensions ideally at s 1 the lv meniscus would be flat but for simplicity we consider the situation where s 1 for example 0 999 0 99 etc since meniscus depth or film length l f m is manually defined seen in fig 7a it is important to study its effect the boundary conditions used for the model are 1 top side q in h since heat is intercepted here and is also exposed to the ambient two conditions each for heat flux and heat transfer coefficient are required in order to define this side a heat flux condition for this side can be written in terms of conservation of surface energy eq a2 in the steady state as a2 i q cond q conv q rad q ref q in q rad q ref where i w m2 is the incoming heat flux q cond w m2 is the heat flux conducted from the surface to the sub surface regions q conv w m2 and q rad w m2 are respectively the convective and radiative heats from the surface into the ambient and q ref w m2 is the reflected heat flux from the surface which depends on its emissivity q ref 1 s i note that q in w m2 is the amount of heat flux incident on the exposed top surface eq a2 can also be written as a3 q in s i q rad where s is the emissivity estimated with an accuracy of 0 01 of the material eq a3 is used as an inflow heat flux term for the top side in terms of fluid properties calculated at the mean temperature and ambient conditions eq a3 can be rewritten as a4 q in s i σ s t s 4 σ a s f sa t a 4 where σ is the stefan boltzmann coefficient a is the ambient emissivity and f sa determined with an accuracy of 0 01 is the view factor between the porous medium surface and the ambient the other condition required for the exposed top side is assigning to it a value of convective heat transfer coefficient h w m2k in order to determine h comsol uses a nu ra one such correlation is reported in lloyd and moran 1974 for different ranges of ra correlation this correlation is accurate within 5 condition used in the simulation is horizontal plate placed upside with external natural convection note that ra is based on δ t t s t a however in actual case it should also include density variation due to change in water vapour concentration near the evaporating surface and in the ambient 2 left side t x since it cuts the plate in two equal halves a symmetry

q evap is a7 q out l f b q evap o p e n i n g d 2 b where b m is the plate width 42 mm for the glass plate in the present experiments brackets at the lhs and rhs of eq a7 represent respectively the right side and half film area note that for s 1 q evap o p e n i n g is estimated following schlünder 1988 eq 2 for the transient model full plate height needs to be considered the term q in in this case can be further divided into a8 q cond q evap q sens q loss where q evap is the latent heat loss from the unit cell q sens is the sensible heat term and q loss is the heat loss from the insulation in the simulations q loss 0 adiabatic condition is assumed and q out is put following eq a7 after a value of t s slightly higher than t a is guessed since the incoming flux i 940 w m2 is known with an error of 5 q in is then estimated using eq a4 temperature distribution within the plate with known geometrical parameters is obtained by solving eq a1 with appropriate boundary conditions following eqs a2 a8 we obtain t s iteration 1 upon solution which is used to obtain q in iteration 1 following eq a3 t s is updated as the mean of the initial guess iteration 0 and after the solution iteration

6792,based on the runoff and sediment load data series obtained at the guide hydrological station ghs in the upper reaches of the yellow river from 1960 to 2013 the varying quasi periodic fluctuations of runoff and sediment load existing in different decomposed time scales are revealed by using the complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition ceemd method pre and post reservoir operation combined with entropy theory the concepts of multi time scale entropy mtse and multi time scale structural entropy mtsse are proposed to analyze the complex fluctuation characteristics of runoff and sediment load at different time scales the results show that reservoir operation has a greater influence on sediment load than that on runoff at multi time scales and that their correlations change as well additionally reservoir operation can aggravate the complexity of the runoff and sediment load but with longer fluctuation time scales this complexity decreases and predictability increases after reservoir operation the fluctuation period of high frequency components in runoff and sediment load is elongated and the information content of runoff and sediment load is focused at the short middle time scale therefore the available and reasonable monitoring and research periods for runoff and sediment load in the upper reaches of the yellow river are suggested as 4 7 years and 3 4 years respectively keywords entropy theory empirical mode decomposition method runoff sediment load reservoir operation multi time scales 1 introduction reservoirs are important artificial structures built on waterways to mitigate disaster risks and provide benefits to communities runoff and sediment load are two primary random hydrological variables with a certain relationship affected by climate change human activities and other factors wu et al 2018 wang et al 2015a while reservoirs provide significant social and economic benefits such as flood control power generation water supply and more they inevitably have a profound impact on the hydrological conditions of rivers including runoff and sediment the construction of reservoirs especially large scale reservoirs has a strong regulatory impact on runoff and sediment load it often causing changes to and evolution of river ecosystems kedra and wiejaczka 2008 lima et al 2017 riverbeds smaga et al 2017 and hydrological conditions chen and guo 2016 this influence may be far reaching so it is important to study the regulatory effects of reservoir application on runoff and sediment load to better understand its causes and evolutionary mechanisms and optimize reservoir operation at present there have been many studies on the impact of reservoir operation on runoff and sediment load however this previous research mainly focuses on the changes in runoff and sediment load in rivers before and after the establishment of reservoirs hou et al 2013 wang et al 2018a wang et al 2014 the impact of reservoir operation on the spatial and temporal distribution of runoff and sediment load ban et al 2014 the contribution of human activities and climate factors on runoff and sediment load kong et al 2016 tian et al 2016 and applied reservoir scheduling under runoff and sediment load changes xiao and peng 2012 like other random variable time series runoff and sediment load time series have multi time scale features the multi time scale feature means that the hydrological variables change within a certain period of time and not only move at a fixed frequency period time scale but also contain changes in various frequencies periodic time scale and local fluctuations zhang et al 2014 ling et al 2017 this phenomenon is the result of the combined efforts of various dynamic mechanisms including meteorological hydrological soil vegetation and human activities and is the fundamental reason for complex changes in hydrological variables over time therefore the research on the impact of reservoir operation on runoff and sediment load must be based on the knowledge of details local characteristics and the overall trends from the multi time perspective in this way the essential characteristics of the hydrological time series can be understood on the microscopic and macroscopic levels so that the mechanism of runoff and sediment load is more accurate and realistic the most commonly used multi time scale analysis method for a variable time series is the wavelet analysis method wang et al 2015b himanshu et al 2017 zhang et al 2017a but it is prone to produce many false harmonics because of its limitations in 1998 huang et al huang et al 1998 proposed empirical mode decomposition emd to overcome the disadvantages of the wavelet transform emd is an adaptive signal time frequency analysis method that decomposes a signal into local fully data driven components with periodic fluctuations in various scales these components are called intrinsic mode function imf however the emd method may produce defects such as modal confusion and endpoint effect in the calculation process huang et al 2009 wu and huang 2009 made improvements to the method and proposed an ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd the eemd method adds white noise into the original signal which can effectively solve the modal confusion problem of the emd method but does produce residual noise in the reconstructed signal sequence in 2010 huang et al yeh et al 2010 made further improvements to the eemd method the added auxiliary noise is in the form of positive and negative pairs which can eliminate the residual noise in the reconstructed signal and the added noise sets numbers can be smaller with higher computational efficiency this method is called ceemd currently the emd and eemd method have been widely used in the hydrological field zhao et al 2017 guo et al 2017 zhang et al 2017b but the ceemd method has insufficient applications in hydrology due to strong interference from the natural environment and human activities the river runoff and sediment load appear highly complex and uncertainty studying the complexity and uncertainty of runoff and sediment load is an important way to understand the dynamic evolution characteristics of nonlinear hydrological systems the concept of entropy originates in physics wang et al 2018b but was introduced into information theory by shannon in 1948 shannon 1948 to describe the uncertainty stability and information in the system in the field of hydrology and water resources the entropy theory is employed to analyze the complexity and uncertainty of hydrological variables baran et al 2017 zeng et al 2016 the innovative contribution of this study is combining the ceemd method with entropy theory the concepts of mtse and messe are proposed to reveal the essential characteristics of runoff and sediment load at the microscopic and macroscopic levels and thus the complexity and uncertainty of runoff and sediment load time series can be better understood under changing environmental conditions this paper demonstrates that when using the ceemd method the periodic fluctuation characteristics and detailed evolution of runoff and sediment load before and after operation of reservoir at multi time scales can be shown reflecting their time frequency relationships according to entropy theory for each time scale the imfs involve different characteristics variations at different time and the information content and complexity of the sequence at different time scales can be described by mtse similarly the transformation changes and periodic fluctuation variations of the imf components at different time scales can be displayed by mtsse therefore the mtse and messe are defined to analyze the complex characteristics and uncertainty of the transformation of runoff and sediment load fluctuation periods at different time scales 2 mathematical methods 2 1 ceemd method the ceemd method is a new adaptive signal time frequency analysis method that separates the imf from complex multicomponent original signals through a screening process the extracted imf component needs to meet the following two conditions 1 in a set containing all data information throughout the time period the number of data maximum and minimum points must be equal to the number of zero crossings or one difference 2 at any time the overall mean of the envelope produced by the connection of the envelope formed by the maximum value point of the data and the minimum point is ultimately zero the ceemd method is based on the emd method and its developed process is as follows 1 define an original signal x t first 2 add n sets of positive and negative pairs of auxiliary white noise into the original signal so that the set numbers of the signal is changed to 2 n which produces two sets of imf components the formula is 1 a 1 a 2 1 1 1 1 x t b where b is the auxiliary noise a 1 a 2 are the signals formed by the added positive and negative pairs 3 decompose these 2 n sets of signals with emd extract each signal using two conditions of the imf component then each signal can be decomposed to obtain a set of imf components eventually a 2n set of imf component is generated 4 find the average value of the corresponding imf component in 2n sets as 2 c j 1 2 n i 1 2 n c ij where c ij is the j th imf component of the i th signal and c j is the j th imf component 5 thus the signal x t can be expressed as m imf components and one residue trend item res r n t 3 x t j 1 m c j r n t 2 2 entropy theory 2 2 1 shannon entropy shannon referring to the field of thermodynamics defines shannon entropy as the average amount of information excluding information redundancy and gives the formula for solving information entropy through analysis shannon entropy can be described as follows if the event has n values described as u u 1 u 2 u n suppose p p 1 p 2 p n is a probability distribution of an event and the appearance of various values are independent of each other the shannon entropy of this distribution is designated as 4 s p i 1 n p i log p i entropy is used to describe the information content and uncertainty of a system if the probability distribution in an information system is uniform its entropy has a maximum value conversely if a system is more stable and regular its entropy is smaller 2 2 2 mtse in information theory entropy represents the average amount of information in the source output for a variable time series the original time series x t is decomposed into m imfs with the ceemd method all imf components are mapped in the time scale plane and involve different frequency components and the imfs characteristics variations on different time scales can be found each scale can be considered an information source and imf component on each scale is equivalent to a message from a source the magnitude of the entropy at different scales corresponds to the information content of different imf components for the i th imf its mtse is calculated as 5 mts e i t 1 n p t log p t where p t is the statistical frequency or probability of the i th imf component in the t th year when p t is the statistical frequency p t x it t 1 n x it x it is the decomposed value of the i th imf component in the t th year n is the total numbers of observation years thus the entropy of imf at different time scales can be obtained and can describe the information content and complexity of the sequence at different time scales 2 2 3 mtsse similarly for a variable time series the original time series x t can be decomposed to obtain a set of imf components with the ceemd method different imf components correspond to different time scales and each scale component is part of the original time series as an internal structure the mtsse of the t th year is defined as 6 mtss e t i 1 m p i log p i where p i x it i 1 m x it is the statistical frequency or probability of the t th year in the i th imf component x it is the decomposed value of the t th year in the i th imf and m is the total numbers of the decomposed imfs the multi time scale structural entropy can reveal the transformation changes and periodic fluctuation variations of the imf components at different time scales the more complicated the change is the larger the multi time scale structural entropy 3 results and discussions 3 1 data sources the longyangxia reservoir is the first large scale comprehensive reservoir located in the upper reaches of the yellow river 168 km from the river s source longyangxia reservoir uses multi annual regulation and plays an important role in flood control power generation irrigation water supply and more the reservoir s designed water level is 2600 m the total storage capacity is 24 7 billion m3 and the regulating storage capacity is 19 4 billion m3 the controlled drainage area above the dam site of the longyangxia reservoir is 131 420 km2 accounting for 17 5 of the total drainage area of the yellow river the guide hydrological station ghs located 54 8 km downstream of the longyangxia dam with a control area of 133 650 km2 is the control station for the outflow of the longyangxia reservoir the location map of the longyangxia reservoir and ghs is shown in fig 1 since beginning its operation in 1986 the longyangxia reservoir has had a profound influence on the downstream runoff and sediment load while exerting comprehensive regulatory benefits in this study the runoff and sediment load data series of ghs from 1960 to 2013 year are obtained as figs 2 and 3 to study the impact of the reservoir operation on runoff and sediment load the data series was divided into 1960 1986 as the pre operation stage and 1987 2013 as the post operation stage 3 2 multi time scale analysis of runoff and sediment load using the ceemd method the original data series of runoff and sediment load at the pre and post operation stage of ghs are decomposed as figs 4 and 5 figs 4 and 5 show the following 1 whether at the pre or post operation stage runoff and sediment load time series at ghs can be all decomposed into three imfs and one residue which means they involve complex periodic fluctuations and micro level developing trends 2 in the pre operation stage the runoff and sediment load have the same periodic fluctuations with multi time scales the quasi periodic fluctuations of the three imfs of runoff and sediment load are 3 years 7 years and 17 years separately except for the difference in amplitude they exhibit similar frequency and synchronous changes the residues show the same increasing trend existing in runoff and sediment load time series 3 in the post operation stage a quasi periodic fluctuation of 4 years 9 years and 20 years are presented in the runoff time series while 3 5 years 7 5 years and 10 years are shown for the sediment load time series this indicates that if the reservoir operation changes the intra annual and inter annual time distribution of runoff and sediment load then the periodic fluctuations of runoff and sediment load with multi time scale changes too when affected by reservoir storage and regulation the runoff and sediment load tend to be more stable and their amplitudes at different time scales are slowed down compared with that of the pre operation stage meanwhile the fluctuation quasi period of the component with high frequency is extended which means the fluctuation quasi period at short time scales weakens in runoff and sediment load in the components with low frequency the fluctuation quasi period increase in runoff but decrease in sediment load furthermore due to the different influences of reservoir operation on runoff and sediment load the multi time scale changes in runoff and sediment load have larger differences not only in amplitude but also in fluctuation periods and even appear asynchronous ultimately leading to an opposite trend for runoff and sediment load series 4 the residue reflects the overall developing trend of runoff and sediment load series before the reservoir operation the trends of runoff and sediment load series both gradually increase after reservoir operation runoff discharge decreases but its upward trend is still obvious while sediment load not only decreases in its absolute quantity but also shows a declining fundamental trend therefore it can be concluded that reservoir operation produces a greater impact on sediment load than on runoff 3 3 mtse of runoff and sediment load according to the mtse calculation method the mtses of runoff and sediment load on the pre and post operation stage are displayed in table 1 from table 1 it can be seen that 1 at the pre operation stage the regularity of mtses for runoff and sediment load at different time scales is not obvious but after reservoir operation their mtses appear to decrease gradually furthermore the mtses changes in imf components and in residues affected by the reservoir operation is very different compared with the pre operation stage the mtses of all imfs in runoff and sediment load on the post operation stage become larger but the residues are smaller this indicates that at the microscopic and mesoscopic time scales the randomness of runoff and sediment load in different time scales has strengthened and their predictability is more unavailable but the macroscale developing trend has the higher predictability all of these factors mean that the operation of the reservoir a human activity has not only greatly exacerbated the complicated changes in runoff and sediment load at different time scales but also makes these changes more and more orderly and the entire runoff and sediment load system transitions from instability to stability 2 at the pre operation stage of three imfs the largest mtse is presented in the imf2 component of the runoff series and in the imf1 component of the sediment load series this indicates that the imf components with high frequency at the short and middle time scales and carry more information than those with low frequency at the long time scale therefore the available monitoring and researching period for runoff is approximately 7 years and 3 years are more reliable for sediment load the residues of runoff and sediment load series also involve the larger mtse that carried more information and thus the developing trend of runoff and sediment load should be emphasized as well 3 in the post operation stage the largest mtse was present in the imf1 component of both runoff and sediment load so more information is presented in their short time scales and the available monitoring and researching period of runoff and sediment load are approximately 4 years and 3 5 years respectively unlike the pre operation stage the residues of runoff and sediment load are greatly reduced and carry the least amount of information especially for the sediment load series the mtse of its residue decreases the most indicating that the impact of the reservoir operation on the sediment load is greater than that on runoff 3 4 mtsse of runoff and sediment load the mtsse of runoff and sediment load on the pre and post operation stage of the reservoir are shown in figs 6 and 7 in fig 6 on the pre operation stage the average mtsses of runoff and sediment load are 0 575 and 0 785 respectively however in the post operation stage shown in fig 7 the average mtsses of runoff and sediment load increase to 0 587 and 0 9 this means that the reservoir operation changed the transformation characteristics of the fluctuation periods of runoff and sediment load at different time scales which complicated the variation of the fluctuation periods between different time scales the mtsses of sediment load are mostly larger than that of runoff in the pre operation stage whereas in the post operation stage the mtsses of the sediment load are all larger than that of the runoff therefore after reservoir operation the fluctuation changes of sediment load at different time scales varies greatly compared to that of runoff and the periodic changes is more complicated specifically the fluctuation period of high frequency components at the short time scale increases in the post operation stage and the low frequency component at the long time scale decreases when compared to the multi time scale periodic fluctuations of sediment load on the pre operation stage however for the runoff series the fluctuation periods at different time scales increase to explain the relationship between the mtsses of runoff and their imfs along with the mtsses of sediment load and their imfs figs 8 and 9 show the annual variation av curve of mtsses and imfs of the runoff and sediment load series from 1960 to 2013 the reservoir exerted comprehensive regulation on the runoff and sediment load series which weakened their degree of randomness it can thus be seen from figs 8 and 9 that after the reservoir operation all the avs of the mtsses in both runoff and sediment load series are smaller the mtsse represents the fluctuating periodic transformation characteristics of the hydrological variables in the pre operation stage for both the runoff and sediment load series the avs of their mtsses correspond with those of their imf1 components at the short time scale as well as their imf2 components at the middle time scale in the post operation stage the avs of mtsses in the runoff and sediment load series remain linked with their imf1 components with enlarged fluctuation periods at the short time scale this indicates that for the runoff and sediment load series the reservoir operation makes the avs of mtsses caused by the combined action of the changing imf1 and imf2 components to be mainly influenced by the imf1 components 4 conclusions this study combines entropy theory and the ceemd method to investigate how changes to the runoff and sediment load at multi time scales are affected by reservoir operation the following can be concluded 1 the operation of the longyangxia reservoir has a significant influence on the changes in runoff and sediment load at ghs but the influence on the sediment load is greater than that of runoff meanwhile reservoir operation can increase the complexity of runoff and sediment load but with the extended fluctuation of time scales this complexity decreases and predictability increases 2 before reservoir operation there is a strong correlation between runoff and sediment load this correlation is reflected not only in the developing macroscale trend but also in the local characteristics showing that the periodic fluctuations of runoff and sediment load have a similar frequency and synchronous variations at multi time scales 3 after reservoir operation the fluctuation period with a high frequency in the short time scale is elongated for the runoff and sediment load meanwhile the correlations between runoff and sediment load at multi time scales are no longer obvious there are actually significant differences in the variation and fluctuation periods of runoff and sediment load at multi time scales which may even appear as asynchronous changes in individual time scales 4 the mtse and the mtsse analysis results show that the information contents carried by the high and middle frequency imf components are more than those carried by the low frequency imf component in the pre operation stage therefore the reliable representative monitoring periods are 7 years for runoff and 3 years for sediment load however in the post operation stage the information content is focused on the high frequency imf component for runoff and sediment load which the short scale imf components of the runoff and sediment load are transferred to the middle scale component and the corresponding period of the high frequency component is elongated therefore considering the variations of the fluctuation period on the pre and post operation stage in future monitoring and research of runoff and sediment load in the upper reaches of the yellow river the runoff monitoring period can be established at 4 7 years and the sediment load for 3 4 years acknowledgements this research is supported by the national key r d program of china grant no 2018yfc0406501 outstanding young talent research fund of zhengzhou university grant no 1521323002

6792,based on the runoff and sediment load data series obtained at the guide hydrological station ghs in the upper reaches of the yellow river from 1960 to 2013 the varying quasi periodic fluctuations of runoff and sediment load existing in different decomposed time scales are revealed by using the complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition ceemd method pre and post reservoir operation combined with entropy theory the concepts of multi time scale entropy mtse and multi time scale structural entropy mtsse are proposed to analyze the complex fluctuation characteristics of runoff and sediment load at different time scales the results show that reservoir operation has a greater influence on sediment load than that on runoff at multi time scales and that their correlations change as well additionally reservoir operation can aggravate the complexity of the runoff and sediment load but with longer fluctuation time scales this complexity decreases and predictability increases after reservoir operation the fluctuation period of high frequency components in runoff and sediment load is elongated and the information content of runoff and sediment load is focused at the short middle time scale therefore the available and reasonable monitoring and research periods for runoff and sediment load in the upper reaches of the yellow river are suggested as 4 7 years and 3 4 years respectively keywords entropy theory empirical mode decomposition method runoff sediment load reservoir operation multi time scales 1 introduction reservoirs are important artificial structures built on waterways to mitigate disaster risks and provide benefits to communities runoff and sediment load are two primary random hydrological variables with a certain relationship affected by climate change human activities and other factors wu et al 2018 wang et al 2015a while reservoirs provide significant social and economic benefits such as flood control power generation water supply and more they inevitably have a profound impact on the hydrological conditions of rivers including runoff and sediment the construction of reservoirs especially large scale reservoirs has a strong regulatory impact on runoff and sediment load it often causing changes to and evolution of river ecosystems kedra and wiejaczka 2008 lima et al 2017 riverbeds smaga et al 2017 and hydrological conditions chen and guo 2016 this influence may be far reaching so it is important to study the regulatory effects of reservoir application on runoff and sediment load to better understand its causes and evolutionary mechanisms and optimize reservoir operation at present there have been many studies on the impact of reservoir operation on runoff and sediment load however this previous research mainly focuses on the changes in runoff and sediment load in rivers before and after the establishment of reservoirs hou et al 2013 wang et al 2018a wang et al 2014 the impact of reservoir operation on the spatial and temporal distribution of runoff and sediment load ban et al 2014 the contribution of human activities and climate factors on runoff and sediment load kong et al 2016 tian et al 2016 and applied reservoir scheduling under runoff and sediment load changes xiao and peng 2012 like other random variable time series runoff and sediment load time series have multi time scale features the multi time scale feature means that the hydrological variables change within a certain period of time and not only move at a fixed frequency period time scale but also contain changes in various frequencies periodic time scale and local fluctuations zhang et al 2014 ling et al 2017 this phenomenon is the result of the combined efforts of various dynamic mechanisms including meteorological hydrological soil vegetation and human activities and is the fundamental reason for complex changes in hydrological variables over time therefore the research on the impact of reservoir operation on runoff and sediment load must be based on the knowledge of details local characteristics and the overall trends from the multi time perspective in this way the essential characteristics of the hydrological time series can be understood on the microscopic and macroscopic levels so that the mechanism of runoff and sediment load is more accurate and realistic the most commonly used multi time scale analysis method for a variable time series is the wavelet analysis method wang et al 2015b himanshu et al 2017 zhang et al 2017a but it is prone to produce many false harmonics because of its limitations in 1998 huang et al huang et al 1998 proposed empirical mode decomposition emd to overcome the disadvantages of the wavelet transform emd is an adaptive signal time frequency analysis method that decomposes a signal into local fully data driven components with periodic fluctuations in various scales these components are called intrinsic mode function imf however the emd method may produce defects such as modal confusion and endpoint effect in the calculation process huang et al 2009 wu and huang 2009 made improvements to the method and proposed an ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd the eemd method adds white noise into the original signal which can effectively solve the modal confusion problem of the emd method but does produce residual noise in the reconstructed signal sequence in 2010 huang et al yeh et al 2010 made further improvements to the eemd method the added auxiliary noise is in the form of positive and negative pairs which can eliminate the residual noise in the reconstructed signal and the added noise sets numbers can be smaller with higher computational efficiency this method is called ceemd currently the emd and eemd method have been widely used in the hydrological field zhao et al 2017 guo et al 2017 zhang et al 2017b but the ceemd method has insufficient applications in hydrology due to strong interference from the natural environment and human activities the river runoff and sediment load appear highly complex and uncertainty studying the complexity and uncertainty of runoff and sediment load is an important way to understand the dynamic evolution characteristics of nonlinear hydrological systems the concept of entropy originates in physics wang et al 2018b but was introduced into information theory by shannon in 1948 shannon 1948 to describe the uncertainty stability and information in the system in the field of hydrology and water resources the entropy theory is employed to analyze the complexity and uncertainty of hydrological variables baran et al 2017 zeng et al 2016 the innovative contribution of this study is combining the ceemd method with entropy theory the concepts of mtse and messe are proposed to reveal the essential characteristics of runoff and sediment load at the microscopic and macroscopic levels and thus the complexity and uncertainty of runoff and sediment load time series can be better understood under changing environmental conditions this paper demonstrates that when using the ceemd method the periodic fluctuation characteristics and detailed evolution of runoff and sediment load before and after operation of reservoir at multi time scales can be shown reflecting their time frequency relationships according to entropy theory for each time scale the imfs involve different characteristics variations at different time and the information content and complexity of the sequence at different time scales can be described by mtse similarly the transformation changes and periodic fluctuation variations of the imf components at different time scales can be displayed by mtsse therefore the mtse and messe are defined to analyze the complex characteristics and uncertainty of the transformation of runoff and sediment load fluctuation periods at different time scales 2 mathematical methods 2 1 ceemd method the ceemd method is a new adaptive signal time frequency analysis method that separates the imf from complex multicomponent original signals through a screening process the extracted imf component needs to meet the following two conditions 1 in a set containing all data information throughout the time period the number of data maximum and minimum points must be equal to the number of zero crossings or one difference 2 at any time the overall mean of the envelope produced by the connection of the envelope formed by the maximum value point of the data and the minimum point is ultimately zero the ceemd method is based on the emd method and its developed process is as follows 1 define an original signal x t first 2 add n sets of positive and negative pairs of auxiliary white noise into the original signal so that the set numbers of the signal is changed to 2 n which produces two sets of imf components the formula is 1 a 1 a 2 1 1 1 1 x t b where b is the auxiliary noise a 1 a 2 are the signals formed by the added positive and negative pairs 3 decompose these 2 n sets of signals with emd extract each signal using two conditions of the imf component then each signal can be decomposed to obtain a set of imf components eventually a 2n set of imf component is generated 4 find the average value of the corresponding imf component in 2n sets as 2 c j 1 2 n i 1 2 n c ij where c ij is the j th imf component of the i th signal and c j is the j th imf component 5 thus the signal x t can be expressed as m imf components and one residue trend item res r n t 3 x t j 1 m c j r n t 2 2 entropy theory 2 2 1 shannon entropy shannon referring to the field of thermodynamics defines shannon entropy as the average amount of information excluding information redundancy and gives the formula for solving information entropy through analysis shannon entropy can be described as follows if the event has n values described as u u 1 u 2 u n suppose p p 1 p 2 p n is a probability distribution of an event and the appearance of various values are independent of each other the shannon entropy of this distribution is designated as 4 s p i 1 n p i log p i entropy is used to describe the information content and uncertainty of a system if the probability distribution in an information system is uniform its entropy has a maximum value conversely if a system is more stable and regular its entropy is smaller 2 2 2 mtse in information theory entropy represents the average amount of information in the source output for a variable time series the original time series x t is decomposed into m imfs with the ceemd method all imf components are mapped in the time scale plane and involve different frequency components and the imfs characteristics variations on different time scales can be found each scale can be considered an information source and imf component on each scale is equivalent to a message from a source the magnitude of the entropy at different scales corresponds to the information content of different imf components for the i th imf its mtse is calculated as 5 mts e i t 1 n p t log p t where p t is the statistical frequency or probability of the i th imf component in the t th year when p t is the statistical frequency p t x it t 1 n x it x it is the decomposed value of the i th imf component in the t th year n is the total numbers of observation years thus the entropy of imf at different time scales can be obtained and can describe the information content and complexity of the sequence at different time scales 2 2 3 mtsse similarly for a variable time series the original time series x t can be decomposed to obtain a set of imf components with the ceemd method different imf components correspond to different time scales and each scale component is part of the original time series as an internal structure the mtsse of the t th year is defined as 6 mtss e t i 1 m p i log p i where p i x it i 1 m x it is the statistical frequency or probability of the t th year in the i th imf component x it is the decomposed value of the t th year in the i th imf and m is the total numbers of the decomposed imfs the multi time scale structural entropy can reveal the transformation changes and periodic fluctuation variations of the imf components at different time scales the more complicated the change is the larger the multi time scale structural entropy 3 results and discussions 3 1 data sources the longyangxia reservoir is the first large scale comprehensive reservoir located in the upper reaches of the yellow river 168 km from the river s source longyangxia reservoir uses multi annual regulation and plays an important role in flood control power generation irrigation water supply and more the reservoir s designed water level is 2600 m the total storage capacity is 24 7 billion m3 and the regulating storage capacity is 19 4 billion m3 the controlled drainage area above the dam site of the longyangxia reservoir is 131 420 km2 accounting for 17 5 of the total drainage area of the yellow river the guide hydrological station ghs located 54 8 km downstream of the longyangxia dam with a control area of 133 650 km2 is the control station for the outflow of the longyangxia reservoir the location map of the longyangxia reservoir and ghs is shown in fig 1 since beginning its operation in 1986 the longyangxia reservoir has had a profound influence on the downstream runoff and sediment load while exerting comprehensive regulatory benefits in this study the runoff and sediment load data series of ghs from 1960 to 2013 year are obtained as figs 2 and 3 to study the impact of the reservoir operation on runoff and sediment load the data series was divided into 1960 1986 as the pre operation stage and 1987 2013 as the post operation stage 3 2 multi time scale analysis of runoff and sediment load using the ceemd method the original data series of runoff and sediment load at the pre and post operation stage of ghs are decomposed as figs 4 and 5 figs 4 and 5 show the following 1 whether at the pre or post operation stage runoff and sediment load time series at ghs can be all decomposed into three imfs and one residue which means they involve complex periodic fluctuations and micro level developing trends 2 in the pre operation stage the runoff and sediment load have the same periodic fluctuations with multi time scales the quasi periodic fluctuations of the three imfs of runoff and sediment load are 3 years 7 years and 17 years separately except for the difference in amplitude they exhibit similar frequency and synchronous changes the residues show the same increasing trend existing in runoff and sediment load time series 3 in the post operation stage a quasi periodic fluctuation of 4 years 9 years and 20 years are presented in the runoff time series while 3 5 years 7 5 years and 10 years are shown for the sediment load time series this indicates that if the reservoir operation changes the intra annual and inter annual time distribution of runoff and sediment load then the periodic fluctuations of runoff and sediment load with multi time scale changes too when affected by reservoir storage and regulation the runoff and sediment load tend to be more stable and their amplitudes at different time scales are slowed down compared with that of the pre operation stage meanwhile the fluctuation quasi period of the component with high frequency is extended which means the fluctuation quasi period at short time scales weakens in runoff and sediment load in the components with low frequency the fluctuation quasi period increase in runoff but decrease in sediment load furthermore due to the different influences of reservoir operation on runoff and sediment load the multi time scale changes in runoff and sediment load have larger differences not only in amplitude but also in fluctuation periods and even appear asynchronous ultimately leading to an opposite trend for runoff and sediment load series 4 the residue reflects the overall developing trend of runoff and sediment load series before the reservoir operation the trends of runoff and sediment load series both gradually increase after reservoir operation runoff discharge decreases but its upward trend is still obvious while sediment load not only decreases in its absolute quantity but also shows a declining fundamental trend therefore it can be concluded that reservoir operation produces a greater impact on sediment load than on runoff 3 3 mtse of runoff and sediment load according to the mtse calculation method the mtses of runoff and sediment load on the pre and post operation stage are displayed in table 1 from table 1 it can be seen that 1 at the pre operation stage the regularity of mtses for runoff and sediment load at different time scales is not obvious but after reservoir operation their mtses appear to decrease gradually furthermore the mtses changes in imf components and in residues affected by the reservoir operation is very different compared with the pre operation stage the mtses of all imfs in runoff and sediment load on the post operation stage become larger but the residues are smaller this indicates that at the microscopic and mesoscopic time scales the randomness of runoff and sediment load in different time scales has strengthened and their predictability is more unavailable but the macroscale developing trend has the higher predictability all of these factors mean that the operation of the reservoir a human activity has not only greatly exacerbated the complicated changes in runoff and sediment load at different time scales but also makes these changes more and more orderly and the entire runoff and sediment load system transitions from instability to stability 2 at the pre operation stage of three imfs the largest mtse is presented in the imf2 component of the runoff series and in the imf1 component of the sediment load series this indicates that the imf components with high frequency at the short and middle time scales and carry more information than those with low frequency at the long time scale therefore the available monitoring and researching period for runoff is approximately 7 years and 3 years are more reliable for sediment load the residues of runoff and sediment load series also involve the larger mtse that carried more information and thus the developing trend of runoff and sediment load should be emphasized as well 3 in the post operation stage the largest mtse was present in the imf1 component of both runoff and sediment load so more information is presented in their short time scales and the available monitoring and researching period of runoff and sediment load are approximately 4 years and 3 5 years respectively unlike the pre operation stage the residues of runoff and sediment load are greatly reduced and carry the least amount of information especially for the sediment load series the mtse of its residue decreases the most indicating that the impact of the reservoir operation on the sediment load is greater than that on runoff 3 4 mtsse of runoff and sediment load the mtsse of runoff and sediment load on the pre and post operation stage of the reservoir are shown in figs 6 and 7 in fig 6 on the pre operation stage the average mtsses of runoff and sediment load are 0 575 and 0 785 respectively however in the post operation stage shown in fig 7 the average mtsses of runoff and sediment load increase to 0 587 and 0 9 this means that the reservoir operation changed the transformation characteristics of the fluctuation periods of runoff and sediment load at different time scales which complicated the variation of the fluctuation periods between different time scales the mtsses of sediment load are mostly larger than that of runoff in the pre operation stage whereas in the post operation stage the mtsses of the sediment load are all larger than that of the runoff therefore after reservoir operation the fluctuation changes of sediment load at different time scales varies greatly compared to that of runoff and the periodic changes is more complicated specifically the fluctuation period of high frequency components at the short time scale increases in the post operation stage and the low frequency component at the long time scale decreases when compared to the multi time scale periodic fluctuations of sediment load on the pre operation stage however for the runoff series the fluctuation periods at different time scales increase to explain the relationship between the mtsses of runoff and their imfs along with the mtsses of sediment load and their imfs figs 8 and 9 show the annual variation av curve of mtsses and imfs of the runoff and sediment load series from 1960 to 2013 the reservoir exerted comprehensive regulation on the runoff and sediment load series which weakened their degree of randomness it can thus be seen from figs 8 and 9 that after the reservoir operation all the avs of the mtsses in both runoff and sediment load series are smaller the mtsse represents the fluctuating periodic transformation characteristics of the hydrological variables in the pre operation stage for both the runoff and sediment load series the avs of their mtsses correspond with those of their imf1 components at the short time scale as well as their imf2 components at the middle time scale in the post operation stage the avs of mtsses in the runoff and sediment load series remain linked with their imf1 components with enlarged fluctuation periods at the short time scale this indicates that for the runoff and sediment load series the reservoir operation makes the avs of mtsses caused by the combined action of the changing imf1 and imf2 components to be mainly influenced by the imf1 components 4 conclusions this study combines entropy theory and the ceemd method to investigate how changes to the runoff and sediment load at multi time scales are affected by reservoir operation the following can be concluded 1 the operation of the longyangxia reservoir has a significant influence on the changes in runoff and sediment load at ghs but the influence on the sediment load is greater than that of runoff meanwhile reservoir operation can increase the complexity of runoff and sediment load but with the extended fluctuation of time scales this complexity decreases and predictability increases 2 before reservoir operation there is a strong correlation between runoff and sediment load this correlation is reflected not only in the developing macroscale trend but also in the local characteristics showing that the periodic fluctuations of runoff and sediment load have a similar frequency and synchronous variations at multi time scales 3 after reservoir operation the fluctuation period with a high frequency in the short time scale is elongated for the runoff and sediment load meanwhile the correlations between runoff and sediment load at multi time scales are no longer obvious there are actually significant differences in the variation and fluctuation periods of runoff and sediment load at multi time scales which may even appear as asynchronous changes in individual time scales 4 the mtse and the mtsse analysis results show that the information contents carried by the high and middle frequency imf components are more than those carried by the low frequency imf component in the pre operation stage therefore the reliable representative monitoring periods are 7 years for runoff and 3 years for sediment load however in the post operation stage the information content is focused on the high frequency imf component for runoff and sediment load which the short scale imf components of the runoff and sediment load are transferred to the middle scale component and the corresponding period of the high frequency component is elongated therefore considering the variations of the fluctuation period on the pre and post operation stage in future monitoring and research of runoff and sediment load in the upper reaches of the yellow river the runoff monitoring period can be established at 4 7 years and the sediment load for 3 4

6793,while extensive green roofs are popular measures for reducing and delaying stormwater runoff design tools are needed to better predict roof performance based on material properties geometry and climate this paper investigates the epa s storm water management model s swmm green roof module for this purpose based on observed runoff from several roofs with different build ups geometry and climates first the general model performance was investigated and secondly transferability of model parameters for similar roofs but different geometries and climates was tested individual models reproduced runoff hydrographs well nse 0 56 0 96 while the long term modelling showed relatively large volume errors most likely due to insufficient representation of evapotranspiration in the model model parameters obtained at one site were only partly transferable to similar roof build up at other sites transferability was better from models calibrated with wetter climates and higher intensity events to drier climates than the opposite way multi site calibration resulted in model parameters performing well for most sites giving model parameters that could be used for the design of similar roof build ups in comparable climates however large variability in obtained model parameters large volume errors and the fact that the calibrated model parameters did not directly correspond to measured material properties place concerns on the generality of the swmm green roof module as a design tool keywords green roofs design storm water management model swmm lid calibration validation 1 introduction green roofs are popular measures for stormwater management while also providing a set of other positive aspects to local environment ranging from reduced energy consumption for buildings reduction in heat island effects increase in urban habitats and bringing visual improvements to urban areas besir and cuce 2018 oberndorfer et al 2007 saadatian et al 2013 a substantial amount of green roof research has been published over the last decade wherein performance of green roofs has been examined in terms of both permanent retention and temporary detention storage of water in the green roof build ups akther et al 2018 berndtsson 2010 carter and rasmussen 2006 li and babcock 2014 there is a large variation in reported performance which has been explained by several factors ranging from natural e g climate precipitation patterns and amounts alfredo et al 2010 to material properties e g layer build up soulis et al 2017a and roof geometry size shape and slope carson et al 2013 hakimdavar et al 2014 this makes field observations difficult to directly use for design purposes stovin et al 2017 most engineers designing stormwater solutions prefer simplified methods in terms of schematic values plots or the use of well known modelling tools preferable methods should be able to show performance as a function of applied materials measured material properties and depths roof geometry and local climate to simplify the design process the necessary parameters and coefficients should be readily available without extensive field experiments different approaches have been applied to represent green roof s performance from the traditional applied runoff coefficients and curve numbers via single or multiple regression equations to more complex conceptual or physical models li and babcock 2014 this paper briefly presents different published approaches before thoroughly testing one of the modelling tools the united states environmental protection agency s epa storm water management model swmm green roof low impact development lid module for general model performance and for a comparison of calibrated model parameters between sites and to material properties curve numbers cn and volumetric runoff coefficients cv combined with design storms are widely applied methods for calculating surface runoff making coefficients for green roofs highly sought after fassman beck et al 2016 made a thorough investigation of retention performance from rainfall runoff data from 21 living roofs the authors emphasize the fact that the coefficients poorly represent the performance variability of green roofs but due to the demand for such numbers they suggest a climate specific modified approached using cn and cv to predict green roof runoff regression models showing a second order relation between precipitation and runoff depth have been found useful in representing runoff at a specific site by fassman beck et al 2013 and carson et al 2013 but these types of models are not transferable to other climates roof build ups and roof geometries stovin et al 2012 performed multiple linear regression analysis to predict hydrological performance but these showed poor predictive capability it was suggested that a continuous simulation approach based on substrate moisture flux is better suited to predict retention performance because it can deal with the complex inter event processes conceptual water balance models as presented by kasmin et al 2010 have been proven successful for modelling green roof retention in several later studies if adequate evapotranspiration estimates are implemented johannessen et al 2017 starry et al 2016 stovin et al 2013 moreover conceptual models have been extended with reservoir routing models or runoff coefficients to model detention processes kasmin et al 2010 locatelli et al 2014 soulis et al 2017b vesuviano and stovin 2013 yio et al 2013 model parameters have been linked to materials roof slopes and drainage length although these conceptual models have proven to successfully reproduce the observed green roof performance they are highly dependent on laboratory or field testing and hence are not transferable to green roofs with different materials layer build up and geometry several physically based models have also been suggested useful in reproducing green roof runoff like the soil water atmosphere and plant model swap metselaar 2012 hydrological evaluation of landfill performance help carson et al 2017 and integrated hydrological model at residential scale ihmors herrera et al 2018 all these models include the possibility to model several consecutive substrate layers while swap and ihmors lack the ability to model lateral flow and are thus unable to include the detention effect resulting from the horizontal flow through the drainage layer in the green roof geometry hydrus a commercial physically based model for water movement in variably saturated media has been applied to several green roof studies in the one 1d hilten et al 2008 palla et al 2012 soulis et al 2017b two 2d li and babcock 2015 or three dimensional 3d model version brunetti and simunek 2016 showing adequate performance the model is based on a quite large number of physical parameters defined either from laboratory measurements or from model calibration introducing high computational requirements and challenging calibration with variability in calibrated parameters soulis et al 2017b even though a large number of modelling tools have shown good abilities to reproduce observed green roof runoff few of these models are applied among practitioners who need tools to estimate runoff from green roofs to further combine with other stormwater measures for system design purposes this could be due to little knowledge of some of these specialized modelling tools or inability to estimate model parameters accurately for many stormwater engineers a green roof modeling tool that combines with existing stormwater models and is based on generic material parameters would be preferable swmm is an easily accessible widely known and applied open source physically based dynamic rainfall runoff simulation model used for predicting flows from contributing subcatchments and for analyzing wastewater and stormwater flow in piped systems rossman 2015 the first attempts of applying swmm to green roofs were carried out by modelling the green roof as permeable area coupled with a runoff coefficient a curve number or modelled as a storage node alfredo et al 2010 roehr and kong 2010 later after a bioretention lid module was added to swmm green roof runoff was simulated with this module burszta adamiak and mrowiec 2013 cipolla et al 2016 the bioretention module includes a surface layer describing possible surface storage and overland flows a soil layer describing the properties of the substrate affecting temporary and permanent water storage and infiltration properties a separate water storage layer based on available volume and depth and a drain function based on a drain coefficient c and a drain exponent n creating runoff rossman 2015 cipolla et al 2016 reported satisfactory performance of the calibrated bioretention module while burszta adamiak and mrowiec 2013 found the module to have limited capabilities in correctly simulating the runoff hydrographs the main objection to this approach for green roof modelling is the use of two drain parameters predicting runoff without including parameters describing roof geometry and drainage layer materials the swmm green roof lid module was introduced in 2014 it has the same surface and soil layers as the bioretention module but with a drainage mat as its bottommost layer the drainage mat provides volume for temporary storage of water while the runoff from the green roof is calculated based on manning s equation with a specific roughness coefficient for the drainage layer evapotranspiration can be modelled based on a constant on monthly values an external input time series climate file or calculated by a climatology editor using the hargreaves method with a possibility to add a monthly soil recovery pattern rossman and huber 2016a palla and gnecco 2015 krebs et al 2016 and peng and stovin 2017 applied the swmm green roof module including calibration and validation of the model parameters krebs et al 2016 and peng and stovin 2017 used field studies and evaluated the model both with continuous data to account for the retention process and with events to account for the detention parameters while palla and gnecco 2015 applied synthetic rainfall events all studies reported that the calibrated models represented the overall runoff generation process very well with better performance for high intensity rainfall events i e events with high runoff to rainfall ratio when compared to low runoff events on the other hand krebs et al 2016 and peng and stovin 2017 discovered the inability of the models to physically represent and predict performance of the plastic board drainage layer to be an important limiting factor furthermore peng and stovin 2017 attribute swmm s limitations in estimating evapotranspiration to its shortcomings in accounting for the influence of the substrate moisture a simplification which krebs et al 2016 found to be of limited effect on initial moisture content in a nordic climate all reported studies of the swmm green roof module are calibrated based on small scale units 2 6 m2 with 2 8 slope substrate depth of 80 120 mm and an egg cup shaped conjugated plastic drainage mat as the bottommost layer calibrated swmm green roof models have shown promising results when simulating green roof runoff from specific small scale test roofs while there is still lack of knowledge to whether the model parameters are true material constants transferable to other roofs with deviating climates geometry and build up making this a generic tool for design and performance evaluation this study investigates the performance of the swmm green roof module in general for several roofs with varying roof build ups sizes slopes and climates calibrated model parameters for identical roof build ups with deviating geometries and climates have been compared assuming that if model parameters were comparable this would be an indication that these were true material constants that could be used for design purposes transferability of parameters has further been investigated by cross validation of parameters among the study sites and by implementing a multi site calibration procedure calibrated model parameters have been compared to other comparable studies and laboratory measurements to see if these could be a source for parameter values when field tests are missing the objectives of the study have been 1 evaluate model performance of the swmm green roof module with respect to long term retention performance and event based reproduction of the runoff hydrograph across geographical different climates 2 evaluate the use of the swmm green roof module as a generic tool by comparing estimated parameters across different sites roof build ups and geometries 2 materials and methods 2 1 site descriptions various field studies containing mainly extensive green roofs but also black bitumen reference roofs and a non vegetated media gray roof with various scale were built to increase knowledge in terms of stormwater retention and runoff detention in cold climate table 1 laboratory tests were conducted to supplement field studies test plots 8 15 m2 as well as full scale 100 m2 field sites were set up in different cities representing the typical coastal climate with various rainfall pattern across norway bergen ber oslo osl sandnes san and trondheim in trondheim data from two different test sites were included risvollan ris and høvringen hov each monitored roof is identified by its location and a number e g ber1 and ber3 bergen experienced most precipitation per month followed by sandnes and oslo while the two sites in trondheim were the driest fig 1 in the figure one can see a comparison between individual sites as well as periods chosen for calibration and validation in two sites osl1 and hov2 a black bitumen roof was used as a reference roof while a gray roof was tested in one site hov1 three groups of extensive green roofs from three different suppliers a b and c which henceforth shall be referred to as type a type b and type c were tested the type a designed for sloped roofs ris1 ber1 and san1 consisted of a vegetation mat 30 mm substrate in a reinforced net of fiber pre cultivated and sedum based over a 10 mm thick textile retention fabric fig 2 b the type b for sloped roofs ber4 san3 have vegetation mat similar to type a but with a 3 mm thick textile retention mat fig 2b the type b for a flat roof hov3 also included a thicker textile retention mat 11 mm over a 25 mm conjugated plastic drainage layer fig 2c this configuration where a thin sedum vegetation mat 30 mm constitute the total substrate depth is typical for the scandinavian market where they are preferred due to fast establishment low weight and low maintenance needs and where the drought risks are lower than in central europe and united states due to the cold and wet climate in general little green roof research is published on these thin configurations and to the knowledge of the authors no applications of the swmm green roof module are published the type c for sloped roofs consisted of a 30 mm vegetation mat over 50 mm of extra substrates a 25 mm conjugated plastic drainage layer ris3 or a 75 mm polystyrene drainage layer ber3 san2 and with a 10 mm textile retention mat in the bottom for all fig 2d the non vegetated gray roof hov1 consisted of a 200 mm layer of lightweight expanded clay aggregates covered by paving stones fig 2a the expanded clay layer served partially as the soil layer as well as the drainage layer for model purposes 10 of the total thickness was assumed to represent the drainage layer for more information about the field experiments see johannessen et al 2018 and hamouz et al 2018 besides field tests laboratory experiments were performed in order to test whether or not laboratory experiments could give material parameters comparable to the one obtained from field experiments this includes vegetated and non vegetated roofs as well as simply individual layers retention mats and a reference roof the laboratory experiments were conducted according to the procedure given in the german green roofing guideline published by the landscape development and landscaping research society fll fll 2008 for more information on the laboratory tests see schärer 2018 2 2 data collection continuous time series from the field rooftops and short term event based data records from the laboratory were used as inputs to the hydrological model table 1 the ris ber san and osl field studies are based on two years of data while the hov field study is based on a total of 6 5 months of data winter data were excluded due to challenges with snow accumulation and melt precipitation was measured on site for all field experiments with a heated tipping bucket rain gauge runoff was measured with a pressure transducer measuring changes in a collection tank for all sites except høvringen where a weight based system was applied precipitation and runoff data were recorded with time intervals of 1 minute bergen sandnes risvollan and høvringen 5 minutes oslo and 3 second laboratory experiments details on instrumentation and data collection can be found in hamouz et al 2018 johannessen et al 2018 and schärer 2018 laboratory measurements of porosity field capacity and wilting point for the green roof type c substrate and the hov1 and lab6 material was performed based on a porous plate apparatus method richards 1948 while the saturated hydraulic conductivity of type c substrate was tested according to the german green roofing guidelines water permeability method fll 2008 2 3 model description the swmm version 5 1 012 including the green roof lid module was applied the rooftop test beds were modeled as subcatchments that were 100 occupied 88 for hov1 and hov3 by the lid the parameters in swmm s green roof module consisting of the individual lid layers soil and drainage mat as well as two parameters from the surface subcatchment surface roughness manning s n and depression storage were used in the calibration process table 2 initial parameter values as well as lower and upper bounds for the calibration were estimated from field observations laboratory experiments adopted from other studies cipolla et al 2016 krebs et al 2016 palla and gnecco 2015 peng and stovin 2017 rosa et al 2015 or from swmm manuals rossman 2015 rossman and huber 2016b however parameters describing physical features such as thicknesses slopes berm heights and elements of the surface lid layer were excluded from the calibration the values of these parameters were obtained directly from the field experiment setups table 1 potential evapotranspiration rates were determined using hargreaves method hargreaves and allen 2003 computing daily evaporation rates from the daily air temperature records provided in an external climate file while soil recovery coefficients were calibrated in order to achieve the best model fit 2 4 model calibration and evaluation a uniform prior distribution was assumed for all calibration parameters given in table 2 the optimal model parameters were identified through model calibration using the shuffled complex evolution sce algorithm duan et al 1992 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse eq 1 nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the relative percentage difference rpd eq 2 were used for model evaluation first as objective functions for the calibration period referred to as model calibration then applied as metrics for measuring model performance when the calibrated parameters were applied in the validation period referred to as model validation in general the closer the nse is to 1 the more accurately the model can predict the observed performance whilst an nse greater than 0 5 indicates acceptable model performance rosa et al 2015 parameter spans giving acceptable model performance were defined as the 5 95 percentile of all parameters fulfilling the requirement of nse 0 5 or rpd 25 nse 1 1 n q obs i q sim i 2 1 n q obs i q obs 2 qobs observed dischargeqsim simulated discharge q obs mean of observed discharge eq 1 rpd v obs v sim v obs 100 vobs observed runoff volumesvsim simulated runoff volumes eq 2 model performance was further evaluated visually using the quantile quantile q q plots a quantile based evaluation provides a more comprehensive analysis approach where whether or not the simulated and observed runoff series exhibit consistent distributions can be assessed directly thyer et al 2009 observed and simulated runoff from the event based calibration was classified in to 100 bins plotted against each other and compared to a 1 1 line to evaluate the model performance at different flow regimes a q q plot along the 1 1 line indicates that the distribution of the simulated runoff series is consistent with that of the observed runoff hence good model performance any deviation of a q q plot from the 1 1 line implies inconsistent uncertainty in the simulated and observed runoff time series with the 1 1 line as a reference sections where the q q data points plot above this line indicate an overestimation while data points that fall under this line indicate an underestimation of the simulated flows a two step calibration procedure separating the volume calibration retention performance from the peak runoff detention performance calibration was carried out retention related parameters soil field capacity soil wilting point and soil recovery constant were calibrated with a continuous time series first and evaluated based on volume errors rpd these parameters were then kept constant while the remaining detention related parameters were calibrated on selected events with high intensity precipitation and evaluated with nse similar calibration approaches calibrating both on retention and detention performance were also carried out by krebs et al 2016 and peng and stovin 2017 for the swmm green roof module for the continuous calibration the observed time series were divided in two equal parts for calibration and validation table 1 for the event based evaluation the four to five largest events were chosen for the calibration and validation period respectively the maximum 5 minute intensities of the chosen events are given in fig 3 together with intensities of the two and five year return period events from local intensity duration frequency idf curves some events exceeded the two and five year return periods while most of the applied events had return periods less than two years for the laboratory experiments based on only one event nse alone was used for model calibration model parameters were first calibrated for each site and configuration individually transferability of model parameters among models of similar roof build ups was further tested with three different approaches the first approach was carried out by manually selecting a common set of parameter values for all type a sloped roofs type b sloped roofs type c sloped roofs and reference roofs and evaluating the performance these parameters were set as close to the optimal values obtained in the individual calibration as possible the second approach was based on a cross validation of parameters among sites for example optimal parameters of the type a sloped roof in trondheim ris1 were applied at sandnes san1 and bergen ber1 sites and evaluated and so on for all comparable roof build ups the third approach was carried out as a multi site calibration by artificially creating a combined time series of all comparable roofs running a calibration and validating the performance based on both the combined series and the individual sites to reduce the influence of variability in runoff flows the runoff was normalized 0 qmin to 1 qmax for each series in the last approach 3 results and discussion 3 1 individual model evaluation the individual model calibration procedure resulted in volume errors ranging from 4 to 28 in the calibration period and from 5 to 17 in the validation period table 3 while some of the models showed acceptable volume errors six models with errors less than 6 others exhibit large volume errors 3 models with errors larger than 20 this is most likely due to the fact that the model does not fully represent the evapotranspiration processes taking place as suggested by earlier studies e g peng and stovin 2017 however it could also be due to measurement inaccuracies and uncertainties the model represents evapotranspiration by the hargreaves method combined with a soil recovery coefficient and does not include the influence of soil moisture which has been shown to have an important impact on evapotranspiration in green roofs berretta et al 2014 stovin et al 2013 the calibration was based on one soil recovery coefficient for the whole model period however it is possible that individual coefficients for each month might improve the performance larger volume errors were found for all tested configurations at høvringen hov one explanation might be uncertainties in the precipitation measurement related to placement of the field station at høvringen located by the coast exposed to an open fjord area and therefore experience higher wind stress this model was also the only where the lid occupied only 88 compared to 100 for the other models which might have influenced the model performance another aspect that could introduce volume errors are possible temporal variations in model parameters not accounted for in the model this aspect will be further discussed in chapter 4 2 the individual model s ability to reproduce the observed runoff hydrograph was evaluated by nse coefficients table 3 all model runs provided nse larger than 0 56 with an average of 0 80 for both the calibration and the validation period which can be considered adequate performance for a rainfall runoff model based on field observations rosa et al 2015 fig 4 shows q q plots of the observed versus simulated runoff at the study sites each data point represent 1 of the data and it can be seen that most of the data fall in the low to medium flow regime under the 75 percentile the individual model calibrations showed good model performance for all data up to the 98 99 percentile while peak flows were overestimated hov3 ber3 or underestimated hov2 ris1 ber1 ris3 for several of the models fig 4 3 2 model parameters optimal model parameters for all calibrated models are given in table 4 a e together with nse values from the calibration 3 2 1 reference roofs three models of reference roofs osl1 hov2 lab1 were calibrated resulting in model parameters that could be useful for design purposes when comparing different roof configurations to conventional roofs table 4a all reference roofs were based on black bitumen roofing but with varying roof size slope and type of experiment optimal model parameters from individual calibration were comparable good model performance was found for both the manually chosen common parameter set and the multi site calibration table 4a fig 4b fig 5 b indicating that the swmm model reproduces the runoff satisfactory and can be used for modeling reference roofs of variable sizes and locations the laboratory experiments were conducted with one high intensity rainfall event which differed significantly from the conditions in the field experiments and gave larger spans of model parameters but still comparable optimal values recommended model parameters for reference roofs based on this study are a manning s roughness coefficient of 0 01 as also found by cipolla et al 2016 in an earlier study and a depression storage of 0 03 3 2 2 model retention performance the available water storage capacity in green roofs in the swmm green roof module is defined by the pore space between the field capacity and the wilting point combined with the soil thickness no storage capacity is included in the drainage layer of the model even if the properties of the drainage layer might allow for water to be stored there i e in cups in the conjugated plastic drainage layers or soaked up in the textile retention drainage mats in some initial tests separate monthly soil recovery patterns were applied while in the individual calibration reported here only one soil recovery coefficient was applied the individual model calibrations showed large variation in optimal parameters for both field capacities 24 44 and wilting points 1 15 for the same material at different sites and the resulting parameters seem to be influenced by local climate conditions table 4b e the highest field capacities were found for the wettest site ber the highest calibrated wilting points were found for the thickest configurations type c possibly due to the fact that the total available storage capacities for the thickest configurations in a norwegian climate are seldom utilized johannessen et al 2017 little or no data when the roof reaches its wilting point is expected to be present in the observed data used to calibrate the model and this might affect the model s ability to predict these parameters properly the span between the field capacity and the wilting point was only 3 for the type b flat roof hov3 this model also has a volume error of 28 for the calibration period indicating that the model is unable to reproduce the retention processes of this roof laboratory experiments of type c substrate gave a field capacity of 21 and a wilting point of 1 5 this is a large deviation from the individual calibrations giving field capacity 24 44 and wilting point 7 15 but corresponds quite well to the field capacity obtained in the multi site calibration 23 tests conducted with monthly soil recovery coefficients resulted in large seasonal variability in the predicted coefficients and a median span of model parameters of 0 19 median model parameter span increased to 0 30 in the calibration including only one soil recovery coefficient for some of the configurations like ris3 the monthly variations could be explained by variations in precipitation pattern with drier conditions in some months giving lower soil moisture content which again reduces the actual evapotranspiration fig 6 a bottom however if this was properly represented in the model the same pattern should be found in all configurations at the same site experiencing the same local climate this was not the case for the modelled sites as shown for ris1 which shows a deviating pattern from ris3 fig 6a top large variation in optimal values at the same site was also found when applying only one soil recovery coefficient while model parameter spans were overlapping for all green roofs at the same site fig 6b both the large volume errors and the large variation in calibrated parameters for soil recovery coefficients field capacities and wilting points confirms earlier findings indicating that the modelling of evapotranspiration in the swmm lid module based on the hargreaves method combined with a soil recovery coefficient is not adequately representing the actual evapotranspiration and thereby also the retention processes taking place feng and burian 2016 peng and stovin 2017 this insufficient representation of the evapotranspiration processes in the model is also expected to affect the detention performance and detention parameters as the observed runoff pattern is a combination of initial retention and detention 3 2 3 green roof drainage layers parameters the drainage layer parameters are expected to play an important role in runoff generation especially for full scale roofs as they will define the detention process associated with the horizontal water movement the only flat green roof included in the study resulted in a drainage layer void fraction of 0 64 and a manning s n of 0 07 model studies with similar conjugated plastic drainage layers resulted in comparable calibrated void fractions of 0 4 0 6 but lower manning s roughness coefficients of 0 01 0 03 krebs et al 2016 palla and gnecco 2015 peng and stovin 2017 these studies were based on table scale green roof units with drainage lengths of 2 3 m which could explain the differences in the findings the swmm manual suggests a void fraction of 0 2 0 4 and manning s n values of 0 01 0 03 but without specifying the drainage layer build up rossman and huber 2016b the sloped green roofs included in the study were all equipped with textile retention mats as the bottommost layer while the total thickness of the drainage layer varied between the different types the drainage layer parameters were the parameters that showed the largest variation both between the individual models of same type between individual models and multi site calibrated models for the same type and between the different types in spite of the similarities of the bottommost layer this indicated that the swmm green roof module have limited ability to represent the water movement through the drainage layer a process considered by the authors to be quite important for modelling detention properly on large scale roofs this limitation of the model was also mentioned by krebs et al 2016 who also applied a textile retention mat as the bottommost layer and by peng and stovin 2017 who applied a slightly different configuration with a plastic drainage layer as the bottommost layer the laboratory experiments of the textile retention mats alone were carried out to test whether these kinds of experiments could give model parameters for different materials the results showed large parameter spans and not comparable optimal parameters to the parameters obtained from field studies and can therefore not be recommended to use for determining model parameters laboratory experiments were calibrated based on only one high intensity event repeated tests with varying intensities might change the results but this was not tested 3 2 4 green roof soil parameters porosities were found to be larger for the reinforced vegetation mats compared to the type c roofs which also had an extra separate substrate layer and with small variations within the same type of green roofs laboratory experiments on the type c extra substrate gave a porosity of 58 which corresponded with one of the model s optimal value of 59 but this was higher than the other models and the multi site calibration value unfortunately it was not possible to measure the porosities of the vegetation mats due to the reinforced structure but based on visual observations it is likely that the porosities are higher in these as also found in the model calibration soil conductivity varied both between and within the different types of green roofs 42 1276 mm hour while there was slightly less variation in the obtained parameters for conductivity slope 14 60 and suction head 6 69 the swmm manual suggests soil conductivity values in the range 1000 2500 mm hr rossman and huber 2016b while the german green roofing guidelines give a requirement for water permeability in the range 36 4200 mm hr fll 2008 laboratory experiments with the type c substrate gave water permeability from 370 to 570 mm hr which is lower than the model parameters found in the individual models but closer to the multi site calibrated value of 596 mm hr krebs et al 2016 applied a pregrown vegetation mat type a over a thicker substrate and found a soil conductivity of 38 mm hr while palla and gnecco 2015 and peng and stovin 2017 found it to be 1000 mm hr 3 2 5 gray roofs two models of gray roofs one from the laboratory lab6 and one field site hov1 were calibrated in the same way as the green roofs both gray roofs were based on a lightweight expanded clay aggregate but with varying particle size roof size and type of experiment continuous versus laboratory the drainage parameters of hov1 showed greater values than all other configuration manning s n 0 48 this corresponds well to the observed runoff with prolonged runoff compared to the green roofs however the calibrated parameters might be too high as high flows had a tendency to be slightly underestimated fig 4a fig 5a since the soil conductivity vertical movement was very high the horizontal movement through the expanded clay layer was expected to provide substantial detention porosity was found to be lower for the gray roof than for the green roofs conductivity higher while conductivity slope and suction heads were found to be comparable laboratory measured porosity was 54 2 for the hov1 material much higher than the calibrated model porosity of 35 field capacity and the wilting point determining the soil retention was found to both be 15 according to the calibrated model parameters for hov1 laboratory measurements of the same material gave a field capacity of 15 6 consistent to the model parameter while the wilting point was measured to be 12 6 indicating that there was a small potential retention capacity in the material that was not found in the model parameters identical values for field capacity and wilting point in the model corresponds to no available storage capacity and explains the large volume error of the model table 3 this is a strong indication that the model does not properly represents the retention processes the lab6 model gave a porosity close to the laboratory measured 54 while field capacity 10 and wilting point 6 5 deviated largely from the model derived parameters of respectively 27 and 10 runoff hydrographs were well reproduced according to nse values table 3 while the model underestimated the runoff for the upper 15 of the data fig 4a 4 practical implications 4 1 laboratory measured material properties laboratory measurements of porosity field capacity and wilting point were carried out for the extra substrates used in the continuous field observations for type c green roofs and the hov1 gray roof laboratory measured porosities were higher than the model calibrated porosities while the wilting points were found to be lower in laboratory measurements than in the model field capacities in the model however were found to be comparable to laboratory measurements of these laboratory measurements of water permeability according to the method described in the german green roofing guidelines were slightly lower than the saturated hydraulic conductivity found in the models based on the same material this method has been questioned for its accuracy and the large deviation from other methods double ring infiltrometer earlier fassman and simcock 2012 calibrated model parameters from the synthetic rain laboratory runoff tests did not show comparable model parameters to the models calibrated with field observations and cannot be used to obtain model parameters this indicates that laboratory measurements should be used with caution in the swmm green roof module alternatively one could argue that physical measurements when available should be used in a physically based model to improve the model s ability to represent unmeasured systems the challenges with such an approach in this study are discussed in section 4 2 however such an approach would simplify the use of the model and should be investigated further with respect to model performance and which parameters could be based on physical measurements and which need to be calibrated 4 2 can the swmm green roof lid module provide generic material parameters the individually calibrated models reproduced the observed green runoff patterns during precipitation events sufficiently as documented by acceptable nse values table 4 and by the quantile plots fig 4 while the long term retention processes were less well reproduced giving variable volume errors the swmm green roof module is a model based on the physical properties and processes in a green roof provided that the model sufficiently reproduces the reality and measurement inaccuracies are limited similar generic model parameters should be obtained when calibrating green roofs with the same roof build up at different sites and with different climate and geometry such transferable model parameters could then further be used for design purposes in sites without experimental data the individually calibrated optimal model parameters were in some cases similar while in other cases quite different for the same type of roofs table 4a d one of the challenges with model calibration is that it provides a set of optimal parameters which together give the best model performance without addressing the possible interdependency of the parameters several different parameter sets can give an adequate model performance which could explain some of the variations in the obtained parameters for the same roof types one could hypothesize that by using fewer model parameters for calibration less variation could be found revealing parameter interdependencies could give information that further could be used to reduce the number of parameters for calibration interdependency of parameters was investigated by visually comparing all sets of acceptable parameter values nse 0 5 by plotting all parameter values against each other e g soil porosity versus soil conductivity soil porosity versus conductivity slope and so on for each individual model no repeated patterns that could have given information about interdependencies of model parameters in the swmm lid module were found in the plots and this approach was therefore abandoned the number of model parameters could also be reduced by fixing some of the substrate properties measured in laboratory e g water storage capacity calculated from field capacity and wilting point in the model which are measurable in laboratory this would have been a feasible approach if all water storage took place in a single layer and was easily measurable this was not the case in our green roof build ups where water storage took place in several layers vegetation mat extra substrate layer drainage layer and in textile retention mats similarly no standardized infiltration test for measuring green roof hydraulic conductivity in multiple layers exist based on this rather than reducing the number of calibrated parameters this study focused further on the transferability of model parameters between comparable roof build ups at different sites as a method to investigate the credibility of the obtained model parameters the first approach by manually selecting a common set of parameter values for similar roofs build ups at different sites showed poor performance with respect to reproducing the green roofs runoff pattern for type a and b roofs nse 0 5 while the reference roof runoff and two of the type c roofs gave acceptable model performance nse 0 5 table 4a d the results indicated that the model parameter spans could not be used individually as a basis for choosing parameter values this was not surprising considering the interdependency of some of the parameters the second approach cross validation of parameters between sites for the type a roof showed that the parameters obtained in ris were not transferable to the other sites while the parameters obtained in ber and san were transferable to the other sites when evaluated based on nse and quantile plots table 5 fig 4c fig 5c the type b roofs showed a good transferability between the two sites ber and san table 5 the type c roof parameters were transferable only from ber to san and from san to ris table 5 fig 4d the third approach the multi site calibration was more successful resulting in common parameter sets for each green roof type as shown in table 5b d fig 4b c and fig 5d model evaluation showed these parameters to sufficiently reproduce green roof runoff patterns nse 0 5 for all tested roof types except for the type a roofs at risvollan but with some challenges associated with overestimation of the highest flows fig 4c d volume errors however were still variable and quite large as also shown and discussed in relation to the individual model calibrations there seems to be a better transferability of model parameters between ber and san than to ris ber and san are comparable in terms of roof size and drainage length while the slope of the roofs are 16 in ris and ber and 27 in san table 1 slope and size were accounted for in the model but due to the experienced differences in obtained parameters this could not be ruled out as a possible cause another more likely explanation to the differences are the differences in precipitation total precipitation amount was lowest in ris almost double in san and around tripled in ber table1 fig 1 the same pattern can be found for the size of the events used for model calibration and validation fig 3 the results indicate that the model parameters are partly influenced by local conditions and not totally generic model parameters representing only the used materials results showed that models calibrated with high precipitation amounts and peak intensities were transferable to drier sites but not the other way around this finding would also limit the use of models for higher intensity events than included in the calibration process de ville et al 2018 investigated temporal variations in hydraulic parameters as retention by studying field capacity and detention by studying the scale parameter in a fitted reservoir routing model the study revealed large sub annual variations in the studied parameters and suggested this to be caused by temporal variation in substrate hydrophobicity water repellency this could also be a possible explanation to why model parameters differ between similar build ups in different climates as some of the sites were considerably wetter than others the findings could also complicate the modelling concept in general and introduce errors as model parameters are expected to be constant and material dependent the multi site calibration approach produced model parameters giving acceptable model performance for several sites resulting in what seemed to be a more robust model applicable for roofs with varying geometry and climate leading us closer to a generic model however there are still questionable whether the models are generic since the model parameters deviate both between individual models with the same roof build up between individual models and multi site calibrated models and from several of the laboratory measurements of material properties 5 conclusions the individual model calibration procedure using two objective functions rpd for volume errors and nse for hydrograph reproduction gave an acceptable model performance runoff hydrographs for each individual model were well reproduced nse 0 56 for all individual models average nse 0 80 while the long term modelling gave relatively high volume errors average absolute volume error of 9 indicating that the water storage and evapotranspiration processes are not well represented in the swmm green roof lid module manually chosen parameter sets for a given green roof build up based on individual model results showed in general poor model performance model parameters obtained at one site was only partly transferable to similar roof build up at other sites transferability was better from models calibrated with wetter climates and higher intensity events to drier climates than the opposite way multi site calibration resulted in model parameters performing well for all sites and roof types except one of the configurations in trondheim giving model parameters that could be used for design of similar roof build ups with varying geometry and climates however the large

6793,while extensive green roofs are popular measures for reducing and delaying stormwater runoff design tools are needed to better predict roof performance based on material properties geometry and

climates first the general model performance was investigated and secondly transferability of model parameters for similar roofs but different geometries and climates was tested individual models reproduced runoff hydrographs well nse 0 56 0 96 while the long term modelling showed relatively large volume errors most likely due to insufficient representation of evapotranspiration in the model

introduction green roofs are popular measures for stormwater management while also providing a set of other positive aspects to local environment ranging from reduced energy consumption for buildings reduction in heat island effects increase in urban habitats and bringing visual improvements to urban areas besir and cuce 2018 oberndorfer et al 2007 saadatian et al 2013 a substantial amount of green roof research has been published over the last decade wherein performance of green roofs has been examined in terms of both permanent retention and temporary detention storage of water in the green roof build ups akther et al 2018 berndtsson 2010 carter and rasmussen 2006 li and babcock 2014 there is a large variation in reported performance which has been explained by several factors ranging from natural e g climate precipitation patterns and amounts alfredo et al 2010 to material properties e g layer build up soulis et al 2017a and roof geometry size shape and slope carson et al 2013 hakimdavar et al 2014 this makes field observations difficult to directly use for design purposes stovin et al 2017 most engineers designing stormwater solutions prefer simplified methods in terms of schematic values plots or the use of well known modelling tools preferable methods should be able to show performance as a function of applied materials measured material properties and depths roof geometry and local climate to simplify the design process the necessary parameters and coefficients should be readily available without extensive field experiments different approaches have been applied to represent green roof s performance from the traditional applied runoff coefficients and curve numbers via single or multiple regression equations to more complex conceptual or physical models li and babcock 2014 this paper briefly presents different published approaches before thoroughly testing one of the modelling tools the united states environmental protection agency s epa storm water management model swmm green roof low impact development lid module for general model performance and for a comparison of calibrated model parameters between sites and to material properties curve numbers cn and volumetric runoff coefficients cv combined with design storms are widely applied methods for calculating surface runoff making coefficients for green roofs highly sought after fassman beck et al 2016 made a thorough investigation of retention performance from rainfall runoff data from 21 living roofs the authors emphasize the fact that the coefficients poorly represent the performance variability of green roofs but due to the demand for such numbers they suggest a climate specific modified approached using cn and cv to predict green roof runoff regression models showing a second order relation between precipitation and runoff depth have been found useful in representing runoff at a specific site by fassman beck et al 2013 and carson et al 2013 but these types of models are not transferable to other climates roof build ups and roof geometries stovin et al 2012 performed multiple linear regression analysis to predict hydrological performance but these showed poor predictive capability it was suggested that a continuous simulation approach based on substrate moisture flux is better suited to predict retention performance because it can deal with the complex inter event processes conceptual water balance models as presented by kasmin et al 2010 have been proven successful for modelling green roof retention in several later studies if adequate evapotranspiration estimates are implemented johannessen et al 2017 starry et al 2016 stovin et al 2013 moreover conceptual models have been extended with reservoir routing models or runoff coefficients to model detention processes kasmin et al 2010 locatelli et al 2014 soulis et al 2017b vesuviano and stovin 2013 yio et al 2013 model parameters have been linked to materials roof slopes and drainage length although these conceptual models have proven to successfully reproduce the observed green roof performance they are highly dependent on laboratory or field testing and hence are not transferable to green roofs with different materials layer build up and geometry several physically based models have also been suggested useful in reproducing green roof runoff like the soil water atmosphere and plant model swap metselaar 2012 hydrological evaluation of landfill performance help carson et al 2017 and integrated hydrological model at residential scale ihmors herrera et al 2018 all these models include the possibility to model several consecutive substrate layers while swap and ihmors lack the ability to model lateral flow and are thus unable to include the detention effect resulting from the horizontal flow through the drainage layer in the green roof geometry hydrus a commercial physically based model for water movement in variably saturated media has been applied to several green roof studies in the one 1d hilten et al 2008 palla et al 2012 soulis et al 2017b two 2d li and babcock 2015 or three dimensional 3d model version brunetti and simunek 2016 showing adequate performance the model is based on a quite large number of physical parameters defined either from laboratory measurements or from model calibration introducing high computational requirements and challenging calibration with variability in calibrated parameters soulis et al 2017b even though a large number of modelling tools have shown good abilities to reproduce observed green roof runoff few of these models are applied among practitioners who need tools to estimate runoff from green roofs to further combine with other stormwater measures for system design purposes this could be due to little knowledge of some of these specialized modelling tools or inability to estimate model parameters accurately for many stormwater engineers a green roof modeling tool that combines with existing stormwater models and is based on generic material parameters would be preferable swmm is an easily accessible widely known and applied open source physically based dynamic rainfall runoff simulation model used for predicting flows from contributing subcatchments and for analyzing wastewater and stormwater flow in piped systems rossman 2015 the first attempts of applying swmm to green roofs were carried out by modelling the green roof as permeable area coupled with a runoff coefficient a curve number or modelled as a storage node alfredo et al 2010 roehr and kong 2010 later after a bioretention lid module was added to swmm green roof runoff was simulated with this module burszta adamiak and mrowiec 2013 cipolla et al 2016 the bioretention module includes a surface layer describing possible surface storage and overland flows a soil layer describing the properties of the substrate affecting temporary and permanent water storage and infiltration properties a separate water storage layer based on available volume and depth and a drain function based on a drain coefficient c and a drain exponent n creating runoff rossman 2015 cipolla et al 2016 reported satisfactory performance of the calibrated bioretention module while burszta adamiak and mrowiec 2013 found the module to have limited capabilities in correctly simulating the runoff hydrographs the main objection to this approach for green roof modelling is the use of two drain parameters predicting runoff without including parameters describing roof geometry and drainage layer materials the swmm green roof lid module was introduced in 2014 it has the same surface and soil layers as the bioretention module but with a drainage mat as its bottommost layer the drainage mat provides volume for temporary storage of water while the runoff from the green roof is calculated based on manning s equation with a specific roughness coefficient for the drainage layer evapotranspiration can be modelled based on a constant on monthly values an external input time series climate file or calculated by a climatology editor using the hargreaves method with a possibility to add a monthly soil recovery pattern rossman and huber 2016a palla and gnecco 2015 krebs et al 2016 and peng and stovin 2017 applied the swmm green roof module including calibration and validation of the model parameters krebs et al 2016 and peng and stovin 2017 used field studies and evaluated the model both with continuous data to account for the retention process and with events to account for the detention parameters while palla and gnecco 2015 applied synthetic rainfall events all studies reported that the calibrated models represented the overall runoff generation process very well with better performance for high intensity rainfall events i e events with high runoff to rainfall ratio when compared to low runoff events on the other hand krebs et al 2016 and peng and stovin 2017 discovered the inability of the models to physically represent and predict performance of the plastic board drainage layer to be an important limiting factor furthermore peng and stovin 2017 attribute swmm s limitations in estimating evapotranspiration to its shortcomings in accounting for the influence of the substrate moisture a simplification which krebs et al 2016 found to be of limited effect on initial moisture content in a nordic climate all reported studies of the swmm green roof module are calibrated based on small scale units 2 6 m2 with 2 8 slope substrate depth of 80 120 mm and an egg cup shaped conjugated plastic drainage mat as the bottommost layer calibrated swmm green roof models have shown promising results when simulating green roof runoff from specific small scale test roofs while there is still lack of knowledge to whether the model parameters are true material constants transferable to other roofs with deviating climates geometry and build up making this a generic tool for design and performance evaluation this study investigates the performance of the swmm green roof module in general for several roofs with varying roof build ups sizes slopes and climates calibrated model parameters for identical roof build ups with deviating geometries and climates have been compared assuming that if model parameters were comparable this would be an indication that these were true material constants that could be used for design purposes transferability of parameters has further been investigated by cross validation of parameters among the study sites and by implementing a multi site calibration procedure calibrated model parameters have been compared to other comparable studies and laboratory measurements to see if these could be a source for parameter values when field tests are missing the objectives of the study have been 1 evaluate model performance of the swmm green roof module with respect to long term retention performance and event based reproduction of the runoff hydrograph across geographical different climates 2 evaluate the use of the swmm green roof module as a generic tool by comparing estimated parameters across different sites roof build ups and geometries 2 materials and methods 2 1 site descriptions various field studies containing mainly extensive green roofs but also black bitumen reference roofs and a non vegetated media gray roof with various scale were built to increase knowledge in terms of stormwater retention and runoff detention in cold climate table 1 laboratory tests were conducted to supplement field studies test plots 8 15 m2 as well as full scale 100 m2 field sites were set up in different cities representing the typical coastal climate with various rainfall pattern across norway bergen ber oslo osl sandnes san and trondheim in trondheim data from two different test sites were included risvollan ris and høvringen hov each monitored roof is identified by its location and a number e g ber1 and ber3 bergen experienced most precipitation per month followed by sandnes and oslo while the two sites in trondheim were the driest fig 1 in the figure one can see a comparison between individual sites as well as periods chosen for calibration and validation in two sites osl1 and hov2 a black bitumen roof was used as a reference roof while a gray roof was tested in one site hov1 three groups of extensive green roofs from three different suppliers a b and c which henceforth shall be referred to as type a type b and type c were tested the type a designed for sloped roofs ris1 ber1 and san1 consisted of a vegetation mat 30 mm substrate in a reinforced net of fiber pre cultivated and sedum based over a 10 mm thick textile retention fabric fig 2 b the type b for sloped roofs ber4 san3 have vegetation mat similar to type a but with a 3 mm thick textile retention mat fig 2b the type b for a flat roof hov3 also included a thicker textile retention mat 11 mm over a 25 mm conjugated plastic drainage layer fig 2c this configuration where a thin sedum vegetation mat 30 mm constitute the total substrate depth is typical for the scandinavian market where they are preferred due to fast establishment low weight and low maintenance needs and where the drought risks are lower than in central europe and united states due to the cold and wet climate in general little green roof research is published on these thin configurations and to the knowledge of the authors no applications of the swmm green roof module are published the type c for sloped roofs consisted of a 30 mm vegetation mat over 50 mm of extra substrates a 25 mm conjugated plastic drainage layer ris3 or a 75 mm polystyrene drainage layer ber3 san2 and with a 10 mm textile retention mat in the bottom for all fig 2d the non vegetated gray roof hov1 consisted of a 200 mm layer of lightweight expanded clay aggregates covered by paving stones fig 2a the expanded clay layer served partially as the soil layer as well as the drainage layer for model purposes 10 of the total thickness was assumed to represent the drainage layer for more information about the field experiments see johannessen et al 2018 and hamouz et al 2018 besides field tests laboratory experiments were performed in order to test whether or not laboratory experiments could give material parameters comparable to the one obtained from field experiments this includes vegetated and non vegetated roofs as well as simply individual layers retention mats and a reference roof the laboratory experiments were conducted according to the procedure given in the german green roofing guideline published by the landscape development and landscaping research society fll fll 2008 for more information on the laboratory tests see schärer 2018 2 2 data collection continuous time series from the field rooftops and short term event based data records from the laboratory were used as inputs to the hydrological model table 1 the ris ber san and osl field studies are based on two years of data while the hov field study is based on a total of 6 5 months of data winter data were excluded due to challenges with snow accumulation and melt precipitation was measured on site for all field experiments with a heated tipping bucket rain gauge runoff was measured with a pressure transducer measuring changes in a collection tank for all sites except høvringen where a weight based system was applied precipitation and runoff data were recorded with time intervals of 1 minute bergen sandnes risvollan and høvringen 5 minutes oslo and 3 second laboratory experiments details on instrumentation and data collection can be found in hamouz et al 2018 johannessen et al 2018 and schärer 2018 laboratory measurements of porosity field capacity and wilting point for the green roof type c substrate and the hov1 and lab6 material was performed based on a porous plate apparatus method richards 1948 while the saturated hydraulic conductivity of type c substrate was tested according to the german green roofing guidelines water permeability method fll 2008 2 3 model description the swmm version 5 1 012 including the green roof lid module was applied the rooftop test beds were modeled as subcatchments that were 100 occupied 88 for hov1 and hov3 by the lid the parameters in swmm s green roof module consisting of the individual lid layers soil and drainage mat as well as two parameters from the surface subcatchment surface roughness manning s n and depression storage were used in the calibration process table 2 initial parameter values as well as lower and upper bounds for the calibration were estimated from field observations laboratory experiments adopted from other studies cipolla et al 2016 krebs et al 2016 palla and gnecco 2015 peng and stovin 2017 rosa et al 2015 or from swmm manuals rossman 2015 rossman and huber 2016b however parameters describing physical features such as thicknesses slopes berm heights and elements of the surface lid layer were excluded from the calibration the values of these parameters were obtained directly from the field experiment setups table 1 potential evapotranspiration rates were determined using hargreaves method hargreaves and allen 2003 computing daily evaporation rates from the daily air temperature records provided in an external climate file while soil recovery coefficients were calibrated in order to achieve the best model fit 2 4 model calibration and evaluation a uniform prior distribution was assumed for all calibration parameters given in table 2 the optimal model parameters were identified through model calibration using the shuffled complex evolution sce algorithm duan et al 1992 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse eq 1 nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the relative percentage difference rpd eq 2 were used for model evaluation first as objective functions for the calibration period referred to as model calibration then applied as metrics for measuring model performance when the calibrated parameters were applied in the validation period referred to as model validation in general the closer the nse is to 1 the more accurately the model can predict the observed performance whilst an nse greater than 0 5 indicates acceptable model performance rosa et al 2015 parameter spans giving acceptable model performance were defined as the 5 95 percentile of all parameters fulfilling the requirement of nse 0 5 or rpd 25 nse 1 1 n q obs i q sim i 2 1 n q obs i q obs 2 qobs observed dischargeqsim simulated discharge q obs mean of observed discharge eq 1 rpd v obs v sim v obs 100 vobs observed runoff volumesvsim simulated runoff volumes eq 2 model performance was further evaluated visually using the quantile quantile q q plots a quantile based evaluation provides a more comprehensive analysis approach where whether or not the simulated and observed runoff series exhibit consistent distributions can be assessed directly thyer et al 2009 observed and simulated runoff from the event based calibration was classified in to 100 bins plotted against each other and compared to a 1 1 line to evaluate the model performance at different flow regimes a q q plot along the 1 1 line indicates that the distribution of the simulated runoff series is consistent with that of the observed runoff hence good model performance any deviation of a q q plot from the 1 1 line implies inconsistent uncertainty in the simulated and observed runoff time series with the 1 1 line as a reference sections where the q q data points plot above this line indicate an overestimation while data points that fall under this line indicate an underestimation of the simulated flows a two step calibration procedure separating the volume calibration retention performance from the peak runoff detention performance calibration was carried out retention related parameters soil field capacity soil wilting point and soil recovery constant were calibrated with a continuous time series first and evaluated based on volume errors rpd these parameters were then kept constant while the remaining detention related parameters were calibrated on selected events with high intensity precipitation and evaluated with nse similar calibration approaches calibrating both on retention and detention performance were also carried out by krebs et al 2016 and peng and stovin 2017 for the swmm green roof module for the continuous calibration the observed time series were divided in two equal parts for calibration and validation table 1 for the event based evaluation the four to five largest events were chosen for the calibration and validation period respectively the maximum 5 minute intensities of the chosen events are given in fig 3 together with intensities of the two and five year return period events from local intensity duration frequency idf curves some events exceeded the two and five year return periods while most of the applied events had return periods less than two years for the laboratory experiments based on only one event nse alone was used for model calibration model parameters were first calibrated for each site and configuration individually transferability of model parameters among models of similar roof build ups was further tested with three different approaches the first approach was carried out by manually selecting a common set of parameter values for all type a sloped roofs type b sloped roofs type c sloped roofs and reference roofs and evaluating the performance these parameters were set as close to the optimal values obtained in the individual calibration as possible the second approach was based on a cross validation of parameters among sites for example optimal parameters of the type a sloped roof in trondheim ris1 were applied at sandnes san1 and bergen ber1 sites and evaluated and so on for all comparable roof build ups the third approach was carried out as a multi site calibration by artificially creating a combined time series of all comparable roofs running a calibration and validating the performance based on both the combined series and the individual sites to reduce the influence of variability in runoff flows the runoff was normalized 0 qmin to 1 qmax for each series in the last approach 3 results and discussion 3 1 individual model evaluation the individual model calibration procedure resulted in volume errors ranging from 4 to 28 in the calibration period and from 5 to 17 in the validation period table 3 while some of the models showed acceptable volume errors six models with errors less than 6 others exhibit large volume errors 3 models with errors larger than 20 this is most likely due to the fact that the model does not fully represent the evapotranspiration processes taking place as suggested by earlier studies e g peng and stovin 2017 however it could also be due to measurement inaccuracies and uncertainties the model represents evapotranspiration by the hargreaves method combined with a soil recovery coefficient and does not include the influence of soil moisture which has been shown to have an important impact on evapotranspiration in green roofs berretta et al 2014 stovin et al 2013 the calibration was based on one soil recovery coefficient for the whole model period however it is possible that individual coefficients for each month might improve the performance larger volume errors were found for all tested configurations at høvringen hov one explanation might be uncertainties in the precipitation measurement related to placement of the field station at høvringen located by the coast exposed to an open fjord area and therefore experience higher wind stress this model was also the only where the lid occupied only 88 compared to 100 for the other models which might have influenced the model performance another aspect that could introduce volume errors are possible temporal variations in model parameters not accounted for in the model this aspect will be further discussed in chapter 4 2 the individual model s ability to reproduce the observed runoff hydrograph was evaluated by nse coefficients table 3 all model runs provided nse larger than 0 56 with an average of 0 80 for both the calibration and the validation period which can be considered adequate performance for a rainfall runoff model based on field observations rosa et al 2015 fig 4 shows q q plots of the observed versus simulated runoff at the study sites each data point represent 1 of the data and it can be seen that most of the data fall in the low to medium flow regime under the 75 percentile the individual model calibrations showed good model performance for all data up to the 98 99 percentile while peak flows were overestimated hov3 ber3 or underestimated hov2 ris1 ber1 ris3 for several of the models fig 4 3 2 model parameters optimal model parameters for all calibrated models are given in table 4 a e together with nse values from the calibration 3 2 1 reference roofs three models of reference roofs osl1 hov2 lab1 were calibrated resulting in model parameters that could be useful for design purposes when comparing different roof configurations to conventional roofs table 4a all reference roofs were based on black bitumen roofing but with varying roof size slope and type of experiment optimal model parameters from individual calibration were comparable good model performance was found for both the manually chosen common parameter set and the multi site calibration table 4a fig 4b fig 5 b indicating that the swmm model reproduces the runoff satisfactory and can be used for modeling reference roofs of variable sizes and locations the laboratory experiments were conducted with one high intensity rainfall event which differed significantly from the conditions in the field experiments and gave larger spans of model parameters but still comparable optimal values recommended model parameters for reference roofs based on this study are a manning s roughness coefficient of 0 01 as also found by cipolla et al 2016 in an earlier study and a depression storage of 0 03 3 2 2 model retention performance the available water storage capacity in green roofs in the swmm green roof module is defined by the pore space between the field capacity and the wilting point combined with the soil thickness no storage capacity is included in the drainage layer of the model even if the properties of the drainage layer might allow for water to be stored there i e in cups in the conjugated plastic drainage layers or soaked up in the textile retention drainage mats in some initial tests separate monthly soil recovery patterns were applied while in the individual calibration reported here only one soil recovery coefficient was applied the individual model calibrations showed large variation in optimal parameters for both field capacities 24 44 and wilting points 1 15 for the same material at different sites and the resulting parameters seem to be influenced by local climate conditions table 4b e the highest field capacities were found for the wettest site ber the highest calibrated wilting points were found for the thickest configurations type c possibly due to the fact that the total available storage capacities for the thickest configurations in a norwegian climate are seldom utilized johannessen et al 2017 little or no data when the roof reaches its wilting point is expected to be present in the observed data used to calibrate the model and this might affect the model s ability to predict these parameters properly the span between the field capacity and the wilting point was only 3 for the type b flat roof hov3 this model also has a volume error of 28 for the calibration period indicating that the model is unable to reproduce the retention processes of this roof laboratory experiments of type c substrate gave a field capacity of 21 and a wilting point of 1 5 this is a large deviation from the individual calibrations giving field capacity 24 44 and wilting point 7 15 but corresponds quite well to the field capacity obtained in the multi site calibration 23 tests conducted with monthly soil recovery coefficients resulted in large seasonal variability in the predicted coefficients and a median span of model parameters of 0 19 median model parameter span increased to 0 30 in the calibration including only one soil recovery coefficient for some of the configurations like ris3 the monthly variations could be explained by variations in precipitation pattern with drier conditions in some months giving lower soil moisture content which again reduces the actual evapotranspiration fig 6 a bottom however if this was properly represented in the model the same pattern should be found in all configurations at the same site experiencing the same local climate this was not the case for the modelled sites as shown for ris1 which shows a deviating pattern from ris3 fig 6a top large variation in optimal values at the same site was also found when applying only one soil recovery coefficient while model parameter spans were overlapping for all green roofs at the same site fig 6b both the large volume errors and the large variation in calibrated parameters for soil recovery coefficients field capacities and wilting points confirms earlier findings indicating that the modelling of evapotranspiration in the swmm lid module based on the hargreaves method combined with a soil recovery coefficient is not adequately representing the actual evapotranspiration and thereby also the retention processes taking place feng and burian 2016 peng and stovin 2017 this insufficient representation of the evapotranspiration processes in the model is also expected to affect the detention performance and detention parameters as the observed runoff pattern is a combination of initial retention and detention 3 2 3 green roof drainage layers parameters the drainage layer parameters are expected to play an important role in runoff generation especially for full scale roofs as they will define the detention process associated with the horizontal water movement the only flat green roof included in the study resulted in a drainage layer void fraction of 0 64 and a manning s n of 0 07 model studies with similar conjugated plastic drainage layers resulted in comparable calibrated void fractions of 0 4 0 6 but lower manning s roughness coefficients of 0 01 0 03 krebs et al 2016 palla and gnecco 2015 peng and stovin 2017 these studies were based on table scale green roof units with drainage lengths of 2 3 m which could explain the differences in the findings the swmm manual suggests a void fraction of 0 2 0 4 and manning s n values of 0 01 0 03 but without specifying the drainage layer build up rossman and huber 2016b the sloped green roofs included in the study were all equipped with textile retention mats as the bottommost layer while the total thickness of the drainage layer varied between the different types the drainage layer parameters were the parameters that showed the largest variation both between the individual models of same type between individual models and multi site calibrated models for the same type and between the different types in spite of the similarities of the bottommost layer this indicated that the swmm green roof module have limited ability to represent the water movement through the drainage layer a process considered by the authors to be quite important for modelling detention properly on large scale roofs this limitation of the model was also mentioned by krebs et al 2016 who also applied a textile retention mat as the bottommost layer and by peng and stovin 2017 who applied a slightly different configuration with a plastic drainage layer as the bottommost layer the laboratory experiments of the textile retention mats alone were carried out to test whether these kinds of experiments could give model parameters for different materials the results showed large parameter spans and not comparable optimal parameters to the parameters obtained from field studies and can therefore not be recommended to use for determining model parameters laboratory experiments were calibrated based on only one high intensity event repeated tests with varying intensities might change the results but this was not tested 3 2 4 green roof soil parameters porosities were found to be larger for the reinforced vegetation mats compared to the type c roofs which also had an extra separate substrate layer and with small variations within the same type of green roofs laboratory experiments on the type c extra substrate gave a porosity of 58 which corresponded with one of the model s optimal value of 59 but this was higher than the other models and the multi site calibration value unfortunately it was not possible to measure the porosities of the vegetation mats due to the reinforced structure but based on visual observations it is likely that the porosities are higher in these as also found in the model calibration soil conductivity varied both between and within the different types of green roofs 42 1276 mm hour while there was slightly less variation in the obtained parameters for conductivity slope 14 60 and suction head 6 69 the swmm manual suggests soil conductivity values in the range 1000 2500 mm hr rossman and huber 2016b while the german green roofing guidelines give a requirement for water permeability in the range 36 4200 mm hr fll 2008 laboratory experiments with the type c substrate gave water permeability from 370 to 570 mm hr which is lower than the model parameters found in the individual models but closer to the multi site calibrated value of 596 mm hr krebs et al 2016 applied a pregrown vegetation mat type a over a thicker substrate and found a soil conductivity of 38 mm hr while palla and gnecco 2015 and peng and stovin 2017 found it to be 1000 mm hr 3 2 5 gray roofs two models of gray roofs one from the laboratory lab6 and one field site hov1 were calibrated in the same way as the green roofs both gray roofs were based on a lightweight expanded clay aggregate but with varying particle size roof size and type of experiment continuous versus laboratory the drainage parameters of hov1 showed greater values than all other configuration manning s n 0 48 this corresponds well to the observed runoff with prolonged runoff compared to the green roofs however the calibrated parameters might be too high as high flows had a tendency to be slightly underestimated fig 4a fig 5a since the soil conductivity vertical movement was very high the horizontal movement through the expanded clay layer was expected to provide substantial detention porosity was found to be lower for the gray roof than for the green roofs conductivity higher while conductivity slope and suction heads were found to be comparable laboratory measured porosity was 54 2 for the hov1 material much higher than the calibrated model porosity of 35 field capacity and the wilting point determining the soil retention was found to both be 15 according to the calibrated model parameters for hov1 laboratory measurements of the same material gave a field capacity of 15 6 consistent to the model parameter while the wilting point was measured to be 12 6 indicating that there was a small potential retention capacity in the material that was not found in the model parameters identical values for field capacity and wilting point in the model corresponds to no available storage capacity and explains the large volume error of the model table 3 this is a strong indication that the model does not properly represents the retention processes the lab6 model gave a porosity close to the laboratory measured 54 while field capacity 10 and wilting point 6 5 deviated largely from the model derived parameters of respectively 27 and 10 runoff hydrographs were well reproduced according to nse values table 3 while the model underestimated the runoff for the upper 15 of the data fig 4a 4 practical implications 4 1 laboratory measured material properties laboratory measurements of porosity field capacity and wilting point were carried out for the extra substrates used in the continuous field observations for type c green roofs and the hov1 gray roof laboratory measured porosities were higher than the model calibrated porosities while the wilting points were found to be lower in laboratory measurements than in the model field capacities in the model however were found to be comparable to laboratory measurements of these laboratory measurements of water permeability according to the method described in the german green roofing guidelines were slightly lower than the saturated hydraulic conductivity found in the models based on the same material this method has been questioned for its accuracy and the large deviation from other methods double ring infiltrometer earlier fassman and simcock 2012 calibrated model parameters from the synthetic rain laboratory runoff tests did not show comparable model parameters to the models calibrated with field observations and cannot be used to obtain model parameters this indicates that laboratory measurements should be used with caution in the swmm green roof module alternatively one could argue that physical measurements when available should be used in a physically based model to improve the model s ability to represent unmeasured systems the challenges with such an approach in this study are discussed in section 4 2 however such an approach would simplify the use of the model and should be investigated further with respect to model performance and which parameters could be based on physical measurements and which need to be calibrated 4 2 can the swmm green roof lid module provide generic material parameters the individually calibrated models reproduced the observed green runoff patterns during precipitation events sufficiently as documented by acceptable nse values table 4 and by the quantile plots fig 4 while the long term retention processes were less well reproduced giving variable volume errors the swmm green roof module is a model based on the physical properties and processes in a green roof provided that the model sufficiently reproduces the reality and measurement inaccuracies are limited similar generic model parameters should be obtained when calibrating green roofs with the same roof build up at different sites and with different climate and geometry such transferable model parameters could then further be used for design purposes in sites without experimental data the individually calibrated optimal model parameters were in some cases similar while in other cases quite different for the same type of roofs table 4a d one of the challenges with model calibration is that it provides a set of optimal parameters which together give the best model performance without addressing the possible interdependency of the parameters several different parameter sets can give an adequate model performance which could explain some of the variations in the obtained parameters for the same roof types one could hypothesize that by using fewer model parameters for calibration less variation could be found revealing parameter interdependencies could give information that further could be used to reduce the number of parameters for calibration interdependency of parameters was investigated by visually comparing all sets of acceptable parameter values nse 0 5 by plotting all parameter values against each other e g soil porosity versus soil conductivity soil porosity versus conductivity slope and so on for each individual model no repeated patterns that could have given information about interdependencies of model parameters in the swmm lid module were found in the plots and this approach was therefore abandoned the number of model parameters could also be reduced by fixing some of the substrate properties measured in laboratory e g water storage capacity calculated from field capacity and wilting point in the model which are measurable in laboratory this would have been a feasible approach if all water storage took place in a single layer and was easily measurable this was not the case in our green roof build ups where water storage took place in several layers vegetation mat extra substrate layer drainage layer and in textile retention mats similarly no standardized infiltration test for measuring green roof hydraulic conductivity in multiple layers exist based on this rather than reducing the number of calibrated parameters this study focused further on the transferability of model parameters between comparable roof build ups at different sites as a method to investigate the credibility of the obtained model parameters the first approach by manually selecting a common set of parameter values for similar roofs build ups at different sites showed poor performance with respect to reproducing the green roofs runoff pattern for type a and b roofs nse 0 5 while the reference roof runoff and two of the type c roofs gave acceptable model performance nse 0 5 table 4a d the results indicated that the model parameter spans could not be used individually as a basis for choosing parameter values this was not surprising considering the interdependency of some of the parameters the second approach cross validation of parameters between sites for the type a roof showed that the parameters obtained in ris were not transferable to the other sites while the parameters obtained in ber and san were transferable to the other sites when evaluated based on nse and quantile plots table 5 fig 4c fig 5c the type b roofs showed a good transferability between the two sites ber and san table 5 the type c roof parameters were transferable only from ber to san and from san to ris table 5 fig 4d the third approach the multi site calibration was more successful resulting in common parameter sets for each green roof type as shown in table 5b d fig 4b c and fig 5d model evaluation showed these parameters to sufficiently reproduce green roof runoff patterns nse 0 5 for all tested roof types except for the type a roofs at risvollan but with some challenges associated with overestimation of the highest flows fig 4c d volume errors however were still variable and quite large as also shown and discussed in relation to the individual model calibrations there seems to be a better transferability of model parameters between ber and san than to ris ber and san are comparable in terms of roof size and drainage length while the slope of the roofs are 16 in ris and ber and 27 in san table 1 slope and size were accounted for in the model but due to the experienced differences in obtained parameters this could not be ruled out as a possible cause another more likely explanation to the differences are the differences in precipitation total precipitation amount was lowest in ris almost double in san and around tripled in ber table1 fig 1 the same pattern can be found for the size of the events used for model calibration and validation fig 3 the results indicate that the model parameters are partly influenced by local conditions and not totally generic model parameters representing only the used materials results showed that models calibrated with high precipitation amounts and peak intensities were transferable to drier sites but not the other way around this finding would also limit the use of models for higher intensity events than included in the calibration process de ville et al 2018 investigated temporal variations in hydraulic parameters as retention by studying field capacity and detention by studying the scale parameter in a fitted reservoir routing model the study revealed large sub annual variations in the studied parameters and suggested this to be caused by temporal variation in substrate hydrophobicity water repellency this could also be a possible explanation to why model parameters differ between similar build ups in different climates as some of the sites were considerably wetter than others the findings could also complicate the modelling concept in general and introduce errors as model parameters are expected to be constant and material dependent the multi site calibration approach produced model parameters giving acceptable model performance for several sites resulting in what seemed to be a more robust model applicable for roofs with varying geometry and climate leading us closer to a generic model however there are still questionable whether the models are generic since the model parameters deviate both between individual models with the same roof build up between individual models and multi site calibrated models and from several of the laboratory measurements of material properties 5 conclusions the individual model calibration procedure using two objective functions rpd for volume errors and nse for hydrograph reproduction gave an acceptable model performance runoff hydrographs for each individual model were well reproduced nse 0 56 for all individual models average nse 0 80 while the long term modelling gave relatively high volume errors average absolute volume error of 9 indicating that the water storage and evapotranspiration processes are not well represented in the swmm green roof lid module manually chosen parameter sets for a given green roof build up based on individual model results showed in general poor model performance model parameters obtained at one site was only partly transferable to similar roof build up at other sites transferability was better from models calibrated with wetter climates and higher intensity events to drier climates than the opposite way multi site calibration resulted in model parameters performing well for all sites and roof types except one of the configurations in trondheim giving model parameters that could be used for design of similar roof build ups with varying geometry and climates however the large variability in obtained model parameters the large volume errors and the fact that the calibrated model parameters did not directly correspond to measured material properties places concerns on the

6794,a stochastic hydro geostatistical assessment approach is proposed to evaluate the predictability of streamflow simulation as a function of precipitation observation network density this approach is based on the paradigm of a controlled data assimilation simulation algorithm known as observing system simulation experiment osse the osse based algorithm is designed to simulate a data assimilation technique known as statistical interpolation si in si observations are combined with short term precipitation forecasts through variographic analysis the assessment approach was designed in two stages at the first stage of the assessment si precipitation analysis is stochastically simulated to construct a hypothetical true reference precipitation field while at the second stage the variographic by products of the si gaussian process are used to perturb the reference field in order to produce the pseudo counterparts of the si input components the pseudo terms are then combined in si to compute the pseudo precipitation analysis while various network scenarios are considered distributed hydrologic modeling is then performed to convert reference and pseudo analysis datasets into streamflow the proposed assessment approach can be used to assess observation networks of various densities however it is particularly effective in sparsely gauged basins to demonstrate the application of the approach to a real world case the sparse observation network in the churchill river basin crb which covers an area of roughly 296 000 km2 in the canadian boreal ecoclimatic region was assessed regional deterministic precipitation analysis from 2002 to 2012 was extracted from the canadian precipitation analysis capa data assimilation system and used while generating the reference field gridded precipitation data from both stages of the assessment were used as input to watflood distributed hydrologic model quantitative assessment of streamflow suggested that an observation network with a density in the order of 3 stations 10 000 km2 in the crb can satisfy hydrological criteria while maintaining the network as an integral part of the capa s si data assimilation technique keywords observation network osse data assimilation hydrologic modeling canadian precipitation analysis statistical interpolation 1 introduction operational and experimental numerical weather prediction nwp models are developed to predict precipitation and other meteorological variables e g temperature wind relative humidity radiation etc over regional or global domains and various spatial and temporal scales one such effort is the regional deterministic precipitation system rdps vaillancourt et al 2012 which relies on the global environmental multiscale gem model côté et al 1998a côté et al 1998b gem has been developed by the canadian meteorological centre cmc to capture the distribution of precipitation along with other meteorological variables in both time and space over canada precipitation estimates derived from gem have temporal and spatial uncertainties which is the case with every nwp model the amount of uncertainty in precipitation estimates can be reduced by assimilating observed precipitation into the model forecast jacobson 1999 kalnay 2003 stull 1999 assimilation systems reduce uncertainty by considering the nwp model forecast only as a necessary source of information to fill in the holes in the precipitation observation network while the emphasis is given to fit the observations as closely as possible rutherford 1972 the cmc canadian precipitation analysis capa mahfouf et al 2007 is a data assimilation system and its product is known as the regional deterministic precipitation analysis rdpa capa rdpa has been used in a number of hydro meteorological and hydrological modeling studies as a source of precipitation information see e g deacu et al 2012 eum et al 2014 fry 2014 gaborit et al 2017 haghnegahdar et al 2014 mekonnen et al 2014 mengistu and spence 2016 milrad et al 2017 yassin et al 2017 and it is expected that the number of studies that incorporates capa data will continue to rise in the future the accuracy of results produced by such modeling efforts would be highly sensitive to the random error associated with the capa precipitation input which in turn is influenced by the spatial sampling of precipitation observations essou et al 2017 oudin et al 2006 xu et al 2006 xu and vandewiele 1994 the core of the capa system is the application of a geostatistical data assimilation scheme known as statistical interpolation si a k a optimum interpolation technique rutherford 1972 si is a minimum variance scheme which resembles the kriging technique alsamamra et al 2009 daley 1991 in capa si is used to combine surface and remotely sensed radar and satellite observations with background information derived from short term gem forecasts to improve the accuracy of precipitation estimates mahfouf et al 2007 in order for si to yield precipitation data that outperform the background forecast field data coverage in both time and space over the region of interest should be consistent mahfouf et al 2007 showed that the accuracy of capa precipitation fields depends on observed data availability to satisfy the interpolation the analysis is more accurate in regions where the observation network density is higher and the accuracy diminishes rapidly in regions with limited precipitation information lespinas et al 2015 assessed the performance of capa against gem and observations across canada using categorical frequency bias index and equitable threat score and continuous root mean square error correlation coefficient and mean error scores and concluded that although capa rdpa consistently performs better than gem both have similar levels of reduced accuracy in areas with few precipitation gauges these findings show that before setting up hydrologic models using capa rdpa as input it is important to assess the sufficiency of the ground observation network density in the general framework of the si technique therefore our point of departure in this study is the problem of the required station density to provide valid regional observations of precipitation for hydrologic modeling geostatistical approaches have been widely explored in precipitation network assessment studies they apply kriging in order to minimize the variance of the areal precipitation estimation and thus are generally referred to as variance based approaches bastin et al 1984 bras and rodriguez iturbe 1976 and hughes and lettenmaier 1981 were among those who first adopted ordinary kriging in the framework of precipitation network assessment geostatistical approaches can be combined with supplementary statistical procedures e g multivariate analysis see e g burn and goulter 1991 shaghaghian and abedini 2013 or entropy based analysis see e g barca et al

results from geostatistical network assessment schemes e g variance based entropy based and multi objective to account for hydrologic modeling operations see e g essou et al 2017 bardossy and das 2008 bras et al 1988 st hilaire et al 2003 tarboton et al 1987 xu et al 2013 xu et al 2015 and wilson et al 1979 were among those who have followed this so called hydro geostatistical paradigm and have investigated the extent to which the modeled streamflow simulated by different lumped or distributed models can be influenced by the density of observation network that controls the estimation of precipitation input the main goal of a hydro geostatistical network assessment is to quantify the impact of observation network density on precipitation estimations and the corresponding hydrological outcomes this objective can be achieved through deterministic i e application of actual precipitation observations or stochastic i e simulation of precipitation data approaches dong et al 2005 a deterministic approach is applicable when high quality precipitation information can be collected by means of ground or radar observations from a densely gauged basin whereas a stochastic scheme is effective when observations have limited long term availability and are scattered in both time and space impending effective hydrologic modeling in a river basin one such stochastic scheme is based on the paradigm of observing system simulation experiment osse arnold and dey 1986 typically an osse is undertaken in order to investigate the impact of an extension to an already operational observation network on the performance of a system e g weather forecasting daley 1991 the main purpose of an osse is therefore to simulate a data assimilation system arnold and dey 1986 while in a data assimilation system real observations which are not perfect are incorporated in the estimation of actual atmospheric conditions in an osse simulated observations with simulated errors are derived from a simulated atmosphere errico et al 2013 the basic components of an osse include a sophisticated nwp model i e one that contains all the required atmospheric information to simulate the true state of the atmosphere a mechanism for generating realistic errors to synthesize observations a data assimilation system to continuously integrate synthetic observations into the model forecast and a yard stick to evaluate the performance of the assimilated synthetic observations the osse procedure is commonly used to design new space borne observation systems but it has found applications for investigating surface based observation networks too for example vecchi and harrison 2007 designed an osse to assess an integrated in situ observation system monitoring interannual and subseasonal variability of subsurface indian ocean temperature in this paper a synthetic approach to precipitation observation network assessment is outlined which resembles the paradigm of an osse this approach is designed to evaluate the impact of increasing the meteorological network density within the framework of the si data assimilation scheme on the accuracy of streamflow simulations to the best of the authors knowledge it is the first time that a procedure is developed to explore the impact of network density of observations used in the assimilation of daily precipitation accumulations on hydrologic modeling outcomes results of this assessment can aid in optimizing observation network density from both statistical accounting for the theoretical formulation of an assimilation system merging observations with short term background forecast and physical accounting for the hydrological response of the basin to assimilation system s precipitation analysis standpoints since similar to an osse the assessment is carried out entirely with synthetic observations the proposed scheme can be applied regardless of existing observation network s configuration and density or basin topographic and climatic characteristics the proposed scheme can be extended to assess precipitation observation networks in any given basin provided that gridded precipitation information from a numerical prediction model are readily available in the remainder of the paper statistical interpolation is described together with the methodology developed for observation network assessment a case study is then presented to illustrate application of the assessment approach to a real world network in a sparely gauged basin in canada thereafter results are presented and discussed including validation of different assumptions and rationales made throughout the assessment finally a summary and the study conclusions follow 2 methodology the most significant advantage of the statistical interpolation si technique is that different sources of information e g precipitation observations and short term precipitation forecasts can be combined in a way that the accuracy of each source would be quantified bratseth 1985 these assimilation by products can be integrated into an osse based observation network assessment approach therefore in this section before elaborating the assessment methodology details regarding the mathematical formulation of the si technique are provided 2 1 statistical interpolation the si technique is performed via the variographic analysis of innovations i e difference between observations and corresponding values from the background forecast at the observation locations daley 1991 if x i b denotes the background forecast at grid point i 1 2 n x k o denotes the observation at location k 1 2 n and x k b denotes the value obtained by interpolating the background forecast available at nearby grid points bilinearly to observation location k the updated grid point value called the analysis x i a is obtained as follows 1 x i a x i b k 1 n w ik x k o x k b where weights w ik are derived by minimizing the variance of the analysis error defined as deviation of analysis value from true value of precipitation depth assuming that observation and background errors defined as the deviation of observation and background forecast from the true value of precipitation depth respectively are not correlated in space the minimization formula can be written in matrix format as σ o σ b w i σ i b the terms inside the brackets on the left hand side express the covariance of innovations where σ o is the n n covariance matrix of observation errors and σ b is the n n covariance matrix of background errors σ i b is the n 1 vector of covariance of errors between the analysis grid point i and n stations two more assumptions are taken into consideration when deriving the weights station errors are uncorrelated in space and background errors and observation errors are normally distributed daley 1991 given these assumptions σ o can be expressed as σ o σ ε o 2 i where σ ε o 2 is variance of observation error and i is the vector of unity in addition the covariance of innovations can be written as 2 σ o σ b σ ε o 2 σ ε b 2 at station locations σ b between station locations where σ ε b 2 indicates variance of background error one can find σ ε o 2 and σ ε b 2 by first transforming background and observations into normal space lespinas et al 2015 using the box and cox 1964 transform function given as 3 y y λ 1 λ where y and y are the transformed and non transformed precipitations respectively and λ is the transformation parameter care should be taken when selecting the λ parameter value while a value close to 1 2 could result in a square root transformation lower values in the order of 1 10 would approximate a log transformation which would lead to a positive bias in estimated precipitation amounts erdin et al 2012 evans 2013 once background and observations are transformed innovations are computed at the station locations the covariance cloud between innovations can then be sketched and fitted with a theoretical semivariogram model with nugget effect daley 1991 such as the exponential model as follows 4 b l k exp d l k l ε b where b l k is the spatial correlation of innovations at grid points l and k d l k is the distance in km between the two grid points and l ε b is the correlation length at which the semivariogram model reaches a plateau i e maximum distance where innovations are correlated in space the semivariogram value associated with the correlation length is referred to as sill and is attributed to the variance of background error σ ε b 2 also the variance of observation error σ ε o 2 is associated with the y intercept a k a the nugget effect of the theoretical semivariogram 2 2 assessment approach fig 1 a shows the basic components of a real world data assimilation system set up based on the configuration of the si technique this flowchart describes an assimilation system in which background forecast and observations represent real data in order to evaluate how a change in an observation network s density throughout a region would impact the analysis a benchmark dataset consisting of real precipitation depths over the basin is required for comparison purposes under real world settings such a benchmark dataset could only be produced in full by an infinitely dense network of observations in such a case representativeness error could be ignored if instrumentation error is ignored as well then the network can be assumed to provide the closest representation of reality such a densely gridded network is created during the first stage of an osse known as the nature run nr in order to provide a true or reference precipitation p r field over the basin details concerning the generation of the reference field are provided in section 2 2 1 this nr p r field is assumed to be perfect and provides actual conditions over the basin in other words the nr p r field is considered to be the real precipitation depth over the basin and not a best approximation of reality this can be proven in theory through the formulation of the si technique see appendix a the nr p r field not only is required for conducting a controlled simulation experiment but also liberates the entire experiment from the constraints of real world observations including limited access to quality controlled data and the uncertainties involved with actual observations fig 1b shows the basic components of a simulated data assimilation system where background forecast and observations represent synthetic rather than real data the chart illustrates a synthetic run sr in which the real input components real observations and a first guess background field of the si data assimilation technique are replaced with artificial ones the key idea here is that the assimilation is carried out in a simulated world where everything is pseudo in a real world data assimilation system the analysis generally resembles the observations as well as the background field gao and stensrud 2012 rutherford 1972 this analogy can be leveraged to derive pseudo observations and pseudo background fields by modifying the nr p r field in a way that accurately captures the nature of the errors associated with the observations and background field this can be done by perturbing the reference field nr p r to approximate the characteristics of the real world input data of the assimilation system while the nature of the errors associated with real station observations and the background forecast is captured 2 2 1 nature run conventionally in an osse the production of the nr p r is carried out by running a nwp model that includes all required atmospheric information to simulate the true state of the atmosphere masutani et al 2013 this makes the generation of the nr p r field expensive from a computational standpoint however here a method is proposed that deviates from the conventional procedure in that the nr p r field is created through stochastic modeling replacing the nwp model with a stochastic precipitation generator is an appropriate substitution for the purpose of the current study since the pertinent statistical properties and distribution moments of the gridded data can be preserved moreover running a sophisticated nwp model would need a considerable amount of data and computational power whereas application of a stochastic precipitation model is deemed a proper way to make efficient use of available resources this study employs the gridded precipitation generator designed by abbasnezhadi et al in review the generator generalizes the occurrence amount precipitation model originally developed by wilks 2009 for the simulation of high resolution gridded daily precipitation fields wilks applied a multivariate nonparametric regression procedure to interpolate the generator parameters this scheme for constructing a gridded model works well for meteorological networks of a decent density if the network density is low the quality of the interpolation suffers no matter what technique is used therefore rather than interpolating the generator parameters onto a grid abbasnezhadi et al in review designed a gridded model where precipitation time series are generated at the location of the grid points of the si precipitation analysis 2 2 2 synthetic run the pseudo observation ψ o component in the simulated data assimilation system can be created by accounting for the observation uncertainty which is expressed in terms of representativeness and mechanical errors both sources of error can be combined into the observation error ε o term which can then be added to the nr p r field to generate the pseudo observation component while the nr p r field includes every grid point throughout the basin of interest ψ o data can be created at a subset of grid points sampled from the full nr p r grid corresponding to observation locations in a hypothetical network of a given resolution density each ψ o sampling grid can be represented by a pseudo network pn denoted by θ ν where ν is the sampling grid resolution in decimal degrees the k th pseudo station from any pn is the location at which an array of ψ o data is created by perturbing nr p r such that 5 ψ k o p r k e k o where ψ k o is the vector of ψ o accumulations at pseudo station k p r k is the vector of reference precipitation nr p r at the same grid point and e k o ε k o 1 ε k o 2 ε k o t is the vector of observation errors generated at the same pseudo station in which t is the recording time interval in days the k index is placed inside a pair of round brackets to indicate that the observation location k is a selected grid point in the corresponding pn realization as per si assumptions observation errors are normally distributed and spatially uncorrelated therefore ε k o t can be generated by independently sampling at each grid point from a gaussian distribution such that ε k o t n 0 σ ε o t where σ ε o t is the mean daily standard deviation of the observation error on julian day t similar to how the pseudo observation ψ o is created a pseudo background ψ b field can be constructed by accounting for the uncertainty associated with the background forecast or the background error ε b kalnay 2003 based on the si technique it is assumed that on each day t background errors are normally distributed and spatially correlated the former assumption implies that ε b t n 0 σ ε b t where σ ε b t is the mean standard deviation of the background error on julian day t associated with the semivariogram sill value given this assumption a ψ b field can be produced by perturbing nr p r as follows 6 ψ b t p r t e b t where ψ b t is the matrix of the pseudo background precipitation on day t and p r t and e b t are the matrices of nr p r and the background errors respectively on the same day by disregarding temporal correlations e b t can be generated by random sampling from the gaussian distribution however since background errors are correlated in space normal variates representing the background error must be generated in a way that achieves a spatial structure consistent with the covariance function of the experimental semivariogram of the si analysis knowing that the covariance matrix of background errors σ b is a symmetric bccb block circulant with circulant blocks the generation of gaussian background error fields can be accomplished by random sampling from the real and imaginary parts of b n o 2 σ b where o is the matrix of zeroes and b is the exponential model given by eq 4 this procedure can be facilitated by the circular embedding spatial process dietrich and newsam 1997 kroese and botev 2015 powell 2014 see abbasnezhadi 2017 for more details fig 2 shows the two stages of the osse based assessment algorithm nature run is shown by the double weighted line while the synthetic run goes through the single weighted process as shown in this flowchart in the last step of the sr stage the pseudo components ψ o and ψ b are combined to produce the synthetic run s pseudo analysis sr ψ a for a given pseudo network realization it should be noted that since in si the analysis is performed using innovations in transformed space the parameters of the theoretical semivariogram σ ε o σ ε b and l ε b represent the transformed data too consequently employing such variographic information during the generation of observation and background errors ε o and ε b results in errors valid only in transformed space therefore it is necessary to transform nr p r field into normal space before ε o or ε b are added to the field to create ψ o and ψ b respectively the transformations can be carried out using the box cox function given by eq 3 once pseudo data are created they should be inverse transformed back to the original space before being assimilated using the si technique the box cox inverse transformation function is written as 7 y y λ 1 1 λ where y and y are either ψ o or ψ b in the original and transformed spaces respectively 2 2 3 network assessment criteria the performance of each pseudo network scenario is manifested through its corresponding pseudo analysis which can be compared against the reference nr p r a sr ψ a that is closely matched with the nr p r field would then represent the best scenario the means by which such a proximity is to be measured depends on the final application e g hydrological versus atmospheric for which the observation network is considered in a hydrological context comparing sr ψ a against nr p r should be carried out by quantitatively measuring the simulated pseudo streamflow response to sr ψ a defined as sr q p against the response to nr p r defined as nr q r given the gridded nature of nr p r and sr ψ a fields a distributed or semi distributed hydrologic model is required to simulate the influence of spatial variability of both fields besides basin characteristics on streamflow estimations khakbaz et al 2012 as per the assumption of the nature run nr p r is assumed to constitute the true state of precipitation if the hydrologic model is assumed to be perfect too with the perfect meteorological input the resulting nr q r constitutes the hypothetically true hydrological response of the basin it can however be argued that the assumption of a perfect hydrologic model is unrealistic but it should be emphasized that the proposed osse based procedure is designed to assess the relative performance of different network densities and not their absolute performance this approach ensures that even with a less than perfectly calibrated hydrologic model the applicability of the proposed osse based algorithm is not undermined the quantitative assessment can be carried out using the efficiency metric described by nash and sutcliffe 1970 nse given as follows 8 nse 1 i 1 m q r i q p i 2 i 1 m q r i q r 2 where q r is the mean value of nr q r and m is the number of time steps nse can be decomposed into three components relative variability a bias b and linear correlation r these constituents can be used to formulate an alternative performance criterion known as the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 given as 9 kge 1 ed where ed is the euclidean distance of a b and r from the optimal point of unity in a three dimensional space as follows 10 ed a 1 2 b 1 2 r 1 2 1 2 3 case study to illustrate the application of the proposed osse based assessment approach for evaluating the observation network in sparsely gauged basins the churchill river basin crb was selected as a case study the crb covers an area of roughly 296 000 km2 and is a sub watershed of the larger nelson churchill river basin fig 3 shows the location of the crb in the canadian boreal ecoregion the distribution of meteorological stations within and near the basin is illustrated in this map as shown the meteorological stations are not uniformly distributed throughout the basin and many weather stations in the basin do not have long and continuous records moreover only a few gauges throughout the basin can pass the strict quality control qc measures enjoyed by capa to safeguard the final analysis against erroneous or biased readings fig 3 displays the synoptic gauges that are currently assimilated in capa the ability of precipitation gauges to pass snow qc standards is of particular concern during winter when aerodynamic effects associated with gauge shape result in the majority of solid precipitation observations being negatively biased and thus rejected lespinas et al 2015 these constraints have adversely affected the capa s skill in the crb while the cmc s meteorological research division is actively studying how to correct snow undercatch bias using existing relationships between solid precipitation measurements and wind speed such as those given by goodison et al 1998 and kochendorfer 2017 among others the first two points of concern namely the non uniform distribution of weather stations and the short discontinuous nature of precipitation records were addressed in this study 3 1 nature run the gridded rdpa regional deterministic precipitation analysis daily precipitation accumulations produced by the capa system version 2 4 β 8 from 2002 to 2012 were acquired from the environment and climate change canada repositories capa rdpa data were then converted to a two dimensional rectangular grid with a spatial resolution of 0 10 in latitude and 0 15 in longitude roughly 10 km in both directions at 60 n fig 3 shows the location of 8772 grid points in the rectangular grid over the crb the gridded precipitation generator developed by abbasnezhadi et al in review was used to generate 100 years worth of gridded daily precipitation fields to construct the nr p r field while maintaining seasonal variability in the mean variance and spatial correlations of the capa rdpa data 3 2 synthetic run the by products of the si procedure σ ε o t σ ε b t and l ε b t from the capa system version 2 4 β 8 from 2002 to 2012 were acquired the mean values of error statistics σ ε o t σ ε b t and l ε b t averaged over all available years on julian day t were then computed as follows 11 s t 1 y y s t y t 1 2 365 y 2002 2012 where s t is any of the three mean error statistics on day t s t y denotes any of the three error statistics on day t in year y and y is the number of years here 10 years considered to compute the mean the key assumptions of the si algorithm were taken into consideration when constructing the ε o and ε b error fields observation errors are not required to account for any dependency in space between the observation locations whereas the background error should account for the spatial structure explained by the variographic analysis of the innovations pns pseudo networks of various densities ranging from capa s average resolution 0 1 to successively coarser resolutions lower density networks were configured using a fixed origin at 59 6900 n 112 9150 e located at the north western corner of the domain for each individual pn scenario θ ν where ν 0 1 0 2 0 8 1 2 1 8 3 6 a subset of grid points representing the pseudo stations of the respective pn was extracted from the original nr p r domain these pn scenarios were used to generate pseudo observations by adding random error to the daily nr p r field the pseudo background ψ b fields were also constructed by perturbing the nr p r field the circular embedding model was used to generate spatial gaussian random fields of background error since observation and background errors are valid only in transformed space the nr p r field was transformed into normal space before adding in ε o or ε b to create ψ o or ψ b respectively the transformations were carried out using the box cox function given by eq 3 a λ parameter of 1 3 was used which is consistent with the optimal value being used in the operational version of capa when transforming innovations in capa this choice of box cox which resembles a cubic root transformation is drawn by a visual inspection of the empirical distribution of transformed innovations fortin et al 2015 once ψ o and ψ b data were created they were inverse transformed back to the original space and used as input data in capa to produce the precipitation pseudo analysis ψ a corresponding to each pseudo network realization with the version of capa used in this study three inputs were required to produce an analysis gridded background data station observations and gridded temperature data while the first two datasets were fundamentally required in si the temperature data were used to quality control the precipitation observations in order to safeguard the final analysis against biased readings however for the purpose of this study ψ o data were assumed to be unbiased as they were created by adding random error to the truth while eliminating all systematic errors a k a bias from entering the assimilation cycle 3 3 hydrologic modeling hydrologic modeling constituted the main framework for evaluating the performance of different pn realizations throughout the crb in this study the watflood distributed hydrologic model kouwen 2010 was used for streamflow analysis the model uses physically based routing and conceptual hydrological simulation modules runoff simulations are performed using grouped response units which collectively reflect a combination of land cover types and elevation data in gridded format in order to avoid conflicts between the spatial resolution of the input data and that of watflood the model s spatial resolution was set to be the same as the resolution of the rectangular grid at which capa rdpa data were extracted the watflood model was pre calibrated against a 1985 1995 training period by manitoba hydro using the canadian daily climate data cdcd bohrn 2012 fig 3 shows the location of the hydrometric gauges where flow simulations in response to nr p r and sr ψ a fields are compared table 1 provides more details regarding the hydrometric gauges considered including water survey of canada wsc gauge number station coordinates drainage subbasin and drainage area for each gauge although these gauges provide an opportunity to use actual flow observations only artificially produced data were used for the network assessment it would therefore also be possible to use other hypothetical hydrometric gauge locations for the evaluation of watflood results if desired regardless of whether or not they represented real world hydrometric observation sites for the watflood model to run the minimum data requirements are precipitation and temperature it was particularly important that diurnal temperature variations were captured which necessitates the use of sub daily inputs this forced us to develop a gridded temperature model in addition to the model already developed for nr p r see abbasnezhadi et al in review for more details the temperature model was used to generate gridded hourly temperature time series over the basin that were spatio temporally coherent with the generated gridded precipitation fields and was developed based on a generalization of the single site hourly temperature model introduced by hansen and driscoll 1977 in order to achieve coherency between the temperature and the precipitation models the cyclic components of the temperature data were conditioned on nr p r precipitation occurrence for each grid point the efficiency of this approach was demonstrated by wilks 2008 who combined the first two moments of daily maximum and minimum temperature using different moments based on precipitation occurrence at multiple sites the watflood model was used to simulate the hypothetical true hydrological response of the basin nr q r in response to nr p r and concurrent temperature fields also for each pn scenario the resulting sr ψ a was used as input in watflood to simulate the synthetic run s pseudo streamflow sr q p fig 4 shows the simulated hydrographs for upper churchill uc and lower churchill lc subbasins hydrometric gauges during the 2000 to 2012 hypothetical period the plots display the nr q r hydrograph as well as the sr q p hydrographs for two extreme scenarios q p θ 3 6 representing the pseudo streamflow derived from the ψ a analyzed from the pn with the lowest resolution and q p θ 0 2 where the pseudo streamflow is based on the ψ a assimilated based on the second highest pn resolution the q p θ 0 1 hydrograph matches perfectly with the nr q r hydrograph and thus is not shown here hydrographs derived from other pn scenarios fall between these two extremes 4 results and discussion before the hydrologic response of sr ψ a fields are compared against that of nr p r it is necessary to validate several important assumptions taken at both stages nature run and synthetic run of the assessment approach 4 1 validation of nature run the nature run should be validated in terms of the validity of the assimilation system representing the hydro meteorological system being investigated as well as the validity of the generated stochastic precipitation fields representing the assimilated products 4 1 1 hydro meteorological system the application of synthetic data in the framework of the proposed algorithm is necessary in order to assess the sensitivity of hydrologic simulations to density of the observation network used in the assimilation cycle however before such an assessment can be undertaken it is necessary to verify beforehand if the assimilation system hydrologic model processing chain can perform adequately to forecast observed streamflow based on actual precipitation observations this is a necessary step to verify that the simulated data assimilation system can properly mimic the hydro meteorological system being investigated in this section the validity of such a system defined by the capa watflood processing chain is investigated lespinas et al 2015 has indicated that capa rdpa data are typically negatively biased and have a larger bias than gem during summer mainly due to the larger number of convective rainfall occurrences during this season this shortcoming means that the generated nr p r field which resembles capa rdpa statistically is similarly biased however the prerequisite assumption used in the assessment that nr p r represents the truth is maintained this assumption was made on the grounds that a hypothetically assumed true field would provide a reliable benchmark for the assessment in the context of a controlled simulation experiment moreover capa rdpa data were used as the developmental sample with the implicit assumption that the capa system currently provides the best knowledge of the precipitation distribution in time and space over the sparsely gauged crb this assumption was made based on the results of an assessment performed by boluwade et al 2018 who compared the performance of capa rdpa data relative to actual precipitation observations for regional flow simulation the validation was performed using an operational version of watflood in the lake winnipeg basin lwb which is a sub watershed of the larger nelson churchill river basin the authors concluded that capa rdpa is a reliable product in regions of the lwb with sparse observation networks when used to force the watflood hydrologic model this is a promising result for other boreal ecoregions in canada with sparse networks such as the crb boluwade et al 2018 therefore it can be argued here that the assumption that capa rpda data can be adequately used in the hydro meteorological system under investigation in the crb is valid 4 1 2 synthetic nr p r field it is vital to validate the stochastic precipitation fields generated during the nature run against the historical capa rdpa data to ensure that the latter has been replaced by realistic stochastic data this validation is also necessary to ensure that nr q r represents the true state of streamflow in the basin the stochastic precipitation model used to generate the nr p r field is known to be a robust generator that can sufficiently retain a number of key statistical elements of historical data table 2 provides a summary of the key statistical properties used for the validation of the generated nr p r fields abbasnezhadi et al in review as the table shows the precipitation model has maintained correlation pattern occurrence probability moments of the precipitation distribution and extreme value characteristics of historical capa rdpa data however the model struggles to preserve long dry spells and the interannual variability of monthly total precipitation it is important to investigate if incorporating the generated nr p r data bearing the aforementioned shortfalls as input into the hydrologic modeling procedure will have any detrimental impact on the assessment the randomness of the generated nr p r results in the modeled hydrological flow response nr q r being random too therefore it is impossible to compare nr q r against real world flow observations in addition it is not appropriate to evaluate nr q r against the flow rates derived from capa rdpa through common quantitative criteria that estimate the goodness of fit between the two time series e g nse instead statistics that measure long term trends e g mean daily flow should be used to evaluate nr q r against the flow response derived from capa rdpa monthly and annual mean precipitation totals are the key statistical indicators of the generated nr p r field that should have been preserved to ensure long term trends of nr q r resemble those of capa rdpa flow response since the precipitation generator can preserve monthly and annual precipitation totals adequately the key components of the overall water balance can be maintained therefore neither of the noted shortfalls of the precipitation generator are found to have a detrimental impact on the statistical characteristics of the nr q r fig 5 compares mean daily nr q r and mean daily capa rdpa flow response at the upper churchill and lower churchill subbasins outlet gauges the inter quantile range and one standard deviation around the mean correspond to capa rdpa flow response are also displayed as shown flows are in relative agreement and therefore it can be concluded that nr q r represents the true state of streamflow in the basin 4 2 validation of synthetic run the synthetic run should be validated in terms of the capacity of the error statistics to represent true observation and background errors in addition the capacity of circular embedding model to preserve the spatial structure of the si semivariogram model should be investigated also it was expected that adding ε o and ε b to nr p r should result in ψ o and ψ b fields that exhibit by a good approximation the statistical characteristics of the real world background field gem and observations respectively therefore the pseudo precipitation data need to be verified against their real world counterparts 4 2 1 error statistics statistics on the errors of observation and background forecast are extracted from the si variographic analysis of innovations however care should be taken when handling these statistics the si technique like kriging provides the best but not necessarily the most accurate estimation of precipitation in addition si is an isotropic and space stationary approach and therefore similar to other non variational data assimilation techniques it does not reproduce the spatial structure of the data in this case precipitation perfectly moreover at each time step only one semivariogram is produced for the entire regional analysis resulting in one unique value for each of the semivariogram parameters the only exception is for cases where there is more than one station within a single analysis grid cell this issue can negatively impact the assessment in sparsely gauged basins and improve the assessment in dense networks the error statistics of the si variographic analysis of innovations ε o ε b were handled with the assumption that these by products are normally distributed ideally one would need to validate this assumption however in the absence of a dense observation network in the crb with a consistent record in both time and space it would be very difficult to infer the probability distribution of ε o and ε b this setback suggests that implementing the developed methodology in another basin with an observation network of a decent density could have been a better choice for a case study however it should be reminded that the selection of the crb was an intentional decision to demonstrate the capacity of the proposed approach for expanding sparse observation networks 4 2 2 background error spatial structure the application of the correlation length in the circular embedding model should force the random gaussian error fields to approximate the correlation function of the si model fig 6 compares the semivariogram model given by eq 4 to the experimental correlation function derived by running the circular embedding model 10 000 times with l ε b 60 93 53 km mean correlation length computed by eq 11 on the first day of march for a sample grid point the plot clearly indicates that the circular embedding model has successfully recreated the spatial dependencies similar to those of the si semivariogram function derived from capa 4 2 3 pseudo precipitation fields given the sparse nature of the current observation network it would be impossible to establish a benchmark to verify ψ o data moreover the sparse network in the crb prevents the background gem forecast from being corrected which in turn prevents the relative performance of capa rdpa and its stochastically generated counterpart nr p r from being improved in this study the verification of pseudo precipitation data was performed with respect to nr p r it can be argued that this was a rational decision since with the sparse network all three datasets capa rdpa nr p r and gem demonstrate rather identical distributions for the majority of grid points in the basin assuming that gem has the same distribution as nr p r also justifies that ψ b should have the same distribution as nr p r this assumption clearly does not imply that gem is the true field the verification of the ψ o and ψ b against nr p r was performed with respect to precipitation occurrence and precipitation amount and revealed two sources of bias 1 a wet day frequency bias and 2 a mean daily precipitation bias the former bias is associated with an increased frequency in light precipitation events while the latter bias is a direct consequence of the fact that for λ 1 3 the box cox inverse transformation function eq 7 is true for y 3 only which results in many low precipitation amounts being removed the wet day frequency bias was corrected by adjusting the frequency of the dry days in the pseudo precipitation fields to match the nr p r field also to remove mean daily precipitation bias in the inverse transformed pseudo precipitation fields parametric and empirical bias correction schemes were tested as one would expect from theory the empirical bias correction technique completely removed the bias from the distribution of the inverse transformed pseudo precipitation amounts see abbasnezhadi 2017 for more details 4 3 quantitative assessment of streamflow simulations the quantitative assessment of the synthetic run s pseudo streamflow sr q p with respect to nature run s reference streamflow nr q r can provide us with an understanding of the extent by which pn scenarios can improve streamflow simulations fig 7 shows the variation of the nse scores given by eq 8 with changing pn resolution for different subbasins in the crb as the resolution increases i e ν goes from 3 6 to 0 2 the performance scores go through an increasing trend which resembles a hyperbolic tangent function with three main regions of variation identified in all subbasins increasing ν from 3 6 up to 0 7 results in only marginal nse improvement the value of 0 7 can be interpreted as the critical network resolution ν c below which only minor improvements are expected increasing the pn resolution to 0 6 boosts the nse scores substantially and at higher resolutions ν 0 6 the variation of the nse scores shows no significant improvement although one could also argue that the predictability of streamflow simulations increases beyond the network resolution of 0 6 and up to ν 0 3 or even ν 0 2 the improvements are not appreciable enough to justify the optimality of adding more stations into the observation network this point will be elaborated later on through the quantification of fig 7 therefore the network resolution of 0 6 which corresponds to roughly 3 stations 10 000 km2 can be regarded as the network resolution threshold ν t below which the accuracy of the flow simulations degrades significantly and above which the nse scores begin to level off and little is gained by further increasing the network density fig 7 shows a few unexpected drops in the efficiencies at ν 0 8 and ν 0 5 mainly for central churchill cc lower central churchill lcc and lower churchill lc and to a lesser extent for upper central churchill ucc although the reduction in nse scores is not significant and the general trend of improvements is still hyperbolic there are several possibilities that can explain the fluctuating i e deviation from the trend behaviour the fluctuations are more pronounced for the larger central and eastern subbasins cc lcc and lc this could be attributed to the spatial heterogeneity of small scale and localized precipitation events e g mesoscale convective systems which might have not been captured by certain pseudo stations of specific pn scenarios in larger subbasins the aggregate of a higher number of pseudo stations missing localized events can ultimately affect nse score more intensely this phenomenon to which we are going to refer as singularity has also been reported by dong et al 2005 it is worth mentioning that the fluctuation in nse scores is not seen in upper churchill uc which is the smallest headwater subbasin while in ucc the fluctuation is observed to a lesser extent and is seen more intensely at larger downstream subbasins the extent to which singularity is responsible for the fluctuations seen in fig 7 is also the likely consequence of using the nse metric to measure the goodness of fit between the reference and synthetic hydrographs the effect of singularity and scale issues on the nse metric can be evaluated by constructing the variation curves using the alternative kge metric given by eq 9 fig 8 shows the variation of the kge scores with changing pn resolution for different hydrometric gauges in the crb many features in the plot including the trend patterns and other diagram specifications such as ν c and ν t are in line with those seen in fig 7 however unlike nse which is relatively sensitive to peak values the kge scores are less sensitive to peak values and therefore the variation curves are less affected by singularity this indicates the importance of the metric used to carry out the assessment the unexpected pulsing of the nse scores could also be the consequence of the bias introduced into ψ o and ψ b through data transformations to and from the normal space while bias ensuing from transformations was removed it bears repeating that the si analysis is itself done in a transformed space which eventually results in another set of biased outcomes although a correction scheme is performed in capa to remove the analysis bias fortin et al 2015 precipitation outputs typically remain negatively biased evans 2013 lespinas et al 2015 in order to find out how modifying the ψ o and ψ b fields i e producing brand new perturbations of the reference precipitation or altering the sampling grids affects the assessment and the singularity several more sets of experiments were considered the findings of these experiments help explain the unexpected drops seen in fig 7 taking the already completed experiment as one set referred to as po1 three more sets of experiment are considered including 1 a brand new ψ o dataset referred to as po2 2 the old ψ o dataset sampled over different grids referred to as po ng and 3 a brand new ψ b referred to as pb new assimilated with po1 fig 9 shows the variation of the nse scores for the four experiment sets for uc and lc subbasins the results illustrate that variations in the nse scores for po1 po2 and po ng are generally similar in other words changing the ψ o data and performing the analysis over a new set of sampling grids has a negligible impact on the overall behaviour of the synthetic streamflows conversely conducting the experiment using a brand new ψ b new gridded perturbation of nr p r has a distinguishable impact on the behaviour of the synthetic streamflow the new background field visibly altered the variation of the nse scores this shows that depending on the background field the singularity phenomenon can play an important role in shaping the variation trend of nse scores against changing pn resolution although the variation in the nse scores for different subbasins was not greatly affected at finer resolutions above ν c the results shown here suggest that in order to fully assess the impact of network density on hydrological criteria several ψ b s should be incorporated into the network assessment framework table 3 provides the percentage of change in the nse criterion at different stages of increase in the pn resolution δ ν nse the change in the nse scores as the resolution increases from 0 7 to 0 6 δ ν 0 7 0 6 nse for the different subbasins is shown in the table the relative contribution of each incremental increase in ν to the total gain in nse is defined as r nse the r nse max value is then defined as the ratio of the largest improvement to the total gain in flow simulation skill as follows 12 r nse max max δ ν nse ν 3 6 0 2 δ ν nse the value of this ratio in percent is shown in the last column of table 3 for different subbasins it clearly shows that augmenting the network when ν 0 7 0 6 alone contributes to at least 50 of the total improvement made to flow forecasting skill through the augmentation of the meteorological observation network the largest overall gain in skill happens at the lc outlet where r nse max is as high as 90 this means that increasing the pn resolution just beyond ν c benefits the whole basin more so than any of the subbasins the total amount of improvement in the nse criterion resulting from augmenting the pn when ν 3 6 0 2 can be related to drainage area fig 10 shows that there is a third order polynomial relationship r 2 0 95 between the drainage area a and the total percentage of improvement that can be made in the flow simulation accuracy δ ν nse by increasing the network resolution from 3 6 to 0 2 while preparing fig 10 several other subbasins in the crb and their corresponding contributing drainage areas were considered in order to establish a more reliable relationship the figure suggests that the larger the drainage area associated with an individual gauge the lower overall improvement is achieved in the simulation skill by augmenting the network it appears that increasing the meteorological network density in a watershed where the total drainage area is less than 100 000 km2 may improve the hydrologic modeling accuracy by as much as three times the improvement seen in basins with drainage areas in the order of 200 000 300 000 km2 this is a reasonable outcome since by moving from upstream and smaller drainage areas to downstream and larger subbasins representativeness errors are averaged which makes individual processes and network inaccuracies i e missing a storm event less relevant and important however in smaller basins these features are extremely important for capturing proper flow statistics 5 summary and conclusions in this study the impact of increasing meteorological network density on hydrologic modeling outcomes within the framework of the statistical interpolation si data assimilation technique was evaluated this evaluation took the form of a network assessment methodology which was developed to be a stochastic hydro geostatistical procedure the developed assessment procedure incorporates an osse observing system simulation experiment based framework to simulate the si data assimilation technique the synthetic approach is an appropriate framework for evaluating and designing ground based observation networks as it offers the advantage of using non existent observations this makes the technique useful for evaluating sparse or new observation networks moreover the osse based network assessment algorithm provides a framework in which true benchmark atmospheric conditions may be realized hypothetically by providing the advantage of using a controlled simulation experiment this is advantageous since even with a dense network true distribution of precipitation intensity may not be fully understood in real world due to high spatial variability of precipitation the developed assessment scheme follows the same paradigm used by tarboton et al 1987 bras et al 1988 krajewski et al 1991 dong et al 2005 and is an extension of the techniques used for augmenting observation networks in sparsely gauged basins our assessment methodology also resembles the procedure explained by arsenault and brissette 2014 who proposed an experimental and exploratory approach to finding the optimal network density for long term hydrologic modeling purposes in a sparsely gauged basin situated in the remote canadian boreal ecoclimatic zone our approach to network assessment however is unique in that it is the first time that a ground based precipitation observation network assessment framework is designed to include a data assimilation component this is made possible by taking advantage of the stochastic geostatistical framework of the si technique in which the reliability of each source of precipitation information used in the assimilation system can be quantified in addition to the novel network assessment methodology introduced in this paper a number of new tools and approaches were applied along the way towards the objective of the study including a gridded daily precipitation generator a gridded hourly temperature generator conditioned on the state of precipitation see abbasnezhadi et al in review for more details and a procedure for perturbing gridded precipitation fields also while it has been long known that there is a relationship between augmenting an observation network in a given basin of certain drainage area and the corresponding improvement in hydrologic simulation skill this study also provided an opportunity to draw a clear line to describe the relationship through an empirical assessment the assessment showed that in smaller catchments individual precipitation processes or network inaccuracies are extremely important in order to capture proper flow statistics whereas by moving from upstream to downstream and subsequently from smaller drainage areas to larger ones errors are averaged out and network inaccuracies become less striking the results of the observation network assessment in the churchill river basin crb located in the canadian boreal ecoclimatic zone showed that the variation of the nash sutcliffe efficiencies against various network resolutions goes through a hyperbolic trend which is in line with the findings of bardossy and das 2008 dong et al 2005 and xu et al 2013 who reported that when network density falls beneath a certain limit flow simulation skill drops rapidly finally a density in the order of 3 stations 10 000 km2 was found to be an optimal choice for an observation network in the crb it should however be reminded here that the definition of the optimal network density depends on the application for which the network is designed i e hydrological simulation versus meteorological purposes lespinas et al 2015 discussed that the network density value of 1 17 station 10 000 km2 which is the mean network density in canada can be used as a measure to predict the relative performance of capa compared to gem when the network density exceeds the mean value in canada capa outperforms gem with higher skill scores and lower bias scores however the canadian mean network density criterion pertains only to improving observation networks in the general framework of the capa assimilation system and does not address hydrological considerations in contrast this study found the minimum required network density through a procedure which satisfies hydro geostatistical criteria while still maintains the si data assimilation technique as an integral part of the procedure a number of modifications have been identified which can improve the overall performance of the proposed osse based assessment technique before applying it in future studies the case study described in this paper tested the developed methodology focused on a potential ground based observation network in the crb the selection of the crb as the study basin was based on the sparse nature of the observation network in the basin which provided an opportunity to demonstrate the capacity of the proposed approach for expanding sparse observation networks nevertheless implementing the developed methodology in another basin with a decent network density that suffers less from the setbacks discussed in sections 4 2 1 and 4 2 3 could help support the findings of this study including whether the assumption of normality of background and observation errors considered in the formulation of the si technique would be valid a possible correction for bias introduced through data transformations is to keep pseudo precipitation datasets in transformed space once they are created as opposed to inverse transforming them back to original space before assimilating by si since relative rather than absolute performance of network scenarios is assessed it was argued that with a less than perfectly calibrated hydrologic model the applicability of the proposed algorithm would not be undermined however it would be worth calibrating the hydrologic model used in the assessment with high resolution precipitation analysis data to test this assumption and finally it is worth reviewing the assumptions and rationales given for the specific choices made throughout the proposed assessment approach in sections 4 1 and 4 2 the proposed assessment scheme provides a number of opportunities for future studies possible avenues of exploration include extending the developed synthetic network assessment procedure for optimizing precipitation observation networks using heuristic optimization algorithms e g genetic algorithm while maintaining the same overall estimation precision applying the described assessment approach to find minimum station densities across different geographical and ecoclimatic regions and utilizing the weather generators designed in this study to develop reference precipitation fields corresponding to different climate scenarios for designing future observation networks in addition various models and techniques used at different stages of the assessment including the weather generators the hydrologic model and the perturbation scheme can all be compared against alternative approaches to investigate opportunities for performance improvements acknowledgements the authors would like to thank the associate editor

council of canada are gratefully acknowledged capa and gem data are accessible through environment and climate change canada servers appendix a nr p r formulation in eq 1 if the background and observation terms are replaced by their pseudo counterparts introduced in section 2 2 2 ψ a may then be explained as follows a 1 ψ i a ψ i b k 1 n w ik ψ k o ψ k b where ψ i a is the pseudo analysis at grid point i ψ i b is the pseudo background at grid point i ψ k o is the pseudo observation at station k 1 2 n and ψ k b is the value obtained by interpolating the nearby ψ i b values bilinearly to the observation location k and the weights are defined in section 2 1 considering that the artificial components in the right hand side of eq a 1 are built by perturbing the reference field they can be expanded such that a 2 ψ i b p r i ε i b ψ k o p r k ε k o where p r i and p r k are the reference precipitation nr p r values at grid point i and station location k respectively and ε i b and ε k o denote the noise terms to be added to the reference field in order to generate the perturbed synthetic data assuming that ψ b and ψ o are unbiased these noise terms can be generated by random sampling from a zero mean normal distribution defined by the following expectation terms a 3 e ε i b 0 e ε k o 0 eq a 1 may be further expanded if the ψ b and ψ o terms are substituted with their respective expressions given by eq a 2 which yields a 4 ψ i a p r i ε i b k 1 n w ik p r k ε k o p r k ε k b if every single analysis grid point is considered to be a pseudo station location where a ψ

6794,a stochastic hydro geostatistical assessment approach is proposed to evaluate the predictability of streamflow simulation as a function of precipitation observation network density this approach is based on the paradigm of a controlled data assimilation simulation algorithm known as observing system simulation experiment osse the osse based algorithm is designed to simulate a data assimilation technique known as statistical interpolation si in si observations are combined with short term precipitation forecasts through variographic analysis the assessment approach was designed in two stages at the first stage of the assessment si precipitation analysis is stochastically simulated to construct a hypothetical true reference precipitation field while at the second stage the variographic by products of the si gaussian process are used to perturb the reference field in order to produce the pseudo counterparts of the si input components the pseudo terms are then combined in si to compute the pseudo precipitation analysis while various network scenarios are considered distributed hydrologic modeling is then performed to convert reference and pseudo analysis datasets into streamflow the proposed assessment approach can be used to assess observation networks of various densities however it is particularly effective in sparsely gauged basins to demonstrate the application of the approach to a real world case the sparse observation network in the churchill river basin crb which covers an area of roughly 296 000 km2 in the canadian boreal ecoclimatic region was assessed regional deterministic precipitation analysis from 2002 to 2012 was extracted from the canadian precipitation analysis capa data assimilation system and used while generating the reference field gridded precipitation data from both stages of the assessment were used as input to watflood distributed hydrologic model quantitative assessment of streamflow suggested that an observation network with a density in the order of 3 stations 10 000 km2 in the crb can satisfy hydrological criteria while maintaining the network as an integral part of the capa s si data assimilation technique keywords observation network osse data assimilation hydrologic modeling canadian precipitation analysis statistical interpolation 1 introduction operational and experimental numerical weather prediction nwp models are developed to predict precipitation and other meteorological variables e g temperature wind relative humidity radiation etc over regional or global domains and various spatial and temporal scales one such effort is the regional deterministic precipitation system rdps vaillancourt et al 2012 which relies on the global environmental multiscale gem model côté et al 1998a côté et al 1998b gem has been developed by the canadian meteorological centre cmc to capture the distribution of precipitation along with other meteorological variables in both time and space over canada precipitation estimates derived from gem have temporal and spatial uncertainties which is the case with every nwp model the amount of uncertainty in precipitation estimates can be reduced by assimilating observed precipitation into the model forecast jacobson 1999 kalnay 2003 stull 1999 assimilation systems reduce uncertainty by considering the nwp model forecast only as a necessary source of information to fill in the holes in the precipitation observation network while the emphasis is given to fit the observations as closely as possible rutherford 1972 the cmc canadian precipitation analysis capa mahfouf et al 2007 is a data assimilation system and its product is known as the regional deterministic precipitation analysis rdpa capa rdpa has been used in a number of hydro meteorological and hydrological modeling studies as a source of precipitation information see e g deacu et al 2012 eum et al 2014 fry 2014 gaborit et al 2017 haghnegahdar et al 2014 mekonnen et al 2014 mengistu and spence 2016 milrad et al 2017 yassin et al 2017 and it is expected that the number of studies that incorporates capa data will continue to rise in the future the accuracy of results produced by such modeling efforts would be highly sensitive to the random error associated with the capa precipitation input which in turn is influenced by the spatial sampling of precipitation observations essou et al 2017 oudin et al 2006 xu et al 2006 xu and vandewiele 1994 the core of the capa system is the application of a geostatistical data assimilation scheme known as statistical interpolation si a k a optimum interpolation technique rutherford 1972 si is a minimum variance scheme which resembles the kriging technique alsamamra et al 2009 daley 1991 in capa si is used to combine surface and remotely sensed radar and satellite observations with background information derived from short term gem forecasts to improve the accuracy of precipitation estimates mahfouf et al 2007 in order for si to yield precipitation data that outperform the background forecast field data coverage in both time and space over the region of interest should be consistent mahfouf et al 2007 showed that the accuracy of capa precipitation fields depends on observed data availability to satisfy the interpolation the analysis is more accurate in regions where the observation network density is higher and the accuracy diminishes rapidly in regions with limited precipitation information lespinas et al 2015 assessed the performance of capa against gem and observations across canada using categorical frequency bias index and equitable threat score and continuous root mean square error correlation coefficient and mean error scores and concluded that although capa rdpa consistently performs better than gem both have similar levels of reduced accuracy in areas with few precipitation gauges these findings show that before setting up hydrologic models using capa rdpa as input it is important to assess the sufficiency of the ground observation network density in the general framework of the si technique therefore our point of departure in this study is the problem of the required station density to provide valid regional observations of precipitation for hydrologic modeling geostatistical approaches have been widely explored in precipitation network assessment studies they apply kriging in order to minimize the variance of the areal precipitation estimation and thus are generally referred to as variance based approaches bastin et al 1984 bras and rodriguez iturbe 1976 and hughes and lettenmaier 1981 were among those who first adopted ordinary kriging in the framework of precipitation network assessment geostatistical approaches can be combined with supplementary statistical procedures e g multivariate analysis see e g burn and goulter 1991 shaghaghian and abedini 2013 or entropy based analysis see e g barca et al 2008 chebbi et al 2011 chen et al 2008 yang and burn 1994 yeh et al 2011 for network assessment rationalization i e optimizing the network while maintaining the same overall mean areal precipitation estimation precision or extension i e identifying new observing locations to enhance the estimation accuracy however from a hydrological point of view it is beneficial for precipitation evaluation results from geostatistical network assessment schemes e g variance based entropy based and multi objective to account for hydrologic modeling operations see e g essou et al 2017 bardossy and das 2008 bras et al 1988 st hilaire et al 2003 tarboton et al 1987 xu et al 2013 xu et al 2015 and wilson et al 1979 were among those who have followed this so called hydro geostatistical paradigm and have investigated the extent to which the modeled streamflow simulated by different lumped or distributed models can be influenced by the density of observation network that controls the estimation of precipitation input the main goal of a hydro geostatistical network assessment is to quantify the impact of observation network density on precipitation estimations and the corresponding hydrological outcomes this objective can be achieved through deterministic i e application of actual precipitation observations or stochastic i e simulation of precipitation data approaches dong et al 2005 a deterministic approach is applicable when high quality precipitation information can be collected by means of ground or radar observations from a densely gauged basin whereas a stochastic scheme is effective when observations have limited long term availability and are scattered in both time and space impending effective hydrologic modeling in a river basin one such stochastic scheme is based on the paradigm of observing system simulation experiment osse arnold and dey 1986 typically an osse is undertaken in order to investigate the impact of an extension to an already operational observation network on the performance of a system e g weather forecasting daley 1991 the main purpose of an osse is therefore to simulate a data assimilation system arnold and dey 1986 while in a data assimilation system real observations which are not perfect are incorporated in the estimation of actual atmospheric conditions in an osse simulated observations with simulated errors are derived from a simulated atmosphere errico et al 2013 the basic components of an osse include a sophisticated nwp model i e one that contains all the required atmospheric information to simulate the true state of the atmosphere a mechanism for generating realistic errors to synthesize observations a data assimilation system to continuously integrate synthetic observations into the model forecast and a yard stick to evaluate the performance of the assimilated synthetic observations the osse procedure is commonly used to design new space borne observation systems but it has found applications for investigating surface based observation networks too for example vecchi and harrison 2007 designed an osse to assess an integrated in situ observation system monitoring interannual and subseasonal variability of subsurface indian ocean temperature in this paper a synthetic approach to precipitation observation network assessment is outlined which resembles the paradigm of an osse this approach is designed to evaluate the impact of increasing the meteorological network density within the framework of the si data assimilation scheme on the accuracy of streamflow simulations to the best of the authors knowledge it is the first time that a procedure is developed to explore the impact of network density of observations used in the assimilation of daily precipitation accumulations on hydrologic modeling outcomes results of this assessment can aid in optimizing observation network density from both statistical accounting for the theoretical formulation of an assimilation system merging observations with short term background forecast and physical accounting for the hydrological response of the basin to assimilation system s precipitation analysis standpoints since similar to an osse the assessment is carried out entirely with synthetic observations the proposed scheme can be applied regardless of existing observation network s configuration and density or basin topographic and climatic characteristics the proposed scheme can be extended to assess precipitation observation networks in any given basin provided that gridded precipitation information from a numerical prediction model are readily available in the remainder of the paper statistical interpolation is described together with the methodology developed for observation network assessment a case study is then presented to illustrate application of the assessment approach to a real world network in a sparely gauged basin in canada thereafter results are presented and discussed including validation of different assumptions and rationales made throughout the assessment finally a summary and the study conclusions follow 2 methodology the most significant advantage of the statistical interpolation si technique is that different sources of information e g precipitation observations and short term precipitation forecasts can be combined in a way that the accuracy of each source would be quantified bratseth 1985 these assimilation by products can be integrated into an osse based observation network assessment approach therefore in this section before elaborating the assessment methodology details regarding the mathematical formulation of the si technique are provided 2 1 statistical interpolation the si technique is performed via the variographic analysis of innovations i e difference between observations and corresponding values from the background forecast at the observation locations daley 1991 if x i b denotes the background forecast at grid point i 1 2 n x k o denotes the observation at location k 1 2 n and x k b denotes the value obtained by interpolating the background forecast available at nearby grid points bilinearly to observation location k the updated grid point value called the analysis x i a is obtained as follows 1 x i a x i b k 1 n w ik x k o x k b where weights w ik are derived by minimizing the variance of the analysis error defined as deviation of analysis value from true value of precipitation depth assuming that observation and background errors defined as the deviation of observation and background forecast from the true value of precipitation depth respectively are not correlated in space the minimization formula can be written in matrix format as σ o σ b w i σ i b the terms inside the brackets on the left hand side express the covariance of innovations where σ o is the n n covariance matrix of observation errors and σ b is the n n covariance matrix of background errors σ i b is the n 1 vector of covariance of errors between the analysis grid point i and n stations two more assumptions are taken into consideration when deriving the weights station errors are uncorrelated in space and background errors and observation errors are normally distributed daley 1991 given these assumptions σ o can be expressed as σ o σ ε o 2 i where σ ε o 2 is variance of observation error and i is the vector of unity in addition the covariance of innovations can be written as 2 σ o σ b σ ε o 2 σ ε b 2 at station locations σ b between station locations where σ ε b 2 indicates variance of background error one can find σ ε o 2 and σ ε b 2 by first transforming background and observations into normal space lespinas et al 2015 using the box and cox 1964 transform function given as 3 y y λ 1 λ where y and y are the transformed and non transformed precipitations respectively and λ is the transformation parameter care should be taken when selecting the λ parameter value while a value close to 1 2 could result in a square root transformation lower values in the order of 1 10 would approximate a log transformation which would lead to a positive bias in estimated precipitation amounts erdin et al 2012 evans 2013 once background and observations are transformed innovations are computed at the station locations the covariance cloud between innovations can then be sketched and fitted with a theoretical semivariogram model with nugget effect daley 1991 such as the exponential model as follows 4 b l k exp d l k l ε b where b l k is the spatial correlation of innovations at grid points l and k d l k is the distance in km between the two grid points and l ε b is the correlation length at which the semivariogram model reaches a plateau i e maximum distance where innovations are correlated in space the semivariogram value associated with the correlation length is referred to as sill and is attributed to the variance of background error σ ε b 2 also the variance of observation error σ ε o 2 is associated with the y intercept a k a the nugget effect of the theoretical semivariogram 2 2 assessment approach fig 1 a shows the basic components of a real world data assimilation system set up based on the configuration of the si technique this flowchart describes an assimilation system in which background forecast and observations represent real data in order to evaluate how a change in an observation network s density throughout a region would impact the analysis a benchmark dataset consisting of real precipitation depths over the basin is required for comparison purposes under real world settings such a benchmark dataset could only be produced in full by an infinitely dense network of observations in such a case representativeness error could be ignored if instrumentation error is ignored as well then the network can be assumed to provide the closest representation of reality such a densely gridded network is created during the first stage of an osse known as the nature run nr in order to provide a true or reference precipitation p r field over the basin details concerning the generation of the reference field are provided in section 2 2 1 this nr p r field is assumed to be perfect and provides actual conditions over the basin in other words the nr p r field is considered to be the real precipitation depth over the basin and not a best approximation of reality this can be proven in theory through the formulation of the si technique see appendix a the nr p r field not only is required for conducting a controlled simulation experiment but also liberates the entire experiment from the constraints of real world observations including limited access to quality controlled data and the uncertainties involved with actual observations fig 1b shows the basic components of a simulated data assimilation system where background forecast and observations represent synthetic rather than real data the chart illustrates a synthetic run sr in which the real input components real observations and a first guess background field of the si data assimilation technique are replaced with artificial ones the key idea here is that the assimilation is carried out in a simulated world where everything is pseudo in a real world data assimilation system the analysis generally resembles the observations as well as the background field gao and stensrud 2012 rutherford 1972 this analogy can be leveraged to derive pseudo observations and pseudo background fields by modifying the nr p r field in a way that accurately captures the nature of the errors associated with the observations and background field this can be done by perturbing the reference field nr p r to approximate the characteristics of the real world input data of the assimilation system while the nature of the errors associated with real station observations and the background forecast is captured 2 2 1 nature run conventionally in an osse the production of the nr p r is carried out by running a nwp model that includes all required atmospheric information to simulate the true state of the atmosphere masutani et al 2013 this makes the generation of the nr p r field expensive from a computational standpoint however here a method is proposed that deviates from the conventional procedure in that the nr p r field is created through stochastic modeling replacing the nwp model with a stochastic precipitation generator is an appropriate substitution for the purpose of the current study since the pertinent statistical properties and distribution moments of the gridded data can be preserved moreover running a sophisticated nwp model would need a considerable amount of data and computational power whereas application of a stochastic precipitation model is deemed a proper way to make efficient use of available resources this study employs the gridded precipitation generator designed by abbasnezhadi et al in review the generator generalizes the occurrence amount precipitation model originally developed by wilks 2009 for the simulation of high resolution gridded daily precipitation fields wilks applied a multivariate nonparametric regression procedure to interpolate the generator parameters this scheme for constructing a gridded model works well for meteorological networks of a decent density if the network density is low the quality of the interpolation suffers no matter what technique is used therefore rather than interpolating the generator parameters onto a grid abbasnezhadi et al in review designed a gridded model where precipitation time series are generated at the location of the grid points of the si precipitation analysis 2 2 2 synthetic run the pseudo observation ψ o component in the simulated data assimilation system can be created by accounting for the observation uncertainty which is expressed in terms of representativeness and mechanical errors both sources of error can be combined into the observation error ε o term which can then be added to the nr p r field to generate the pseudo observation component while the nr p r field includes every grid point throughout the basin of interest ψ o data can be created at a subset of grid points sampled from the full nr p r grid corresponding to observation locations in a hypothetical network of a given resolution density each ψ o sampling grid can be represented by a pseudo network pn denoted by θ ν where ν is the sampling grid resolution in decimal degrees the k th pseudo station from any pn is the location at which an array of ψ o data is created by perturbing nr p r such that 5 ψ k o p r k e k o where ψ k o is the vector of ψ o accumulations at pseudo station k p r k is the vector of reference precipitation nr p r at the same grid point and e k o ε k o 1 ε k o 2 ε k o t is the vector of observation errors generated at the same pseudo station in which t is the recording time interval in days the k index is placed inside a pair of round brackets to indicate that the observation location k is a selected grid point in the corresponding pn realization as per si assumptions observation errors are normally distributed and spatially uncorrelated therefore ε k o t can be generated by independently sampling at each grid point from a gaussian distribution such that ε k o t n 0 σ ε o t where σ ε o t is the mean daily standard deviation of the observation error on julian day t similar to how the pseudo observation ψ o is created a pseudo background ψ b field can be constructed by accounting for the uncertainty associated with the background forecast or the background error ε b kalnay 2003 based on the si technique it is assumed that on each day t background errors are normally distributed and spatially correlated the former assumption implies that ε b t n 0 σ ε b t where σ ε b t is the mean standard deviation of the background error on julian day t associated with the semivariogram sill value given this assumption a ψ b field can be produced by perturbing nr p r as follows 6 ψ b t p r t e b t where ψ b t is the matrix of the pseudo background precipitation on day t and p r t and e b t are the matrices of nr p r and the background errors respectively on the same day by disregarding temporal correlations e b t can be generated by random sampling from the gaussian distribution however since background errors are correlated in space normal variates representing the background error must be generated in a way that achieves a spatial structure consistent with the covariance function of the experimental semivariogram of the si analysis knowing that the covariance matrix of background errors σ b is a symmetric bccb block circulant with circulant blocks the generation of gaussian background error fields can be accomplished by random sampling from the real and imaginary parts of b n o 2 σ b where o is the matrix of zeroes and b is the exponential model given by eq 4 this procedure can be facilitated by the circular embedding spatial process dietrich and newsam 1997 kroese and botev 2015 powell 2014 see abbasnezhadi 2017 for more details fig 2 shows the two stages of the osse based assessment algorithm nature run is shown by the double weighted line while the synthetic run goes through the single weighted process as shown in this flowchart in the last step of the sr stage the pseudo components ψ o and ψ b are combined to produce the synthetic run s pseudo analysis sr ψ a for a given pseudo network realization it should be noted that since in si the analysis is performed using innovations in transformed space the parameters of the theoretical semivariogram σ ε o σ ε b and l ε b represent the transformed data too consequently employing such variographic information during the generation of observation and background errors ε o and ε b results in errors valid only in transformed space therefore it is necessary to transform nr p r field into normal space before ε o or ε b are added to the field to create ψ o and ψ b respectively the transformations can be carried out using the box cox function given by eq 3 once pseudo data are created they should be inverse transformed back to the original space before being assimilated using the si technique the box cox inverse transformation function is written as 7 y y λ 1 1 λ where y and y are either ψ o or ψ b in the original and transformed spaces respectively 2 2 3 network assessment criteria the performance of each pseudo network scenario is manifested through its corresponding pseudo analysis which can be compared against the reference nr p r a sr ψ a that is closely matched with the nr p r field would then represent the best scenario the means by which such a proximity is to be measured depends on the final application e g hydrological versus atmospheric for which the observation network is considered in a hydrological context comparing sr ψ a against nr p r should be carried out by quantitatively measuring the simulated pseudo streamflow response to sr ψ a defined as sr q p against the response to nr p r defined as nr q r given the gridded nature of nr p r and sr ψ a fields a distributed or semi distributed hydrologic model is required to simulate the influence of spatial variability of both fields besides basin characteristics on streamflow estimations khakbaz et al 2012 as per the assumption of the nature run nr p r is assumed to constitute the true state of precipitation if the hydrologic model is assumed to be perfect too with the perfect meteorological input the resulting nr q r constitutes the hypothetically true hydrological response of the basin it can however be argued that the assumption of a perfect hydrologic model is unrealistic but it should be emphasized that the proposed osse based procedure is designed to assess the relative performance of different network densities and not their absolute performance this approach ensures that even with a less than perfectly calibrated hydrologic model the applicability of the proposed osse based algorithm is not undermined the quantitative assessment can be carried out using the efficiency metric described by nash and sutcliffe 1970 nse given as follows 8 nse 1 i 1 m q r i q p i 2 i 1 m q r i q r 2 where q r is the mean value of nr q r and m is the number of time steps nse can be decomposed into three components relative variability a bias b and linear correlation r these constituents can be used to formulate an alternative performance criterion known as the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 given as 9 kge 1 ed where ed is the euclidean distance of a b and r from the optimal point of unity in a three dimensional space as follows 10 ed a 1 2 b 1 2 r 1 2 1 2 3 case study to illustrate the application of the proposed osse based assessment approach for evaluating the observation network in sparsely gauged basins the churchill river basin crb was selected as a case study the crb covers an area of roughly 296 000 km2 and is a sub watershed of the larger nelson churchill river basin fig 3 shows the location of the crb in the canadian boreal ecoregion the distribution of meteorological stations within and near the basin is illustrated in this map as shown the meteorological stations are not uniformly distributed throughout the basin and many weather stations in the basin do not have long and continuous records moreover only a few gauges throughout the basin can pass the strict quality control qc measures enjoyed by capa to safeguard the final analysis against erroneous or biased readings fig 3 displays the synoptic gauges that are currently assimilated in capa the ability of precipitation gauges to pass snow qc standards is of particular concern during winter when aerodynamic effects associated with gauge shape result in the majority of solid precipitation observations being negatively biased and thus rejected lespinas et al 2015 these constraints have adversely affected the capa s skill in the crb while the cmc s meteorological research division is actively studying how to correct snow undercatch bias using existing relationships between solid precipitation measurements and wind speed such as those given by goodison et al 1998 and kochendorfer 2017 among others the first two points of concern namely the non uniform distribution of weather stations and the short discontinuous nature of precipitation records were addressed in this study 3 1 nature run the gridded rdpa regional deterministic precipitation analysis daily precipitation accumulations produced by the capa system version 2 4 β 8 from 2002 to 2012 were acquired from the environment and climate change canada repositories capa rdpa data were then converted to a two dimensional rectangular grid with a spatial resolution of 0 10 in latitude and 0 15 in longitude roughly 10 km in both directions at 60 n fig 3 shows the location of 8772 grid points in the rectangular grid over the crb the gridded precipitation generator developed by abbasnezhadi et al in review was used to generate 100 years worth of gridded daily precipitation fields to construct the nr p r field while maintaining seasonal variability in the mean variance and spatial correlations of the capa rdpa data 3 2 synthetic run the by products of the si procedure σ ε o t σ ε b t and l ε b t from the capa system version 2 4 β 8 from 2002 to 2012 were acquired the mean values of error statistics σ ε o t σ ε b t and l ε b t averaged over all available years on julian day t were then computed as follows 11 s t 1 y y s t y t 1 2 365 y 2002 2012 where s t is any of the three mean error statistics on day t s t y denotes any of the three error statistics on day t in year y and y is the number of years here 10 years considered to compute the mean the key assumptions of the si algorithm were taken into consideration when constructing the ε o and ε b error fields observation errors are not required to account for any dependency in space between the observation locations whereas the background error should account for the spatial structure explained by the variographic analysis of the innovations pns pseudo networks of various densities ranging from capa s average resolution 0 1 to successively coarser resolutions lower density networks were configured using a fixed origin at 59 6900 n 112 9150 e located at the north western corner of the domain for each individual pn scenario θ ν where ν 0 1 0 2 0 8 1 2 1 8 3 6 a subset of grid points representing the pseudo stations of the respective pn was extracted from the original nr p r domain these pn scenarios were used to generate pseudo observations by adding random error to the daily nr p r field the pseudo background ψ b fields were also constructed by perturbing the nr p r field the circular embedding model was used to generate spatial gaussian random fields of background error since observation and background errors are valid only in transformed space the nr p r field was transformed into normal space before adding in ε o or ε b to create ψ o or ψ b respectively the transformations were carried out using the box cox function given by eq 3 a λ parameter of 1 3 was used which is consistent with the optimal value being used in the operational version of capa when transforming innovations in capa this choice of box cox which resembles a cubic root transformation is drawn by a visual inspection of the empirical distribution of transformed innovations fortin et al 2015 once ψ o and ψ b data were created they were inverse transformed back to the original space and used as input data in capa to produce the precipitation pseudo analysis ψ a corresponding to each pseudo network realization with the version of capa used in this study three inputs were required to produce an analysis gridded background data station observations and gridded temperature data while the first two datasets were fundamentally required in si the temperature data were used to quality control the precipitation observations in order to safeguard the final analysis against biased readings however for the purpose of this study ψ o data were assumed to be unbiased as they were created by adding random error to the truth while eliminating all systematic errors a k a bias from entering the assimilation cycle 3 3 hydrologic modeling hydrologic modeling constituted the main framework for evaluating the performance of different pn realizations throughout the crb in this study the watflood distributed hydrologic model kouwen 2010 was used for streamflow analysis the model uses physically based routing and conceptual hydrological simulation modules runoff simulations are performed using grouped response units which collectively reflect a combination of land cover types and elevation data in gridded format in order to avoid conflicts between the spatial resolution of the input data and that of watflood the model s spatial resolution was set to be the same as the resolution of the rectangular grid at which capa rdpa data were extracted the watflood model was pre calibrated against a 1985 1995 training period by manitoba hydro using the canadian daily climate data cdcd bohrn 2012 fig 3 shows the location of the hydrometric gauges where flow simulations in response to nr p r and sr ψ a fields are compared table 1 provides more details regarding the hydrometric gauges considered including water survey of canada wsc gauge number station coordinates drainage subbasin and drainage area for each gauge although these gauges provide an opportunity to use actual flow observations only artificially produced data were used for the network assessment it would therefore also be possible to use other hypothetical hydrometric gauge locations for the evaluation of watflood results if desired regardless of whether or not they represented real world hydrometric observation sites for the watflood model to run the minimum data requirements are precipitation and temperature it was particularly important that diurnal temperature variations were captured which necessitates the use of sub daily inputs this forced us to develop a gridded temperature model in addition to the model already developed for nr p r see abbasnezhadi et al in review for more details the temperature model was used to generate gridded hourly temperature time series over the basin that were spatio temporally coherent with the generated gridded precipitation fields and was developed based on a generalization of the single site hourly temperature model introduced by hansen and driscoll 1977 in order to achieve coherency between the temperature and the precipitation models the cyclic components of the temperature data were conditioned on nr p r precipitation occurrence for each grid point the efficiency of this approach was demonstrated by wilks 2008 who combined the first two moments of daily maximum and minimum temperature using different moments based on precipitation occurrence at multiple sites the watflood model was used to simulate the hypothetical true hydrological response of the basin nr q r in response to nr p r and concurrent temperature fields also for each pn scenario the resulting sr ψ a was used as input in watflood to simulate the synthetic run s pseudo streamflow sr q p fig 4 shows the simulated hydrographs for upper churchill uc and lower churchill lc subbasins hydrometric gauges during the 2000 to 2012 hypothetical period the plots display the nr q r hydrograph as well as the sr q p hydrographs for two extreme scenarios q p θ 3 6 representing the pseudo streamflow derived from the ψ a analyzed from the pn with the lowest resolution and q p θ 0 2 where the pseudo streamflow is based on the ψ a assimilated based on the second highest pn resolution the q p θ 0 1 hydrograph matches perfectly with the nr q r hydrograph and thus is not shown here hydrographs derived from other pn scenarios fall between these two extremes 4 results and discussion before the hydrologic response of sr ψ a fields are compared against that of nr p r it is necessary to validate several important assumptions taken at both stages nature run and synthetic run of the assessment approach 4 1 validation of nature run the nature run should be validated in terms of the validity of the assimilation system representing the hydro meteorological system being investigated as well as the validity of the generated stochastic precipitation fields representing the assimilated products 4 1 1 hydro meteorological system the application of synthetic data in the framework of the proposed algorithm is necessary in order to assess the sensitivity of hydrologic simulations to density of the observation network used in the assimilation cycle however before such an assessment can be undertaken it is necessary to verify beforehand if the assimilation system hydrologic model processing chain can perform adequately to forecast observed streamflow based on actual precipitation observations this is a necessary step to verify that the simulated data assimilation system can properly mimic the hydro meteorological system being investigated in this section the validity of such a system defined by the capa watflood processing chain is investigated lespinas et al 2015 has indicated that capa rdpa data are typically negatively biased and have a larger bias than gem during summer mainly due to the larger number of convective rainfall occurrences during this season this shortcoming means that the generated nr p r field which resembles capa rdpa statistically is similarly biased however the prerequisite assumption used in the assessment that nr p r represents the truth is maintained this assumption was made on the grounds that a hypothetically assumed true field would provide a reliable benchmark for the assessment in the context of a controlled simulation experiment moreover capa rdpa data were used as the developmental sample with the implicit assumption that the capa system currently provides the best knowledge of the precipitation distribution in time and space over the sparsely gauged crb this assumption was made based on the results of an assessment performed by boluwade et al 2018 who compared the performance of capa rdpa data relative to actual precipitation observations for regional flow simulation the validation was performed using an operational version of watflood in the lake winnipeg basin lwb which is a sub watershed of the larger nelson churchill river basin the authors concluded that capa rdpa is a reliable product in regions of the lwb with sparse observation networks when used to force the watflood hydrologic model this is a promising result for other boreal ecoregions in canada with sparse networks such as the crb boluwade et al 2018 therefore it can be argued here that the assumption that capa rpda data can be adequately used in the hydro meteorological system under investigation in the crb is valid 4 1 2 synthetic nr p r field it is vital to validate the stochastic precipitation fields generated during the nature run against the historical capa rdpa data to ensure that the latter has been replaced by realistic stochastic data this validation is also necessary to ensure that nr q r represents the true state of streamflow in the basin the stochastic precipitation model used to generate the nr p r field is known to be a robust generator that can sufficiently retain a number of key statistical elements of historical data table 2 provides a summary of the key statistical properties used for the validation of the generated nr p r fields abbasnezhadi et al in review as the table shows the precipitation model has maintained correlation pattern occurrence probability moments of the precipitation distribution and extreme value characteristics of historical capa rdpa data however the model struggles to preserve long dry spells and the interannual variability of monthly total precipitation it is important to investigate if incorporating the generated nr p r data bearing the aforementioned shortfalls as input into the hydrologic modeling procedure will have any detrimental impact on the assessment the randomness of the generated nr p r results in the modeled hydrological flow response nr q r being random too therefore it is impossible to compare nr q r against real world flow observations in addition it is not appropriate to evaluate nr q r against the flow rates derived from capa rdpa through common quantitative criteria that estimate the goodness of fit between the two time series e g nse instead statistics that measure long term trends e g mean daily flow should be used to evaluate nr q r against the flow response derived from capa rdpa monthly and annual mean precipitation totals are the key statistical indicators of the generated nr p r field that should have been preserved to ensure long term trends of nr q r resemble those of capa rdpa flow response since the precipitation generator can preserve monthly and annual precipitation totals adequately the key components of the overall water balance can be maintained therefore neither of the noted shortfalls of the precipitation generator are found to have a detrimental impact on the statistical characteristics of the nr q r fig 5 compares mean daily nr q r and mean daily capa rdpa flow response at the upper churchill and lower churchill subbasins outlet gauges the inter quantile range and one standard deviation around the mean correspond to capa rdpa flow response are also displayed as shown flows are in relative agreement and therefore it can be concluded that nr q r represents the true state of streamflow in the basin 4 2 validation of synthetic run the synthetic run should be validated in terms of the capacity of the error statistics to represent true observation and background errors in addition the capacity of circular embedding model to preserve the spatial structure of the si semivariogram model should be investigated also it was expected that adding ε o and ε b to nr p r should result in ψ o and ψ b fields that exhibit by a good approximation the statistical characteristics of the real world background field gem and observations respectively therefore the pseudo precipitation data need to be verified against their real world counterparts 4 2 1 error statistics statistics on the errors of observation and background forecast are extracted from the si variographic analysis of innovations however care should be taken when handling these statistics the si technique like kriging provides the best but not necessarily the most accurate estimation of precipitation in addition si is an isotropic and space stationary approach and therefore similar to other non variational data assimilation techniques it does not reproduce the spatial structure of the data in this case precipitation perfectly moreover at each time step only one semivariogram is produced for the entire regional analysis resulting in one unique value for each of the semivariogram parameters the only exception is for cases where there is more than one station within a single analysis grid cell this issue can negatively impact the assessment in sparsely gauged basins and improve the assessment in dense networks the error statistics of the si variographic analysis of innovations ε o ε b were handled with the assumption that these by products are normally distributed ideally one would need to validate this assumption however in the absence of a dense observation network in the crb with a consistent record in both time and space it would be very difficult to infer the probability distribution of ε o and ε b this setback suggests that implementing the developed methodology in another basin with an observation network of a decent density could have been a better choice for a case study however it should be reminded that the selection of the crb was an intentional decision to demonstrate the capacity of the proposed approach for expanding sparse observation networks 4 2 2 background error spatial structure the application of the correlation length in the circular embedding model should force the random gaussian error fields to approximate the correlation function of the si model fig 6 compares the semivariogram model given by eq 4 to the experimental correlation function derived by running the circular embedding model 10 000 times with l ε b 60 93 53 km mean correlation length computed by eq 11 on the first day of march for a sample grid point the plot clearly indicates that the circular embedding model has successfully recreated the spatial dependencies similar to those of the si semivariogram function derived from capa 4 2 3 pseudo precipitation fields given the sparse nature of the current observation network it would be impossible to establish a benchmark to verify ψ o data moreover the sparse network in the crb prevents the background gem forecast from being corrected which in turn prevents the relative performance of capa rdpa and its stochastically generated counterpart nr p r from being improved in this study the verification of pseudo precipitation data was performed with respect to nr p r it can be argued that this was a rational decision since with the sparse network all three datasets capa rdpa nr p r and gem demonstrate rather identical distributions for the majority of grid points in the basin assuming that gem has the same distribution as nr p r also justifies that ψ b should have the same distribution as nr p r this assumption clearly does not imply that gem is the true field the verification of the ψ o and ψ b against nr p r was performed with respect to precipitation occurrence and precipitation amount and revealed two sources of bias 1 a wet day frequency bias and 2 a mean daily precipitation bias the former bias is associated with an increased frequency in light precipitation events while the latter bias is a direct consequence of the fact that for λ 1 3 the box cox inverse transformation function eq 7 is true for y 3 only which results in many low precipitation amounts being removed the wet day frequency bias was corrected by adjusting the frequency of the dry days in the pseudo precipitation fields to match the nr p r field also to remove mean daily precipitation bias in the inverse transformed pseudo precipitation fields parametric and empirical bias correction schemes were tested as one would expect from theory the empirical bias correction technique completely removed the bias from the distribution of the inverse transformed pseudo precipitation amounts see abbasnezhadi 2017 for more details 4 3 quantitative assessment of streamflow simulations the quantitative assessment of the synthetic run s pseudo streamflow sr q p with respect to nature run s reference streamflow nr q r can provide us with an understanding of the extent by which pn scenarios can improve streamflow simulations fig 7 shows the variation of the nse scores given by eq 8 with changing pn resolution for different subbasins in the crb as the resolution increases i e ν goes from 3 6 to 0 2 the performance scores go through an increasing trend which resembles a hyperbolic tangent function with three main regions of variation identified in all subbasins increasing ν from 3 6 up to 0 7 results in only marginal nse improvement the value of 0 7 can be interpreted as the critical network resolution ν c below which only minor improvements are expected increasing the pn resolution to 0 6 boosts the nse scores substantially and at higher resolutions ν 0 6 the variation of the nse scores shows no significant improvement although one could also argue that the predictability of streamflow simulations increases beyond the network resolution of 0 6 and up to ν 0 3 or even ν 0 2 the improvements are not appreciable enough to justify the optimality of adding more stations into the observation network this point will be elaborated later on through the quantification of fig 7 therefore the network resolution of 0 6 which corresponds to roughly 3 stations 10 000 km2 can be regarded as the network resolution threshold ν t below which the accuracy of the flow simulations degrades significantly and above which the nse scores begin to level off and little is gained by further increasing the network density fig 7 shows a few unexpected drops in the efficiencies at ν 0 8 and ν 0 5 mainly for central churchill cc lower central churchill lcc and lower churchill lc and to a lesser extent for upper central churchill ucc although the reduction in nse scores is not significant and the general trend of improvements is still hyperbolic there are several possibilities that can explain the fluctuating i e deviation from the trend behaviour the fluctuations are more pronounced for the larger central and eastern subbasins cc lcc and lc this could be attributed to the spatial heterogeneity of small scale and localized precipitation events e g mesoscale convective systems which might have not been captured by certain pseudo stations of specific pn scenarios in larger subbasins the aggregate of a higher number of pseudo stations missing localized events can ultimately affect nse score more intensely this phenomenon to which we are going to refer as singularity has also been reported by dong et al 2005 it is worth mentioning that the fluctuation in nse scores is not seen in upper churchill uc which is the smallest headwater subbasin while in ucc the fluctuation is observed to a lesser extent and is seen more intensely at larger downstream subbasins the extent to which singularity is responsible for the fluctuations seen in fig 7 is also the likely consequence of using the nse metric to measure the goodness of fit between the reference and synthetic hydrographs the effect of singularity and scale issues on the nse metric can be evaluated by constructing the variation curves using the alternative kge metric given by eq 9 fig 8 shows the variation of the kge scores with changing pn resolution for different hydrometric gauges in the crb many features in the plot including the trend patterns and other diagram specifications such as ν c and ν t are in line with those seen in fig 7 however unlike nse which is relatively sensitive to peak values the kge scores are less sensitive to peak values and therefore the variation curves are less affected by singularity this indicates the importance of the metric used to carry out the assessment the unexpected pulsing of the nse scores could also be the consequence of the bias introduced into ψ o and ψ b through data transformations to and from the normal space while bias ensuing from transformations was removed it bears repeating that the si analysis is itself done in a transformed space which eventually results in another set of biased outcomes although a correction scheme is performed in capa to remove the analysis bias fortin et al 2015 precipitation outputs typically remain negatively biased evans 2013 lespinas et al 2015 in order to find out how modifying the ψ o and ψ b fields i e producing brand new perturbations of the reference precipitation or altering the sampling grids affects the assessment and the singularity several more sets of experiments were considered the findings of these experiments help explain the unexpected drops seen in fig 7 taking the already completed experiment as one set referred to as po1 three more sets of experiment are considered including 1 a brand new ψ o dataset referred to as po2 2 the old ψ o dataset sampled over different grids referred to as po ng and 3 a brand new ψ b referred to as pb new assimilated with po1 fig 9 shows the variation of the nse scores for the four experiment sets for uc and lc subbasins the results illustrate that variations in the nse scores for po1 po2 and po ng are generally similar in other words changing the ψ o data and performing the analysis over a new set of sampling grids has a negligible impact on the overall behaviour of the synthetic streamflows conversely conducting the experiment using a brand new ψ b new gridded perturbation of nr p r has a distinguishable impact on the behaviour of the synthetic streamflow the new background field visibly altered the variation of the nse scores this shows that depending on the background field the singularity phenomenon can play an important role in shaping the variation trend of nse scores against changing pn resolution although the variation in the nse scores for different subbasins was not greatly affected at finer resolutions above ν c the results shown here suggest that in order to fully assess the impact of network density on hydrological criteria several ψ b s should be incorporated into the network assessment framework table 3 provides the percentage of change in the nse criterion at different stages of increase in the pn resolution δ ν nse the change in the nse scores as the resolution increases from 0 7 to 0 6 δ ν 0 7 0 6 nse for the different subbasins is shown in the table the relative contribution of each incremental increase in ν to the total gain in nse is defined as r nse the r nse max value is then defined as the ratio of the largest improvement to the total gain in flow simulation skill as follows 12 r nse max max δ ν nse ν 3 6 0 2 δ ν nse the value of this ratio in percent is shown in the last column of table 3 for different subbasins it clearly shows that augmenting the network when ν 0 7 0 6 alone contributes to at least 50 of the total improvement made to flow forecasting skill through the augmentation of the meteorological observation network the largest overall gain in skill happens at the lc outlet where r nse max is as high as 90 this means that increasing the pn resolution just beyond ν c benefits the whole basin more so than any of the subbasins the total amount of improvement in the nse criterion resulting from augmenting the pn when ν 3 6 0 2 can be related to drainage area fig 10 shows that there is a third order polynomial relationship r 2 0 95 between the drainage area a and the total percentage of improvement that can be made in the flow simulation accuracy δ ν nse by increasing the network resolution from 3 6 to 0 2 while preparing fig 10 several other subbasins in the crb and their corresponding contributing drainage areas were considered in order to establish a more reliable relationship the figure suggests that the larger the drainage area associated with an individual gauge the lower overall improvement is achieved in the simulation skill by augmenting the network it appears that increasing the meteorological network density in a watershed where the total drainage area is less than 100 000 km2 may improve the hydrologic modeling accuracy by as much as three times the improvement seen in basins with drainage areas in the order of 200 000 300 000 km2 this is a reasonable outcome since by moving from upstream and smaller drainage areas to downstream and larger subbasins representativeness errors are averaged which makes individual processes and network inaccuracies i e missing a storm event less relevant and important however in smaller basins these features are extremely important for capturing proper flow statistics 5 summary and conclusions in this study the impact of increasing meteorological network density on hydrologic modeling outcomes within the framework of the statistical interpolation si data assimilation technique was evaluated this evaluation took the form of a network assessment methodology which was developed to be a stochastic hydro geostatistical procedure the developed assessment procedure incorporates an osse observing system simulation experiment based framework to simulate the si data assimilation technique the synthetic approach is an appropriate framework for evaluating and designing ground based observation networks as it offers the advantage of using non existent observations this makes the technique useful for evaluating sparse or new observation networks moreover the osse based network assessment algorithm provides a framework in which true benchmark atmospheric conditions may be realized hypothetically by providing the advantage of using a controlled simulation experiment this is advantageous since even with a dense network true distribution of precipitation intensity may not be fully understood in real world due to high spatial variability of precipitation the developed assessment scheme follows the same paradigm used by tarboton et al 1987 bras et al 1988 krajewski et al 1991 dong et al 2005 and is an extension of the techniques used for augmenting observation networks in sparsely gauged basins our assessment methodology also resembles the procedure explained by arsenault and brissette 2014 who proposed an experimental and exploratory approach to finding the optimal network density for long term hydrologic modeling purposes in a sparsely gauged basin situated in the remote canadian boreal ecoclimatic zone our approach to network assessment however is unique in that it is the first time that a ground based precipitation observation network assessment framework is designed to include a data assimilation component this is made possible by taking advantage of the stochastic geostatistical framework of the si technique in which the reliability of each source of precipitation information used in the assimilation system can be quantified in addition to the novel network assessment methodology introduced in this paper a number of new tools and approaches were applied along the way towards the objective of the study including a gridded daily precipitation generator a gridded hourly temperature generator conditioned on the state of precipitation see abbasnezhadi et al in review for more details and a procedure for perturbing gridded precipitation fields also while it has been long known that there is a relationship between augmenting an observation network in a given basin of certain drainage area and the corresponding improvement in hydrologic simulation skill this study also provided an opportunity to draw a clear line to describe the relationship through an empirical assessment the assessment showed that in smaller catchments individual precipitation processes or network inaccuracies are extremely important in order to capture proper flow statistics whereas by moving from upstream to downstream and subsequently from smaller drainage areas to larger ones errors are averaged out and network inaccuracies become less striking the results of the observation network assessment in the churchill river basin crb located in the canadian boreal ecoclimatic zone showed that the variation of the nash sutcliffe efficiencies against various network resolutions goes through a hyperbolic trend which is in line with the findings of bardossy and das 2008 dong et al 2005 and xu et al 2013 who reported that when network density falls beneath a certain limit flow simulation skill drops rapidly finally a density in the order of 3 stations 10 000 km2 was found to be an optimal choice for an observation network in the crb it should however be reminded here that the definition of the optimal network density depends on the application for which the network is designed i e hydrological simulation versus meteorological purposes lespinas et al 2015 discussed that the network density value of 1 17 station 10 000 km2 which is the mean network density in canada can be used as a measure to predict the relative performance of capa compared to gem when the network density exceeds the mean value in canada capa outperforms gem with higher skill scores and lower bias scores however the canadian mean network density criterion pertains only to improving observation networks in the general framework of the capa assimilation system and does not address hydrological considerations in contrast this study found the minimum required network density through a procedure which satisfies hydro geostatistical criteria while still maintains the si data assimilation technique as an integral part of the procedure a number of modifications have been identified which can improve the overall performance of the proposed osse based assessment technique before applying it in future studies the case study described in this paper tested the developed methodology focused on a potential ground based observation network in the crb the selection of the crb as the study basin was based on the sparse nature of the observation network in the basin which provided an opportunity to demonstrate the capacity of the proposed approach for expanding sparse observation networks nevertheless implementing the developed methodology in another basin with a decent network density that suffers less from the setbacks discussed in sections 4 2 1 and 4 2 3 could help support the findings of this study including whether the assumption of normality of background and observation errors considered in the formulation of the si technique would be valid a possible correction for bias introduced through data transformations is to keep pseudo precipitation datasets in transformed space once they are created as opposed to inverse transforming them back to original space before assimilating by si since relative rather than absolute performance of network scenarios is assessed it was argued that with a less than perfectly calibrated hydrologic model the applicability of the proposed algorithm would not be undermined however it would be worth calibrating the hydrologic model used in the assessment with high resolution precipitation analysis data to test this assumption and finally it is worth reviewing the assumptions and rationales given for the specific choices made throughout the proposed assessment approach in sections 4 1 and 4 2 the proposed assessment scheme provides a number of opportunities for future studies possible avenues of exploration include extending the developed synthetic network assessment procedure for optimizing precipitation observation networks using heuristic optimization algorithms e g genetic algorithm while maintaining the same overall estimation precision applying the described assessment approach to find minimum station densities across different geographical and ecoclimatic regions and utilizing the weather generators designed in this study to develop reference precipitation fields corresponding to different climate scenarios for designing future observation networks in addition various models and techniques used at different stages of the assessment including the weather generators the hydrologic model and the perturbation scheme can all be compared against alternative approaches to investigate opportunities for performance improvements acknowledgements the authors would like to thank the associate editor

observation terms are replaced by their pseudo counterparts introduced in section 2 2 2 ψ a may then be explained as follows a 1 ψ i a ψ i b k 1 n w ik ψ k o ψ k b where ψ i a is the pseudo analysis at grid point i ψ i b is the pseudo background at grid point i ψ k o is the pseudo observation at station k 1 2 n and ψ k b is the value obtained by interpolating the nearby ψ i b values bilinearly to the observation location k and the weights are defined in section 2 1 considering that the artificial components in the right hand side of eq a 1 are built by perturbing the reference field they can be expanded such that a 2 ψ i b p r i ε i b ψ k o p r k ε k o where p r i and p r k are the reference precipitation nr p r values at grid point i and station location k respectively and ε i b and ε k o denote the noise terms to be added to the reference field in order to generate the perturbed synthetic data assuming that ψ b and ψ o are unbiased these noise terms can be generated by random sampling from a zero mean normal distribution defined by the following expectation terms a 3 e ε i b 0 e ε k o 0 eq a 1 may be further expanded if the ψ b and ψ o terms are substituted with their respective expressions given by eq a 2 which yields a 4 ψ i a p r i ε i b k 1 n w ik p r k ε k o p r k ε k b if every single analysis grid point is considered to be a pseudo station location where a ψ

differences between the two error fields subtracting the reference precipitation field from both sides of eq a 5 and taking the expectations for the full network yields a 6 e ψ i a p r i e ε i b k 1 n
