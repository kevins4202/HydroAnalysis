concern especially for providing drinking water there are many ways to improve the quality of contaminated aquifers that need to be assessed by considering aquifer condition a strategy in this study is proposed to remove recharging contamination sources into an aquifer by a hydraulic system the present study proposes a framework for assessing the performance of a hydraulic removing system of

quality of the aquifer over the next 12 years results showed that construction of the hydraulic system would reduce infiltration water with of tds 13 000 mg l from shurab river into the semnan aquifer this would improve the quality of the aquifer and reduce tds levels by 20 in wells around the river over the next 12 years in addition the quality improvement index would increase by 6 until the august 2025 indicating improvement of aquifer quality by constructing the hydraulic system however complete elimination of this contamination would require a very long time about 30 years the proposed

chloride and nitrate anions in coastal aquifers would eventually result in changing the cropping pattern to growing salt resistant crop plants prediction of the status of the contaminants by 2020 also showed that pollutants would decrease if the river flowed for 90 days in a year vetrimurugan et al 2017 in all these reports and articles emphasized the role played by qualitative simulation of aquifers in assessing groundwater quantity and quality review of conducted studies in recent years shows that all of them examined the impact of structural measures on the quality of groundwater resources through field and laboratory methods and investigated various indices like tds ec 3 3 electrical conductivity and nitrate quality of these sources was studied using gms software application and modflow and mt3d models and the studies which investigated effects of hydraulic structures employed field and laboratory methods since assessment of structural strategy for improving water quality of aquifers costs considerably it is necessary to propose a framework for assessing the impact of construction of a hydraulic removal system on aquifer quality which is an important innovation in this research for the first time this research studied effects of constructing a hydraulic removal system that prevented entry and penetration of water into an aquifer using gms software for the next 12 years the effects of structural measure in this study were assessed using the mt3d qualitative model and simulation of the total dissolved solids tds the results of this study can offer substantial aid in the comprehensive qualitative management of aquifers that receive water from saline rivers in order to prevent salinization of aquifers 2 materials and methods the present research aimed to both provide a qualitative and quantitative model of groundwater and investigate the effect of the pollutant water reduction scenario the construction of a hydraulic system for obstruction and diversion of the pollutant flow of hot springs due to the effect the hydraulic removal system on the semnan aquifer its site was selected as a boundary of the study area furthermore the eastern and northern parts of the aquifer are considered as the boundary of groundwater inflow and the southern part as the boundary of groundwater outflow regarding flow direction in the aquifer these boundaries were determined by considering water level in observation wells the research stages are shown in fig 1 as shown in this figure the effect that the pollutant water reduction scenario was studied for future period too 2 1 study area the study area is located in the northwestern part of the dasht e kavir in semnan province iran at the longitude from 53 8 to 53 80 n and latitude from 35 13 to 35 80 asaraab 2016 the total area of this region is about 2150 9 km2 and about 746 8 km2 of which consists of plains and the rest of highlands according to climate classification this area is considered an arid region with a long term average annual rainfall of 167 1 mm and the annual mean temperature is 15 2 c fig 2 depicts the geographic position of the semnan aquifer hot water springs the hydraulic system and transmission lines the type of aquifer is unconfined furthermore in the northern heights of the study area dolomite limestone units of the elika formation have been expanded which are valuable in terms of hydrology and in other area there is alluvial fan that is effective in the recharging the aquifer the recharge area is located in the south of aquifer and the accumulation of operation wells in the northwest part of the aquifer the gradient of groundwater shows that the flow direction is from the aquifer s inflow toward to the east northeast the center of the aquifer and then to the south the aquifer s outflow according to 2010 2011 data groundwater level in 1994 was 1051 06 m above sea level but gradually declined to 1038 84 m in september 2011 these records show that the reservoir deficit is 12 22 million m 4 4 modular transport 3 dimensional multi species model in addition the groundwater level in the semnan aquifer shows a mean annual reduction of 0 72 m during this period according to available data there are 32 observation wells and 352 exploitation wells in the various parts of the semnan plain 2 2 the hydraulic system since it is situated in a dry area the semnan plain lacks a permanent river and only the seasonal river shurab which forms from the confluence of the golroudbar and abgarm rivers flows into the semnan aquifer the abgarm river receives its water from upstream of the catchment area therefore it contains considerable amounts of salts from hot springs in the upstream of the river when it joins the golroudbar river the high tds level of the abgarm river influences the water in the shurab river and reduces its quality the high salinity of the abgarm river and recharging from the river into the semnan aquifer increases the concentration of the tds index in the aquifer table 3 shows the initial tds values in 2013 in order to reduce the concentration of tds a hydraulic removal system was constructed in order to eliminate the saline water recharging by abgarm river according to the latest technical reports about 20 of the water in the shurab river water has penetrated into the groundwater and its low quality has had negative impacts on the aquifer company 2007 since this aquifer is considered a strategic source of drinking water for semnan city its salinization will negatively affect the people in this region hence an efficient hydraulic system for obstruction of flow from abgarm river s hot springs was designed and constructed to improve water quality and prevent recharging saline water into the aquifer this hydraulic system consists of a hybrid underground and diversion dam that both prevents the flow from the abgarm river and diverts it to a transmission pipeline and transfers saline water of the hot springs out of the aquifer company 2012 fig 3 shows a view of the hydraulic system the hydraulic system has been designed in a way as to both remove base water with high contamination level 600 000 m3 year through a 13 km long pipeline and make it possible for 4 5 million m3 year high quality floodwater to flow into the river s downstream fig 2 2 3 aquifer conceptual modeling modflow code in gms 7 software package was employed to simulate semnan aquifer in this study information needed for modeling of the aquifer including data of exploitation and observation wells precipitation topography bedrock and inflow and outflow boundaries transmissivity using the pumping test was obtained from semnan regional water company table 1 groundwater level data are monthly and are recorded monthly by regional provincial water authority the consistency in these data had been checked by regional provincial water authority before delivering to authors transmissivity map constructed using observed data transmissivity data is achieved by using pumping test by semnan provincial water authority table 1 to insert information into the model the transmissivity map change to the hydraulic conductivity map because the modflow model requires the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer in steady state hydraulic conductivity was calibrated with trial and error method in october 2010 topographic map was a gis file dem which was used in determining the aquifer according to this map the northern and northeastern parts of the aquifer have the highest elevation the elevation decreases by move toward the south and finally the southern part has the lowest elevation the network used in this study sized 1000 1000 m seventeen of the wells in the region were reliable fig 4 a groundwater direction in the semnan aquifer generally flows from the north and northeast towards the center and then to the south due to the very large number of exploitation wells and excessive water extraction from them the central part of the aquifer draws the recharged water towards itself first and then the water moves towards the outflow located in its southern part to perform simulation and estimate the calibrated values for hydraulic conductivity and coefficient of aquifer storage the data of september 2010 was used for modeling the steady state and the data from november 2010 to september 2012 for modeling the unsteady state in the steady state the hydraulic conductivity k was calibrated by method of a trial and error and in the unsteady state the specific storage coefficient s was calibrated by pest method furthermore in the verification phase using 6 month continuous modeling we assured calibration accuracy in a steady and unsteady state in addition the data from november 2012 to april 2013 were used to verify the model to build a conceptual model and simulate the tds in the aquifer quality data of the sample wells which were obtained from the semnan provincial water authority were used table 1 the quantitative and qualitative data for a tension period of two years with 6 month time step were employed in the simulation by the mt3d model from november 2010 to september 2012 table 1 2 4 the applied management scenario to reduce the salinity of the semnan aquifer the scenario of reducing 600 000 m3 year of the inflow from the abgarm river and transferring it to the desert through a pipeline was studied company 2012 in addition a new indicator was introduced to investigate and evaluate the effect of the hydraulic system on the aquifer quality this new qualitative improvement indicator μ which shows the qualitative performance of the aquifer after the removal of contaminated water is calculated by using equation 1 1 μ 1 t d s a f t e r t d s a c c e p t a b l e t d s b e f o r e t d s a c c e p t a b l e where tds before denotes tds before the establishment of the hydraulic system tds after denotes tds value 12 years after the establishment of the hydraulic system and tds acceptable the standard tds value for drinking water based on who 90 ppm 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration and verification of the quantitative model in steady state the data of oct 2010 were used in this stage hydraulic conductivity was calibrated using the trial and error method in addition 24 monthly time steps were used from november 2010 to september 2012 for unsteady modeling and the specific yield was calibrated in this stage fig 4b shows the groundwater level after calibration in the unsteady state the groundwater level in the northern and northeastern part of the aquifer is higher and this will lead to the movement of water from this part to the central part with lower water levels and eventually towards the southern part of the aquifer and the excess water outflows from southern part hydraulic conductivity is one of the hydrodynamic properties of saturated section that plays a significant role in water flow in the aquifer fig 4c indicates the hydraulic conductivity in the semnan aquifer in the inflow section of the northeastern and eastern parts of this aquifer hydraulic conductivity has the highest value because these areas have coarse grained alluvial as we move towards the central and southern parts hydraulic conductivity values will decrease because the soil texture in these parts is fine grained fig 4d shows the specific storage coefficient given the aquifer s sedimentology this coefficient was calibrated from 0 1 in the upstream up to 0 03 in the downstream for the model after conducting the calibrations the errors in each step were checked to ensure the correct performance of the model table 2 indicates the errors in the steady and unsteady states calibration and the verification phases the mean square error of the model was less than 59 cm in the steady state and less than 132 cm in the non steady state since the goal of simulation of the aquifer is to predict its quantitative and qualitative status in the future conducting the verification step is necessary in order ensure the model s accurate performance a verification interval depends on the aquifer type given the data collection limitations in the area the verification interval in this aquifer was considered six months from october 2012 to march 2013 the mean square error in this stage was less than 1 39 m and the results of the verification of the model indicate the model s acceptable performance kardan et al 2017 sami et al 2018 sheikhipour et al 2018 the acceptable verification results of groundwater level indicate model accuracy in the calibration stage fig 5 shows the results of the model s verification for six months moreover the verification results indicate a strong correlation between the observed and the simulated values for groundwater levels the points around the perfect line indicate the acceptable performance of the model in quantitative state 3 2 calibration of the qualitative model tds of groundwater is simulated qualitative modeling of the aquifer for two years 2010 2012 using the mt3d model kardan et al 2017 mesmarian et al 2016 after calibrating the model it was verified for 6 months october 2012 april 2013 and then the tds was predicted for 12 years the shurab river in the semnan aquifer had recharged high saline water into the central and southern parts of the aquifer and had increased the tds index in it fig 6 indicates the location of the wells and the qualitative zoning of the tds index of semnan aquifer before the construction of the hydraulic system in the northern parts of the aquifer the tds is low and these areas have a desirable quality however the southern part has the highest tds level and the worst quality this reveals the effect of the water entering from the shurab river which flows from the western part to the southern part since the direction of groundwater flow is from the eastern and northeastern parts towards the central and the southern area the presence of pollutants in the southern parts will not transmit pollution to the northern parts table 2 shows the error of the qualitative model in the calibration stage the mean square error in the qualitative calibration stage was less than 72 m which can be considered as the acceptable performance of the model ghobadian and bahrami 2017 lalezari and karachian 2017 3 3 prediction of aquifer water quality after construction of the hydraulic system the scenario introduced in the present research is the reduction of pollutant water recharging from the shurab river company 2012 as can be seen in fig 6 the water quality of the semnan aquifer in the central and southern parts where the shurab river flows on it has low quality this shows that the river s flow has greatly contributes to the aquifer s contamination since this aquifer is important for the water supply of semnan city a hydraulic system was constructed to improve the current situation the results of predicted tds for future period indicate improvement of the aquifer condition implementation of the system has had considerable effect on the exploitation wells near the shurab river and no significant change can be observed in the other wells fig 7 shows the qualitative zoning of the tds index after 12 years of using the system as shown in the figure the largest decrease in the concentration of tds index is observed in the aquifer s western part the place where shurab river enters to the aquifer zone and in its surrounding areas however the concentration of the tds index in the central and southern parts are still higher than those of other parts of the aquifer fig 8 represents the changes in the tds index in the wells around shurab river from april 2013 to august 2025 as shown in this figure the trend in the variations of the tds index in the all wells are the same the cumulative changes in the diagrams represent the concentration of the tds index in the absence of a hydraulic system it shows the increasing trend in the accumulation of the contaminants it has a seasonal and sinusoidal variations in addition descending diagrams represent the trend of variations in the tds index if the hydraulic system is constructed the values of this index decreases annually the reduction percentage in tds value is used in order to better assess the variations caused by the construction of the hydraulic system this percentage stands for the ratio of in tds concentration with the construction of the system to the tds concentration without the construction of the system table 3 represents the status of qualitative exploitation wells around the shurab river the reduction percentage in this table shows the highest reduction in the tds concentration will happen in the wells around shurab river in the year 2025 as shown in this table the largest reductions are in wells number 12 and 11 about 19 and 18 8 respectively these two wells are located near the entrance of shurab river into the aquifer the smallest reductions about 6 1 is for well number 7 which is far away from the rest of the wells close to the entrance point of the shurab river into the aquifer after quantitative and qualitative calibration tds concentration was predicted in the wells around the shurab river several years after the construction of a hydraulic removal system the concentration of tds in these wells has decreased in order to see significant change in the concentration of tds in these wells the prediction has been conducted for 12 years after 12 years of prediction the concentration of the tds in these wells has decreased by several percentages in the area close to the river a comparison has been made for assessing the impact of hydraulic removal system on the tds concentration in october 2025 at best tds concentration will be declining by 19 in well no 12 by using the hydraulic removal system for 12 years in 2025 nevertheless the positive result of the construction of the hydraulic system in the semnan aquifer is evident if this hydraulic system was not constructed the tds value would increase annually and it seems it would be impossible to improve it since considering the current water deficit the water issue will become more apparent in the coming years loss of an important and strategic water resource will be a great crisis although it cost a lot to construct such a system the results obtained from its construction would be satisfactory and would reduce future expenditures in the water treatment sector fig 9 shows the comographs of the wells around the shurab river to better observe the results and effects of constructing the current structure we drew a comographic diagram of the wells around the river this diagram represents the general improvement in the aquifer status as can be observed if the current situation continues over the next 12 years the variations in the tds index concentration will exhibit a cumulative trend and follow a sinusoidal function however by the construction of hydraulic system and transferring contaminated water through the pipeline out of the aquifer area the variations in the tds index concentration during the next 12 years will show a decreasing trend without seasonal fluctuations the qualitative improvement index μ was obtained from equation 1 and fig 10 shows the changes in it if the scenario of construction of the system is implemented this diagram represents the variations in the water quality of the semnan aquifer during the 12 year period after construction of the hydraulic system from april 2013 to august 2025 as shown the variation in the qualitative improvement index is ascending with seasonal fluctuations this variation represents the positive impacts of the construction of the hydraulic system which has consistently reduced the tds index in the aquifer as mentioned above the present study investigated the future quality of the semnan aquifer in the presence of the hydraulic system scenario by introducing a qualitative index as well as employing numerical modeling most previous studies just studied the present and future quality of aquifers and did not pay much attention to assessing the construction of structures for reducing or eliminate contaminators ghobadian et al 2016 vetrimurugan et al 2017 ghoraba et al 2013 in this study impact of reducing an aquifer s salinity was investigated for the first time by employing a structural measure the results indicate that most of the effects of this structural action were observed in the areas adjacent to the river and the construction of this structure did not guarantee salinity reduction in the entire aquifer furthermore given the results of this study the time needed for a tangible reduction in the salinity in the aquifer is about 12 years which is a relatively long time on the other hand the cost of constructing the structure is about 500 000 which is expensive for a developing country like iran thus to save on the relatively high cost and time required for constructing such a structure managerial measures should be applied for same cases to prevent the contamination of aquifers 4 conclusion in the current study quantitative and qualitative modeling of the semnan aquifer was examined and analyzed by using a mathematical model in order to determine the effects of constructing a hydraulically contaminant removing system on aquifer quantity and quality main conclusions of this study can be summarized as follows without construction of the hydraulic system the aquifer would face with a cumulative increase in tds concentration in next 12 years especially in the central and southern areas where the shurab river with its high salinity level recharges the aquifer zone construction of the hydraulic system would omit recharging contaminated water from hot springs into the aquifer and would drop the tds concentration trend in following years particularly in the wells around the shurab river the largest tds reduction caused by construction of the hydraulic system would be about 19 and the smallest reduction would about 6 1 in this study also it was shown that it would take 12 years for a tangible reduction in salinity by the high cost hydraulic system hence the management methods for improving aquifer quality should be considered along with structural methods in similar cases due to its high concentration the total removal of the contaminant will need a long time about 60 years of course most strategies for removal of pollutants in groundwater aquifers costs high investment and considerable time finally the results of this research show that construction of the proposed hydraulic systems will be capable of improving quality of similar aquifers and also the proposed framework can be used in similar cases for the assessment of systems impacts

showed that pollutants would decrease if the river flowed for 90 days in a year vetrimurugan et al 2017 in all these reports and articles emphasized the role played by qualitative simulation of aquifers in assessing groundwater quantity and quality review of conducted studies in recent years shows that all of them examined the impact of structural measures on the quality of groundwater resources through field and laboratory methods and investigated various indices like tds ec 3 3 electrical conductivity and nitrate quality of these sources was studied using gms software application and modflow and mt3d models and the studies which investigated effects of hydraulic structures employed field and laboratory methods since assessment of structural strategy for improving water quality of aquifers costs considerably it is necessary to propose a framework for assessing the impact of construction of a hydraulic removal system on aquifer quality which is an important innovation in this research for the first time this research studied effects of constructing a hydraulic removal system that prevented entry and penetration of water into an aquifer using gms software for the next 12 years the effects of structural measure in this study were assessed using the mt3d qualitative model and simulation of the total dissolved solids tds the results of this study can offer substantial aid in the comprehensive qualitative management of aquifers that receive water from saline rivers in order to prevent salinization of aquifers 2 materials and methods the present research aimed to both provide a qualitative and quantitative model of groundwater and investigate the effect of the pollutant water reduction scenario the construction of a hydraulic system for obstruction and diversion of the pollutant flow of hot springs due to the effect the hydraulic removal system on the semnan aquifer its site was selected as a boundary of the study area furthermore the eastern and northern parts of the aquifer are considered as the boundary of groundwater inflow and the southern part as the boundary of groundwater outflow regarding flow direction in the aquifer these boundaries were determined by considering water level in observation wells the research stages are shown in fig 1 as shown in this figure the effect that the pollutant water reduction scenario was studied for future period too 2 1 study area the study area is located in the northwestern part of the dasht e kavir in semnan province iran at the longitude from 53 8 to 53 80 n and latitude from 35 13 to 35 80 asaraab 2016 the total area of this region is about 2150 9 km2 and about 746 8 km2 of which consists of plains and the rest of highlands according to climate classification this area is considered an arid region with a long term average annual rainfall of 167 1 mm and the annual mean temperature is 15 2 c fig 2 depicts the geographic position of the semnan aquifer hot water springs the hydraulic system and transmission lines the type of aquifer is unconfined furthermore in the northern heights of the study area dolomite limestone units of the elika formation have been expanded which are valuable in terms of hydrology and in other area there is alluvial fan that is effective in the recharging the aquifer the recharge area is located in the south of aquifer and the accumulation of operation wells in the northwest part of the aquifer the gradient of groundwater shows that the flow direction is from the aquifer s inflow toward to the east northeast the center of the aquifer and then to the south the aquifer s outflow according to 2010 2011 data groundwater level in 1994 was 1051 06 m above sea level but gradually declined to 1038 84 m in september 2011 these records show that the reservoir deficit is 12 22 million m 4 4 modular transport 3 dimensional multi species model in addition the groundwater level in the semnan aquifer shows a mean annual reduction of 0 72 m during this period according to available data there are 32 observation wells and 352 exploitation wells in the various parts of the semnan plain 2 2 the hydraulic system since it is situated in a dry area the semnan plain lacks a permanent river and only the seasonal river shurab which forms from the confluence of the golroudbar and abgarm rivers flows into the semnan aquifer the abgarm river receives its water from upstream of the catchment area therefore it contains considerable amounts of salts from hot springs in the upstream of the river when it joins the golroudbar river the high tds level of the abgarm river influences the water in the shurab river and reduces its quality the high salinity of the abgarm river and recharging from the river into the semnan aquifer increases the concentration of the tds index in the aquifer table 3 shows the initial tds values in 2013 in order to reduce the concentration of tds a hydraulic removal system was constructed in order to eliminate the saline water recharging by abgarm river according to the latest technical reports about 20 of the water in the shurab river water has penetrated into the groundwater and its low quality has had negative impacts on the aquifer company 2007 since this aquifer is considered a strategic source of drinking water for semnan city its salinization will negatively affect the people in this region hence an efficient hydraulic system for obstruction of flow from abgarm river s hot springs was designed and constructed to improve water quality and prevent recharging saline water into the aquifer this hydraulic system consists of a hybrid underground and diversion dam that both prevents the flow from the abgarm river and diverts it to a transmission pipeline and transfers saline water of the hot springs out of the aquifer company 2012 fig 3 shows a view of the hydraulic system the hydraulic system has been designed in a way as to both remove base water with high contamination level 600 000 m3 year through a 13 km long pipeline and make it possible for 4 5 million m3 year high quality floodwater to flow into the river s downstream fig 2 2 3 aquifer conceptual modeling modflow code in gms 7 software package was employed to simulate semnan aquifer in this study information needed for modeling of the aquifer including data of exploitation and observation wells precipitation topography bedrock and inflow and outflow boundaries transmissivity using the pumping test was obtained from semnan regional water company table 1 groundwater level data are monthly and are recorded monthly by regional provincial water authority the consistency in these data had been checked by regional provincial water authority before delivering to authors transmissivity map constructed using observed data transmissivity data is achieved by using pumping test by semnan provincial water authority table 1 to insert information into the model the transmissivity map change to the hydraulic conductivity map because the modflow model requires the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer in steady state hydraulic conductivity was calibrated with trial and error method in october 2010 topographic map was a gis file dem which was used in determining the aquifer according to this map the northern and northeastern parts of the aquifer have the highest elevation the elevation decreases by move toward the south and finally the southern part has the lowest elevation the network used in this study sized 1000 1000 m seventeen of the wells in the region were reliable fig 4 a groundwater direction in the semnan aquifer generally flows from the north and northeast towards the center and then to the south due to the very large number of exploitation wells and excessive water extraction from them the central part of the aquifer draws the recharged water towards itself first and then the water moves towards the outflow located in its southern part to perform simulation and estimate the calibrated values for hydraulic conductivity and coefficient of aquifer storage the data of september 2010 was used for modeling the steady state and the data from november 2010 to september 2012 for modeling the unsteady state in the steady state the hydraulic conductivity k was calibrated by method of a trial and error and in the unsteady state the specific storage coefficient s was calibrated by pest method furthermore in the verification phase using 6 month continuous modeling we assured calibration accuracy in a steady and unsteady state in addition the data from november 2012 to april 2013 were used to verify the model to build a conceptual model and simulate the tds in the aquifer quality data of the sample wells which were obtained from the semnan provincial water authority were used table 1 the quantitative and qualitative data for a tension period of two years with 6 month time step were employed in the simulation by the mt3d model from november 2010 to september 2012 table 1 2 4 the applied management scenario to reduce the salinity of the semnan aquifer the scenario of reducing 600 000 m3 year of the inflow from the abgarm river and transferring it to the desert through a pipeline was studied company 2012 in addition a new indicator was introduced to investigate and evaluate the effect of the hydraulic system on the aquifer quality this new qualitative improvement indicator μ which shows the qualitative performance of the aquifer after the removal of contaminated water is calculated by using equation 1 1 μ 1 t d s a f t e r t d s a c c e p t a b l e t d s b e f o r e t d s a c c e p t a b l e where tds before denotes tds before the establishment of the hydraulic system tds after denotes tds value 12 years after the establishment of the hydraulic system and tds acceptable the standard tds value for drinking water based on who 90 ppm 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration and verification of the quantitative model in steady state the data of oct 2010 were used in this stage hydraulic conductivity was calibrated using the trial and error method in addition 24 monthly time steps were used from november 2010 to september 2012 for unsteady modeling and the specific yield was calibrated in this stage fig 4b shows the groundwater level after calibration in the unsteady state the groundwater level in the northern and northeastern part of the aquifer is higher and this will lead to the movement of water from this part to the central part with lower water levels and eventually towards the southern part of the aquifer and the excess water outflows from southern part hydraulic conductivity is one of the hydrodynamic properties of saturated section that plays a significant role in water flow in the aquifer fig 4c indicates the hydraulic conductivity in the semnan aquifer in the inflow section of the northeastern and eastern parts of this aquifer hydraulic conductivity has the highest value because these areas have coarse grained alluvial as we move towards the central and southern parts hydraulic conductivity values will decrease because the soil texture in these parts is fine grained fig 4d shows the specific storage coefficient given the aquifer s sedimentology this coefficient was calibrated from 0 1 in the upstream up to 0 03 in the downstream for the model after conducting the calibrations the errors in each step were checked to ensure the correct performance of the model table 2 indicates the errors in the steady and unsteady states calibration and the verification phases the mean square error of the model was less than 59 cm in the steady state and less than 132 cm in the non steady state since the goal of simulation of the aquifer is to predict its quantitative and qualitative status in the future conducting the verification step is necessary in order ensure the model s accurate performance a verification interval depends on the aquifer type given the data collection limitations in the area the verification interval in this aquifer was considered six months from october 2012 to march 2013 the mean square error in this stage was less than 1 39 m and the results of the verification of the model indicate the model s acceptable performance kardan et al 2017 sami et al 2018 sheikhipour et al 2018 the acceptable verification results of groundwater level indicate model accuracy in the calibration stage fig 5 shows the results of the model s verification for six months moreover the verification results indicate a strong correlation between the observed and the simulated values for groundwater levels the points around the perfect line indicate the acceptable performance of the model in quantitative state 3 2 calibration of the qualitative model tds of groundwater is simulated qualitative modeling of the aquifer for two years 2010 2012 using the mt3d model kardan et al 2017 mesmarian et al 2016 after calibrating the model it was verified for 6 months october 2012 april 2013 and then the tds was predicted for 12 years the shurab river in the semnan aquifer had recharged high saline water into the central and southern parts of the aquifer and had increased the tds index in it fig 6 indicates the location of the wells and the qualitative zoning of the tds index of semnan aquifer before the construction of the hydraulic system in the northern parts of the aquifer the tds is low and these areas have a desirable quality however the southern part has the highest tds level and the worst quality this reveals the effect of the water entering from the shurab river which flows from the western part to the southern part since the direction of groundwater flow is from the eastern and northeastern parts towards the central and the southern area the presence of pollutants in the southern parts will not transmit pollution to the northern parts table 2 shows the error of the qualitative model in the calibration stage the mean square error in the qualitative calibration stage was less than 72 m which can be considered as the acceptable performance of the model ghobadian and bahrami 2017 lalezari and karachian 2017 3 3 prediction of aquifer water quality after construction of the hydraulic system the scenario introduced in the present research is the reduction of pollutant water recharging from the shurab river company 2012 as can be seen in fig 6 the water quality of the semnan aquifer in the central and southern parts where the shurab river flows on it has low quality this shows that the river s flow has greatly contributes to the aquifer s contamination since this aquifer is important for the water supply of semnan city a hydraulic system was constructed to improve the current situation the results of predicted tds for future period indicate improvement of the aquifer condition implementation of the system has had considerable effect on the exploitation wells near the shurab river and no significant change can be observed in the other wells fig 7 shows the qualitative zoning of the tds index after 12 years of using the system as shown in the figure the largest decrease in the concentration of tds index is observed in the aquifer s western part the place where shurab river enters to the aquifer zone and in its surrounding areas however the concentration of the tds index in the central and southern parts are still higher than those of other parts of the aquifer fig 8 represents the changes in the tds index in the wells around shurab river from april 2013 to august 2025 as shown in this figure the trend in the variations of the tds index in the all wells are the same the cumulative changes in the diagrams represent the concentration of the tds index in the absence of a hydraulic system it shows the increasing trend in the accumulation of the contaminants it has a seasonal and sinusoidal variations in addition descending diagrams represent the trend of variations in the tds index if the hydraulic system is constructed the values of this index decreases annually the reduction percentage in tds value is used in order to better assess the variations caused by the construction of the hydraulic system this percentage stands for the ratio of in tds concentration with the construction of the system to the tds concentration without the construction of the system table 3 represents the status of qualitative exploitation wells around the shurab river the reduction percentage in this table shows the highest reduction in the tds concentration will happen in the wells around shurab river in the year 2025 as shown in this table the largest reductions are in wells number 12 and 11 about 19 and 18 8 respectively these two wells are located near the entrance of shurab river into the aquifer the smallest reductions about 6 1 is for well number 7 which is far away from the rest of the wells close to the entrance point of the shurab river into the aquifer after quantitative and qualitative calibration tds concentration was predicted in the wells around the shurab river several years after the construction of a hydraulic removal system the concentration of tds in these wells has decreased in order to see significant change in the concentration of tds in these wells the prediction has been conducted for 12 years after 12 years of prediction the concentration of the tds in these wells has decreased by several percentages in the area close to the river a comparison has been made for assessing the impact of hydraulic removal system on the tds concentration in october 2025 at best tds concentration will be declining by 19 in well no 12 by using the hydraulic removal system for 12 years in 2025 nevertheless the positive result of the construction of the hydraulic system in the semnan aquifer is evident if this hydraulic system was not constructed the tds value would increase annually and it seems it would be impossible to improve it since considering the current water deficit the water issue will become more apparent in the coming years loss of an important and strategic water resource will be a great crisis although it cost a lot to construct such a system the results obtained from its construction would be satisfactory and would reduce future expenditures in the water treatment sector fig 9 shows the comographs of the wells around the shurab river to better observe the results and effects of constructing the current structure we drew a comographic diagram of the wells around the river this diagram represents the general improvement in the aquifer status as can be observed if the current situation continues over the next 12 years the variations in the tds index concentration will exhibit a cumulative trend and follow a sinusoidal function however by the construction of hydraulic system and transferring contaminated water through the pipeline out of the aquifer area the variations in the tds index concentration during the next 12 years will show a decreasing trend without seasonal fluctuations the qualitative improvement index μ was obtained from equation 1 and fig 10 shows the changes in it if the scenario of construction of the system is implemented this diagram represents the variations in the water quality of the semnan aquifer during the 12 year period after construction of the hydraulic system from april 2013 to august 2025 as shown the variation in the qualitative improvement index is ascending with seasonal fluctuations this variation represents the positive impacts of the construction of the hydraulic system which has consistently reduced the tds index in the aquifer as mentioned above the present study investigated the future quality of the semnan aquifer in the presence of the hydraulic system scenario by introducing a qualitative index as well as employing numerical modeling most previous studies just studied the present and future quality of aquifers and did not pay much attention to assessing the construction of structures for reducing or eliminate contaminators ghobadian et al 2016 vetrimurugan et al 2017 ghoraba et al 2013 in this study impact of reducing an aquifer s salinity was investigated for the first time by employing a structural measure the results indicate that most of the effects of this structural action were observed in the areas adjacent to the river and the construction of this structure did not guarantee salinity reduction in the entire aquifer furthermore given the results of this study the time needed for a tangible reduction in the salinity in the aquifer is about 12 years which is a relatively long time on the other hand the cost of constructing the structure is about 500 000 which is expensive for a developing country like iran thus to save on the relatively high cost and time required for constructing such a structure managerial measures should be applied for same cases to prevent the contamination of aquifers 4 conclusion in the current study quantitative and qualitative modeling of the semnan aquifer was examined and analyzed by using a mathematical model in order to determine the effects of constructing a hydraulically contaminant removing system on aquifer quantity and quality main conclusions of this study can be summarized as follows without construction of the hydraulic system the aquifer would face with a cumulative increase in tds concentration in next 12 years especially in the central and southern areas where the shurab river with its high salinity level recharges the aquifer zone construction of the hydraulic system would omit recharging contaminated water from hot springs into the aquifer and would drop the tds concentration trend in following years particularly in the wells around the shurab river the largest tds reduction caused by construction of the hydraulic system would be about 19 and the smallest reduction would about 6 1 in this study also it was shown that it would take 12 years for a tangible reduction in salinity by the high cost hydraulic system hence the management methods for improving aquifer quality should be considered along with structural methods in similar cases due to its high concentration the total removal of the contaminant will need a long time about 60 years of course most strategies for removal of pollutants in groundwater aquifers costs high investment and considerable time finally the results of this research show that construction of the proposed hydraulic systems will be capable of improving quality of similar aquifers and also the proposed framework can be used in similar cases for the assessment of systems impacts 
12136,the north western part of india has been affected by severe ground water depletion in this study an attempt has been made to assess potential ground water recharge of north west nw india and its comparison with gravity recovery and climate experiment grace gravity anomaly based monsoonal groundwater storage change an assessment of potential groundwater recharge was done in terms of terrain suitability for groundwater recharge and average monsoonal recharge terrain suitability was assessed based on hydrogeology and terrain parameters which were then integrated with the spatial variability in monsoonal recharge expressed as the surface water column available for underground infiltration the average monsoonal groundwater storage gws change was derived from grace terrestrial water storage tws change an evaluation of potential groundwater recharge vs terrain suitability for groundwater recharge and potential groundwater recharge vs monsoonal grace gws change shows that there is high terrain suitability but low potential groundwater recharge in the north western part of nw india essentially due to very low precipitation in the north western part terrain suitability is high primarily due to the presence of sandy alluvium deeper sandy loam soil and flat terrain the remaining alluvial plains lithologically covered by unconsolidated sediments with loamy silty sand or clayey loamy silty sand soils show moderate terrain suitability rainfall induced surface water infiltration capacity is high in upper ganga drainage basin and in major parts of narmada drainage basin but low to very low in luni ghaggar drainage basin and in major parts of yamuna and chambal drainage basins the average monsoonal grace gws change is low in the north western part of nw india which is in agreement with potential groundwater recharge scenario the comparison between precipitation terrain infiltration potential and grace gravity based average groundwater storage observations

eastern parts of punjab and himachal pradesh h p gujarat madhya pradesh m p and north western part of maharashtra we considered five major drainage basins of nw india such as upper ganga yamuna chambal luni ghaggar and narmada drainage basins as hydrological units for assessing groundwater recharge scenario in the region fig 1b in general the nw india is divided into three physiographic zones such as indo gangetic plain in north and east deccan plateau in south and west and thar desert in west the region receives moderate to low rainfall and essentially during the monsoon season june october during the remaining period of the year the region remains more or less dry the extreme western part of the study area namely the western part of rajasthan state experiences very low rainfall 100 mm the major rock types in the study area include unconsolidated sediments sedimentary rocks igneous rocks and combination of igneous metamorphic and sedimentary rocks belonging to the geological groups and formations such as indo gangetic alluvium deccan trap and vindhyans indo gangetic alluvium consists of unconsolidated quaternary sediments comprising recent alluvium older alluvium and aeolian sediments the sediments are made of sands silts clays pebbles etc they form alluvial aquifers with high infiltration capacity high storage and transmissivity deccan trap consists of alternate layers of compact and vesicular basaltic lava flows and inter trappean clastic sedimentary beds it has in general low infiltration capacity low storage and transmissivity except for highly weathered fractured and vesicular basalts occurring in limited areas it has moderate infiltration storage and transmissivity vindhyan rocks consist of consolidated clastic and non clastic sedimentary and meta sedimentary rocks such as sandstone shale conglomerate limestone slate and quartzite with primary and or secondary porosity the vindhyan rocks are characterized by low to moderate infiltration capacity low to high storage and transmissivity depending on the availability of secondary porosity in addition to primary porosity of consolidated proterozoic sandstone and conglomerate the study area is characterized by a wide variety of soils such as alluvial soil desert soil sandy soil black soil and red soils a variety of geomorphological processes have been operated in the study area which lead to the development of diverse landforms such as fluvial landforms aeolian landforms volcanic landforms and structural landforms due to diverse climate and physiographic conditions diverse vegetation types including tropical dry deciduous forest tropical moist deciduous forest tropical semi evergreen forest tropical thorn forest sub tropical pine forest and littoral and swamp vegetation occur in the region isfr 2011 2 2 data preparation and analysis 2 2 1 earth observation eo data indian remote sensing irs resourcesat 2 advanced wide field sensor awifs multispectral data available in visible and near infrared vnir and short wave infrared swir bands were used for false colour composite fcc image generation the images with a spatial resolution of 56 m and a combined swath of 740 km were acquired during november december 2013 enhanced fcc images were used for refinement and updation of the existing thematic data layers such as geomorphology lithology and land use land cover maps to update the boundaries between lithological units to refine geomorphological classification scheme in terms of groundwater potential and to address lu lc dynamics in the study area 2 2 2 digital elevation model dem and terrain analysis data we used shuttle radar topography mission srtm 1 arc second approximately 30 m spatial resolution at equator dem available in 1 1 tiles usgs 2015 the dem represents a seamless and complete elevational surface of the earth after applying a number of post processing steps by the data provider and by spatial interpolation of the remaining no data regions the dem is available in geographic lat long projection system with the wgs84 horizontal datum and the egm96 vertical datum the relative vertical accuracy of the dem is reported to be 12 15 m which allows to achieve a digital terrain elevation data level 2 dted 2 land surface model and precise terrain related thematic data layers from the dem specific catchment area and topographic slope were determined using arcgis tools finally topographic wetness index twi map was generated using specific catchment area and topographic slope of the study area as follows twi ln specific catchment area slope fig 2 twi is a key element for identifying ground water recharge potential as it measures the effect of local topography on hydrological processes and describes the spatial distribution of soil moisture and surface saturation wilson and gallant 2000 2 2 3 geomorphology geomorphology describes earth surface processes and resulting landforms with emphasis on their shape size relief characteristics material composition spatial distribution and evolution geomorphology governs surface runoff groundwater recharge and discharge potential of the landforms as a function of their relief characteristics and material composition the existing geomorphological map 1 2 000 000 scale of geological survey of india gsi 2002 was used after needful updation and modification based on visual analysis of awifs standard fcc image the geomorphological classes were regrouped as a function of ground water recharge potential to obtain simplified applied geomorphological classes fig 3 the geomorphological classes in the study area were broadly combined into 3 groups 1 hills and plateau 2 plains and 3 valleys with an interface group between hills and plateau and plains namely slopes and badlands the geomorphological group hills and plateau comprises the geomorphological classes with higher elevations under hills as well as plateau the geomorphological group plains occupies more than 66 of the study area it comprises a diverse variety of geomorphological classes such as rocky terrace rocky desert planation surface with or without duricrust low lying flats ranns low lying salt deserts prodelta islands and lagoons alluvial plains and depositional terraces aeolian plains with sand dunes and sand sheets there are limited number of geomorphological classes under the geomorphological group valleys such as playas valleys and infilled valleys 2 2 4 lithology lithology or rock types describe hydrogeological characteristics in terms of porosity and permeability of rock materials to assess groundwater recharge potential loose unconsolidated sediments or alluvium generally possess high porosity and permeability and are therefore favourable for high level of groundwater recharge primary porosity is essentially found in clastic sedimentary rocks whereas secondary porosity may be observed in igneous metamorphic and sedimentary rocks due to mechanical processes such as brittle deformation and fracturing and or geochemical processes such as dissolution geologically younger sedimentary rocks have generally higher primary porosity than that of the same type of geologically older rocks because of lesser degree of compaction the lithological map of geological survey of india on 1 2 000 000 scale gsi 1998 was visually compared with awifs fcc image and the broad lithological formation contacts were updated various lithological classes were regrouped based on similar rock types and geological age as a function of their favourability for groundwater recharge the broad rock types include unconsolidated sediments or alluvium sedimentary rocks comprising clastic and non clastic rocks igneous rocks comprising ultrabasic ultramafic rocks intermediate basic rocks and granitic rocks a combination of igneous and metamorphic rocks and a combination of igneous metamorphic and sedimentary rocks and ophiolites among these unconsolidated quaternary sediments or alluvium occupies approximately 50 of the study area and primarily contributes groundwater recharge in the study area finally based on the similarity in hydrgeoological properties broad applied lithologic classes were made from a large number of lithological classes available in the study area fig 4 2 2 5 soil texture and soil depth soil texture and soil depth map of india prepared by national bureau of soil survey and land use planning nagpur india on 1 2 000 000 scale nbss lup 2002 was used in this study we regrouped a wide variety of soil texture classes into four broad classes in terms of groundwater recharge potential 1 fine texture e g clay loamy clay silty clay sandy clay sandy clay loam silty clay loam 2 medium texture e g loam silty loam silt sandy loam 3 coarse texture e g loamy sand sand and 4 others e g rocky outcrop built up with very coarse texture or without soil cover fig 5 a similarly we regrouped a wide range of soil depth into four classes 1 deep soil 50 cm 2 moderately deep soil 25 50 cm 3 shallow soil 10 25 cm and 4 others with very shallow 10 cm or no soil cover fig 5b finally the regrouped soil texture and soil depth classes were combined as a function of groundwater recharge potential in this process we obtained 3 major soil texture classes with their subclasses of soil depth except for the fourth class named as others class 2 2 6 land use land cover the land use land cover map was essentially adapted from agrawal et al 2003 and modified based on irs resourcesat 2 awifs multispectral data of november december 2013 in the study area 13 different types of land use land cover classes were mapped such as settlement wood or forest land good cover wood or forest land poor cover pasture range poor desert shrub poor meadow good meadow poor agriculture bare soil mangrove mud flat salt pan water body snow cover fig 6 except for water body snow cover the lu lc classes in the study area possess characteristically different groundwater recharge potential 2 2 7 rainfall daily and monthly precipitation data for the study area were generated by combining satellite based and ground based observations satellite based daily rainfall measurements with spatial resolution 0 25 0 25 was obtained from the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm a joint space mission of nasa usa and jaxa japan ground based rainfall data at 0 25 0 25 grid was obtained from the indian meteorological department imd 2014 the gridded rainfall data for the entire country was generated by imd by interpolating ground based rainfall measurements available from 6995 rainfall stations we used essentially imd rainfall data for those grids where one or more rainfall stations exist for the remaining grids we took weighted average correlation coefficient based weighted average between imd and trmm rainfall data of trmm and imd gridded rainfall data where both the data are available finally the combined product was passed through a 3 3 low pass median filter to smoothen sharp edges between neighbouring grids daily rainfall data at 0 25 0 25 grid was later used for run off estimation daily rainfall data was also used to obtain cumulative monthly rainfall during the observation period 2005 2012 2 2 8 runoff in the present study the scs runoff curve number method kent 1973 was adopted to calculate runoff from daily rainfall data at 0 25 0 25 spatial grids the curve number depends on the hydrologic soil group land use treatment and hydrologic condition the hydrologic soil groups land use treatment and slope maps were prepared from the soil map modified after nbss lup 2002 land use land cover map modified after agrawal et al 2003 and srtm 1 arc second dem 2 2 9 evapotranspiration evapotranspiration plays

4 0 0 in the present study mod 16 monthly et data was used after upscaling into 0 25 0 25 grids by resizing based on pixel aggregated averaging finally the volume of surface water available for underground infiltration was calculated by subtracting monthly runoff and monthly et from the monthly rainfall data products we used the average surface water column thickness in each grid 0 25 0 25 potentially available for underground infiltration during the monsoon fig 7 to translate terrain suitability for groundwater recharge map into potential groundwater recharge map of the nw india 2 2 10 soil moisture change in this study soil moisture data of global land data assimilation system gldas noah land surface model rodell and beaudoing 2007 https mirador gsfc nasa gov collections gldas noah025 m 001 shtml was used soil moisture is available in 4 layers first layer 0 10 cm second layer for 10 40 cm third layer 40 100 cm and fourth layer 100 200 cm by summing up the values in four layers the volumetric soil moisture volumetric soil water content was obtained soil moisture being a state function the monthly soil moisture change was estimated with respect to a long term average 2 2 11 grace gravity observation and tws change the grace satellite mission was launched by nasa and dlr for monitoring the earth s dynamic gravity field in terms of monthly gravity anomaly the gravity anomaly of the earth surface may be inverted to derive spatio temporal variation of mass and therefore terrestrial water storage tws change around the planet by measuring the changing distance between the two satellites and combining that with precise geocentric positions obtained from the onboard gps instruments the gravity anomaly over the earth s surface is produced grace level 2 monthly product consists of a series of spherical harmonic coefficients which describes the shape of the earth s gravity field the level 2 products are converted to level 3 products describing terrestrial water storage change in terms of the deviations from the series mean by averaging kernels e g wahr et al 1998 2004 seo et al 2006 swenson and wahr 2006 landerer and swenson 2012 terrestrial water storage tws represents a land surface state which may be compared with other hydrological states or water storage components of the land surface it is the sum of surface water storage groundwater storage soil moisture accumulated snow and plant canopy water storage however grace observation cannot provide an absolute measurement of tws but a relative measurement of the anomaly with respect to a long term average in the present study grace level 3 tws change data products available in 1 1 grids were used we downscaled the grace monthly tws change from 1 1 grids to 0 25 0 25 grids using high resolution eo based and in situ hydrological layers such as surface run off et soil moisture and groundwater level fluctuation data by linear regression based predictive analysis for presentation of the results we further downscaled grace monthly tws change data from 0 25 0 25 grids to 10 km 10 km grids by inverse distance weighted idw algorithm based statistical interpolation of grid centre values 2 3 spatial data integration the data layers used in this study were made available from different sources such as resourcesat 2 awifs eo data srtm dem geomorphology and lithological data from geological survey of india soil texture and soil depth data from nbsslup existing land use land cover map prepared from spot vegetation data trmm and imd rainfall based surface water column thickness available for underground infiltration and grace gravity based tws change data as a result the scale and projection systems are different those are not compatible for spatial comparison and integration all the derived data layers were reprojected into albers conical equal area projection and subsequently converted to raster layers with 10 km 10 km spatial grids for spatial comparison and integration 2 3 1 layer weight assignment for determination of layer weight we adopted analytic hierarchy process ahp saaty 1980 1994 2008 coyle 2004 saaty and vargas 2012 it is an effective tool for setting the priorities in a complex multi variate decision making problem based on a series of pairwise comparisons it overcomes the bias in the decision making to a great extent by ensuring consistency in the process the first step in this process is to construct a pair wise comparison matrix for all the elements such as topography or topographic wetness describing surface water flow accumulation per unit cell geomorphology lithology soil texture and soil depth and land use land cover those are contributing to terrain suitability for groundwater recharge in pair wise comparison an index from 1 to 9 indicates the degree of importance 1 equally important 1 2 somewhat more important moderate 3 3 much more important strong 5 4 very much more important very strong 7 5 absolutely more important extreme 9 and intermediate values 2 4 6 and 8 when some compromise is needed the basic principle of the rating scale is that if an element m is absolutely more important than another element n then n must be absolutely less important than m and the ratings for m and n would be 9 and 1 9 respectively thus for 5 layers a square reciprocal matrix a aij of order 5 is formed for aij 1 aij for i j and aii ajj 1 for all i and j equal to 1 to 5 the next step is the calculation of a list of the relative weights or eigen vectors such that aω λω where ω is said to be an eigen vector of order n 5 and λ is an eigen value the elements of the eigen vector of relative importance a is calculated as follows for each row multiply all the row elements and take the nth root of the product which is then divided by the sum sum of the nth root of the product of the row elements for all the rows the product aω vector with five elements gives five estimates of λ max by dividing the five elements of the product vector aω with the corresponding element of the eigen vector all the five estimates of λ max are always 5 else there has been error in the calculation finally the mean of these five estimates gives the value of λ max the difference between λ max and n is an indication of the inconsistency in the judgements therefore consistency index ci followed by consistency ratio cr are calculated to check inconsistency when the value of cr is zero the judgements are considered to be perfectly consistent in practice when cr is 0 1 the judgements are considered to be consistent and therefore trustworthy raharjo and endah 2006 2 3 2 class weight assignment individual class weightage for each of the data layers was determined on 1 9 linear scale based on their relative significance towards groundwater recharge for this purpose we first arranged the classes of a layer in terms of their relative significance to groundwater recharge and regrouped into hydrogeologically similar classes now based on the number of groups or categories in a data layer the entire 1 9 weight range was linearly distributed further depending on the number of classes in a group or category the weight range was linearly allocated based on next level criteria such as process of formation grain size geological age or degree of fracturing etc for lithology layer geomorphic process ruggedness slope or relative age of formation etc for geomorphology layer in this process the recharge potential behavior of different classes in a data layer becomes more or less linear and subjectivity in the weight scale is avoided the procedure for assigning class weightage for individual layers is elaborated below 2 3 3 integration of data layers finally the data layers were integrated by index overlay method using ahp based layer weights and knowledge based linear class weights to obtain integrated terrain suitability map of the study area for groundwater recharge fig 8 terrain suitability for groundwater recharge represents the capability of the study area for potential groundwater recharge but it does not take into account the availability of surface water column available for underground infiltration as a function of rainfall and terrain condition trmm and imd rainfall based monsoonal surface water column available for underground infiltration was therefore integrated with terrain suitability layer to obtain potential groundwater recharge during the observation period 3 results and discussion 3 1 terrain suitability for groundwater recharge terrain suitability for groundwater recharge was prepared using five terrain parameters such as topographic wetness index twi applied geomorphology lithology soil texture and depth and land use land cover of the study area by ahp based layer weights and linear class weights based on relative significance fig 8 it is observed that the terrain suitability for groundwater recharge is high in luni ghaggar drainage basin in the western part of the study area primarily due to the presence of sandy alluvium deeper sandy loam soil and flat terrain it is high in some patches of upper ganga and yamuna drainage basins covering valleys and infilled valleys besides a large part of the study area geomorphologically occupied by alluvial plain lithologically covered by unconsolidated sediments with loamy silty sand or clayey loamy silty sand soil types shows moderate terrain suitability for groundwater recharge the area dominantly falls under upper ganga and yamuna drainage basins covering u p haryana and ncr delhi northern part of luni ghaggar drainage basin and central part of chambal drainage basin covering western part of haryana southern part of punjab and eastern part of rajasthan states and sabarmati mahi narmada and tapi alluvial plains of narmada drainage basin covering parts of gujarat m p and maharashtra states the remaining area is occupied by adverse geomorphology such as hills and plateau or slopes and badlands adverse lithology such as igneous rocks or a combination of igneous metamorphic and sedimentary rocks adverse soil types such as rocky non soil or thin clayey loamy silty soil and unfavourable land covers the area shows fair to poor terrain suitability for groundwater recharge 3 2 potential groundwater recharge the monsoonal surface water column available for underground infiltration was integrated with the terrain suitability for groundwater recharge layer to obtain potential groundwater recharge in the study area for this purpose the surface water column available for underground infiltration during the monsoon was rescaled into 1 9 linear scale similar to terrain suitability for groundwater recharge layer the two layers were integrated as an algebraic product raised to the power γ and 1 γ as follows bonham carter 1994 1 μ a γ b 1 γ where μ represents the integrated value of two layer variables a and b e g terrain suitability for groundwater recharge and surface water column available for underground infiltration and the value of γ operator varies in the range of 0 1 0 9 to consider the effect of extreme values in the integration product for example where one of the variables say layer a is very low rescaled values 1 3 and the other variable is sufficiently high rescaled values 3 9 the effect of the variable a becomes critical and we assume γ 0 9 0 7 for layer a and 1 γ 0 1 0 3 for layer b respectively but where both the variables are very low rescaled values 1 3 or both the variables are sufficiently high rescaled values 3 9 the effect of the variables will be essentially governed by their values and we assume γ 1 γ 0 5 bonham carter 1994 marjanovic and caha 2011 finally we obtained potential groundwater recharge map of the study area fig 9 it is observed that potential groundwater recharge is high in the major part of upper ganga drainage basin covering u p and uttarakhand states excluding the northern hilly region of uttarakhand and south eastern part of u p and in parts of narmada drainage basin covering narmada mahi sabarmati alluvial plains in m p and gujarat it is also found to be high in the northern part of yamuna drainage basin covering south western part of uttarakhand state essentially due to high rainfall and therefore high surface water column available for underground infiltration potential groundwater recharge is found to be low in luni ghaggar drainage basin particularly in the areas covering desert region of rajasthan state and mud flat and salt pan covered kutch region of gujarat state it is also found to be low in the hilly northern part of upper ganga drainage basin in uttarakhand state sloping rugged terrain in the north western part of narmada drainage basin in rajasthan state and chambal yamuna gullied badlands in chambal and yamuna drainage basins in the remaining areas potential groundwater recharge is found to be moderate while comparing with terrain suitability for groundwater recharge we observed a disagreement in luni ghaggar drainage basin in parts of narmada drainage basin and in the northern part of upper ganga drainage basin essentially due to inversely proportional surface water availability very low surface water column thickness in areas of high terrain suitability and vice versa for underground infiltration in these regions in the kutch region of luni ghaggar drainage basin both the factors are unfavourable which lead to extremely low potential groundwater recharge 3 3 grace monsoonal gws change grace tws change data represent mass anomaly in centimetres of equivalent water thickness relative to the 2004 2009 time mean baseline post processing of grace observation was done using a destriping filter and gaussian filter followed by truncation of the gravity signal at a spectral degree and order 60 the quantitative estimates of signal attenuation and leakage error due to post processing filters were determined with respect to simulated monthly tws anomalies obtained from gldas noah land surface model data swenson and wahr 2006 landerer and swenson 2012 besides grace gravity variations are caused due to the changes in the mass distribution in the solid earth and at the earth s surface the major sources of gravity variation due to solid earth processes include glacial isostatic adjustment gia and earthquakes at local scale the effect of gia has been incorporated by the data provider based on the contemporary gia correction model peltier 2004 chambers et al 2010 wahr and zhong 2013 after correcting the effects of solid earth processes grace gravity variation successfully represents the water mass exchanges at the earth surface the grace tws change represents the sum of the changes in surface water storage groundwater storage soil moisture accumulated snow and plant canopy water storage in the present study the monthly surface water storage change was considered as the sum of monthly aggregated surface runoff and et the monthly soil moisture change was derived with respect to a long term average covering the same period as grace tws long term average it may be noted that the changes in accumulated snow and plant canopy water storage are not appreciable in the study area due to their limited spatial coverage accumulated snow cover is confined to high altitude ne boundary region of uttarakhand and h p states of the study area and vegetation cover is restricted to rocky terrain over hills plateau slopes and bad land regions those are not favourable for groundwater recharge from the monthly tws change we subtracted monthly surface water storage change and monthly soil moisture change to obtain spaceborne grace gravity anomaly based monthly gws change finally grace monthly gws change layers were combined for the monsoonal period june october to produce average monsoonal grace gws change of the study area during the observation period 2005 2012 fig 10 it was observed that spaceborne grace gravity anomaly based average monsoonal gws change is low in luni ghaggar drainage basin and north western part of yamuna drainage basin covering desertic arid region of rajasthan whole of haryana and ncr delhi southern part of punjab western part of u p hilly northern part of uttarakhand and kutch region of gujarat states on the other hand it is moderate to high in narmada drainage basin southern part of chambal and yamuna drainage basins and eastern part of upper ganga drainage basin covering eastern and southern parts of gujarat and northern part of maharashtra states m p excluding northern part and eastern part of u p states respectively 3 4 comparison of grace gws change with in situ groundwater level based gws change we used groundwater level gwl data collected by central groundwater board cgwb at 4307 monitoring wells scattered across the states of nw india we prepared year wise gwl change point maps for pre monsoon may post monsoon november periods finally each gwl change point map was interpolated by kriging and inverse distance weighted idw algorithms using 90 data points the remaining 10 data points those are spread over the study area were used for calculation of rmse between observed and interpolated values two interpolated gwl change maps for each year were then integrated by rmse based weighted average algorithm in situ groundwater storage change during the monsoon was estimated using groundwater level fluctuation method as follows cgwb 2014 2 change in groundwater storage per unit area δ s h s y where h represents groundwater level change during the monsoon period and sy represents specific yield of aquifer materials lithologically the nw india is primarily made of unconsolidated and semi consolidated sediments followed by sedimentary rocks extrusive igneous rocks basalts intrusive igneous rocks metamorphic rocks and their combinations granites gneisses phyllites schists and quartzites we used a standard specific yield value of 0 12 applicable for unconsolidated and semi consolidated materials of indo gangetic alluvium cgwb 2014 porosity acts as the governing factor for specific yield and it ranges 30 50 for unconsolidated sediments 10 30 for sedimentary rocks and basalts and 5 20 for fractured partially weathered crystalline rocks granites and granite gneisses zhang 2017 we used a normalization factor of 1 0 for unconsolidated and semi consolidated sediments specific yield 0 12 0 5 for sedimentary rocks and basalts specific yield 0 06 and 0 25 for fractured partially altered igneous rocks such as granites gneisses and igneous metamorphic rocks combinations granites gneisses phyllites schists and quartzites specific yield 0 03 to obtain gwl fluctuation based average monsoonal gws change fig 11 a it is observed that gwl fluctuation based monsoonal gws change is very low in luni ghaggar drainage basin north western parts of yamuna chambal and upper ganga drainage basins northern kutch of gujarat state rugged hard rock terrain of eastern rajasthan alluvial plains in punjab haryana ncr delhi and western u p overall the relative spatial distribution of in situ gwl fluctuation based gws change is found to agree well with the grace satellite based monsoonal gws change we used pearson product moment correlation coefficient to measure the nature and strength of correlation between two data layers grid based pearson correlation coefficient values generated on 1 1 spatial grids followed by grid centre point interpolation by idw algorithm show good agreement between two results fig 11b we found a positive correlation between grace gws change and gwl fluctuation based gws change in 11 43 050 km2 out of the total 11 70 375 km2 area which amounts to 97 7 of the study area besides the correlation is moderate to high in 77 4 area and it is low in 20 3 area we found a negative correlation in 27 325 km2 area covering isolated patches in uttarakhand and u p states in the northern part of the study area and in rajasthan gujarat m p and maharashtra states in western and southern parts of the study area this is perhaps due to high surface runoff and base flow and large differences in the spatial resolutions between grace and gwl fluctuation data in hydrogeologically diverse area with contrasting gws capacity 3 5 comparison of potential groundwater recharge and grace monsoonal gws change we made a comparison between potential groundwater recharge essentially during the monsoon and average monsoonal grace monthly gws change during the observation period we made two potential groundwater recharge classes such as high and low potential groundwater recharge and three monsoonal gws change classes such as high and low increase in gws positive gws change and decrease in gws negative gws change classes based on spatial frequency distribution in this comparison the following combinations were made 1 high potential groundwater recharge and high increase in monsoonal gws 2 low potential groundwater recharge but high increase in monsoonal gws 3 high potential groundwater recharge but low increase in monsoonal gws 4 low potential groundwater recharge and low increase in monsoonal gws 5 high potential groundwater recharge but decrease in monsoonal gws negative gws change in monsoon 6 low potential groundwater recharge and decrease in monsoonal gws negative gws change in monsoon fig 12 the spatial coverage of the six classes are 1 82 606 km2 3 37 236 km2 1 04 179 km2 4 75 244 km2 10 534 km2 and 60 868 km2 respectively both the potential classes with high increase in monsoonal gws may be considered safe in terms of sustained availability of groundwater on the other hand the classes with high and low potential groundwater recharge but with low increase in monsoonal gws are vulnerable to groundwater depletion moreover the classes with decreasing monsoonal gws negative gws change in monsoon are at severe risk in terms of groundwater sustainability and are vulnerable to excessive groundwater depletion it is observed that luni ghaggar drainage basin covering rajasthan haryana punjab and nw part of gujarat states is worst affected in terms of low potential groundwater recharge condition and low increase or decrease in monsoonal gws the major part of yamuna drainage basin covering delhi part of haryana rajasthan and u p states is badly affected in terms of low potential groundwater recharge condition and low increase in monsoonal gws similarly the western part of narmada drainage basin covering a large part of gujarat state is characterized by low potential groundwater recharge condition with low increase in monsoonal gws besides the western part of upper ganga drainage basin and northern part of yamuna and luni ghaggar drainage basins covering western u p part of haryana punjab uttarakhand and h p are characterized by high potential groundwater recharge condition but low increase in monsoonal gws such areas are vulnerable to groundwater depletion and therefore at risk for groundwater sustainability in the near future the remaining areas such as eastern part of upper ganga drainage basin southern part of yamuna and chambal drainage basins eastern and central part of narmada drainage basin covering eastern u p m p eastern part of gujarat and northern part of maharashtra states are characterized by high or low potential groundwater recharge condition and high increase in monsoonal gws such areas may be considered safe in terms of sustained availability of groundwater moreover the areas characterized by high potential groundwater recharge condition and high increase in gws dark blue class in map are prospective zones in terms of groundwater availability and sustainability 4 conclusions terrain suitability for groundwater recharge and potential groundwater recharge in 5 major drainage basins of nw india such as upper ganga yamuna chambal luni ghaggar and narmada drainage basins were assessed based on hydrogeology and terrain parameters and surface water column available for underground infiltration as a function of monsoonal precipitation hydrological soil group land use land cover and topographic slope the potential groundwater recharge is high in the major part of upper ganga drainage basin and in parts of yamuna and narmada drainage basins it is found to be low to very low in luni ghaggar drainage basin including desertic region of rajasthan and kutch region of gujarat states in the remaining areas including chambal yamuna and narmada drainage basins it ranges from low to moderate we found a sharp disagreement between terrain suitability for groundwater recharge and potential groundwater recharge in luni ghaggar drainage basin essentially due to very low surface water column available for underground infiltration grace gravity observation provides high precision quantitative estimate of tws change on monthly interval in post processing of grace data a number of uncertainties and leakage errors are involved the primary sources of uncertainty in the analysis include filtering leakage correction and glacial isostatic adjustment in addition to the uncertainties associated with geocenter motion and the earth oblateness the uncertainty in the global water budget was found to be close to 0 27 mm year during 2005 2015 at 90 confidence level blazquez et al 2018 in the present study grace tws change data could be successfully used to assess monsoonal groundwater recharge in terms of satellite based gws change the grace gravity anomaly based average monsoonal gws change was found to be low in luni ghaggar drainage basin northern part of yamuna drainage basin north western parts of upper ganga chambal and narmada drainage basins it is moderate to high in the remaining areas of upper ganga yamuna chambal and most of narmada drainage basins moreover the north western and western parts of the study area covering luni ghaggar yamuna chambal and narmada drainage basins are dominantly characterized by low potential groundwater recharge condition with low increase or decrease in monsoonal gws which suggests that the given area is vulnerable to excessive groundwater depletion and is at severe risk towards sustained availability of groundwater besides the western part of upper ganga drainage basin and northern part of yamuna and luni ghaggar drainage basins are characterized by high potential groundwater recharge condition but significantly low increase in monsoonal gws which suggests that such areas are also vulnerable to significant groundwater depletion over the years the remaining areas such as eastern part of upper ganga drainage basin southern part of yamuna and chambal drainage basins eastern and central parts of narmada drainage basin may be considered safe in terms of groundwater sustainability but differ in groundwater recharge potential acknowledgement the study was funded by indian space research organization isro india under the earth observation application mission eoam project scheme grace monthly mass grid data available from http grace jpl nasa gov were used in the study appendix 1 derivation of topographic wetness index twi from digital elevation model dem from srtm 30 m dem flow direction map was prepared by eight direction d8 flow model jenson and domingue 1988 using the flow direction tool of arcgis software in this algorithm the direction of flow which could be towards any of the eight adjacent pixels is determined by the direction of steepest descent or maximum drop in the dem with respect to the central pixel as follows maximum drop change in height value distance 100 when the direction of steepest descent is found the output cell central pixel is coded with the direction value when two pixels flow towards each other they are termed as sink pixels so fill sinks operation needs to be implemented to remove local depressions by assigning lowest pixel height from the adjacent pixels before executing flow direction step subsequently flow accumulation map was prepared from flow direction map using flow accumulation tool of arcgis in flow accumulation map the number of pixels flow into each pixel is determined and all the pixels are then coded with the corresponding numbers from the flow accumulation map specific catchment area map was prepared using flow accumulation area for each pixel per unit length as follows specific catchment area flow accumulation area size of the pixel finally topographic wetness index twi was generated using specific catchment area and topographic slope of the study

12136,the north western part of india has been affected by severe ground water depletion in this study an attempt has been made to assess potential ground water recharge of north west nw india and its comparison with gravity recovery and climate experiment grace gravity anomaly based monsoonal groundwater storage change an assessment of potential groundwater recharge was done in terms of terrain suitability for groundwater recharge and average monsoonal recharge terrain suitability was assessed based on hydrogeology and terrain parameters which were then integrated with the spatial variability in monsoonal recharge expressed as the surface water column available for underground infiltration the average monsoonal groundwater storage gws change was derived from grace terrestrial water storage tws change an evaluation of potential groundwater recharge vs terrain suitability for groundwater recharge and potential groundwater recharge vs monsoonal grace gws change shows that there is high terrain suitability but low potential groundwater recharge in the north western part of nw india essentially due to very low precipitation in the north western part terrain suitability is high primarily due to the presence of sandy alluvium deeper sandy loam soil and flat terrain the remaining alluvial plains lithologically covered by unconsolidated sediments with loamy silty sand or clayey loamy silty sand soils show moderate terrain suitability rainfall induced surface water infiltration capacity is high in upper ganga drainage basin and in major parts of narmada drainage basin but low to very low in luni ghaggar drainage basin and in major parts of yamuna and chambal drainage basins the average monsoonal grace gws change is low in the north western part of nw india which is in agreement with potential groundwater recharge scenario the comparison between precipitation terrain infiltration potential and grace gravity based average groundwater storage observations enables to evaluate prospective and vulnerable areas in terms of groundwater availability and sustainability in nw india graphical abstract image 1 keywords potential groundwater recharge grace tws change groundwater storage change nw india 1 introduction groundwater depletion or lowering of groundwater level is one of the major issues controlling fresh water availability khurana and mahapatra 2008 nwp 2012 the demand for water has increased rapidly in the recent years which leads to water crisis not only in india but also in many other parts of the world hinrichsen and tacio 2002 nwp 2012 rapid population growth urbanization irregularity in rainfall and groundwater intensive agriculture are major causes of groundwater depletion garduño et al 2011 wyrwoll 2012 unicef et al 2013 steward 2014 india has 16 percent of the world s total population but only 4 percent of the world s fresh water resources groundwater plays an important role for high agricultural productivity in punjab haryana parts of rajasthan and uttar pradesh as a result groundwater exploitation has been increasing at an alarming rate leading to severe groundwater depletion in this region in india groundwater extraction in agricultural domestic and industrial sectors constitutes approximately 89 9 and 2 respectively suhag 2016 cgwb 2019 the primary cause of groundwater extraction has been the high demand in the agricultural sector in fact in the last four decades there is an increase of roughly 84 net irrigated area through groundwater suhag 2016 groundwater extraction scenario can be indirectly assessed through present groundwater development stages in different parts of the country fig 1 a groundwater development in percentage is a ratio of the annual gross groundwater extraction for all uses to the net annual groundwater availability multiplied by 100 considering groundwater development in the past 20 years groundwater extraction has been assessed into four categories such as safe semi critical critical and overexploited categories for groundwater development 70 70 90 90 100 and 100 respectively groundwater extraction is very high in ncr delhi haryana punjab rajasthan ut of chandigarh and some parts of gujarat uttar pradesh and madhya pradesh with the level of groundwater development 100 suhag 2016 cgwb 2019 the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite mission was launched by national aeronautics and space administration nasa and the german aerospace center dlr for monitoring the earth s gravity field and its temporal variation monthly gravity variations obtained from grace mission is inverted to obtain tws change on spatial grids of few hundred kilometres using the monthly gravity anomaly grace can sense the changes in the water storage at surface and sub surface level including groundwater storage change satellite based grace gravity anomaly study of rodell et al 2009 and tiwari et al 2009 highlighted severe ground water depletion in the north western part of india subsequently several researchers conducted similar studies and corroborated groundwater depletion in nw india and indo gangetic basin chen et al 2014 dasgupta et al 2014 grace gravity observation on groundwater storage depletion has also been successfully studied in other parts of the globe such as mississippi river basin usa rodell et al 2007 california central valley usa famiglietti et al 2011 middle east and arabian countries voss et al 2013 richey 2014 canning basin australia richey 2014 central asia li et al 2018 and in different parts of china feng et al 2018 gong et al 2018 chen et al 2019 to avoid the situation of severe groundwater depletion the usage of groundwater should be controlled at par the rate of replenishment de vries 1984 towards this mission an in depth knowledge on potential groundwater recharge is utmost important it is indeed essential to develop a geospatial framework model for generating and organizing the data layers such as geomorphology lithology digital surface model dsm land use land cover lu lc soil depth and texture and monsoonal precipitation as available from earth observation and field based data sources in the present study hydrogeology and terrain parameters were coupled with monsoonal surface water column available for underground infiltration for deriving potential groundwater recharge of the study area it may be noted that monsoonal rainfall is the primary source of groundwater recharge in the country sinha and sharma 1988 in nw india groundwater recharge dominantly occurs during the south west monsoon june october grace gravity anomaly based 1 1 grid data of monthly terrestrial water storage tws change during the monsoonal months of 2005 2012 was used to derive average monsoonal groundwater storage gws change finally potential groundwater recharge in nw india was compared with average monsoonal gws change for comparative evaluation of groundwater sustainability in nw india 2 materials

eastern parts of punjab and himachal pradesh h p gujarat madhya pradesh m p and north western part of maharashtra we considered five major drainage basins of nw india such as upper ganga yamuna chambal luni ghaggar and narmada drainage basins as hydrological units for assessing groundwater recharge scenario in the region fig 1b in general the nw india is divided into three physiographic zones such as indo gangetic plain in north and east deccan plateau in south and west and thar desert in west the region receives moderate to low rainfall and essentially during the monsoon season june october during the remaining period of the year the region remains more or less dry the extreme western part of the study area namely the western part of rajasthan state experiences very low rainfall 100 mm the major rock types in the study area include unconsolidated sediments sedimentary rocks igneous rocks and combination of igneous metamorphic and sedimentary rocks belonging to the geological groups and formations such as indo gangetic alluvium deccan trap and vindhyans indo gangetic alluvium consists of unconsolidated quaternary sediments comprising recent alluvium older alluvium and aeolian sediments the sediments are made of sands silts clays pebbles etc they form alluvial aquifers with high infiltration capacity high storage and transmissivity deccan trap consists of alternate layers of compact and vesicular basaltic lava flows and inter trappean clastic sedimentary beds it has in general low infiltration capacity low storage and transmissivity except for highly weathered fractured and vesicular basalts occurring in limited areas it has moderate infiltration storage and transmissivity vindhyan rocks consist of consolidated clastic and non clastic sedimentary and meta sedimentary rocks such as sandstone shale conglomerate limestone slate and quartzite with primary and or secondary porosity the vindhyan rocks are characterized by low to moderate infiltration capacity low to high storage and transmissivity depending on the availability of secondary porosity in addition to primary porosity of consolidated proterozoic sandstone and conglomerate the study area is characterized by a wide variety of soils such as alluvial soil desert soil sandy soil black soil and red soils a variety of geomorphological processes have been operated in the study area which lead to the development of diverse landforms such as fluvial landforms aeolian landforms volcanic landforms and structural landforms due to diverse climate and physiographic conditions diverse vegetation types including tropical dry deciduous forest tropical moist deciduous forest tropical semi evergreen forest tropical thorn forest sub tropical pine forest and littoral and swamp vegetation occur in the region isfr 2011 2 2 data preparation and analysis 2 2 1 earth observation eo data indian remote sensing irs resourcesat 2 advanced wide field sensor awifs multispectral data available in visible and near infrared vnir and short wave infrared swir bands were used for false colour composite fcc image generation the images with a spatial resolution of 56 m and a combined swath of 740 km were acquired during november december 2013 enhanced fcc images were used for refinement and updation of the existing thematic data layers such as geomorphology lithology and land use land cover maps to update the boundaries between lithological units to refine geomorphological classification scheme in terms of groundwater potential and to address lu lc dynamics in the study area 2 2 2 digital elevation model dem and terrain analysis data we used shuttle radar topography mission srtm 1 arc second approximately 30 m spatial resolution at equator dem available in 1 1 tiles usgs 2015 the dem represents a seamless and complete elevational surface of the earth after applying a number of post processing steps by the data provider and by spatial interpolation of the remaining no data regions the dem is available in geographic lat long projection system with the wgs84 horizontal datum and the egm96 vertical datum the relative vertical accuracy of the dem is reported to be 12 15 m which allows to achieve a digital terrain elevation data level 2 dted 2 land surface model and precise terrain related thematic data layers from the dem specific catchment area and topographic slope were determined using arcgis tools finally topographic wetness index twi map was generated using specific catchment area and topographic slope of the study area as follows twi ln specific catchment area slope fig 2 twi is a key element for identifying ground water recharge potential as it measures the effect of local topography on hydrological processes and describes the spatial distribution of soil moisture and surface saturation wilson and gallant 2000 2 2 3 geomorphology geomorphology describes earth surface processes and resulting landforms with emphasis on their shape size relief characteristics material composition spatial distribution and evolution geomorphology governs surface runoff groundwater recharge and discharge potential of the landforms as a function of their relief characteristics and material composition the existing geomorphological map 1 2 000 000 scale of geological survey of india gsi 2002 was used after needful updation and modification based on visual analysis of awifs standard fcc image the geomorphological classes were regrouped as a function of ground water recharge potential to obtain simplified applied geomorphological classes fig 3 the geomorphological classes in the study area were broadly combined into 3 groups 1 hills and plateau 2 plains and 3 valleys with an interface group between hills and plateau and plains namely slopes and badlands the geomorphological group hills and plateau comprises the geomorphological classes with higher elevations under hills as well as plateau the geomorphological group plains occupies more than 66 of the study area it comprises a diverse variety of geomorphological classes such as rocky terrace rocky desert planation surface with or without duricrust low lying flats ranns low lying salt deserts prodelta islands and lagoons alluvial plains and depositional terraces aeolian plains with sand dunes and sand sheets there are limited number of geomorphological classes under the geomorphological group valleys such as playas valleys and infilled valleys 2 2 4 lithology lithology or rock types describe hydrogeological characteristics in terms of porosity and permeability of rock materials to assess groundwater recharge potential loose unconsolidated sediments or alluvium generally possess high porosity and permeability and are therefore favourable for high level of groundwater recharge primary porosity is essentially found in clastic sedimentary rocks whereas secondary porosity may be observed in igneous metamorphic and sedimentary rocks due to mechanical processes such as brittle deformation and fracturing and or geochemical processes such as dissolution geologically younger sedimentary rocks have generally higher primary porosity than that of the same type of geologically older rocks because of lesser degree of compaction the lithological map of geological survey of india on 1 2 000 000 scale gsi 1998 was visually compared with awifs fcc image and the broad lithological formation contacts were updated various lithological classes were regrouped based on similar rock types and geological age as a function of their favourability for groundwater recharge the broad rock types include unconsolidated sediments or alluvium sedimentary rocks comprising clastic and non clastic rocks igneous rocks comprising ultrabasic ultramafic rocks intermediate basic rocks and granitic rocks a combination of igneous and metamorphic rocks and a combination of igneous metamorphic and sedimentary rocks and ophiolites among these unconsolidated quaternary sediments or alluvium occupies approximately 50 of the study area and primarily contributes groundwater recharge in the study area finally based on the similarity in hydrgeoological properties broad applied lithologic classes were made from a large number of lithological classes available in the study area fig 4 2 2 5 soil texture and soil depth soil texture and soil depth map of india prepared by national bureau of soil survey and land use planning nagpur india on 1 2 000 000 scale nbss lup 2002 was used in this study we regrouped a wide variety of soil texture classes into four broad classes in terms of groundwater recharge potential 1 fine texture e g clay loamy clay silty clay sandy clay sandy clay loam silty clay loam 2 medium texture e g loam silty loam silt sandy loam 3 coarse texture e g loamy sand sand and 4 others e g rocky outcrop built up with very coarse texture or without soil cover fig 5 a similarly we regrouped a wide range of soil depth into four classes 1 deep soil 50 cm 2 moderately deep soil 25 50 cm 3 shallow soil 10 25 cm and 4 others with very shallow 10 cm or no soil cover fig 5b finally the regrouped soil texture and soil depth classes were combined as a function of groundwater recharge potential in this process we obtained 3 major soil texture classes with their subclasses of soil depth except for the fourth class named as others class 2 2 6 land use land cover the land use land cover map was essentially adapted from agrawal et al 2003 and modified based on irs resourcesat 2 awifs multispectral data of november december 2013 in the study area 13 different types of land use land cover classes were mapped such as settlement wood or forest land good cover wood or forest land poor cover pasture range poor desert shrub poor meadow good meadow poor agriculture bare soil mangrove mud flat salt pan water body snow cover fig 6 except for water body snow cover the lu lc classes in the study area possess characteristically different groundwater recharge potential 2 2 7 rainfall daily and monthly precipitation data for the study area were generated by combining satellite based and ground based observations satellite based daily rainfall measurements with spatial resolution 0 25 0 25 was obtained from the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm a joint space mission of nasa usa and jaxa japan ground based rainfall data at 0 25 0 25 grid was obtained from the indian meteorological department imd 2014 the gridded rainfall data for the entire country was generated by imd by interpolating ground based rainfall measurements available from 6995 rainfall stations we used essentially imd rainfall data for those grids where one or more rainfall stations exist for the remaining grids we took weighted average correlation coefficient based weighted average between imd and trmm rainfall data of trmm and imd gridded rainfall data where both the data are available finally the combined product was passed through a 3 3 low pass median filter to smoothen sharp edges between neighbouring grids daily rainfall data at 0 25 0 25 grid was later used for run off estimation daily rainfall data was also used to obtain cumulative monthly rainfall during the observation period 2005 2012 2 2 8 runoff in the present study the scs runoff curve number method kent 1973 was adopted to calculate runoff from daily rainfall data at 0 25 0 25 spatial grids the curve number depends on the hydrologic soil group land use treatment and hydrologic condition the hydrologic soil groups land use treatment and slope maps were prepared from the soil map modified after nbss lup 2002 land use land cover map modified after agrawal et al 2003 and srtm 1 arc second dem 2 2 9 evapotranspiration evapotranspiration plays a crucial role in hydrological water balance mod16 global evapotranspiration product is derived from earth land surface by using terra aqua modis remote sensing data it provides global evapotranspiration et and potential evapotranspiration pet at 1 km 1 km regular grids for the 109 03 million km2 global vegetated land areas at 8 days monthly and annual intervals mu et al 2013 terrestrial et includes water vapour fluxes from soil evaporation wet canopy evaporation and plant transpiration at dry canopy surface modis 8 day fraction of photosynthetically active radiation fpar is used as vegetation cover faction to quantify how much surface net radiation is allocated between soil and vegetation modis 8 day albedo and daily downward solar radiation and air temperature available from daily meteorological reanalysis data are used to calculate surface net radiation and soil heat flux besides daily air temperature vapour pressure deficit vpd and relative humidity data and 8 day modis leaf area index lai are used to estimate surface stomatal conductance aerodynamic resistance wet canopy soil heat flux and other key environmental variables mod16 et data products are essentially generated by the algorithm of mu et al 2007 2011 using modis land cover fpar lai data and global surface meteorology data available from the global modeling and assimilation office gmao v 4 0 0 in the present study mod 16 monthly et data was used after upscaling into 0 25 0 25 grids by resizing based on pixel aggregated averaging finally the volume of surface water available for underground infiltration was calculated by subtracting monthly runoff and monthly et from the monthly rainfall data products we used the average surface water column thickness in each grid 0 25 0 25 potentially available for underground infiltration during the monsoon fig 7 to translate terrain suitability for groundwater recharge map into potential groundwater recharge map of the nw india 2 2 10 soil moisture change in this study soil moisture data of global land data assimilation system gldas noah land surface model rodell and beaudoing 2007 https mirador gsfc nasa gov collections gldas noah025 m 001 shtml was used soil moisture is available in 4 layers first layer 0 10 cm second layer for 10 40 cm third layer 40 100 cm and fourth layer 100 200 cm by summing up the values in four layers the volumetric soil moisture volumetric soil water content was obtained soil moisture being a state function the monthly soil moisture change was estimated with respect to a long term average 2 2 11 grace gravity observation and tws change the grace satellite mission was launched by nasa and dlr for monitoring the earth s dynamic gravity field in terms of monthly gravity anomaly the gravity anomaly of the earth surface may be inverted to derive spatio temporal variation of mass and therefore terrestrial water storage tws change around the planet by measuring the changing distance between the two satellites and combining that with precise geocentric positions obtained from the onboard gps instruments the gravity anomaly over the earth s surface is produced grace level 2 monthly product consists of a series of spherical harmonic coefficients which describes the shape of the earth s gravity field the level 2 products are converted to level 3 products describing terrestrial water storage change in terms of the deviations from the series mean by averaging kernels e g wahr et al 1998 2004 seo et al 2006 swenson and wahr 2006 landerer and swenson 2012 terrestrial water storage tws represents a land surface state which may be compared with other hydrological states or water storage components of the land surface it is the sum of surface water storage groundwater storage soil moisture accumulated snow and plant canopy water storage however grace observation cannot provide an absolute measurement of tws but a relative measurement of the anomaly with respect to a long term average in the present study grace level 3 tws change data products available in 1 1 grids were used we downscaled the grace monthly tws change from 1 1 grids to 0 25 0 25 grids using high resolution eo based and in situ hydrological layers such as surface run off et soil moisture and groundwater level fluctuation data by linear regression based predictive analysis for presentation of the results we further downscaled grace monthly tws change data from 0 25 0 25 grids to 10 km 10 km grids by inverse distance weighted idw algorithm based statistical interpolation of grid centre values 2 3 spatial data integration the data layers used in this study were made available from different sources such as resourcesat 2 awifs eo data srtm dem geomorphology and lithological data from geological survey of india soil texture and soil depth data from nbsslup existing land use land cover map prepared from spot vegetation data trmm and imd rainfall based surface water column thickness available for underground infiltration and grace gravity based tws change data as a result the scale and projection systems are different those are not compatible for spatial comparison and integration all the derived data layers were reprojected into albers conical equal area projection and subsequently converted to raster layers with 10 km 10 km spatial grids for spatial comparison and integration 2 3 1 layer weight assignment for determination of layer weight we adopted analytic hierarchy process ahp saaty 1980 1994 2008 coyle 2004 saaty and vargas 2012 it is an effective tool for setting the priorities in a complex multi variate decision making problem based on a series of pairwise comparisons it overcomes the bias in the decision making to a great extent by ensuring consistency in the process the first step in this process is to construct a pair wise comparison matrix for all the elements such as topography or topographic wetness describing surface water flow accumulation per unit cell geomorphology lithology soil texture and soil depth and land use land cover those are contributing to terrain suitability for groundwater recharge in pair wise comparison an index from 1 to 9 indicates the degree of importance 1 equally important 1 2 somewhat more important moderate 3 3 much more important strong 5 4 very much more important very strong 7 5 absolutely more important extreme 9 and intermediate values 2 4 6 and 8 when some compromise is needed the basic principle of the rating scale is that if an element m is absolutely more important than another element n then n must be absolutely less important than m and the ratings for m and n would be 9 and 1 9 respectively thus for 5 layers a square reciprocal matrix a aij of order 5 is formed for aij 1 aij for i j and aii ajj 1 for all i and j equal to 1 to 5 the next step is the calculation of a list of the relative weights or eigen vectors such that aω λω where ω is said to be an eigen vector of order n 5 and λ is an eigen value the elements of the eigen vector of relative importance a is calculated as follows for each row multiply all the row elements and take the nth root of the product which is then divided by the sum sum of the nth root of the product of the row elements for all the rows the product aω vector with five elements gives five estimates of λ max by dividing the five elements of the product vector aω with the corresponding element of the eigen vector all the five estimates of λ max are always 5 else there has been error in the calculation finally the mean of these five estimates gives the value of λ max the difference between λ max and n is an indication of the inconsistency in the judgements therefore consistency index ci followed by consistency ratio cr are calculated to check inconsistency when the value of cr is zero the judgements are considered to be perfectly consistent in practice when cr is 0 1 the judgements are considered to be consistent and therefore trustworthy raharjo and endah 2006 2 3 2 class weight assignment individual class weightage for each of the data layers was determined on 1 9 linear scale based on their relative significance towards groundwater recharge for this purpose we first arranged the classes of a layer in terms of their relative significance to groundwater recharge and regrouped into hydrogeologically similar classes now based on the number of groups or categories in a data layer the entire 1 9 weight range was linearly distributed further depending on the number of classes in a group or category the weight range was linearly allocated based on next level criteria such as process of formation grain size geological age or degree of fracturing etc for lithology layer geomorphic process ruggedness slope or relative age of formation etc for geomorphology layer in this process the recharge potential behavior of different classes in a data layer becomes more or less linear and subjectivity in the weight scale is avoided the procedure for assigning class weightage for individual layers is elaborated below 2 3 3 integration of data layers finally the data layers were integrated by index overlay method using ahp based layer weights and knowledge based linear class weights to obtain integrated terrain suitability map of the study area for groundwater recharge fig 8 terrain suitability for groundwater recharge represents the capability of the study area for potential groundwater recharge but it does not take into account the availability of surface water column available for underground infiltration as a function of rainfall and terrain condition trmm and imd rainfall based monsoonal surface water column available for underground infiltration was therefore integrated with terrain suitability layer to obtain potential groundwater recharge during the observation period 3 results and discussion 3 1 terrain suitability for groundwater recharge terrain suitability for groundwater recharge was prepared using five terrain parameters such as topographic wetness index twi applied geomorphology lithology soil texture and depth and land use land cover of the study area by ahp based layer weights and linear class weights based on relative significance fig 8 it is observed that the terrain suitability for groundwater recharge is high in luni ghaggar drainage basin in the western part of the study area primarily due to the presence of sandy alluvium deeper sandy loam soil and flat terrain it is high in some patches of upper ganga and yamuna drainage basins covering valleys and infilled valleys besides a large part of the study area geomorphologically occupied by alluvial plain lithologically covered by unconsolidated sediments with loamy silty sand or clayey loamy silty sand soil types shows moderate terrain suitability for groundwater recharge the area dominantly falls under upper ganga and yamuna drainage basins covering u p haryana and ncr delhi northern part of luni ghaggar drainage basin and central part of chambal drainage basin covering western part of haryana southern part of punjab and eastern part of rajasthan states and sabarmati mahi narmada and tapi alluvial plains of narmada drainage basin covering parts of gujarat m p and maharashtra states the remaining area is occupied by adverse geomorphology such as hills and plateau or slopes and badlands adverse lithology such as igneous rocks or a combination of igneous metamorphic and sedimentary rocks adverse soil types such as rocky non soil or thin clayey loamy silty soil and unfavourable land covers the area shows fair to poor terrain suitability for groundwater recharge 3 2 potential groundwater recharge the monsoonal surface water column available for underground infiltration was integrated with the terrain suitability for groundwater recharge layer to obtain potential groundwater recharge in the study area for this purpose the surface water column available for underground infiltration during the monsoon was rescaled into 1 9 linear scale similar to terrain suitability for groundwater recharge layer the two layers were integrated as an algebraic product raised to the power γ and 1 γ as follows bonham carter 1994 1 μ a γ b 1 γ where μ represents the integrated value of two layer variables a and b e g terrain suitability for groundwater recharge and surface water column available for underground infiltration and the value of γ operator varies in the range of 0 1 0 9 to consider the effect of extreme values in the integration product for example where one of the variables say layer a is very low rescaled values 1 3 and the other variable is sufficiently high rescaled values 3 9 the effect of the variable a becomes critical and we assume γ 0 9 0 7 for layer a and 1 γ 0 1 0 3 for layer b respectively but where both the variables are very low rescaled values 1 3 or both the variables are sufficiently high rescaled values 3 9 the effect of the variables will be essentially governed by their values and we assume γ 1 γ 0 5 bonham carter 1994 marjanovic and caha 2011 finally we obtained potential groundwater recharge map of the study area fig 9 it is observed that potential groundwater recharge is high in the major part of upper ganga drainage basin covering u p and uttarakhand states excluding the northern hilly region of uttarakhand and south eastern part of u p and in parts of narmada drainage basin covering narmada mahi sabarmati alluvial plains in m p and gujarat it is also found to be high in the northern part of yamuna drainage basin covering south western part of uttarakhand state essentially due to high rainfall and therefore high surface water column available for underground infiltration potential groundwater recharge is found to be low in luni ghaggar drainage basin particularly in the areas covering desert region of rajasthan state and mud flat and salt pan covered kutch region of gujarat state it is also found to be low in the hilly northern part of upper ganga drainage basin in uttarakhand state sloping rugged terrain in the north western part of narmada drainage basin in rajasthan state and chambal yamuna gullied badlands in chambal and yamuna drainage basins in the remaining areas potential groundwater recharge is found to be moderate while comparing with terrain suitability for groundwater recharge we observed a disagreement in luni ghaggar drainage basin in parts of narmada drainage basin and in the northern part of upper ganga drainage basin essentially due to inversely proportional surface water availability very low surface water column thickness in areas of high terrain suitability and vice versa for underground infiltration in these regions in the kutch region of luni ghaggar drainage basin both the factors are unfavourable which lead to extremely low potential groundwater recharge 3 3 grace monsoonal gws change grace tws change data represent mass anomaly in centimetres of equivalent water thickness relative to the 2004 2009 time mean baseline post processing of grace observation was done using a destriping filter and gaussian filter followed by truncation of the gravity signal at a spectral degree and order 60 the quantitative estimates of signal attenuation and leakage error due to post processing filters were determined with respect to simulated monthly tws anomalies obtained from gldas noah land surface model data swenson and wahr 2006 landerer and swenson 2012 besides grace gravity variations are caused due to the changes in the mass distribution in the solid earth and at the earth s surface the major sources of gravity variation due to solid earth processes include glacial isostatic adjustment gia and earthquakes at local scale the effect of gia has been incorporated by the data provider based on the contemporary gia correction model peltier 2004 chambers et al 2010 wahr and zhong 2013 after correcting the effects of solid earth processes grace gravity variation successfully represents the water mass exchanges at the earth surface the grace tws change represents the sum of the changes in surface water storage groundwater storage soil moisture accumulated snow and plant canopy water storage in the present study the monthly surface water storage change was considered as the sum of monthly aggregated surface runoff and et the monthly soil moisture change was derived with respect to a long term average covering the same period as grace tws long term average it may be noted that the changes in accumulated snow and plant canopy water storage are not appreciable in the study area due to their limited spatial coverage accumulated snow cover is confined to high altitude ne boundary region of uttarakhand and h p states of the study area and vegetation cover is restricted to rocky terrain over hills plateau slopes and bad land regions those are not favourable for groundwater recharge from the monthly tws change we subtracted monthly surface water storage change and monthly soil moisture change to obtain spaceborne grace gravity anomaly based monthly gws change finally grace monthly gws change layers were combined for the monsoonal period june october to produce average monsoonal grace gws change of the study area during the observation period 2005 2012 fig 10 it was observed that spaceborne grace gravity anomaly based average monsoonal gws change is low in luni ghaggar drainage basin and north western part of yamuna drainage basin covering desertic arid region of rajasthan whole of haryana and ncr delhi southern part of punjab western part of u p hilly northern part of uttarakhand and kutch region of gujarat states on the other hand it is moderate to high in narmada drainage basin southern part of chambal and yamuna drainage basins and eastern part of upper ganga drainage basin covering eastern and southern parts of gujarat and northern part of maharashtra states m p excluding northern part and eastern part of u p states respectively 3 4 comparison of grace gws change with in situ groundwater level based gws change we used groundwater level gwl data collected by central groundwater board cgwb at 4307 monitoring wells scattered across the states of nw india we prepared year wise gwl change point maps for pre monsoon may post monsoon november periods finally each gwl change point map was interpolated by kriging and inverse distance weighted idw algorithms using 90 data points the remaining 10 data points those are spread over the study area were used for calculation of rmse between observed and interpolated values two interpolated gwl change maps for each year were then integrated by rmse based weighted average algorithm in situ groundwater storage change during the monsoon was estimated using groundwater level fluctuation method as follows cgwb 2014 2 change in groundwater storage per unit area δ s h s y where h represents groundwater level change during the monsoon period and sy represents specific yield of aquifer materials lithologically the nw india is primarily made of unconsolidated and semi consolidated sediments followed by sedimentary rocks extrusive igneous rocks basalts intrusive igneous rocks metamorphic rocks and their combinations granites gneisses phyllites schists and quartzites we used a standard specific yield value of 0 12 applicable for unconsolidated and semi consolidated materials of indo gangetic alluvium cgwb 2014 porosity acts as the governing factor for specific yield and it ranges 30 50 for unconsolidated sediments 10 30 for sedimentary rocks and basalts and 5 20 for fractured partially weathered crystalline rocks granites and granite gneisses zhang 2017 we used a normalization factor of 1 0 for unconsolidated and semi consolidated sediments specific yield 0 12 0 5 for sedimentary rocks and basalts specific yield 0 06 and 0 25 for fractured partially altered igneous rocks such as granites gneisses and igneous metamorphic rocks combinations granites gneisses phyllites schists and quartzites specific yield 0 03 to obtain gwl fluctuation based average monsoonal gws change fig 11 a it is observed that gwl fluctuation based monsoonal gws change is very low in luni ghaggar drainage basin north western parts of yamuna chambal and upper ganga drainage basins northern kutch of gujarat state rugged hard rock terrain of eastern rajasthan alluvial plains in punjab haryana ncr delhi and western u p overall the relative spatial distribution of in situ gwl fluctuation based gws change is found to agree well with the grace satellite based monsoonal gws change we used pearson product moment correlation coefficient to measure the nature and strength of correlation between two data layers grid based pearson correlation coefficient values generated on 1 1 spatial grids followed by grid centre point interpolation by idw algorithm show good agreement between two results fig 11b we found a positive correlation between grace gws change and gwl fluctuation based gws change in 11 43 050 km2 out of the total 11 70 375 km2 area which amounts to 97 7 of the study area besides the correlation is moderate to high in 77 4 area and it is low in 20 3 area we found a negative correlation in 27 325 km2 area covering isolated patches in uttarakhand and u p states in the northern part of the study area and in rajasthan gujarat m p and maharashtra states in western and southern parts of the study area this is perhaps due to high surface runoff and base flow and large differences in the spatial resolutions between grace and gwl fluctuation data in hydrogeologically diverse area with contrasting gws capacity 3 5 comparison of potential groundwater recharge and grace monsoonal gws change we made a comparison between potential groundwater recharge essentially during the monsoon and average monsoonal grace monthly gws change during the observation period we made two potential groundwater recharge classes such as high and low potential groundwater recharge and three monsoonal gws change classes such as high and low increase in gws positive gws change and decrease in gws negative gws change classes based on spatial frequency distribution in this comparison the following combinations were made 1 high potential groundwater recharge and high increase in monsoonal gws 2 low potential groundwater recharge but high increase in monsoonal gws 3 high potential groundwater recharge but low increase in monsoonal gws 4 low potential groundwater recharge and low increase in monsoonal gws 5 high potential groundwater recharge but decrease in monsoonal gws negative gws change in monsoon 6 low potential groundwater recharge and decrease in monsoonal gws negative gws change in monsoon fig 12 the spatial coverage of the six classes are 1 82 606 km2 3 37 236 km2 1 04 179 km2 4 75 244 km2 10 534 km2 and 60 868 km2 respectively both the potential classes with high increase in monsoonal gws may be considered safe in terms of sustained availability of groundwater on the other hand the classes with high and low potential groundwater recharge but with low increase in monsoonal gws are vulnerable to groundwater depletion moreover the classes with decreasing monsoonal gws negative gws change in monsoon are at severe risk in terms of groundwater sustainability and are vulnerable to excessive groundwater depletion it is observed that luni ghaggar drainage basin covering rajasthan haryana punjab and nw part of gujarat states is worst affected in terms of low potential groundwater recharge condition and low increase or decrease in monsoonal gws the major part of yamuna drainage basin covering delhi part of haryana rajasthan and u p states is badly affected in terms of low potential groundwater recharge condition and low increase in monsoonal gws similarly the western part of narmada drainage basin covering a large part of gujarat state is characterized by low potential groundwater recharge condition with low increase in monsoonal gws besides the western part of upper ganga drainage basin and northern part of yamuna and luni ghaggar drainage basins covering western u p part of haryana punjab uttarakhand and h p are characterized by high potential groundwater recharge condition but low increase in monsoonal gws such areas are vulnerable to groundwater depletion and therefore at risk for groundwater sustainability in the near future the remaining areas such as eastern part of upper ganga drainage basin southern part of yamuna and chambal drainage basins eastern and central part of narmada drainage basin covering eastern u p m p eastern part of gujarat and northern part of maharashtra states are characterized by high or low potential groundwater recharge condition and high increase in monsoonal gws such areas may be considered safe in terms of sustained availability of groundwater moreover the areas characterized by high potential groundwater recharge condition and high increase in gws dark blue class in map are prospective zones in terms of groundwater availability and sustainability 4 conclusions terrain suitability for groundwater recharge and potential groundwater recharge in 5 major drainage basins of nw india such as upper ganga yamuna chambal luni ghaggar and narmada drainage basins were assessed based on hydrogeology and terrain parameters and surface water column available for underground infiltration as a function of monsoonal precipitation hydrological soil group land use land cover and topographic slope the potential groundwater recharge is high in the major part of upper ganga drainage basin and in parts of yamuna and narmada drainage basins it is found to be low to very low in luni ghaggar drainage basin including desertic region of rajasthan and kutch region of gujarat states in the remaining areas including chambal yamuna and narmada drainage basins it ranges from low to moderate we found a sharp disagreement between terrain suitability for groundwater recharge and potential groundwater recharge in luni ghaggar drainage basin essentially due to very low surface water column available for underground infiltration grace gravity observation provides high precision quantitative estimate of tws change on monthly interval in post processing of grace data a number of uncertainties and leakage errors are involved the primary sources of uncertainty in the analysis include filtering leakage correction and glacial isostatic adjustment in addition to the uncertainties associated with geocenter motion and the earth oblateness the uncertainty in the global water budget was found to be close to 0 27 mm year during 2005 2015 at 90 confidence level blazquez et al 2018 in the present study grace tws change data could be successfully used to assess monsoonal groundwater recharge in terms of satellite based gws change the grace gravity anomaly based average monsoonal gws change was found to be low in luni ghaggar drainage basin northern part of yamuna drainage basin north western parts of upper ganga chambal and narmada drainage basins it is moderate to high in the remaining areas of upper ganga yamuna chambal and most of narmada drainage basins moreover the north western and western parts of the study area covering luni ghaggar yamuna chambal and narmada drainage basins are dominantly characterized by low potential groundwater recharge condition with low increase or decrease in monsoonal gws which suggests that the given area is vulnerable to excessive groundwater depletion and is at severe risk towards sustained availability of groundwater besides the western part of upper ganga drainage basin and northern part of yamuna and luni ghaggar drainage basins are characterized by high potential groundwater recharge condition but significantly low increase in monsoonal gws which suggests that such areas are also vulnerable to significant groundwater depletion over the years the remaining areas such as eastern part of upper ganga drainage basin southern part of yamuna and chambal drainage basins eastern and central parts of narmada drainage basin may be considered safe in terms of groundwater sustainability but differ in groundwater recharge potential acknowledgement the study was funded by indian space research organization isro india under the

this algorithm the direction of flow which could be towards any of the eight adjacent pixels is determined by the direction of steepest descent or maximum drop in the dem with respect to the central pixel as follows maximum drop change in height value distance 100 when the direction of steepest descent is found the output cell central pixel is coded with the direction value when two pixels flow towards each other they are termed as sink pixels so fill sinks operation needs to be implemented to remove local depressions by assigning lowest pixel height from the adjacent pixels before executing flow direction step subsequently flow accumulation map was prepared from flow direction map using flow accumulation tool of arcgis in flow accumulation map the number of pixels flow into each pixel is determined and all the pixels are then coded with the corresponding numbers from the flow accumulation map specific catchment area map was prepared using flow accumulation area for each pixel per unit length as follows specific catchment area flow accumulation area size of the pixel finally topographic wetness index twi was generated using specific catchment area and topographic slope of the study

12137,this study assesses the efficiency of using cold plasma technology to treat groundwater for the purpose of domestic water supply experimental results showed that cold plasma was an effective method to remove e coli in water after treatment with cold plasma the concentration of e coli decreased significantly in addition cold plasma greatly reduced iron and arsenic levels however the performance of removing arsenic by cold plasma was increased with the presence of ferrous and ferric ions chloride permanganate index electrical conductivity and ph of groundwater samples were slightly changed after treatment with cold plasma one of the disadvantages of cold plasma is that it significantly increases nitrate concentration the effectiveness of water treatment decreased with water flow rate and increased with time to retain water in the effluent tank all quality parameters of groundwater samples treated by the prototype have met the vietnamese standard and who guidelines

grinevich et al 2011 kuraica et al 2006 tichonovas et al 2013 valsero et al 2013 rong et al 2014 malik 2010 this is because cold plasma treats water by the synergism of elements such as ultraviolet uv ozone active species high electric fields sarangapani et al 2016 cold plasma was found to effectively kill escherichia coli e coli in distilled water samples velázquez et al 2013 majeed et al 2012 in addition cold plasma also effectively decomposed organic compounds kuraica et al 2006 majeed et al 2012 and significantly decreased concentrations of heavy metals e g pb cd fe and mn grinevich et al 2011 so far most studies have focused on using cold plasma to decompose organic compounds for wastewater treatment tichonovas et al 2013 valsero et al 2013 rong et al 2014 sarangapani et al 2016 majeed et al 2012 recently cold plasma has successfully treated surface water for domestic water supply nguyen et al 2019 in vietnam there are quite a few rural areas that are not provided with drinking water people in these areas have directly used groundwater or only after natural oxidation for domestic purposes after this oxidation stage water still smells and contains ca2 mg2 iron arsenic and even bacteria therefore it does not meet vietnamese standards and who guidelines unfortunately the existence of high concentrations of arsenic and bacteria has been detected in some wells therefore a study on groundwater treatment by cold plasma to provide a new method which is green and suitable for low capacity solution is necessary in this study experiments were performed with two models a small scale model was used in the laboratory to determine the effectiveness of the treatment process and a prototype with a capacity of 6 m3 day was tested in a real condition at a household in a rural area of vietnam 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials water samples were taken from an 80 m deep underground well of a household in cantho city to evaluate the effectiveness of cold plasma treatment with a small scale model in preparation for experiments these samples were first contaminated with ferrous iron and arsenic by adding different amounts of feso4 99 and acid arsenic h3aso4 furthermore a small amount of domestic wastewater was added to groundwater samples to change the concentration of e coli to test the treatment efficiency of the prototype groundwater was pumped from a well at a household and supplied directly to the prototype without adding any additional sources of contamination 2 2 experimental setup fig 1 shows the setup of the small scale model a high voltage source 18 kv 29 khz is connected to the electrode system inner electrode is made of stainless steel tube having diameter of 22 mm an aluminium foil is wrapped around a quartz tube to form outer electrode the quartz tube has diameter of 35 mm and thickness of 3 5 mm cold plasma is formed between the outer surface of the water layer and the inner surface of the quartz tube by micro discharges and at the edges of outside electrode by corona discharges a pump has been used to supply air to inside and outside plasma chambers to enhance ozone production and the concentration of ozone dissolved in water at the outside plasma chamber ozone is generated by the interaction between corona discharges and oxygen in the air this amount of ozone is piped to a porous disk placed at the bottom of the effluent tank to increase the efficiency of dissolving ozone in water this may lead to improve water treatment efficiency of the model influent and effluent tanks have the same volume 20 l fig 2 shows the process used for groundwater treatment by the prototype fig 3 groundwater is pumped from a well into a raw water storage tank then water is supplied to a plasma treatment unit for eliminating odour removing bacteria and oxidising ferrous iron as well as arsenic iii oxide after plasma treatment the water is retained in an effluent storage tank for about 30 min to complete all possible reactions and to deposit iron precipitate then water is pumped to an elevated tank for pressurising a water supply system at each household a 2 stage filter 5 μm sized cotton filter and cationic ion exchange resin filter is installed a cotton filter is used to remove suspended sediment and iron precipitates in water while a cationic ion filter is used to reduce water hardness the prototype is operated in batch mode of 1 m3 of treated water 2 3 experimental procedure the experiment was performed with a small scale model as shown in fig 1 to evaluate the effectiveness of removing iron arsenic and bacteria from groundwater by cold plasma first the optimal operating parameters were determined by changing the water flow rate and the retention time after treatment the water flow rate which is supplied to the plasma treatment unit is changed from 1 l min to 5 l min the retention time of water after plasma treatment is varied from 10 min to 35 min then based on these optimal operating parameters experiments were performed to evaluate the efficiency of removing iron arsenic and e coli by cold plasma to increase the efficiency of arsenic removal from groundwater by cold plasma the addition of iron ions was investigated three cases were carried out for case 1 only arsenic was added into water samples to a concentration of 0 22 mg l for case 2 both arsenic and ferrous iron was mixed with water samples the concentration of ferrous iron was of about 4 25 mg l for case 3 both arsenic ferrous and ferric irons were added into groundwater samples fe3 from fecl3 6h2o was added into the water samples to the concentration of 2 mg l and the total iron concentration in the water sample is 4 25 mg l for both cases 2 and 3 arsenic concentration was still 0 22 mg l finally the prototype fig 3 operated with the treatment process in fig 2 was installed at a household to evaluate its effectiveness in real groundwater treatment 2 4 water quality parameter measurement the measurement of 14 quality parameters of water samples was performed according to the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater apha 2012 as shown in table 1 the ozone concentrations in treated water samples were roughly measured by the hanna test kit with checker disc hi 38054 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimal operation parameters of plasma reactor 3 1 1 water flow rate the parameters of water quality of samples before and after contamination are shown in table 2 experimental results show that cold plasma has a very high efficiency in iron treatment and the concentration of total iron in water after treatment was significantly changed with the water flow rate fig 4 the highest efficiency 98 8 is achieved at a flow rate of 3 l min and the lowest efficiency occurs a flow rate of 1 l min 97 6 this is because the plasma was observed to be unstable at a flow rate of 1 l min at this flow rate the electrical energy consumption of the plasma column is measured to be 50 w when the flow rate increases to a value of 2 3 l min the measured electrical energy consumption is highest 65 w however when the flow rate is greater than 3 l min the treatment efficiency decreases due to an increase in the thickness of the water layer and a reduction in the interaction time between cold plasma and water layer it was observed that the plasma reactor only consumes 55 w when the flow rate changes within the range of 4 5 l min therefore the highest efficiency of iron removal by cold plasma is achieved at a water flow rate of 2 3 l min a reduction in the concentration of iron in the water after cold plasma treatment due to the existence of ozone and the active species in water which oxidise ferrous iron fe2 into ferric iron fe3 which precipitates then in iron hydroxide fe oh 3 the precipitate is then separated from water by sedimentation in the effluent storage tank and filtered by a cotton filter with a pore size of 5 μm fig 5 shows how cold plasma affects the concentration of arsenic when changing the water flow rate after treatment by cold plasma arsenic levels decreased significantly treatment efficiency was significantly reduced with increasing the water flow rate at the flow rate of 1 l min the arsenic concentration in water after treatment was about 9 1 μg l and the treatment efficiency reached the highest value of about 70 the reduction of post treatment arsenic concentration is due to the oxidation of arsenic in soluble form as3 into an insoluble form as5 expressed in 1 with ph value of approximately 6 5 1 o 3 h 3 a s o 3 h 2 a s o 4 o 2 h fig 6 shows the change in e coli density after cold plasma treatment when increasing the flow rate experimental results show that at the water flow rate of 1 2 l min almost all e coli was destroyed by cold plasma however the efficiency of e coli removal decreased with increasing the water flow rate and only reached approximately 92 at a flow rate of 5 l min this result can be explained by a reduction in the irradiation time of plasma on water volume as well as ozone concentration in the water the mechanism of e coli removal is suggested to be a synergistic effect of ultraviolet ozone and high electric fields 3 1 2 water retention time after plasma treatment similar to the experiments in the above sections groundwater samples were also contaminated with ferrous iron arsenic and e coli the water quality parameters of these water samples are shown in table 3 after being contaminated the total iron arsenic and e coli concentrations were measured to be 4 16 mg l 0 31 mg l and 2400 mpn 100 ml respectively the experiment was carried at a flow rate of 2 l min the retention time of water after treatment in the effluent tank was changed in steps from 10 min to 35 min experimental results showed that ozone concentration in the water after treatment significantly decreased when increasing the retention time fig 7 the ozone dissolved in water after treatment was completely decomposed after 30 min of storing treated water in the effluent tank the concentration of total iron decreased by about 98 9 from 4 16 mg l to 0 042 mg l in the first 10 min after treatment and gradually decreased as the retention time increased to 35 min fig 8 at the same time arsenic concentration decreased by 99 4 from 0 31 mg l to 0 002 mg l in the first 10 min and seem to unchange in the next 20 min fig 9 however when the retention time increased to 35 min the arsenic concentration decreased by about 50 from 0 002 mg l to about 0 001 mg l the experimental results also showed that the retention time significantly affected the concentration of e coli after 10 min of water storage in the outlet tank about 93 8 of e coli was removed when the retention time was increased to 15 min e coli was not detected in the water samples fig 10 this means that the retention time of groundwater in the outlet tank was at least 15 min to achieve high treatment efficiency 3 2 efficiency of removing iron arsenic and e coli from groundwater 3 2 1 iron removal to evaluate the efficiency of iron removal by cold plasma ferrous irons were added into groundwater samples to concentrations of 3 76 mg l and 9 09 mg l water quality parameters before and after treatment are given in table 4 the experiments were carried out at a flow rate of 2 l min and the retention time of water samples after treatment was 30 min it is seen from table 4 that cold plasma is highly effective in removing iron at a low concentration 3 76 mg l about 98 9 of iron is removed by cold plasma however when the iron concentration increased to 9 mg l the treatment efficiency of cold plasma slightly decreased and was about 97 8 it is evident that within the investigated concentrations the initial concentration of ferrous irons insignificantly affects the treatment efficiency of removing iron of cold plasma 3 2 2 arsenic removal for determining the efficiency of arsenic removal by cold plasma arsenic was added into groundwater samples to concentrations of 0 087 mg l and 0 22 mg l water quality parameters of water samples before and after treatment are given in table 5 experiments were carried out at a water flow rate of 2 l min the retention time of water samples after treatment was still 30 min experimental results show that at a low arsenic concentration about 88 7 arsenic was removed by cold plasma however when the arsenic concentration was increased to 0 22 mg l the treatment efficiency of cold plasma was significantly reduced and only reached about 50 this means that the treatment efficiency of the system is dependent on initial concentrations of arsenic the influence of iron ions on the effectiveness of arsenic removal is shown in fig 11 for case of without presence of iron ions the efficiency of removing arsenic concentration was only 50 0 22 mg l compared 0 11 mg l with the presence of fe2 the arsenic level after treatment was only 0 044 mg l this means that the efficiency of arsenic removal from water reached about 80 apparently addition of ferrous iron can increase arsenic treatment efficiency by about 30 the reason is that the efficiency of removing arsenic from groundwater significantly depends on the presence of iron ions tiwari and pandey 2013 in groundwater ferrous iron is oxidised into ferric iron which can react with arsenic to form ferric arsenate complex feaso4 2h2o another possibility is that as5 with low concentration can react with fe3 having high concentration to form co precipitation it was also observed that the addition of both ferrous and ferric irons significantly raised the effectiveness of arsenic removal after treatment very low concentration of arsenic in water was detected 0 7 μg l it means that cold plasma removed about 99 6 of arsenic from water in comparison with case of adding only fe2 fe3 can increase the efficiency of removal of arsenic from water by cold plasma by about 20 the similar result was reported in a reference viet 2013 3 2 3 e coli removal the effectiveness of removing e coli by cold plasma was determined with low and high concentrations initial concentrations of e coli were 7 33 mpn 100 ml and 722 67 mpn 100 ml the experiments were performed at the flow rate of 2 l min and the retention time of water samples after treatment of 30 min the experiment results were shown in table 6 in both cases of low and high concentrations all e coli were killed by cold plasma this confirms the high efficiency of using cold plasma to remove e coli in water 3 3 efficiency of groundwater treatment by cold plasma 3 3 1 water treatment with a small scale model in laboratory in this testing groundwater samples were first infected with ferrous iron arsenic and e coli to concentrations shown in table 7 in addition fe3 was added into water samples to a concentration of 2 mg l the water flow rate was 2 l min and the retention time of water after treatment in the effluent tank was 30 min the experimental results were also shown in table 7 it was seen that ph slightly increased by about 5 after treatment at the same time the electric conductivity of water treatment decreased a little 4 6 total iron and arsenic were highly removed after plasma treatment after treatment about 98 9 of iron was removed while approximately 99 9 of arsenic was eliminated due to the removal of iron turbidity of water after treatment significantly decreased moreover cold plasma showed a high capability of removing e coli all e coli in groundwater samples was killed after treatment this result is similar to previous reports on cold plasma studies velázquez et al 2013 rashmei et al 2016 slow sand filtration cotruvo et al 1999 ceramic filtration lange et al 2016 uv radiation hijnen et al 2006 and ozonation sharrer and summerfelt 2007 however the negative effect of cold plasma is to significantly raise the concentration of nitrate after treatment nitrate concentration was raised by about 2 times this is due to the presence of moist air inside plasma chambers fridman 2008 an increase in nitrate concentration due to cold plasma treatment was reported grinevich et al 2011 rong et al 2014 however this value of nitrate is still far below the threshold value of the vietnamese standard 50 mg l moh 2009 as well as who guidelines 50 mg l who 2011 3 3 2 water treatment with the prototype the prototype was installed to treat groundwater directly pumped from a drilled well in a household and operated with the treatment process presented in fig 2 it was recorded that the prototype consumed about 1 5 kwh of electrical energy for 1 m3 of water treated quality parameters of groundwater samples before and after treatment are presented in table 8 it was found that after treatment all parameters of water complied with the vietnamese standard and who guidelines the prototype can remove colour and odour in addition it was observed that the prototype effectively decreased turbidity ammonia total iron permanganate index and hardness however ph was obtained to increase by about 15 the other parameters may have value which is lower than limit of detection lod of test equipment therefore treatment effectiveness of the prototype for these parameters could not specify the prototype can remove about 99 6 of ammonia which was oxidised to nitrate by ozonation singer 1975 in addition the prototype eliminates 98 3 of total iron from water samples from 1 74 mg l to 0 03 mg l this is similar to result received when groundwater was treated with ozone araby et al 2009 it was also obtained that hardness of groundwater after treatment reduced by about 87 2 which indicates the effectiveness of using cation exchange resin it is inferred that cold plasma combined with cation exchange resin and fine filter can efficiently treat varieties of pollutants in groundwater 4 conclusions cold plasma showed a high efficiency in removal of iron and e coli in groundwater however the effectiveness of arsenic removal of cold plasma is not high therefore it is necessary to add ferric iron into groundwater to enhance the elimination of arsenic the combination of cold plasma with cation exchange resin and fine filter successfully treats groundwater for domestic use purpose and the quality parameters of groundwater after treatment with the prototype are in accordance with the vietnamese standard and the who guidelines the biggest limitation of cold plasma is to produce nitrate during treatment time acknowledgement this research is

effluent tank was 30 min the experimental results were also shown in table 7 it was seen that ph slightly increased by about 5 after treatment at the same time the electric conductivity of water treatment decreased a little 4 6 total iron and arsenic were highly removed after plasma treatment after treatment about 98 9 of iron was removed while approximately 99 9 of arsenic was eliminated due to the removal of iron turbidity of water after treatment significantly decreased moreover cold plasma showed a high capability of removing e coli all e coli in groundwater samples was killed after treatment this result is similar to previous reports on cold plasma studies velázquez et al 2013 rashmei et al 2016 slow sand filtration cotruvo et al 1999 ceramic filtration lange et al 2016 uv radiation hijnen et al 2006 and ozonation sharrer and summerfelt 2007 however the negative effect of cold plasma is to significantly raise the concentration of nitrate after treatment nitrate concentration was raised by about 2 times this is due to the presence of moist air inside plasma chambers fridman 2008 an increase in nitrate concentration due to cold plasma treatment was reported grinevich et al 2011 rong et al 2014 however this value of nitrate is still far below the threshold value of the vietnamese standard 50 mg l moh 2009 as well as who guidelines 50 mg l who 2011 3 3 2 water treatment with the prototype the prototype was installed to treat groundwater directly pumped from a drilled well in a household and operated with the treatment process presented in fig 2 it was recorded that the prototype consumed about 1 5 kwh of electrical energy for 1 m3 of water treated quality parameters of groundwater samples before and after treatment are presented in table 8 it was found that after treatment all parameters of water complied with the vietnamese standard and who guidelines the prototype can remove colour and odour in addition it was observed that the prototype effectively decreased turbidity ammonia total iron permanganate index and hardness however ph was obtained to increase by about 15 the other parameters may have value which is lower than limit of detection lod of test equipment therefore treatment effectiveness of the prototype for these parameters could not specify the prototype can remove about 99 6 of ammonia which was oxidised to nitrate by ozonation singer 1975 in addition the prototype eliminates 98 3 of total iron from water samples from 1 74 mg l to 0 03 mg l this is similar to result received when groundwater was treated with ozone araby et al 2009 it was also obtained that hardness of groundwater after treatment reduced by about 87 2 which indicates the effectiveness of using cation exchange resin it is inferred that cold plasma combined with cation exchange resin and fine filter can efficiently treat varieties of pollutants in groundwater 4 conclusions cold plasma showed a high efficiency in removal of iron and e coli in groundwater however the effectiveness of arsenic removal of cold plasma is not high therefore it is necessary to add ferric iron into groundwater to enhance the elimination of arsenic the combination of cold plasma with cation exchange resin and fine filter successfully treats groundwater for domestic use purpose and the quality parameters of groundwater after treatment with the prototype are in accordance with the vietnamese standard and the who guidelines the biggest limitation of cold plasma is to produce nitrate during treatment time acknowledgement this research is

operating parameters of aas 7000 are given in table 1 2 5 data analysis 2 5 1 geo accumulation index the geo accumulation index igeo was presented by muller 1969 this index is applied to quantify the metal pollution in the soils and aquatic sediments the geo accumulation index igeo for soil samples was calculated using the following equation eq 1 1 i g e o log 2 c n 1 5 b n where cn concentration of metal measured in soil samples in the study area bn bn is the average crustal concentration of element n in shale background 1 5 is the background matrix correction due to lithological effects the shale rock value fe 46 700 cr 90 cu 45 cd 0 3 mn 850 and zn 95 μg g 1 are considered as bn according to huu 2010 the level of metal pollution is assessed in terms of seven contamination classes based on the increasing numerical value of the index as follows i geo 0 means unpolluted 0 i geo 1 means unpolluted to moderately polluted 1 i geo 2 means moderately polluted 2 i geo 3 means moderately to strongly polluted 3 i geo 4 means strongly polluted 4 i geo 5 means strongly to very strongly polluted i geo 5 means very strongly polluted 2 5 2 heavy metal pollution index according to pal et al 2017 hpi shows the overall quality of water with regard to the content of heavy metals the critical hpi value is 100 milivojević et al 2016 the weighted arithmetic average of the concentrations was used to calculate hpi values using eq 2 given by mohan et al 1996 2 h p i i 1 n wiqi i 1 n wi where wi is the unit weightage defined as the reciprocal value of si si is the maximum permissible limit for drinking water according to pal et al 2017 and kumar and puri 2012 n is the number of parameters considered qi is the sub index of the ith parameter which is calculated by eq 3 3 q i i 1 n mi si 100 in eq 3 mi is the monitored value of the heavy metal si is the standard value of the ith parameter in ppm μg l 2 5 3 transfer factor tf according to kachenko and singh 2006 the transfer factor was calculated by dividing the concentration of the heavy metal in the selected plant sample by that of the total heavy metal concentration in the soil which is shown by equation 4 4 t f c p l a n t c s o i l where c p l a n t metal concentration in plant tissue c s o i l metal concentration in dry soil 2 5 4 statistical analysis pearson s correlation coefficient is calculated to show the relationships among the examined metal concentration using spss windows version 16 0 mean standard deviation maximum and minimum values were analyzed by microsoft excel pearson correlation was tested at 99 confidence level following formula was used to calculate correlation r in eq 5 5 r n x y x y n x 2 x 2 n y 2 y 2 where r is the pearson correlation coefficient measured between two variables x and y 3 result and discussion 3 1 heavy metal contents in water analysis of heavy metals such as fe mn cu zn pb and cd in water is important because of their toxicity with their possible transformation into the body of humans and animals via the food chain table 2 shows the concentration of heavy metals of the collected water sample from the site the concentration ranges of the heavy metals found in the mogla bazar landfill site were fe 0 03 0 97 mg l zn 0 00 0 12 mg l cu 0 00 0 16 mg l mn 0 01 0 99 mg l cd 0 00 0 05 mg l and pb 0 00 0 33 mg l respectively the concentration ranges of ph and ec were 5 65 8 04 and 0 03 0 90 ms cm respectively the maximum pb concentration 0 33 mg l was found in surface water 1 sw1 sample which is located in the eastern low lying haorarea whereas the maximum concentration of cd 0 05 was found in sw5 sample which was leachate the maximum fe zn cu mn was detected in gw2 sw4 sw5 sw4 respectively in fig 2 the mean concentration of fe zn and cu were 0 24 0 36 0 04 0 04 and 0 05 0 06 and the mean concentration of mn pb and cd were 0 26 0 42 0 16 0 12 and 0 01 0 02 respectively according to the recommended level of who 1998 and kumar and puri 2012 for drinking water the mean concentration of fe mn cd and the pb exceed the allowable limit besides the other zn cu was within the allowable limit based on the isi awashthi 2000 the mean concentration of all metals except zn exceed the allowable limits on the other hand the cd and pb concentration of metals exceed the recommended level by usepa 2010 the tendency of mean heavy metal concentration of water was like this order mn fe pb cu zn cd 3 2 heavy metal contents in soil in this study heavy metal concentration was also analyzed in the soil around the landfill site table 3 shows the heavy metal contents in soil the concentration ranges of heavy metal in soil were found fe 29 8 302 6 μg g zn 0 29 14 5 μg g cu 0 047 5 4 μg g mn 5 08 133 6 μg g pb 0 08 42 9 μg g and cd 0 0 67 μg g respectively the maximum pb content found in s1 3 haor soil sample which is located 50 cm depth from the surface level the maximum cd concentration 0 67 μg g was in 50 cm depth of s6 3 sample the maximum level of fe zn cu and mn concentration were detected in s1 3 50 cm s5 1 0 cm s1 3 50 cm and s1 1 0 cm respectively where the maximum level of concentration was identified in the low lying haor region because of the easy movement of leachate from the landfill site besides in sample 2 which is a fishing zone it is clearly shown that in a specific time the accumulation was lower it is because of not to spreading leachate from the dumping zone for lower rainfall or not to use chemicals in the fishing zone based on the european union and indian standard limit all the heavy metal contents in soil were found in the allowable limit in fig 3 the mean concentration of fe zn and cu were shown 137 79 94 75 3 75 5 04 1 63 1 38 respectively the mean concentration of mn pb and cd were found 31 23 30 47 14 22 14 63 and 0 15 0 21 are shown in fig 3 the trend of heavy metal contents of soil was fe mn pb zn cu cd see table 3 3 3 heavy metal contents in plant the plant p samples were also gathered from the landfill site to detect the toxicity transferred to the food chain the concentration ranges were found fe 14 65 35 89 mg kg zn 29 62 64 81 mg kg cu 17 24 21 64 mg kg mn 28 88 338 mg kg pb 0 2 1 mg kg and cd 0 05 0 07 mg kg respectively according to the who fao 2007 recommended limit the mean concentration of all the heavy metals were within the permissible limit the maximum concentration of cd was detected in solanummelongena in ipomoea batatas there was the highest cu content found whereas the highest concentration of fe was detected in the oryza sativa sample in luffaacutangula raphanus sativa var longipinnatus and oryza sativa contains the highest amount of pb zn and mn contents respectively in fact the zn concentration was higher than the recommended value by eu 2002 and is 2000 in the selected plant sample in fig 4 the mean concentration of fe zn and cu were analyzed 26 63 8 26 45 85 16 04 19 59 1 69 and the mean concentration of mn pb cd were detected 125 11 126 78 0 54 0 36 0 06 0 01 respectively see table 4 3 4 geo accumulation index the igeo values of the studied heavy metals are given in table 5 the igeo for pb in s2 1 s2 3 s3 2 s3 3 s4 2 were in class 0 and 1 in s1 3 pb value was calculated 1 14 the cd igeo value was 0 36 in s2 3 the values were found 1 14 and 1 16 in s4 1 and s6 3 respectively the other igeo of fe zn cu and mn were less than 0 indicating that the soils was not polluted according to huu 2010 in s2 3 the igeo of pb and cd were classified into the 2nd class indicates unpolluted to moderately polluted the soil condition for pb in s2 1 s3 2 s3 3 s4 2 were also unpolluted to moderately polluted the soils was moderately polluted in s1 3 s 4 1 and s6 3 the igeo for pb and cd in the landfill site ranged from 7 93 to 1 14 and 5 91 to 1 16 with a mean concentration of 2 14 3 06 and 1 69 1 80 respectively in fig 5 a reflected the igeo concentration value where the maximum and minimum igeo for all the heavy metals were listed in fig 5 b this figure indicates the positive maximum values of pb and cd in the area 3 5 heavy metal pollution index the high hpi values were mainly due to industrial and domestic wastewater discharge into the rive r pal et al 2017 table 6 shows the details of calculating hpi wi and qi values respectively in table 6 the mean hpi value resulted in the present study was 311 61 which is above the critical value 100 milivojević et al 2016 so the hpi value suggests that the overall water samples were critically polluted with respect to heavy metals concentration see table 6 3 6 transfer factor transfer factor tf or plant concentration factor pcf is a parameter used to determine the transfer of trace elements from soil to plant aktaruzzaman 2013 the mean tf values of fe zn cu mn pb and cd were 0 36 2 19 6 92 0 69 0 01 and 0 20 respectively the transfer factor for heavy metals decreased as follows cu zn mn cd fe pb see table 7 the highest tf value recorded in cu 119 25 zn 56 61 mn 38 45 cd 1 19 pb 1 92 and fe 0 77 the higher tf value of any metal in any plant indicates that the higher movement of metal in the plant body baker and brooks 1989 3 7 pearson correlation matrix to identify the important factors involved in controlling the transport and distribution of metal contaminants the statistical analysis was performed chen et al 2012 liu et al 2003 it was done to enlighten the associations among heavy metals hoque 2014 the pearson s correlation matrix was performed to detect the interrelation among the heavy metal contents in table 8 the heavy metals in water showed significant correlation except for fe and pb among the soil samples zn and cd were shown the negative correlation the metal pb and fe represent a lower number of significant relationships in the computation processes in plant sample there was no significant correlation whereas a high correlation among the water sample indicates the vulnerable condition for the study area see table 9 table 8 3 8 comparison with other regions the fe zn and cd concentration were lower than in other countries on the other hand pb concentration was higher than all of the other countries except china the variations in heavy metal contents of different samples may be due to differences in the geographical location of the landfill waste management of the entire country environmental conditions seasonal changes physiochemical characteristics and climatic variation of the growing regions and matrix to matrix transfer see table 9 3 9 precision and accuracy according to table 10 the mean percent recoveries for the metals ranged between 94 02 and 99 07 all the recovery values were within the acceptable range of 80 120 for metal analysis addis and abebaw 2017 the precision of the method was expressed as rsd ranged from 8 62 to 200 these results indicate that the proposed method was accurate and moderately precise 4 conclusions this study showed the metal concentration and distribution in water soil and plant within a multi ring buffer zone from the mogla bazar landfill site which could impact on human health by entering the food chain the concentration of fe mn cd and pb in water were higher than the permissible limit because of leachate migration adjacent water body and low lying topography are responsible for the heavy metal accumulation in water though the mean absorption of heavy metals in soil was within the allowable limit some area will be at high risk the concentration of pb fe and mn were found higher than other elements in the soil pb mn and zn concentration of some plants were higher than the allowable limit luffaacutangula oryza sativa and raphanussativus var longipinnatus plants were accumulated at higher concentration of heavy metals according to huu 2010 the mean igeo values of pb and cd indicate that the soil was moderately contaminated and some of them were unpolluted to moderately polluted in the area the mean value of hpi index was 311 61 which was above the critical value of 100 milivojević et al 2016 the highest tf value was recorded in the case of cu zn and mn contents in the water sample there was a significant positive correlation except for fe and pb on the other hand cd and zn were negatively correlated in soil samples there was no significant correlation with plant samples comparing with the other region s data pb concentration was higher than the other countries except for china in general the environmental situation of the study area was not good in the landfill site consequently it will be tended to the hazardous condition for future better waste management sustainable development and steady monitoring of these toxic metals of the landfill site will prevent excessive accumulation in the food

floodplain in the mogla bazar union under sylhetsadarzilla which is approximately within at 24 5100 n and 91 5230 e it is situated beside the sylhet sreemangal highway road flexible road infrastructure located near the city large open space is responsible for the development of the dumping zone according to barc 1999 the inundation land type of the area is low land land normally inundated upto 180 300 cm depth the soil quality of the study area is noncalcareous grey floodplain soils nonsaline the area lies in the north eastern zone of bangladesh is highly vulnerable for flash flood and the surface geology of the study area is alluvial silt and clay shamsudduha et al 2011 the landfill site is open with an area of about 4 15 ha alampur and shunargaon union are situated just beside the landfill site 2 2 sample collection and treatment 2 2 1 water sample collection water samples were collected from eight different stations among them six water samples were from surface water sw and the rest two were from groundwater gw through composite sampling method surface water samples were collected from leachate adjacent water body commercial fishing zone haor settlement area and the groundwater samples were collected from adjacent wells 2 2 2 soil sample collection soil samples were collected at every 25 cm interval to find out the soil quality over the years and to show the chronological change top surface 25 cm and 50 cm depth from top surface using auger boring all soil samples were air dried at room temperature in a dust free place sieved to 2 mm through a stainless steel sieve and homogenized preserved in clean plastic containers for subsequent use chrastný et al 2012 2 2 3 plant sample collection five plant samples namely ipomoeabatatas raphanus sweet potato sativa var longipinnatus radish luffaacutangula ridge gourd solanummelongena eggplant and oryza sativa rice were collected with a stainless steel trowel and a knife plant samples were collected from where soil samples were collected plant samples from roots grain leaves and fruit were collected using pre cleaned zipper bags kamal et al 2016 plant leaves were rinsed with distilled water and dried to a constant weight in an oven nouri et al 2009 the dried plant samples were then demolished to powder using acid washed mortar and pestle and passed through 2 mm mesh sieve abdallah 2012 all the sample location are shown in fig 1 latitude and longitude values of the samples were derived froma gps hand tool the north eastern low lying area of the landfill site was mainly selected for sampling by creating a multi ring buffer zone of 100 200 300 400 500 m from the dumping site the number of samples was derived from the localization of important landform features such as fishing zone haor agricultural field etc were located near to the landfill all the samples were collected from september 2018 to december 2018 the laboratory for soil research development srdi sylhet was used for analyzing the heavy metals concentration quality control data of heavy metal contents detected by atomic absorption were analyzed to test the quality control samples first to check that the calibration function is linear and then to test the performance of the recalibrated aas system samples for quality control were stored as appropriate for the specific aas system to ensure that all sample analyses of samples from a given batch were performed properly 2 3 precision and accuracy precision and accuracy of the analytical methods were determined by recovery and repeatability of the

45 min to allow for oxidation after cooling 2 ml of hclo 3 70 was added and the mixture was reheated on a hot plate until the digest became clear and semi dried then the sample was cooled and filtered through whatman no 42 filter paper finally it was transferred to a 50 ml volumetric flask by adding deionized distilled water 2 4 sample analysis the ph of the water was determined by the ph tester model hanna h19125 and the ec of the water was tested by model hanna h18733 by using distilled water the electrode was pre rinsed thoroughly and wiped by using tissue paper kamal et al 2016 for recording the final value the electrode was plunged into the sample and wait until a stable reading was observed the concentration of fe zn cu mn pb cd were observed by using atomic absorption spectroscopy model aa 7000 shimadzu corporation japan by following the standard level apha 2003 the absorption wavelength slit current etc for the determination of each heavy metal type and other operating parameters of aas 7000 are given in table 1 2 5 data analysis 2 5 1 geo accumulation index the geo accumulation index igeo was presented by muller 1969 this index is applied to quantify the metal pollution in the soils and aquatic sediments the geo accumulation index igeo for soil samples was calculated using the following equation eq 1 1 i g e o log 2 c n 1 5 b n where cn concentration of metal measured in soil samples in the study area bn bn is the average crustal concentration of element n in shale background 1 5 is the background matrix correction due to lithological effects the shale rock value fe 46 700 cr 90 cu 45 cd 0 3 mn 850 and zn 95 μg g 1 are considered as bn according to huu 2010 the level of metal pollution is assessed in terms of seven contamination classes based on the increasing numerical value of the index as follows i geo 0 means unpolluted 0 i geo 1 means unpolluted to moderately polluted 1 i geo 2 means moderately polluted 2 i geo 3 means moderately to strongly polluted 3 i geo 4 means strongly polluted 4 i geo 5 means strongly to very strongly polluted i geo 5 means very strongly polluted 2 5 2 heavy metal pollution index according to pal et al 2017 hpi shows the overall quality of water with regard to the content of heavy metals the critical hpi value is 100 milivojević et al 2016 the weighted arithmetic average of the concentrations was used to calculate hpi values using eq 2 given by mohan et al 1996 2 h p i i 1 n wiqi i 1 n wi where wi is the unit weightage defined as the reciprocal value of si si is the maximum permissible limit for drinking water according to pal et al 2017 and kumar and puri 2012 n is the number of parameters considered qi is the sub index of the ith parameter which is calculated by eq 3 3 q i i 1 n mi si 100 in eq 3 mi is the monitored value of the heavy metal si is the standard value of the ith parameter in ppm μg l 2 5 3 transfer factor tf according to kachenko and singh 2006 the transfer factor was calculated by dividing the concentration of the heavy metal in the selected plant sample by that of the total heavy metal concentration in the soil which is shown by equation 4 4 t f c p l a n t c s o i l where c p l a n t metal concentration in plant tissue c s o i l metal concentration in dry soil 2 5 4 statistical analysis pearson s correlation coefficient is calculated to show the relationships among the examined metal concentration using spss windows version 16 0 mean standard deviation maximum and minimum values were analyzed by microsoft excel pearson correlation was tested at 99 confidence level following formula was used to calculate correlation r in eq 5 5 r n x y x y n x 2 x 2 n y 2 y 2 where r is the pearson correlation coefficient measured between two variables x and y 3 result and discussion 3 1 heavy metal contents in water analysis of heavy metals such as fe mn cu zn pb and cd in water is important because of their toxicity with their possible transformation into the body of humans and animals via the food chain table 2 shows the concentration of heavy metals of the collected water sample from the site the concentration ranges of the heavy metals found in the mogla bazar landfill site were fe 0 03 0 97 mg l zn 0 00 0 12 mg l cu 0 00 0 16 mg l mn 0 01 0 99 mg l cd 0 00 0 05 mg l and pb 0 00 0 33 mg l respectively the concentration ranges of ph and ec were 5 65 8 04 and 0 03 0 90 ms cm respectively the maximum pb concentration 0 33 mg l was found in surface water 1 sw1 sample which is located in the eastern low lying haorarea whereas the maximum concentration of cd 0 05 was found in sw5 sample which was leachate the maximum fe zn cu mn was detected in gw2 sw4 sw5 sw4 respectively in fig 2 the mean concentration of fe zn and cu were 0 24 0 36 0 04 0 04 and 0 05 0 06 and the mean concentration of mn pb and cd were 0 26 0 42 0 16 0 12 and 0 01 0 02 respectively according to the recommended level of who 1998 and kumar and puri 2012 for drinking water the mean concentration of fe mn cd and the pb exceed the allowable limit besides the other zn cu was within the allowable limit based on the isi awashthi 2000 the mean concentration of all metals except zn exceed the allowable limits on the other hand the cd and pb concentration of metals exceed the recommended level by usepa 2010 the tendency of mean heavy metal concentration of water was like this order mn fe pb cu zn cd 3 2 heavy metal contents in soil in this study heavy metal concentration was also analyzed in the soil around the landfill site table 3 shows the heavy metal contents in soil the concentration ranges of heavy metal in soil were found fe 29 8 302 6 μg g zn 0 29 14 5 μg g cu 0 047 5 4 μg g mn 5 08 133 6 μg g pb 0 08 42 9 μg g and cd 0 0 67 μg g respectively the maximum pb content found in s1 3 haor soil sample which is located 50 cm depth from the surface level the maximum cd concentration 0 67 μg g was in 50 cm depth of s6 3 sample the maximum level of fe zn cu and mn concentration were detected in s1 3 50 cm s5 1 0 cm s1 3 50 cm and s1 1 0 cm respectively where the maximum level of concentration was identified in the low lying haor region because of the easy movement of leachate from the landfill site besides in sample 2 which is a fishing zone it is clearly shown that in a specific time the accumulation was lower it is because of not to spreading leachate from the dumping zone for lower rainfall or not to use chemicals in the fishing zone based on the european union and indian standard limit all the heavy metal contents in soil were found in the allowable limit in fig 3 the mean concentration of fe zn and cu were shown 137 79 94 75 3 75 5 04 1 63 1 38 respectively the mean concentration of mn pb and cd were found 31 23 30 47 14 22 14 63 and 0 15 0 21 are shown in fig 3 the trend of heavy metal contents of soil was fe mn pb zn cu cd see table 3 3 3 heavy metal contents in plant the plant p samples were also gathered from the landfill site to detect the toxicity transferred to the food chain the concentration ranges were found fe 14 65 35 89 mg kg zn 29 62 64 81 mg kg cu 17 24 21 64 mg kg mn 28 88 338 mg kg pb 0 2 1 mg kg and cd 0 05 0 07 mg kg respectively according to the who fao 2007 recommended limit the mean concentration of all the heavy metals were within the permissible limit the maximum concentration of cd was detected in solanummelongena in ipomoea batatas there was the highest cu content found whereas the highest concentration of fe was detected in the oryza sativa sample in luffaacutangula raphanus sativa var longipinnatus and oryza sativa contains the highest amount of pb zn and mn contents respectively in fact the zn concentration was higher than the recommended value by eu 2002 and is 2000 in the selected plant sample in fig 4 the mean concentration of fe zn and cu were analyzed 26 63 8 26 45 85 16 04 19 59 1 69 and the mean concentration of mn pb cd were detected 125 11 126 78 0 54 0 36 0 06 0 01 respectively see table 4 3 4 geo accumulation index the igeo values of the studied heavy metals are given in table 5 the igeo for pb in s2 1 s2 3 s3 2 s3 3 s4 2 were in class 0 and 1 in s1 3 pb value was calculated 1 14 the cd igeo value was 0 36 in s2 3 the values were found 1 14 and 1 16 in s4 1 and s6 3 respectively the other igeo of fe zn cu and mn were less than 0 indicating that the soils was not polluted according to huu 2010 in s2 3 the igeo of pb and cd were classified into the 2nd class indicates unpolluted to moderately polluted the soil condition for pb in s2 1 s3 2 s3 3 s4 2 were also unpolluted to moderately polluted the soils was moderately polluted in s1 3 s 4 1 and s6 3 the igeo for pb and cd in the landfill site ranged from 7 93 to 1 14 and 5 91 to 1 16 with a mean concentration of 2 14 3 06 and 1 69 1 80 respectively in fig 5 a reflected the igeo concentration value where the maximum and minimum igeo for all the heavy metals were listed in fig 5 b this figure indicates the positive maximum values of pb and cd in the area 3 5 heavy metal pollution index the high hpi values were mainly due to industrial and domestic wastewater discharge into the rive r pal et al 2017 table 6 shows the details of calculating hpi wi and qi values respectively in table 6 the mean hpi value resulted in the present study was 311 61 which is above the critical value 100 milivojević et al 2016 so the hpi value suggests that the overall water samples were critically polluted with respect to heavy metals concentration see table 6 3 6 transfer factor transfer factor tf or plant concentration factor pcf is a parameter used to determine the transfer of trace elements from soil to plant aktaruzzaman 2013 the mean tf values of fe zn cu mn pb and cd were 0 36 2 19 6 92 0 69 0 01 and 0 20 respectively the transfer factor for heavy metals decreased as follows cu zn mn cd fe pb see table 7 the highest tf value recorded in cu 119 25 zn 56 61 mn 38 45 cd 1 19 pb 1 92 and fe 0 77 the higher tf value of any metal in any plant indicates that the higher movement of metal in the plant body baker and brooks 1989 3 7 pearson correlation matrix to identify the important factors involved in controlling the transport and distribution of metal contaminants the statistical analysis was performed chen et al 2012 liu et al 2003 it was done to enlighten the associations among heavy metals hoque 2014 the pearson s correlation matrix was performed to detect the interrelation among the heavy metal contents in table 8 the heavy metals in water showed significant correlation except for fe and pb among the soil samples zn and cd were shown the negative correlation the metal pb and fe represent a lower number of significant relationships in the computation processes in plant sample there was no significant correlation whereas a high correlation among the water sample indicates the vulnerable condition for the study area see table 9 table 8 3 8 comparison with other regions the fe zn and cd concentration were lower than in other countries on the other hand pb concentration was higher than all of the other countries except china the variations in heavy metal contents of different samples may be due to differences in the geographical location of the landfill waste management of the entire country environmental conditions seasonal changes physiochemical characteristics and climatic variation of the growing regions and matrix to matrix transfer see table 9 3 9 precision and accuracy according to table 10 the mean percent recoveries for the metals ranged between 94 02 and 99 07 all the recovery values were within the acceptable range of 80 120 for metal analysis addis and abebaw 2017 the precision of the method was expressed as rsd ranged from 8 62 to 200 these results indicate that the proposed method was accurate and moderately precise 4 conclusions this study showed the metal concentration and distribution in water soil and plant within a multi ring buffer zone from the mogla bazar landfill site which could impact on human health by entering the food chain the concentration of fe mn cd and pb in water were higher than the permissible limit because of leachate migration adjacent water body and low lying topography are responsible for the heavy metal accumulation in water though the mean absorption of heavy metals in soil was within the allowable limit some area will be at high risk the concentration of pb fe and mn were found higher than other elements in the soil pb mn and zn concentration of some plants were higher than the allowable limit luffaacutangula oryza sativa and raphanussativus var longipinnatus plants were accumulated at higher concentration of heavy metals according to huu 2010 the mean igeo values of pb and cd indicate that the soil was moderately contaminated and some of them were unpolluted to moderately polluted in the area the mean value of hpi index was 311 61 which was above the critical value of 100 milivojević et al 2016 the highest tf value was recorded in the case of cu zn and mn contents in the water sample there was a significant positive correlation except for fe and pb on the other hand cd and zn were negatively correlated in soil samples there was no significant correlation with plant samples comparing with the other region s data pb concentration was higher than the other countries except for china in general the environmental situation of the study area was not good in the landfill site consequently it will be tended to the hazardous condition for future better waste management sustainable development and steady monitoring of these toxic metals of the landfill site will prevent excessive accumulation in the food

12139,globally natural and human interference is affecting aquifer recharge and quality of ground water this study focuses on changes in groundwater hydrochemistry in south and central part of gujarat state in india to identify vulnerable hotspots under seasonal variations and anthropogenic activities forty five groundwater and soil samples were collected over three seasons from random locations of south and central gujarat the samples were analyzed for physico chemical characteristics dominance of cations and anions during post monsoon was in higher to lower order of na mg ca k and cl so4 2 hco3 in groundwater the piper classification for hydrogeochemical facies indicates all monsoon samples were of ca cl type residual sodium carbonate values revealed that 46 samples were not suitable for irrigation purposes in pre monsoon samples collected during post monsoon from vyara and ukai and during pre monsoon from central gujarat were of doubtful to unsuitable category as per wilcox s diagram during the post monsoon season moderate and bad quality water rose owing to the enrichment of sodium and electrical conductivity the groundwater quality in post monsoon for all constituents were higher at some places due to dissolution of surface pollutants and infiltration after flooding with percolation of rainwater none of the samples from pre monsoon fell under class i category permeability index 75 due to leaching of ions through industrial agricultural or domestic discharges soil permeability index varied from monsoon to post and pre monsoon groundwater quality of vadodara bharuch and tapi districts were affected by geological and anthropogenic activities while ground water in vansda and ahwa were less affected due to limited industrialization as well as geographical location the cumulative hydrochemistry during post and pre monsoon was found to be higher than permissible limits due to leaching of contaminants judicious management of efficient irrigation industrial waste treatment modern agricultural practices rainwater harvesting to conserve groundwater quality of study area are critical graphical abstract image 1 keywords agriculture anthropogenic activities groundwater hydrochemistry rainfall 1 introduction global warming has a significant impact on hydrological cycle houghton et al 1995 a large part of groundwater is being used by the agriculture sector according to studies by shiklomanov 1997 groundwater demand for irrigation is about 67 of the global water withdrawal and 87 of the consumptive water uses agriculture is the main source of livelihood for the population and this sector alone represents 23 of india s gross national product gnp which plays a crucial role in the country s socio economic development however agriculture is sensitive to short term changes in weather as well as seasonal annual and longer term variations in climate human interference in terms of over exploitation industrialization and farm practices make agriculture sector more vulnerable to climate change impacts thus the effect of climate change would be direct in the rain fed agriculture and indirect in surface and groundwater fed areas zhou et al 2010 agriculture mainly depends on groundwater in arid and semi arid regions however unconstrained use is causing exhaustion in aquifer recharge and quality of water the change in temperature and rainfall patterns due to climate change would directly deprive soil availability which increases the irrigation demand from groundwater resulting into a great impact on agriculture yield the movement of contaminants naturally or by human activities is accelerated as a result of rainfall that runoff and infiltration contaminating nearby streams and lakes or infiltration affecting aquifers climate change in terms of increased rainfall and temperature also affects soil structure by its physical properties which can change the groundwater chemistry the quality of irrigation water depends upon various types of salts which constitute salinity and sodicity of the water the total concentration of soluble salts proportion of sodium ions to other cations concentration of toxic elements such as boron lead chromium ratios ions of carbonate co3 2 or bicarbonate hco3 sulfate so4 2 or chloride cl play a significant role in determining the irrigation water quality especially in arid and semiarid areas it has become compulsion for the farmers of arid and semi arid areas to use available resources irrespective of its doubtful quality goyal 2013 the analysis of aquifer characteristics of sites with known climate physiography source of contamination and geology provides a tool in investigation and in the prediction and prevention of future contamination of downstream water bodies therefore it is important to carry out discrete analysis of ground water quality and regional soil streta to identify vulnerable hotspots which need immediate arbitration gujarat is privileged with characteristic features viz longest coastline 14 river basins and diverse geology this makes the semi arid gujarat more exposed to climate change hiremath and shiyani 2012 gujarat has special economic significance due to its high population density and intense agricultural activities the alluvial sediments carried by the river are deposited and form productive fertile plains the major area of gujarat is covered by plains of this south gujarat and central gujarat plains are highly productive in terms of agriculture production however urbanization rapid agricultural growth and industrial development exert severe pressure on the aquifers of the study area over the years the south and central regions have become the most industrialized areas of gujarat that included industries such as dyeing chemical pharmaceutical textile fertilizers pesticides iron steel plastic mining and mineral processing etc these industries dispose of it s treated or partially treated effluents occasionally causing heavy metal contamination of aquifers the alluvial plains of the south and central regions of gujarat have been formed by rivers narmada tapi vishwamitri dhadhar mahi it has been reported that heavy rainfall in 2013 at the study region these rivers overflowed and flooded arable lands there is a dearth of research on the integrated impact of climate change anthropogenic activities and geology on groundwater quality considering the past evidence with reference to climate change and groundwater scenario in the south and central regions of gujarat the present study was carried out with main objectives 1 to assess synergistic effects of seasonal variation and human intervention on irrigational quality of groundwater 2 to determine relationship between soil physical properties and groundwater chemistry it is foreseen that the study would be helpful to frame out practical measures related to future management of irrigation water quality based on the climatic variability the source of contamination and geology of the region 2 materials and methodology 2 1 study area and hydrogeology the study area is consists of 13 districts located between 20 45 to 22 53 n latitude and 72 78 to 73 40 e longitude in the south and central regions of gujarat state india fig 1 the study area falls in the subtropical climate region the year can be divided into the cold season from november to february with temperature ranges between 24 c and 8 c the summer season from march to may where the maximum temperature recorded to be 32 c to 46 c however the study area receives greater of annual rainfall through south west monsoon from june to september and the intervening month of october the average annual rainfall of the study area ranges between 600 and 850 mm it is confined to the gulf of khambhat which is drainage area for three major river basins of the region the well known agriculturally rich alluvial basin of gujarat rises from the estuarine tracts between narmada and tapi rivers the eastern border of the basin is covered by aravali vindhya satpura and sahyadri hill ranges which have been formed by circumdenudation leaving a large plateau on top and a step as a result of horizontal lava flows and their differential weathering thus the geological processes played a significant role in controlling topography of the land geology would unfold the vast potential of the groundwater resources much needed to raise the crop output the rock formations of the gujarat showed a varied and interesting geological record the geologic units and rock types that occur in the study area are presented in table 1 2 2 sampling strategy forty five groundwater samples deep borewell were collected from the study area using the manual composite sampling method american public health association apha 2005 fifteen samples each were collected during the monsoon august 2013 post monsoon december 2013 and pre monsoon may 2014 season nine sites namely ahwa amod amroli ankleshwar pathri rajpipla ukai vansda and vyara from south gujarat and five locations as chhota udepur dahod halol khambhat and vadodara from central gujarat

5 min of flushing new hdpe bottles pre washed with dilute hydrochloric acid and rinsed thrice with distilled water were sued for sample collection the samples were stored in the laboratory at 4 c prior to analysis the soil samples were collected from 15 cm soil depth plough layer using an auger and required an amount of soil samples were taken by cone and quartering method roots and external plant material were removed from the soil and then were air dried sieved with 2 0 mm test sieve for further soil physical properties analysis integrated nutrient management inm division 2011 2 3

harding and ross 1964 2 4 data analysis data analysis was performed using spss version 20 ibm descriptive statistical and anova analysis was performed for all the variables of groundwater and soil physical properties groundwater quality parameters were correlated by pearson correlation method regression analysis was applied to predict the strength of the relationship between soil physical properties and groundwater chemical properties using regression equation and coefficient statistical significance was accounted when the p value was between 0 05 and 0 01 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical characterization of groundwater several studies have been carried out on assessment of groundwater quality for its irrigation or domestic purpose islam et al 2018 c d modhera 2017 bhat et al 2016 however evaluation of synergistic effects of seasonal variation and human intervention on groundwater quality for irrigation and to determine relationship between soil physical properties and groundwater chemistry have not been studied yet the physicochemical properties were statistically analyzed and results are represented in table 2 the results were compared with those reported by the bureau of indian standards bureau of indian standards bis 1991 groundwater in the study area was found to be alkaline to slightly acidic possibly due to the leaching of dissolved ions mainly calcium carbonates and bicarbonates none of the groundwater samples showed presence of carbonate ions thus calcium and bicarbonates contributed to the alkalinity of groundwater total dissolved solids tds are valuable indicators of the groundwater quality water consists of dissolved solids under natural conditions mainly inorganic salts like bicarbonates carbonates chlorides phosphates sulfates and calcium magnesium sodium potassium as nitrate complex forms and a small portion of heavy metals along with a slight presence of organic matter and dissolved gases chae et al 2006 the presence of these dissolved solids contributes to ec it is an important property in determining the suitability of water for irrigation during pre monsoon tds in all the samples were above the permissible limit which was reflected by high ec table 2 the observed tds and ec values during monsoon and post monsoon in comparison to pre monsoon could be due to change in soil physical properties and mineralogy which were influenced by high rainfall and percolation rate table 2 describes that concentration of b zn pb and cr of all samples was within permissible limits chloride occurs naturally in all types of waters about 53 of samples were found exceeding the acceptable limit of bis minerals like mica apatite and hornblende and inclusions of sedimentary and igneous rocks in liquid forms contribute to chloride content of groundwater das and malik 1988 the percolation of agricultural industrial and domestic waste also ramps up the groundwater chloride level high pre monsoon chloride level is an indicator of groundwater contamination influenced by industrial activities in the vicinity mondal and mujumdar 2015 sulfate in the groundwater is generally present in the form of calcium sodium and magnesium soluble salts metal sulfates undergo dissociation in water solution table 2 the groundwater recharge and rainfall infiltration from the stagnant water body and surface runoff of water accumulated in low lying areas might contribute to enhancing the level of sulfate ion concentration the results revealed that alkaline nature of groundwater was particularly due to bicarbonate ion in spite of carbonate alkalinity due to unavailability of carbonate in collected samples bicarbonate is common to all natural waters owing to its water soluble nature chemical weathering of rocks leads to dissolving calcite and other carbonate minerals thus adding hco3 to the soil solution as water flows through the ground dissolution of minerals continues and the concentration of dissolved constituents tends to increase with the length of the flow path and time in the present study sewage waste and other anthropogenic activities were assumed as possible sources of enhanced bicarbonate concentration in groundwater during post monsoon and pre monsoon and the rate of dissolution of carbon dioxide present in soil air get accelerated as rain infiltrates through the soil downing 1998 anthropogenic sources in increasing alkalinity include agriculture practices such as the use of limestone applied to agriculture fields to increase soil ph the industrial effluent and domestic wastes add hco3 to a river stream which increases overall alkalinity it is closely correlated with many other major ions and especially with the calcium ion the low rate of removal by soil could be the reason of high concentrations of magnesium calcium bicarbonates and chlorides in several cases somashekar et al 2007 the distribution of metal in the study region is shown in table 2 zinc was the predominant metal in groundwater samples followed by b cr and pb no metal concentration exceeded permissible limits reported by bis table 2 the adequate concentrations of these metals during the post monsoon and pre monsoon season might be regulated by an excess of hco3 ions in water as it can remove toxic metals such as lead by precipitating the metals out of solution magnesium and calcium ion contents in all the samples were within the bis permissible limit 100 mg l mineral formation could induced high concentrations of cations as cations are more abundant in sedimentary rock and present in the form of clay minerals feldspar and mica cation exchange process industrial activities and agricultural activities might contribute to greater level of cations in groundwater 3 1 1 hydrogeochemical characteristics of groundwater the ionic variations in groundwater samples with respect to location and season were very well explained using a trilinear piper diagram 1944 modified by langguth 1966 which divides this diagram into seven facies fig 2 it shows the graphical nature of the groundwater samples the diamond ring indicated that all monsoon season samples were the ca cl type fig 2a during post monsoon dominant cation was sodium while cl was found to be dominant anion for all the samples in the study area ankleshwar vyara ukai rajpipla surat and amod regions were identified as the na cl type and the areas like khambhat vansda chhota udepur pathtri gandevi dahod and vadodara were identified as a mixed ca mg cl type of water ca cl type was found to prevail in halol and ahwa region fig 2b the sodium and chloride ion prevalence might be attributed to prolonged leaching of untreated effluents and wastes from industries or urban area depending upon geology particularly dolomite and clay mineral content water type might change to ca cl and mixed ca mg cl type the cation distribution observed during pre monsoon season clearly demonstrated that all the samples were dominated by sodium type the anions observed during pre monsoon were originated or influenced by chloride type water the quadrilateral field illustrates that the samples from central gujarat represent a na cl water type the rocky highland deccan trap area viz pathri gandevi ahwa and vansda showed ca cl type of groundwater and remaining samples from ankleshwar vyara ukai surat rajpipla and amod was dominantly influenced by the mixed ca mg cl type which mainly depends on soil physical properties and rock type of this region fig 2c this demonstrated abundance of calcium and magnesium rich minerals such as gypsum limestone etc in the study area 3 1 2 indicators of irrigation water quality the concentration and composition of dissolved salts determine the use of groundwater for irrigation these specific ions may be toxic to various plant physiological processes or may cause nutritional disorders in plants if exceeded permissible limits for irrigation use raghupathi and ganeshmurthy 2013 the salinity of water suitable for irrigation depends on the mineral composition of soil permeability of the soil agriculture practices seasonal variations and the nature of the groundwater and surface water drainage system of the region excess of salinity reduces osmotic activity of plants and thus interferes with the absorption of water and nutrients from the soil saleh et al 1999 salinity and sodicity indices are important properties for determining the suitability of groundwater for irrigation uses electrical conductivity sodium adsorption ratio sar soluble sodium percent ssp kelley s ratio kr residual sodium carbonate rsc and permeability index pi are the important indicators to determine irrigation water quality 3 1 2 1 soluble sodium percent the tendency for a water to enter into cation exchange reactions were commonly evaluated in terms of the soluble sodium percent ssp the sodium content reduces soil permeability by adsorbing to clay particles and accumulates in the pore spaces which hampers plant growth thus high sodium concentration in groundwater produces undesirable effects the ssp with regard to respective proportions of cations present in water was computed using the following formula s a r n a 100 c a 2 m g 2 n a k the concentrations of ions are expressed in meq l the relationship between electrical conductivity and soluble sodium percent is represented by graphical method of wilcox 1955 diagram fig 3 shows wilcox diagram for monsoon post monsoon and pre monsoon data out of total 45 samples 15 samples of monsoon and samples from pathri gandevi vansda and ahwa of pre monsoon belonged to good to permissible category the samples collected during post monsoon from vyara and ukai and central gujarat samples of pre monsoon belonged to doubtful to unsuitable category pre monsoon samples of amod amroli ankleshwar rajpipla vyara and ukai were falling under unsuitable category the major source of sodium hazard in amod amroli ankleshwar vadodara vyara and ukai were from industrial wastes 3 1 2 2 sodium adsorption ratio the suitability of water for irrigation can be determined with one of the important chemical parameter which is expressed as sodium adsorption ratio sar sar is calculated from the ratio of sodium to calcium and magnesium calcium and magnesium ions are important since they are gravitating to counter the sodium effect higher concentration of sar seize up the physical structure of the soil which indicates the degree to which the water used for agriculture purpose inclined to enter into cation exchange reactions in soil bhat et al 2016 with increase in sar sodium is adsorbed and become attached to soil particles which leads to hardening and drying the soil then becomes hard and compact when dry and impregnable to water penetration the sar recommended by the united states salinity laboratory us department of agriculture is calculated using following formula s a r n a c a 2 m g 2 2 the sodium hazard can be determined by classifying sar index and ec using united state salinity laboratory ussl 1954 diagram after richard 1954 fig 4 shows that all samples collected during monsoon post monsoon samples except surat and ukai and pre monsoon samples except khambhat and chhota udepur represent c3s1 class indicating high salinity and low alkali hazard however only one post monsoon sample from amod fell in the c3s2 category of water signifying high salinity to a medium sodium type c3s2 type of water can be used on organic soils with good permeability or coarse textured soils karanth 1989 khambhat and chhota udepur pre monsoon samples fell under very high salinity and low alkalinity hazards c4s1 category during the post monsoon season moderate and bad quality water types increased owing to the enrichment of sodium concentrations and electrical conductivity the bad waters should not be used for irrigation on clayey soils with low permeability singh et al 2015 3 1 2 3 residual sodium carbonate the excess sum of carbonate and bicarbonate in groundwater over the sum of calcium and magnesium was evaluated by rsc which plays an important role in evaluating suitability of irrigation water raju et al 2009 siddiqui et al 2005 generally more than 2 5 meq l of the rsc is unsuitable for irrigation purposes hence continued usage of high rsc waters would affect crop yield all the samples of the monsoon season had rsc within the permissible limit during post monsoon and pre monsoon central gujarat samples exceeded the permissible limit amod amroli rajpipla ankleshwar and vyara samples of pre monsoon were also found to exceed the desirable limit the increased rsc value was particularly because of high bicarbonate concentration and absence of carbonates in all three season s samples most of the sampling sites showed negative rsc values which were ascribed to incomplete precipitation of calcium and magnesium the rsc values calculated using following formula r s c h c o 3 2 c o 3 c a 2 m g 2 3 1 2 4 kelly s ratio the level of sodium measured against calcium and magnesium is known as kelley s ratio based on which irrigation waters can be rated kelley 1946 paliwal 1967 excess sodium in water produces undesirable effects of changing soil properties and reducing soil permeability kelley 1951 tijani 1994 kelley s ratio is taken as an indication of alkali hazard in water handa 1981 the suitable kelley s ratio for irrigation purpose should be less than one in the study area all monsoon samples were suitable for irrigation use all samples collected during post monsoon from south gujarat and all pre monsoon season samples from central gujarat were unsuitable for irrigation purpose the kelley s ratio can be calculated using formula given below k r n a c a 2 m g 2 3 1 2 5 doneen s permeability index pi the permeability index as developed by doneen 1962 1964 affected by the use of irrigation water for a long period of time and dissolved solids indicates the suitability of groundwater for irrigation according to the pi values 27 groundwater from pathri gandevi vansda and ahwa and 7 groundwater from vyara in monsoon and post monsoon could be assigned to class i category pi 75 respectively none of the samples from pre monsoon fell under class i category all remaining samples belonged to the class ii 25 75 category samples from pathri gandevi vansda and ahwa showed that soil permeability was not affected as mineral content was within the permissible limit for irrigation the pi value less than 25 falls under class iii indicating unsuitable nature of water for irrigation doneen 1964 permeability index for soil can be calculated using formula as follows p i n a h c o 3 2 c a 2 m g 2 n a k the soil permeability index decreases with an increase in ion contents however the soil permeability is influenced by long term usage of groundwater for irrigation and is in turn contrived by cations like calcium magnesium sodium and anions like bicarbonates contents in the soil singh 2015 the results indicated that the common use of these alkaline earth metals and alkalis in the groundwater this gives evidence for the abundance of calcium and magnesium rich minerals such as gypsum calcite etc in the study area pearson correlation analysis was performed to check relationship between key variables of ground water during three seasons table 3 inter element correlation was performed among the 15 different hydro chemical variables of ph tds ec cl so4 2 sar rsc ssp kr pi mg2 ca2 k na hco3 2 across monsoon post monsoon and pre monsoon seasons sar ssp and kr showed strong association with na whereas rsc showed strong association for hco3 2 in all three seasons however during all seasons tds and ec which were strongly correlated to each other showed direct proportional relationship with the abundance of cations in groundwater during pre monsoon sodium has a strong positive correlation with chloride r 0 909 indicating that increases in na also increases cl in the form of na cl salt as the water evaporation rate is high during pre monsoon season 3 2 physical characterization of soil groundwater quality and recharge are influenced by hydrologic processes and also the physical characteristics of the soil profile and landscapes kumar 2012 the dissolved solids are transported by water percolating through the soil to the water table dissolved solids enter groundwater through soil particles sediments and rocks as the water travels along with mineral surfaces percolates through the pores and ruptures of the unsaturated zone and the aquifer the basic statistics for physical properties of soil from south and central gujarat is summarized in table 4 average sand silt and clay content during monsoon and post monsoon did not show significant variation however in pre monsoon slight change has been observed because change in soil texture takes time water holding capacity found to be ranged between 16 99 and 85 29 26 84 91 96 and 24 56 65 88 during monsoon post monsoon and pre monsoon respectively on the contrary average of moisture content during pre monsoon was 2 54 16 81 which was observed to be lowered compared to that of during monsoon and post monsoon along with climatic conditions and anthropogenic activities soil structure plays an important role in changing groundwater chemistry a relation between soil physical properties and chemical properties of groundwater played a vital role in determining the effects of irrigation practices on groundwater quality soil texture sand silt and clay content bulk density water holding capacity and moisture content have a significant effect on the groundwater electrical conductivity the results were represented in the form of scatter plot with linear regression equations in figs 5 and 6 with the decreasing clay content and water holding capacity of the soil ec increases due to decreasing in infiltration capacity and it might take time to percolate through soil in order to recharge the water table the exact reverse case was observed when sand content bulk density of soil was correlated with ec of groundwater sandy soil has low water holding capacity and moisture content which allow minerals to easily pass through soil horizon and ultimately increasing ec of groundwater the bulk density is directly proportional to sand content as sandy soils have lower porosities thus the chances of groundwater contamination after heavy rainfall might affect due to changes in soil physical characteristics the poor nature of soil might take a long time to recharge aquifer and improve water quality an increase in the concentration of ions during post monsoon season was due to leaching of salts from soil through an infiltration process the infiltration process mainly dependent on soil structure i e its texture sand clay or silt water holding capacity porosity and bulk density the regression analysis indicates that the ec of groundwater changes along with soil physical properties the soil type of south gujarat is deep black clay whereas central gujarat has medium black to loamy sand type according to agriculture and co operation department gujarat groundwater quality changes for south gujarat was observed in pre monsoon was due to clay type of soil in case of central gujarat changes were observed from post monsoon and pre monsoon due to sandy loamy soil type this is because salts and sodium could leached much easier from coarse textured soils sandy whereas clays are particularly effective at adsorbing cations because their surfaces are consistently negatively charged the percentage variation in groundwater ec could be ascribed to variations in sand content bulk density clay content and water holding capacity and can be calculated using regression equation the regression analysis was carried out between groundwater and soil physical properties like sand and clay content bulk density and water holding capacity and results are described in fig 6 groundwater quality depends on geology extent of chemical weathering of different types of rocks recharge water quality and from sources other than water rock interaction and seasonal changes domenico 1972 schuh et al 1997 this may result from different soil types and change in soil properties which led to changes in concentration of dissolved salts reflecting ec in groundwater the overall groundwater analysis revealed a significant deterioration in groundwater quality throughout the south and central gujarat except for pathri gandevi vansda and ahwa point sources which migrate with the river basin water flow towards drainage area seasonal variations in precipitation surface runoff groundwater flow and water interception and abstraction have a strong effect on river discharge and subsequently on the concentration of pollutants in river water dixon and chiswell 1996 the important factor influencing the river water quality is stream flow which defines the rate of pollutant transport and dilution of pollutant loads the study areas along river basins are densely populated in terms of highly industrialized with developed agriculture adhikari 2012 the agriculture department government of gujarat reported that surat narmada bharuch tapi valsad vadodara dahod and panchmahal districts had witnessed a heavy downpour since the year 2013 heavy rainfall in these regions led to overflowing of rivers narmada tapi vishwamitri flooding vast areas in 2013 surat bharuch and vadodara districts are located on flat alluvial plains of these rivers and these lowlands of lower basins that are prone to floods thiruppugazh et al 2014 contamination of groundwater is caused by effluent seepage and solid wastes center for science and environment cse new delhi reported that more than 1500 industries of bharuch district have been discharging effluents into amlakhadi which further flows into the narmada river near bharuch where there are factories manufacturing dyes paints textiles pharmaceuticals paper pesticides and fertilizer industries during monsoon the effluent overflows further destroying farmlands pollution caused by fertilizers and pesticides used in agriculture often dispersed over large areas known as non point pollution eclectic disposal of human and animal waste on land and intensive use of agriculture inputs in farms result in leaching of the chemicals which is a big threat to fresh groundwater ecosystems the groundwater acquired its unique chemistry through geological interactions leaching and reactions at vadose zone yousef nazzal 2014 groundwater chemistry changes during post monsoon season as water remain in rivers for a relatively short time covering days or weeks in contrast the water flows through the ground very slowly generally varies in age from months to years compared to the flow in the upper part of the unconfined zone therefore groundwater samples showed an increasing trend from monsoon to pre monsoon season over exploitation highly populated or industrial cluster areas like vadodara ankleshwar saline water ingression coastal areas like khambhat and geology rock type of the pathri gandevi vansda ahwa halol dahod rajpipla played a major role in increasing sodium hazard these results emphasize the need of adopting judicious management strategies to mitigate the problem of deteriorating groundwater quality in the study area 4 conclusion the study gives significant details on the development of ground water quality in southern and central part parts of gujarat state of india ground water is immensely important for water supply in both urban and rural areas particularly groundwater quality of amroli rajpipla vyara vansda and ahwa varied from good to moderate for all the three seasons vadodara district of central gujarat and bharuch tapi districts of south gujarat were significantly affected vansda and ahwa were occasionally influenced by landscape and minor industrialization khambhat region showed changes with respect to salinity due to its proximity to the arabian sea the high level of bicarbonates etc in groundwater deteriorated the water quality which made it unsuitable for irrigation purpose during the post monsoon and pre monsoon period due to sandy and loamy soil type of central gujarat changes were observed from post monsoon and pre monsoon in case of clayey type of soil in south gujarat majority of groundwater quality changes were observed in pre monsoon this is owing to rate of leaching of salts and sodium is much easier from coarse textured soils sandy whereas clays are particularly effective in adsorbing cations as their surfaces are consistently negatively charged the implication is that groundwater salinization threats need diagnosis monitoring and careful management to overcome deterioration of groundwater quality the calculated values of pi indicate that the water for irrigation uses is excellent to good quality in both seasons as per wilcox s diagram and us salinity laboratory classification most of the groundwater samples are suitable for irrigation except one sample which is unsuitable for irrigation purposes the overall quality of groundwater in post monsoon season in all chemical constituents is on the higher side due to dissolution of surface pollutants during the infiltration and percolation of rainwater at few places due to agricultural and domestic activities acknowledgment this work is a part of research thesis for the degree of doctor of philosophy ph d of

12139,globally natural and human interference is affecting aquifer recharge and quality of ground water this study focuses on changes in groundwater hydrochemistry in south and central part of gujarat state in india to identify vulnerable hotspots under seasonal variations and anthropogenic activities forty five groundwater and soil samples were collected over three seasons from random locations of south and central gujarat the samples were analyzed for physico chemical characteristics dominance of cations and anions during post monsoon was in higher to lower order of na mg ca k and cl so4 2 hco3 in groundwater the piper classification for hydrogeochemical facies indicates all monsoon samples were of ca cl type residual sodium carbonate values revealed that 46 samples were not suitable for irrigation purposes in pre monsoon samples collected during post monsoon from vyara and ukai and during pre monsoon from central gujarat were of doubtful to unsuitable category as per wilcox s diagram during the post monsoon season moderate and bad quality water rose owing to the enrichment of sodium and electrical conductivity the groundwater quality in post monsoon for all constituents were higher at some places due to dissolution of surface pollutants and infiltration after flooding with percolation of rainwater none of the samples from pre monsoon fell under class i category permeability index 75 due to leaching of ions through industrial agricultural or domestic discharges soil permeability index varied from monsoon to post and pre monsoon groundwater quality of vadodara bharuch and tapi districts were affected by geological and anthropogenic activities while ground water in vansda and ahwa were less affected due to limited industrialization as well as geographical location the cumulative hydrochemistry during post and pre monsoon was found to be higher than permissible limits due to leaching of contaminants judicious management of efficient irrigation industrial waste treatment modern agricultural practices rainwater harvesting to conserve groundwater quality of study area are critical graphical abstract image 1 keywords agriculture anthropogenic activities groundwater hydrochemistry rainfall 1 introduction global warming has a significant impact on hydrological cycle houghton et al 1995 a large part of groundwater is being used by the agriculture sector according to studies by shiklomanov 1997 groundwater demand for irrigation is about 67 of the global water withdrawal and 87 of the consumptive water uses agriculture is the main source of livelihood for the population and this sector alone represents 23 of india s gross national product gnp which plays a crucial role in the country s socio economic development however agriculture is sensitive to short term changes in weather as well as seasonal annual and longer term variations in climate human interference in terms of over exploitation industrialization and farm practices make agriculture sector more vulnerable to climate change impacts thus the effect of climate change would be direct in the rain fed agriculture and indirect in surface and groundwater fed areas zhou et al 2010 agriculture mainly depends on groundwater in arid and semi arid regions however unconstrained use is causing exhaustion in aquifer recharge and quality of water the change in temperature and rainfall patterns due to climate change would directly deprive soil availability which increases the irrigation demand from groundwater resulting into a great impact on agriculture yield the movement of contaminants naturally or by human activities is accelerated as a result of rainfall that runoff and infiltration contaminating nearby streams and lakes or infiltration affecting aquifers climate change in terms of increased rainfall and temperature also affects soil structure by its physical properties which can change the groundwater chemistry the quality of irrigation water depends upon various types of salts which constitute salinity and sodicity of the water the total concentration of soluble salts proportion of sodium ions to other cations concentration of toxic elements such as boron lead chromium ratios ions of carbonate co3 2 or bicarbonate hco3 sulfate so4 2 or chloride cl play a significant role in determining the irrigation water quality especially in arid and semiarid areas it has become compulsion for the farmers of arid and semi arid areas to use available resources irrespective of its doubtful quality goyal 2013 the analysis of aquifer characteristics of sites with known climate physiography source of contamination and geology provides a tool in investigation and in the prediction and prevention of future contamination of downstream water bodies therefore it is important to carry out discrete analysis of ground water quality and regional soil streta to identify vulnerable hotspots which need immediate arbitration gujarat is privileged with characteristic features viz longest coastline 14 river basins and diverse geology this makes the semi arid gujarat more exposed to climate change hiremath and shiyani 2012 gujarat has special economic significance due to its high population density and intense agricultural activities the alluvial sediments carried by the river are deposited and form productive fertile plains the major area of gujarat is covered by plains of this south gujarat and central gujarat plains are highly productive in terms of agriculture production however urbanization rapid agricultural growth and industrial development exert severe pressure on the aquifers of the study area over the years the south and central regions have become the most industrialized areas of gujarat that included industries such as dyeing chemical pharmaceutical textile fertilizers pesticides iron steel plastic mining and mineral processing etc these industries dispose of it s treated or partially treated effluents occasionally causing heavy metal contamination of aquifers the alluvial plains of the south and central regions of gujarat have been formed by rivers narmada tapi vishwamitri dhadhar mahi it has been reported that heavy rainfall in 2013 at the study region these rivers overflowed and flooded arable lands there is a dearth of research on the integrated impact of climate change anthropogenic activities and geology on groundwater quality considering the past evidence with reference to climate change and groundwater scenario in the south and central regions of gujarat the present study was carried out with main objectives 1 to assess synergistic effects of seasonal variation and human intervention on irrigational quality of groundwater 2 to determine relationship between soil physical properties and groundwater chemistry it is foreseen that the study would be helpful to frame out practical measures related to future management of irrigation water quality based on the climatic variability the source of contamination and geology of the region 2 materials and methodology 2 1 study area and hydrogeology the study area is consists of 13 districts located between 20 45 to 22 53 n latitude and 72 78 to 73 40 e longitude in the south and central regions of gujarat state india fig 1 the study area falls in the subtropical climate region the year can be divided into the cold season from november to february with temperature ranges between 24 c and 8 c the summer season from march to may where the maximum temperature recorded to be 32 c to 46 c however the study area receives greater of annual rainfall through south west monsoon from june to september and the intervening month of october the average annual rainfall of the study area ranges between 600 and 850 mm it is confined to the gulf of khambhat which is drainage area for three major river basins of the region the well known agriculturally rich alluvial basin of gujarat rises from the estuarine tracts between narmada and tapi rivers the eastern border of the basin is covered by aravali vindhya satpura and sahyadri hill ranges which have been formed by circumdenudation leaving a large plateau on top and a step as a result of horizontal lava flows and their differential weathering thus the geological processes played a significant role in controlling topography of the land geology would unfold the vast potential of the groundwater resources much needed to raise the crop output the rock formations of the gujarat showed a varied and interesting geological record the geologic units and rock types that occur in the study area are presented in table 1 2 2 sampling strategy forty five groundwater samples deep borewell were collected from the study area using the manual composite sampling method american public health association apha 2005 fifteen samples each were collected during the monsoon august 2013 post monsoon december 2013 and pre monsoon may 2014 season nine sites namely ahwa amod amroli ankleshwar pathri rajpipla ukai vansda and vyara from south gujarat and five locations as chhota udepur dahod halol khambhat and vadodara from central gujarat zone were selected for sample collection the groundwater samples were collected from the wells with average depth of 150 200 feets after purging with pumps from phreatic aquifer or upper aquifer over 5 min of flushing new hdpe bottles pre washed with dilute hydrochloric acid and rinsed thrice with distilled water were sued for sample collection the samples were stored in the laboratory at 4 c prior to analysis the soil samples were collected from 15 cm soil depth plough layer using an auger and required an amount of soil samples were taken by cone and quartering method roots and external plant material were removed from the soil and then were air dried sieved with 2 0 mm test sieve for further soil physical properties analysis integrated nutrient management inm division 2011 2 3

chromium cr zinc zn and lead pb content soil physical properties like soil texture sand silt and clay content was determined by bottle method whiting et al 2002 soil moisture content was tested by gravimetric method inm 2011 bulk density and porosity were estimated using undisturbed soil core method bashour and sayegh 2007 water holding capacity of soil was measured by a method developed by harding and ross 1964 2 4 data analysis data analysis was performed using spss version 20 ibm descriptive statistical and anova analysis was performed for all the variables of groundwater and soil physical properties groundwater quality parameters were correlated by pearson correlation method regression analysis was applied to predict the strength of the relationship between soil physical properties and groundwater chemical properties using regression equation and coefficient statistical significance was accounted when the p value was between 0 05 and 0 01 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical characterization of groundwater several studies have been carried out on assessment of groundwater quality for its irrigation or domestic purpose islam et al 2018 c d modhera 2017 bhat et al 2016 however evaluation of synergistic effects of seasonal variation and human intervention on groundwater quality for irrigation and to determine relationship between soil physical properties and groundwater chemistry have not been studied yet the physicochemical properties were statistically analyzed and results are represented in table 2 the results were compared with those reported by the bureau of indian standards bureau of indian standards bis 1991 groundwater in the study area was found to be alkaline to slightly acidic possibly due to the leaching of dissolved ions mainly calcium carbonates and bicarbonates none of the groundwater samples showed presence of carbonate ions thus calcium and bicarbonates contributed to the alkalinity of groundwater total dissolved solids tds are valuable indicators of the groundwater quality water consists of dissolved solids under natural conditions mainly inorganic salts like bicarbonates carbonates chlorides phosphates sulfates and calcium magnesium sodium potassium as nitrate complex forms and a small portion of heavy metals along with a slight presence of organic matter and dissolved gases chae et al 2006 the presence of these dissolved solids contributes to ec it is an important property in determining the suitability of water for irrigation during pre monsoon tds in all the samples were above the permissible limit which was reflected by high ec table 2 the observed tds and ec values during monsoon and post monsoon in comparison to pre monsoon could be due to change in soil physical properties and mineralogy which were influenced by high rainfall and percolation rate table 2 describes that concentration of b zn pb and cr of all samples was within permissible limits chloride occurs naturally in all types of waters about 53 of samples were found exceeding the acceptable limit of bis minerals like mica apatite and hornblende and inclusions of sedimentary and igneous rocks in liquid forms contribute to chloride content of groundwater das and malik 1988 the percolation of agricultural industrial and domestic waste also ramps up the groundwater chloride level high pre monsoon chloride level is an indicator of groundwater contamination influenced by industrial activities in the vicinity mondal and mujumdar 2015 sulfate in the groundwater is generally present in the form of calcium sodium and magnesium soluble salts metal sulfates undergo dissociation in water solution table 2 the groundwater recharge and rainfall infiltration from the stagnant water body and surface runoff of water accumulated in low lying areas might contribute to enhancing the level of sulfate ion concentration the results revealed that alkaline nature of groundwater was particularly due to bicarbonate ion in spite of carbonate alkalinity due to unavailability of carbonate in collected samples bicarbonate is common to all natural waters owing to its water soluble nature chemical weathering of rocks leads to dissolving calcite and other carbonate minerals thus adding hco3 to the soil solution as water flows through the ground dissolution of minerals continues and the concentration of dissolved constituents tends to increase with the length of the flow path and time in the present study sewage waste and other anthropogenic activities were assumed as possible sources of enhanced bicarbonate concentration in groundwater during post monsoon and pre monsoon and the rate of dissolution of carbon dioxide present in soil air get accelerated as rain infiltrates through the soil downing 1998 anthropogenic sources in increasing alkalinity include agriculture practices such as the use of limestone applied to agriculture fields to increase soil ph the industrial effluent and domestic wastes add hco3 to a river stream which increases overall alkalinity it is closely correlated with many other major ions and especially with the calcium ion the low rate of removal by soil could be the reason of high concentrations of magnesium calcium bicarbonates and chlorides in several cases somashekar et al 2007 the distribution of metal in the study region is shown in table 2 zinc was the predominant metal in groundwater samples followed by b cr and pb no metal concentration exceeded permissible limits reported by bis table 2 the adequate concentrations of these metals during the post monsoon and pre monsoon season might be regulated by an excess of hco3 ions in water as it can remove toxic metals such as lead by precipitating the metals out of solution magnesium and calcium ion contents in all the samples were within the bis permissible limit 100 mg l mineral formation could induced high concentrations of cations as cations are more abundant in sedimentary rock and present in the form of clay minerals feldspar and mica cation exchange process industrial activities and agricultural activities might contribute to greater level of cations in groundwater 3 1 1 hydrogeochemical characteristics of groundwater the ionic variations in groundwater samples with respect to location and season were very well explained using a trilinear piper diagram 1944 modified by langguth 1966 which divides this diagram into seven facies fig 2 it shows the graphical nature of the groundwater samples the diamond ring indicated that all monsoon season samples were the ca cl type fig 2a during post monsoon dominant cation was sodium while cl was found to be dominant anion for all the samples in the study area ankleshwar vyara ukai rajpipla surat and amod regions were identified as the na cl type and the areas like khambhat vansda chhota udepur pathtri gandevi dahod and vadodara were identified as a mixed ca mg cl type of water ca cl type was found to prevail in halol and ahwa region fig 2b the sodium and chloride ion prevalence might be attributed to prolonged leaching of untreated effluents and wastes from industries or urban area depending upon geology particularly dolomite and clay mineral content water type might change to ca cl and mixed ca mg cl type the cation distribution observed during pre monsoon season clearly demonstrated that all the samples were dominated by sodium type the anions observed during pre monsoon were originated or influenced by chloride type water the quadrilateral field illustrates that the samples from central gujarat represent a na cl water type the rocky highland deccan trap area viz pathri gandevi ahwa and vansda showed ca cl type of groundwater and remaining samples from ankleshwar vyara ukai surat rajpipla and amod was dominantly influenced by the mixed ca mg cl type which mainly depends on soil physical properties and rock type of this region fig 2c this demonstrated abundance of calcium and magnesium rich minerals such as gypsum limestone etc in the study area 3 1 2 indicators of irrigation water quality the concentration and composition of dissolved salts determine the use of groundwater for irrigation these specific ions may be toxic to various plant physiological processes or may cause nutritional disorders in plants if exceeded permissible limits for irrigation use raghupathi and ganeshmurthy 2013 the salinity of water suitable for irrigation depends on the mineral composition of soil permeability of the soil agriculture practices seasonal variations and the nature of the groundwater and surface water drainage system of the region excess of salinity reduces osmotic activity of plants and thus interferes with the absorption of water and nutrients from the soil saleh et al 1999 salinity and sodicity indices are important properties for determining the suitability of groundwater for irrigation uses electrical conductivity sodium adsorption ratio sar soluble sodium percent ssp kelley s ratio kr residual sodium carbonate rsc and permeability index pi are the important indicators to determine irrigation water quality 3 1 2 1 soluble sodium percent the tendency for a water to enter into cation exchange reactions were commonly evaluated in terms of the soluble sodium percent ssp the sodium content reduces soil permeability by adsorbing to clay particles and accumulates in the pore spaces which hampers plant growth thus high sodium concentration in groundwater produces undesirable effects the ssp with regard to respective proportions of cations present in water was computed using the following formula s a r n a 100 c a 2 m g 2 n a k the concentrations of ions are expressed in meq l the relationship between electrical conductivity and soluble sodium percent is represented by graphical method of wilcox 1955 diagram fig 3 shows wilcox diagram for monsoon post monsoon and pre monsoon data out of total 45 samples 15 samples of monsoon and samples from pathri gandevi vansda and ahwa of pre monsoon belonged to good to permissible category the samples collected during post monsoon from vyara and ukai and central gujarat samples of pre monsoon belonged to doubtful to unsuitable category pre monsoon samples of amod amroli ankleshwar rajpipla vyara and ukai were falling under unsuitable category the major source of sodium hazard in amod amroli ankleshwar vadodara vyara and ukai were from industrial wastes 3 1 2 2 sodium adsorption ratio the suitability of water for irrigation can be determined with one of the important chemical parameter which is expressed as sodium adsorption ratio sar sar is calculated from the ratio of sodium to calcium and magnesium calcium and magnesium ions are important since they are gravitating to counter the sodium effect higher concentration of sar seize up the physical structure of the soil which indicates the degree to which the water used for agriculture purpose inclined to enter into cation exchange reactions in soil bhat et al 2016 with increase in sar sodium is adsorbed and become attached to soil particles which leads to hardening and drying the soil then becomes hard and compact when dry and impregnable to water penetration the sar recommended by the united states salinity laboratory us department of agriculture is calculated using following formula s a r n a c a 2 m g 2 2 the sodium hazard can be determined by classifying sar index and ec using united state salinity laboratory ussl 1954 diagram after richard 1954 fig 4 shows that all samples collected during monsoon post monsoon samples except surat and ukai and pre monsoon samples except khambhat and chhota udepur represent c3s1 class indicating high salinity and low alkali hazard however only one post monsoon sample from amod fell in the c3s2 category of water signifying high salinity to a medium sodium type c3s2 type of water can be used on organic soils with good permeability or coarse textured soils karanth 1989 khambhat and chhota udepur pre monsoon samples fell under very high salinity and low alkalinity hazards c4s1 category during the post monsoon season moderate and bad quality water types increased owing to the enrichment of sodium concentrations and electrical conductivity the bad waters should not be used for irrigation on clayey soils with low permeability singh et al 2015 3 1 2 3 residual sodium carbonate the excess sum of carbonate and bicarbonate in groundwater over the sum of calcium and magnesium was evaluated by rsc which plays an important role in evaluating suitability of irrigation water raju et al 2009 siddiqui et al 2005 generally more than 2 5 meq l of the rsc is unsuitable for irrigation purposes hence continued usage of high rsc waters would affect crop yield all the samples of the monsoon season had rsc within the permissible limit during post monsoon and pre monsoon central gujarat samples exceeded the permissible limit amod amroli rajpipla ankleshwar and vyara samples of pre monsoon were also found to exceed the desirable limit the increased rsc value was particularly because of high bicarbonate concentration and absence of carbonates in all three season s samples most of the sampling sites showed negative rsc values which were ascribed to incomplete precipitation of calcium and magnesium the rsc values calculated using following formula r s c h c o 3 2 c o 3 c a 2 m g 2 3 1 2 4 kelly s ratio the level of sodium measured against calcium and magnesium is known as kelley s ratio based on which irrigation waters can be rated kelley 1946 paliwal 1967 excess sodium in water produces undesirable effects of changing soil properties and reducing soil permeability kelley 1951 tijani 1994 kelley s ratio is taken as an indication of alkali hazard in water handa 1981 the suitable kelley s ratio for irrigation purpose should be less than one in the study area all monsoon samples were suitable for irrigation use all samples collected during post monsoon from south gujarat and all pre monsoon season samples from central gujarat were unsuitable for irrigation purpose the kelley s ratio can be calculated using formula given below k r n a c a 2 m g 2 3 1 2 5 doneen s permeability index pi the permeability index as developed by doneen 1962 1964 affected by the use of irrigation water for a long period of time and dissolved solids indicates the suitability of groundwater for irrigation according to the pi values 27 groundwater from pathri gandevi vansda and ahwa and 7 groundwater from vyara in monsoon and post monsoon could be assigned to class i category pi 75 respectively none of the samples from pre monsoon fell under class i category all remaining samples belonged to the class ii 25 75 category samples from pathri gandevi vansda and ahwa showed that soil permeability was not affected as mineral content was within the permissible limit for irrigation the pi value less than 25 falls under class iii indicating unsuitable nature of water for irrigation doneen 1964 permeability index for soil can be calculated using formula as follows p i n a h c o 3 2 c a 2 m g 2 n a k the soil permeability index decreases with an increase in ion contents however the soil permeability is influenced by long term usage of groundwater for irrigation and is in turn contrived by cations like calcium magnesium sodium and anions like bicarbonates contents in the soil singh 2015 the results indicated that the common use of these alkaline earth metals and alkalis in the groundwater this gives evidence for the abundance of calcium and magnesium rich minerals such as gypsum calcite etc in the study area pearson correlation analysis was performed to check relationship between key variables of ground water during three seasons table 3 inter element correlation was performed among the 15 different hydro chemical variables of ph tds ec cl so4 2 sar rsc ssp kr pi mg2 ca2 k na hco3 2 across monsoon post monsoon and pre monsoon seasons sar ssp and kr showed strong association with na whereas rsc showed strong association for hco3 2 in all three seasons however during all seasons tds and ec which were strongly correlated to each other showed direct proportional relationship with the abundance of cations in groundwater during pre monsoon sodium has a strong positive correlation with chloride r 0 909 indicating that increases in na also increases cl in the form of na cl salt as the water evaporation rate is high during pre monsoon season 3 2 physical characterization of soil groundwater quality and recharge are influenced by hydrologic processes and also the physical characteristics of the soil profile and landscapes kumar 2012 the dissolved solids are transported by water percolating through the soil to the water table dissolved solids enter groundwater through soil particles sediments and rocks as the water travels along with mineral surfaces percolates through the pores and ruptures of the unsaturated zone and the aquifer the basic statistics for physical properties of soil from south and central gujarat is summarized in table 4 average sand silt and clay content during monsoon and post monsoon did not show significant variation however in pre monsoon slight change has been observed because change in soil texture takes time water holding capacity found to be ranged between 16 99 and 85 29 26 84 91 96 and 24 56 65 88 during monsoon post monsoon and pre monsoon respectively on the contrary average of moisture content during pre monsoon was 2 54 16 81 which was observed to be lowered compared to that of during monsoon and post monsoon along with climatic conditions and anthropogenic activities soil structure plays an important role in changing groundwater chemistry a relation between soil physical properties and chemical properties of groundwater played a vital role in determining the effects of irrigation practices on groundwater quality soil texture sand silt and clay content bulk density water holding capacity and moisture content have a significant effect on the groundwater electrical conductivity the results were represented in the form of scatter plot with linear regression equations in figs 5 and 6 with the decreasing clay content and water holding capacity of the soil ec increases due to decreasing in infiltration capacity and it might take time to percolate through soil in order to recharge the water table the exact reverse case was observed when sand content bulk density of soil was correlated with ec of groundwater sandy soil has low water holding capacity and moisture content which allow minerals to easily pass through soil horizon and ultimately increasing ec of groundwater the bulk density is directly proportional to sand content as sandy soils have lower porosities thus the chances of groundwater contamination after heavy rainfall might affect due to changes in soil physical characteristics the poor nature of soil might take a long time to recharge aquifer and improve water quality an increase in the concentration of ions during post monsoon season was due to leaching of salts from soil through an infiltration process the infiltration process mainly dependent on soil structure i e its texture sand clay or silt water holding capacity porosity and bulk density the regression analysis indicates that the ec of groundwater changes along with soil physical properties the soil type of south gujarat is deep black clay whereas central gujarat has medium black to loamy sand type according to agriculture and co operation department gujarat groundwater quality changes for south gujarat was observed in pre monsoon was due to clay type of soil in case of central gujarat changes were observed from post monsoon and pre monsoon due to sandy loamy soil type this is because salts and sodium could leached much easier from coarse textured soils sandy whereas clays are particularly effective at adsorbing cations because their surfaces are consistently negatively charged the percentage variation in groundwater ec could be ascribed to variations in sand content bulk density clay content and water holding capacity and can be calculated using regression equation the regression analysis was carried out between groundwater and soil physical properties like sand and clay content bulk density and water holding capacity and results are described in fig 6 groundwater quality depends on geology extent of chemical weathering of different types of rocks recharge water quality and from sources other than water rock interaction and seasonal changes domenico 1972 schuh et al 1997 this may result from different soil types and change in soil properties which led to changes in concentration of dissolved salts reflecting ec in groundwater the overall groundwater analysis revealed a significant deterioration in groundwater quality throughout the south and central gujarat except for pathri gandevi vansda and ahwa point sources which migrate with the river basin water flow towards drainage area seasonal variations in precipitation surface runoff groundwater flow and water interception and abstraction have a strong effect on river discharge and subsequently on the concentration of pollutants in river water dixon and chiswell 1996 the important factor influencing the river water quality is stream flow which defines the rate of pollutant transport and dilution of pollutant loads the study areas along river basins are densely populated in terms of highly industrialized with developed agriculture adhikari 2012 the agriculture department government of gujarat reported that surat narmada bharuch tapi valsad vadodara dahod and panchmahal districts had witnessed a heavy downpour since the year 2013 heavy rainfall in these regions led to overflowing of rivers narmada tapi vishwamitri flooding vast areas in 2013 surat bharuch and vadodara districts are located on flat alluvial plains of these rivers and these lowlands of lower basins that are prone to floods thiruppugazh et al 2014 contamination of groundwater is caused by effluent seepage and solid wastes center for science and environment cse new delhi reported that more than 1500 industries of bharuch district have been discharging effluents into amlakhadi which further flows into the narmada river near bharuch where there are factories manufacturing dyes paints textiles pharmaceuticals paper pesticides and fertilizer industries during monsoon the effluent overflows further destroying farmlands pollution caused by fertilizers and pesticides used in agriculture often dispersed over large areas known as non point pollution eclectic disposal of human and animal waste on land and intensive use of agriculture inputs in farms result in leaching of the chemicals which is a big threat to fresh groundwater ecosystems the groundwater acquired its unique chemistry through geological interactions leaching and reactions at vadose zone yousef nazzal 2014 groundwater chemistry changes during post monsoon season as water remain in rivers for a relatively short time covering days or weeks in contrast the water flows through the ground very slowly generally varies in age from months to years compared to the flow in the upper part of the unconfined zone therefore groundwater samples showed an increasing trend from monsoon to pre monsoon season over exploitation highly populated or industrial cluster areas like vadodara ankleshwar saline water ingression coastal areas like khambhat and geology rock type of the pathri gandevi vansda ahwa halol dahod rajpipla played a major role in increasing sodium hazard these results emphasize the need of adopting judicious management strategies to mitigate the problem of deteriorating groundwater quality in the study area 4 conclusion the study gives significant details on the development of ground water quality in southern and central part parts of gujarat state of india ground water is immensely important for water supply in both urban and rural areas particularly groundwater quality of amroli rajpipla vyara vansda and ahwa varied from good to moderate for all the three seasons vadodara district of central gujarat and bharuch tapi districts of south gujarat were significantly affected vansda and ahwa were occasionally influenced by landscape and minor industrialization khambhat region showed changes with respect to salinity due to its proximity to the arabian sea the high level of bicarbonates etc in groundwater deteriorated the water quality which made it unsuitable for irrigation purpose during the post monsoon and pre monsoon period due to sandy and loamy soil type of central gujarat changes were observed from post monsoon and pre monsoon in case of clayey type of soil in south gujarat majority of groundwater quality changes were observed in pre monsoon this is owing to rate of leaching of salts and sodium is much easier from coarse textured soils sandy whereas clays are particularly effective in adsorbing cations as their surfaces are consistently negatively charged the implication is that groundwater salinization threats need diagnosis monitoring and careful management to overcome deterioration of groundwater quality the calculated values of pi indicate that the water for irrigation uses is excellent to good quality in both seasons as per wilcox s diagram and us salinity laboratory classification most of the groundwater samples are suitable for irrigation except one sample which is unsuitable for irrigation purposes the overall quality of groundwater in post monsoon season in all chemical constituents is on the higher side due to dissolution of surface pollutants during the infiltration and percolation of rainwater at few places due to agricultural and domestic activities acknowledgment this work is a part of research thesis for the degree of doctor of philosophy ph d of
