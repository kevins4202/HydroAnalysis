19125,wastewater treatment plants wwtps have been identified as confirmed but until today underestimated sources of legionella playing an important role in local and community cases and outbreaks of legionnaires disease in general aerobic biological systems provide an optimum environment for the growth of legionella due to high organic nitrogen and oxygen concentrations ideal temperatures and the presence of protozoa however few studies have investigated the occurrence of legionella in wwtps and many questions in regards to the interacting factors that promote the proliferation and persistence of legionella in these treatment systems are still unanswered this critical review summarizes the current knowledge about legionella in municipal and industrial wwtps the conditions that might support their growth as well as control strategies that have been applied furthermore an overview of current quantification methods guidelines and health risks associated with legionella in reclaimed wastewater is also discussed in depth a better understanding of the conditions promoting the occurrence of legionella in wwtps will contribute to the development of improved wastewater treatment technologies and or innovative mitigation approaches to minimize future legionella outbreaks graphical abstract image 1 keywords legionella wastewater treatment plants activated sludge industrial wastewater reclaimed wastewater 1 introduction legionella are gram negative facultative intracellular bacteria found in the natural environment as well as in man made water systems percival et al 2014 the genus legionella includes more than 50 species lesnik et al 2016 from which around 20 species have been confirmed to be pathogens to humans lück 2009 infection occurs exclusively by the inhalation of aerosols contaminated with legionella which can cause a flu like illness called pontiac fever or a severe clinical pneumonia known as legionnaire s disease ld sharaby et al 2017 legionella pneumophila is divided into 15 serogroups among which l pneumophila sg1 is responsible for more than 90 of confirmed ld outbreaks and sporadic cases with 10 15 mortality rate making it the most relevant and studied species within the genus legionella ecdc 2015 fields et al 2002 evidence of other serogroups is rare with l pneumophila sg6 being the second most common serogroup isolated from clinical samples in the united states and europe us epa 2016 l pneumophila is included within the drinking water contaminant candidate list and regulatory determination 4 ccl4 from the united states environmental protection agency us epa us epa 2016 other pathogenic species associated with clinical cases are legionella micdadei legionella longbeachae legionella dumoffii and legionella bozemanii bartram et al 2007 lau and ashbolt 2009 among the documented non l pneumophila infections l micdadei represents the second most common cause of ld in united states and europe us epa 2016 while in australia and new zeeland l longbeachae is the causative agent of approximately 30 of community acquired ld yu et al 2002 it has been reported that ld follows a seasonal trend showing a higher incidence in summer months in comparison to other types of community acquired pneumonia prussin et al 2017 it is plausible that climate change might affect the transmission pathways of legionella increasing the incidence of ld cases the study of brandse et al 2014 showed that warm and wet weather conditions followed by heavy rainfall were the factors associated with the increased cases of community acquired ld in the netherlands contrary in other regions were climate change has caused droughts or longer and extreme summer seasons storing rain water for long periods and the increased use of irrigation systems may lead to a potential rise in the number of people exposed to legionella ahmed et al 2014 in addition with warmer and longer summers water temperature will increase 25 c in different water systems such as cold water supplies within buildings fountains or municipal wwtps increasing the risk of growth and exposure to legionella legionella are considered a nutritionally fastidious bacteria in axenic laboratory growth cultures because of its incapability to metabolize carbohydrates and its strict requirement of amino acids as a source of carbon and energy george et al 1980 percival et al 2014 wieland et al 2005 however legionella are usually detected in poor nutrient environments like engineered water systems where they have developed mechanisms to obtain amino acids by parasitizing and multiplying within protozoa steinert et al 2002 in drinking water systems for instance protozoa and biofilms along the pipe walls are considered the main reservoirs of legionella lau and ashbolt 2009 in complex matrices like biofilms protozoa represent a key factor on the survival of legionella not only by providing amino acids for intracellular growth but also by acting as shelter against hostile environmental conditions and disinfection agents abu kwaik et al 1998 scheikl et al 2014 although intracellular replication within protozoa plays an important role on the growth and survival of l pneumophila studies have shown that environmental l pneumophila is able to grow independently from protozoa by interacting with other water microorganisms and or by obtaining essential nutrients from other sources like decaying organic matter and dead cells devos et al 2005 stout et al 1985 temmerman et al 2006 until now studies have demonstrated that three groups of microorganisms favour the growth of l pneumophila protozoa price et al 2014 rowbotham 1980 cyanobacteria tison et al 1980 and other bacteria states et al 1987 wadowsky and yee 1985 these studies support the idea that despite the strict nutritional conditions shown in pure cultures environmental legionella are able to benefit from associated microorganisms as suppliers of nutrients due to the extensive research that has been done concerning the occurrence of legionella in drinking water systems plenty of preventive and control guidelines have been already established and are in use to decrease the risk of ld outbreaks in these systems cdc 2017 hartemann and hautemaniere 2011 nevertheless there have been only few studies focused on non potable water systems that represent an important source of legionella such a wastewater treatment systems wwtps have been identified as confirmed sources of legionella caicedo et al 2016 nogueira et al 2016 van heijnsbergen et al 2015 wwtps are constructed to treat municipal and industrial effluents that are discharged into natural water bodies or reused for agricultural or industrial purposes briefly conventional wwtps include a primary treatment where sedimentation and skimming processes are used to remove organic and inorganic solids as well as floating material like oil and grease effluents from primary treatment are then directed into a secondary biological treatment generally based on the activated sludge process used to remove dissolved and colloidal compounds from wastewater the aeration of primary treated wastewater in the activated sludge tank promotes the growth of microorganisms in flocs known as activated sludge that are subsequently separated from the treated wastewater by sedimentation within the microorganisms present in activated sludge protozoa are considered as important predators controlling bacterial communities and consuming colloidal particles metcalf and eddy 2003 a tertiary treatment is usually used to remove residual solids nitrogen phosphorus and finally disinfection processes take place by applying chlorine ozone or uv irradiation before treated wastewater is discharged into natural water systems or further re used in aerobic biological treatment systems the combination of ideal temperature in combined systems receiving industrial effluents 30 c lapara and alleman 1999 availability of oxygen and organic nitrogen and the presence of protozoa provide an ideal environment for the proliferation of legionella therefore these facilities may play an important role in local or community transmission of legionella according to the centers for disease control and prevention cdc ld cases are considered as outbreaks when two or more people exposed to legionella are sick at the same time and at the same place cdc 2018 considering this definition and the documented ld cases linked to wwtps blatny et al 2011 loenenbach et al 2018 maisa et al 2015 nguyen et al 2006 nygard et al 2008 it can be assumed that these biological treatment facilities are more likely to be associated with legionella outbreaks rather than sporadic cases direct aerosol dispersion from biological aerated tanks has been reported in ld outbreaks to reach distances of 300 m olsen et al 2010 and 1 6 km loenenbach et al 2018 in two other ld outbreaks associated with wwtps an additional aerosol disseminator was involved e g cooling towers or air scrubbers generating and transmitting aerosols containing legionella to distances up to 6 10 km nguyen et al 2006 olsen et al 2010 it is essential to understand how legionella proliferate and persist in wwtps in order to develop effective preventive and control strategies in this work an extensive literature review was conducted on the methods routinely used for the detection and quantification of legionella in environmental samples on the occurrence of legionella in domestic and industrial wwtp in association to wastewater composition and operational parameters on the elimination measures that have been implemented as well as on the health risks associated with reclaimed wastewater reuse 2 methods for the detection and quantification of legionella in wastewater the detection and quantification of legionella in wastewater is challenging because of the complex chemical and biological composition of the wastewater matrix in comparison to drinking water currently there are several methods for legionella quantification but most of the studies that investigated the occurrence of legionella in wwtps as shown in tables 1 and 2 used the culture method and the real time polymerase chain reaction qpcr method therefore this literature review focuses on the advantages and disadvantages of these two methods as follows culture method the culture method used to quantify legionella in water samples is described in the international standard iso 11 731 2017 water quality and enumeration of legionella this method is considered as the gold standard because it quantifies viable and culturable legionella reischl et al 2002 the results are expressed in colony forming units the cultivation of legionella has been improved through the use of specific agar formulations and sample pre treatments to promote the growth of these bacteria and to suppress the growth of unwanted microorganisms the most widely used solid medium to cultivate legionella is the buffered charcoal yeast extract agar bcye supplemented with cysteine iron salts and α ketoglutarate cdc 2005 to suppress the growth of background flora present in water samples the agar is supplemented with the antibiotics glycine vancomycin polymyxin b and cycloheximide gvpc wadowsky and yee 1981 heat and or acid pre treatments of water samples are usually performed depending on the origin and level of contamination the samples can be heated up to 50 c for 30 min or 60 c for 1 3 min and or treated with hcl ph 2 2 for 5 20 min percival et al 2014 it has been reported in the literature that the culture method underestimates legionella s concentration in wastewater samples caicedo et al 2016 lund et al 2014 medema et al 2004 the main acknowledged disadvantages of this method are i the harsh sample pre treatment conditions that can affect legionella s cultivability whiley and taylor 2016 ii the method is optimized for the detection of l pneumophila sg1 and does not detect all legionella spp lee et al 1993 iii the difficulty in obtaining reproducible and consistent results iv the presence of inhibitors in the samples and or overgrowth of legionella by background flora and v the failure to detect viable but non culturable vbnc legionella delgado viscogliosi et al 2009 pascual et al 2001 in addition mccoy et al 2012 reported that the sampling holding time significantly affects legionella counts the authors showed that in 52 of the samples the concentrations of legionella varied c a 1 log unit within 6 h and up to 2 log units within 24 h despite the above mentioned disadvantages the culture method continues to be widely used due to the lack of alternative methods which quantify viable and culturable legionella and because the majority of the guidelines for drinking water systems and cooling towers use the culture method as the reference standard blanky et al 2015 and rodríguez martínez et al 2015 modified the iso standard 11 731 1998 to quantify legionella in greywater the concentration of microorganisms in greywater is much lower than in wastewater because greywater has not come into contact with human solid waste briefly the modified method includes an additional pre filtration step to remove particles exceeding 100 μm pore size subsequently the sample is filtered again through a 0 2 μm cellulose nitrate filter to concentrate the microorganisms on the surface of the filter the filter is suspended in a buffer and vortexed for 10 min the obtained solution is then centrifuged and the supernatant is replaced with acid buffer after the acid treatment the sample is vortexed and immediately heated for 30 min at 50 c finally for the quantification treated samples are plated on gvpc selective media the maximal recovery rate of this method estimated by using sterile potable water with a known concentration of legionella was only 6 blanky et al 2015 the low recovery rate of this protocol might be related to the highly aggressive acid thermal treatment of the greywater samples with the purpose to suppress growth of background flora it is well documented in the literature that legionella can resist stressful conditions entering into a viable but non culturable vbnc state mansi et al 2014 exposure to high temperatures 50 c and to acid buffer might be seen as stressors for legionella in the vbnc state legionella are not detected by the cultivation method which might explain the low recovery rates described in both studies another limitation of the modified cultivation method proposed by blanky et al 2015 and rodríguez martínez et al 2015 is the underestimation of the concentration of legionella in greywater because the pre filtration step to remove coarse matter also excludes legionella adsorbed to embedded in the solids from the samples to be analysed this protocol can be considered as a method to isolate legionella from complex matrices like greywater or wastewater but the quantification should be further improved to counteract the limitations mentioned before qpcr method this molecular method has been used extensively for the quantification of legionella in wastewater samples the method and quality control procedures for the detection and quantification of legionella by the qpcr are described in the international standard iso ts 12 869 2012 water quality detection and quantification of legionella spp and or legionella pneumophila by concentration and genic amplification by quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr the principle of the method relies on the amplification and quantification of a target dna sequence and the results are expressed in copy numbers or genomic units to detect legionella spp in clinical and environmental samples genus specific primers have been developed to target the 16s rrna jarraud et al 2013 wellinghausen et al 2001 the 5s rrna hayden et al 2001 and the 23s5s genes herpers et al 2003 kao et al 2014 for the detection of l pneumophila primers targeting the macrophage infectivity potentiator gene mip have been used behets et al 2007 jarraud et al 2013 kao et al 2014 wullings et al 2011 yáñez et al 2005 however as described by stølhaug and bergh 2006 other pathogenic non l pneumophila species have been also detected with high accuracy by targeting the mip gene the advantages of the qpcr method are high sensitivity and shorter time required for analysis results can be obtained within hours in comparison to the culture method mansi et al 2014 however it has two main limitations the qpcr reaction can be inhibited by substances present in the sample and it does not differentiate between living injured and dead bacteria which can result in an overestimation of health risks of ld the presence of qpcr inhibitors in environmental samples has been reported in the literature brooks et al 2004 sidstedt et al 2015 they can be divided into amplification inhibitors which are the ones acting directly on the dna polymerase by modifying the buffer composition or binding nucleic acids and detection inhibitors which interfere with the fluorescence signal from dyes or probes sidstedt et al 2015 the inhibitors that are expected to be present in wastewater samples include bile salts polysaccharides urea lipids proteins metal ions e g iron and aluminum humic substances and phytic acids chaturvedi et al 2008 radström et al 2004 rock et al 2010 shieh et al 1995 sidstedt et al 2015 during the last few years several strategies and commercial qpcr kits have been developed for the removal of pcr inhibitors in specific matrices in wastewater inhibitors can readily be detected by applying appropriate internal controls and pcr inhibition can be addressed using different approaches such as additional extraction steps e g heat treatment before the pcr dilution of the sample extraction with solvents ultrafiltration with positively charged membranes addition of unique buffer formulations to separate pcr inhibitors from dna and cleaning steps to obtain pure and intact dna chaturvedi et al 2008 schrader et al 2012 attempts have been also made to improve the qpcr method to differentiate between living and dead legionella several studies demonstrated that it is possible to amplify only living cells by pre treating the samples with the nucleic acid dyes ethidium monoazide ema and propium monoazide pma before dna extraction the ema and pma enter damaged cells membranes and react with dna to restrict its amplification and therefore its quantification bonetta et al 2017 reyneke et al 2017 although viable qpcr could be considered as a promising method for the quantification of legionella in environmental samples it needs to be optimized to overcome reported problems like ema entering undamaged cells insufficient concentrations of ema or pma to block dna amplification from dead cells and the presence of extracellular substances that influence the binding between ema and dna from dead cells fittipaldi et al 2012 whiley and taylor 2016 control assays to assess the effectiveness of the viability dyes ema and pma are done by comparing qpcr threshold cycle values ct for cells treated and non treated with the molecular dyes both viability dyes have been reported to reduce the qpcr signal when they enter living cells resulting in an increase of the ct ema is more likely to enter intact cell membranes hence causing a greater qpcr signal reduction in comparison to pma seinige et al 2014 these control assays are usually done with pure cultures and the increase in the ct values can also indicate either the presence of membrane compromised cells or the presence of dead cells fittipaldi et al 2012 moreover the membrane permeability can vary according to cell growth phase in the study of gedalanga and olson 2009 ema treatment showed to have a lower influence on e coli viable cells during the exponential phase of growth compared to the effect observed at the lag and stationary phases of growth the authors attributed this result to the cellular membrane properties which changes through the different growth phases another disadvantage of the qpcr method is the limited number of specific primer pairs that can be analysed in a qpcr run even using multiplex qpcr this means that by choosing the primer pairs a pre selection of the legionella species to be detected is done an alternative molecular method applied for the detection of legionella in wastewater is high throughput pyrosequencing which generates large amounts of sequence reads in a single run through a massive sequencing by synthesis approach in the study of ma et al 2015 the 454 high throughput pyrosequencing method was reported to be an efficient tool for the characterization of the most dominant potential pathogens in activated sludge and treated wastewater including legionella pathogenic species l parisiensis l longbeachae l bozemanii l pneumophila l micdadei despite the limitations that qpcr presents this molecular technique is considered a rapid versatile and highly specific option for the detection and or quantification of pathogenic bacteria including l pneumophila in environmental samples to minimize ld risks in outbreak situations it is of the utmost importance to improve the response time to take control measures for that collins et al 2015 recommended the use of the qpcr method for legionella quantification and the culture method only in qpcr positive samples to obtain isolates for epidemiological studies an international trial to quantify legionella in artificial water systems by the culture and qpcr methods was done with the purpose to develop an algorithm for the interpretation of qpcr results in routine monitoring or outbreak investigations lee et al 2011 for routine monitoring in cooling towers and non healthcare water systems the authors suggest that for l pneumophila concentrations under 5 103 gu l alert level no actions are required while for higher concentrations samples should be additionally analysed by the culture method and disinfection and control actions are recommended for health care facilities and outbreak investigations the authors suggest a higher qpcr alert level of 4 103 gu l for l pneumophila and 104 gu l for legionella spp for samples above the alert level the legionella quantification should be repeated in parallel by both methods to obtain information about viability and present strains if the results from the culture method or both are positive the actions recommended within the corresponding regulation drinking water systems or cooling towers for monitoring by culture should be applied in case of positive qpcr but negative culture results further investigations are recommended to determine the origin of the legionella signal within the system until now molecular methods are still not considered for the quantification of legionella in standards guidelines and regulations issued for the prevention and control of legionella in potable water systems brooks et al 2004 morio et al 2008 the previously mentioned study could be considered as a step forward to the development of an algorithm for the interpretation of culture and qpcr results in wastewater monitoring a consensus between molecular and culturable methods is necessary to facilitate the decision making process on public health measures and for the establishing of threshold values in activated sludge tanks and discharge limits for legionella in wastewater 3 occurrence of legionella in wwtps wwtps that include aerobic biological treatment processes are systems which provide conditions that promote the proliferation of legionella wastewater typically contains sufficient organic matter nitrogen and phosphorus to support microbial growth organic nitrogen mainly in the forms of protein and urea accounts for at least 30 of the total nitrogen in the wastewater westgate and park 2010 in a study investigating the spatial distribution of protozoa and legionella in activated sludge using fluorescence in situ hybridization fish caicedo et al 2018 reported the occurrence of legionella mainly as clusters dispersed in the activated sludge matrix and only a few protozoa were found infected with legionella these results suggest that legionella might be able to use the organic nitrogen in the wastewater as a source of amino acids however further studies are necessary to validate this hypothesis in complex biocenoses such as biofilms and activated sludge several microorganisms can play a key role in the growth of legionella in biofilms protozoa have been identified as the main environmental reservoir and vehicle for legionella transmission lau and ashbolt 2009 steinert et al 2002 protozoan hosts for legionella growth have been identified by co culturing laboratory techniques or by co isolation from environmental samples in vitro co cultures studies have shown that acanthamoeba spp hartmannella spp naegleria spp echinamoeba exundans tetramitus jugosus dictyostelium discoideum balamuthia mandrillaris and tetrahymena spp can serve as hosts for l pneumophila valster et al 2010 several co isolation studies described the presence of the aforementioned protozoa in environmental water systems with acanthamoeba hartmannella naegleria and vahlkampfia being the most commonly detected genera in several water sources boamah et al 2017 interestingly these genera have also been found in activated sludge systems garcía et al 2011 magnet et al 2013 ramirez et al 2014 1993 the operating conditions in wwtps also represent an advantage for the proliferation of legionella dissolved oxygen concentrations in activated sludge tanks are maintained in a range of 0 5 2 0 mg l to promote the growth of key aerobic microorganisms involved in the removal of carbon and nitrogen the oxygen requirements for the growth of legionella species including l pneumophila reported in literature are in the range of 0 3 2 2 mg l mauchline et al 1992 wadowsky et al 1985 meaning that the dissolved oxygen concentration in the activated sludge tanks is ideal for the growth of legionella the temperature at which wwtps are operated is generally not controlled and can be influenced by many factors such as location weather conditions and type of wastewater in general growth of microorganisms for wastewater treatment occurs in the range of 8 30 c nevertheless in combined systems where municipal and industrial wastewaters are treated together the operating temperature can be 30 c lapara and alleman 1999 the growth of legionella species including l pneumophila has been reported at temperatures ranging from 25 to 42 c with an optimum growth at 35 c falkinham et al 2015 meaning that aerated systems provide ideal conditions for legionella in hot summer periods the temperatures in industrial systems can rise and remain at levels up to 40 c causing temporary die off in the mixed microbial populations present in the activated sludge under these specific events a faster growth of legionella can be hypothesized based on the following reasons i a temperature of 40 c is in the range for optimal growth of legionella as mentioned before legionella compared to other bacteria also resist higher temperatures up to 63 c typical for warm water distribution systems fliermans 1996 wadowsky et al 1985 b l pneumophila can grow on dead biomass reported in the literature as necrotrophic growth temmerman et al 2006 a sudden increase in the wastewater temperature causes die off of the unacclimated biomass that might support necrotrophic growth of legionella this form of growth does not require a microbial host the occurrence of legionella has been reported in municipal as well as in industrial wwtps two main differences between municipal and industrial wastewater are the temperature and the organic nutrient concentrations which are in general higher in industrial wastewaters the treatment of industrial wastewater often combines an anaerobic reactor followed by an aerobic process for a better insight into the conditions associated to the occurrence of legionella in wwtps municipal and industrial plants will be addressed separately 3 1 occurrence of legionella in municipal wwtps municipal wastewater is a mixture of domestic water coming from residential and commercial facilities industrial effluents and run off rain water the occurrence of legionella has been reported in several municipal wwtps based on the activated sludge process in germany caicedo et al 2016 france brissaud et al 2008 netherlands schalk et al 2012 norway lund et al 2014 spain catalan et al 1997 usa kulkarni et al 2018 palmer et al 1993 roll and fujioka 1995 and china cai and zhang 2013 huang et al 2009 these studies reported the presence of legionella at different treatment steps table 1 indicating that this genus is able to grow and survive within wwtps roll and fujioka 1995 and palmer et al 1993 reported legionella spp concentrations 106 cells l and l pneumophila concentrations 106 cells l in all stages of wastewater treatment starting from the settling basins up to and including chlorinated effluents palmer et al 1993 stated that the concentration of legionella spp did not differ significantly throughout the wwtp medema et al 2004 reported legionella spp concentrations of 108 gu l in raw wastewater while brissaud et al 2008 reported legionella spp concentrations between 106 107 gu l in treated wastewater in the study of kulkarni et al 2018 conducted in three wwtps using different biological processes activated sludge sequencing batch reactor and secondary aeration tank the abundance of legionella spp was higher in treated wastewater in comparison to raw wastewater in fact the pathogenic species l pneumophila l feeleii and l tusconensis were not detected in raw wastewater but in activated sludge secondary clarifier and effluent samples after tertiary treatment the survival of legionella within the different steps of the wwtp is presumably due to intracellular growth within protozoa or through growth within the biofilm along the pipes which allow the bacteria to overcome adverse environmental conditions among the reviewed literature only two studies tried to correlate the occurrence of legionella with operational parameters of the municipal wwtp on the one hand caicedo et al 2016 reported legionella spp concentrations between 103 108 gu l in activated sludge tanks from three wwtp and positive correlations between legionella spp concentrations and particulate chemical oxygen demand kjeldahl nitrogen and protein concentrations in wastewater on the other hand the survey done by huang et al 2009 reported that the occurrence of legionella in 10 out of 17 wwtps in taiwan did not correlate with the operational conditions in this study legionella were detected in 75 of the samples with a temperature range between 15 and 20 c in comparison to only 56 of legionella positive samples with a higher temperature range 25 30 c the authors also reported that the detection of legionella does not differ significantly among samples with different ph electrical conductivity turbidity dissolved oxygen concentrations or presence of heterotrophic bacteria even though it is well known that temperature plays an important role in the multiplication of l pneumophila limited information exits about the exact temperature range that promotes the growth of the pathogen in municipal wwtps only few studies reported the wastewater temperature in positive samples for l pneumophila maisa et al 2015 and nogueira et al 2016 reported the occurrence of l pneumophila sg 1 with a concentration 5 107 cfu l in a municipal plant receiving industrial effluents at a temperature between 30 and 35 c lund et al 2014 detected l pneumophila in a concentration range between 103 106 gu l at least once in seven of eight municipal wwtps with a lower wastewater temperature range 7 c 15 c on the other hand brissaud et al 2008 reported the occurrence of l pneumophila at relatively low concentrations detectable but non quantifiable in treated wastewater of a municipal plant receiving mainly domestic effluents with a temperature between 20 c and 30 c these results support the hypothesis that temperature is probably not the only factor responsible for the occurrence of l pneumophila in municipal wwtps and further investigations are needed to define the conditions that favour its growth the occurrence of other pathogenic and non pathogenic legionella species in domestic wwtp has also been reported in the literature huang et al 2009 and schalk et al 2012 found the pathogenic species l anisa and l sainthelensi and the non pathogenic species l lytica and l fallonii in samples taken from the influent of the wwtps as well as samples from aeration ponds bio aerosols generated during wastewater treatment have also been investigated for the presence of legionella roll and fujioka 1995 detected legionella spp in air samples collected above aeration basins 109 cells m3 and mirzaee et al 2015 reported legionella positive results in air samples collected above the aeration basin sludge dewatering process and 250 m downwind from the wwtp similarly pascual et al 2001 obtained l pneumophila positive results in 30 of the air samples taken at the pre treatment stage and in 11 of the samples taken above the activated sludge tanks medema et al 2004 also reported the presence of legionella spp and l pneumophila in aerosols above trickling filters aeration tanks and belt filter press at concentrations of 0 56 56 gu m3 and stated that aerated systems are facilities where prevention measures should be taken to reduce the risk of legionella infections ma et al 2015 reported a decrease in the relative abundance of legionella in a mbr treating restaurant wastewater from 19 to below 0 5 in the membrane effluent showing that membranes can produce legionella free treated wastewater legionella are thus retained by the membrane and accumulated in the reactor at wwtps operating with mbr care has to be taken to avoid a high legionella s concentration in aerosols nguyen et al 2006 and olsen et al 2010 reported that aerosols can be transported by the wind distances up to 10 km from the source thus increasing the risk of a legionella outbreak it has been reported in the literature that aerosols containing legionella with a size of 10 μm are more likely to enter the respiratory system and to be transported further distances whereas aerosols 10 μm are more likely to contain higher concentrations of legionella since they can transport cysts infected with legionella but with reduced dispersion distances due to higher settling velocities prussin et al 2017 schoen and ashbolt 2011 the aerosol size distribution and weather conditions e g wind velocity and direction humidity are important factors in determining the distance that airborne legionella can reach during ld outbreaks future research is needed to characterize aerosols generation of different aeration systems as well as dispersion models of airborne legionella in wwtps risk assessments of legionella in municipal wwtps are not adequately represented in literature studies are necessary to evaluate and classify the risk of growth of legionella in municipal plants based on the size of the facility type of treatment type of influent as well as operating conditions further research should be done in municipal wwtp receiving industrial effluents to clarify the influence of industrial wastewater constituents and temperatures on the growth of legionella 3 2 occurrence of legionella in industrial wwtps the few studies available in the context of legionella in industrial wwtps were done in treatment plants from the wood and paper mills petrochemical beer and food production table 2 the occurrence of legionella in treatment plants from other industrial sectors cannot be excluded a wastewater temperature above 25 c is the common factor within the industrial wastewaters with high compositional variance an overview of the legionella concentrations operating conditions at each industrial wwtp and the efforts from the industrial sector to eradicate the growth of l pneumophila are summarized in the following sections wood production and paper mills wastewater from wood and paper production is characterized by relatively high chemical oxygen demand cod concentrations up to 5700 mg l depending on the type of paper being produced and very low concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorous compounds atv dvwk 2011a the addition of inorganic nutrients is indispensable for microbial growth during wastewater treatment the temperature of the wastewater varies between 30 and 37 c and the characteristics depend on the type of production process raw materials and or internal recirculation for resource recovery among other factors pokhrel and viraraghavan 2004 for a wastewater with a cod concentration less than 1000 mg l aerobic biological treatment processes have been used namely activated sludge bio membrane reactors and stabilization ponds mahmood and paice 2006 pokhrel and viraraghavan 2004 anaerobic treatment is recommended when the cod concentration of the wastewater exceeds 1000 mg l atv dvwk 2011a among the anaerobic treatment processes the most commonly used in the wood and paper industry are the anaerobic granular reactors up flow sludge blanket uasb expanded granular sludge bed egsb and the fluidized bed reactors fykse et al 2016 pokhrel and viraraghavan 2004 in an extensive monitoring of 43 wwtps from paper mills in sweden allestam et al 2006 reported legionella concentrations up to 109 cfu l in 66 of the aerated ponds receiving wastewater with an average temperature of 38 4 c l pneumophila sg 2 14 were dominant in all aerated ponds legionella were not detected in aerated ponds receiving wastewater with a temperature below 30 c additionally aerosols were monitored in cooling towers used to bring down the temperature of the wastewater only 3 samples out of 12 were positive for legionella thus allestam et al 2006 concluded that the cooling towers were not the source of legionella for the wwtps in finland a monitoring study was done in two industrial wwtps from the paper industry with 2 diagnosed cases of ld among workers kusnetsov et al 2010 l pneumophila sg1 and sg13 were found at concentrations of 1 106 cfu l and 2 107 cfu l respectively in the activated sludge tanks from wwtp a operated at 33 36 c in treated wastewater the concentration of l pneumophila sg1 2 3 104 cfu l was ca 2 log lower this reduction is explained by the separation of the sludge from the treated wastewater in the sedimentation tank in the excess sludge l pneumophila sg1 and sg13 were both found at a concentration of 106 cfu l in wwtp b l pneumophila sg5 and l rubrilucens a pathogenic non l pneumophila species were found at concentrations of 3 107 and 8 109 cfu l respectively in the activated sludge tanks operated at 35 37 c kusnetsov et al 2010 in aerosols from the cooling tower used to bring down the temperature of the wastewater l pneumophila sg2 was found at a concentration of 1 7 103 cfu l this same serogroup was isolated from the infected worker suggesting that the cooling tower was the source of infection in norway the aeration ponds receiving wastewater from the wood based factory borregaard were identified as the source of 3 ld outbreaks that occurred between 2005 and 2008 in 2005 56 confirmed cases of ld and 10 deaths were reported and until 2008 50 more people were diagnosed with ld nygard et al 2008 the biological treatment consisted of an anaerobic reactor followed by two aeration ponds operated at 36 38 c fykse et al 2013 in an extensive investigation of the etiology of the ld outbreaks l pneumophila sg1was found in the aeration ponds up to 1010 cfu l in the river downstream of the wwtp outlet 105 cfu l and in air samples collected above the aeration ponds 3 300 cfu m3 contaminated aerosols reached distances up to 200 m downwind the aerated ponds blatny et al 2008 fykse et al 2016 olsen et al 2010 an air scrubber located 200 m away from the aeration ponds was also spreading l pneumophila contaminated aerosols at a distance up to 10 km from the source nygard et al 2008 to prevent more ld cases control measures were taken to eliminate the source of legionella the shut down of the aerated ponds and the dosing of hypochlorite resulted in a 3 4 log reduction in the concentration of l pneumophila in the wastewater in air samples collected above the aeration ponds the concentration of the pathogen decreased to 43 cfu m3 olsen et al 2010 the aeration ponds were not reactivated presently the industrial wastewater is entirely treated anaerobically in a closed egsb full scale reactor before discharge into the river the effluent is filtered by hydrotech disc filters to avoid potential release of legionella or other pathogenic microorganisms fykse et al 2016 petrochemical industry petrochemical industries produce different types of products derived from petroleum and natural gas the wastewater generated in this type of industry contains toxic substances therefore its treatment generally requires a combination of biological and chemical processes before its final discharge in surface waters tiku 2005 l pneumophila sg1 lens in a concentration range of 106 1010 cfu l was found in the activated sludge tanks treating wastewater from a petrochemical industry producing solvents in france hartemann et al 2018 interestingly this strain was identical to l pneumophila sg1 strain 15 found in high concentrations in the previously mentioned wwtp from the wood and paper industry in norway olsen et al 2010 the pathogen was also found in two cooling towers located between 200 and 300 m from the aerated basins the contaminated aerosols produced by the aerated tanks and the cooling towers were spread in a distance up to 6 km from the petrochemical plant causing a ld outbreak with 86 confirmed cases and 18 fatalities nguyen et al 2006 to stop the outbreak it was necessary to shut down the cooling towers and the aerators in the activated sludge tanks in the study from lund et al 2014 samples from nine wwtp from petrochemical industries with aerated lagoons were analysed all samples were positive for l pneumophila in a concentration range of 104 107 gu l the temperature in all monitored wwtps was above 25 c and the lowest concentration of legionella was observed in the wastewater coming from the production of polyethylene or ethylene wastewater composition from the petrochemical industry differs considerably according to the industrial activities thus further studies aiming to correlate wastewater parameters and l pneumophila concentrations are necessary to understand which factors promote the growth of the pathogen in this type of wastewater brewery the composition of brewery wastewater depends on the type of process used for beer production this wastewater is readily biodegradable and it is characterized by the following parameters 300 1800 mg l cod 30 100 mg l total nitrogen 10 30 mg l total phosphorous and a temperature between 25 c and 35 c atv dvwk 2010 brewery wastewater is usually collected in equalization tanks to regulate flow and concentrations these tanks can be aerated to provide an initial biological degradation both aerobic activated sludge fluidized bed reactor and anaerobic processes egsb uasb processes have been used to treat wastewater however when anaerobic processes are applied a post aerated treatment is necessary to eliminate nitrogen for direct discharge into water bodies during the largest legionnaires outbreak in germany ocurred in warstein 2013 l pneumophila sg1 knoxville was isolated from an industrial sewer transporting brewery wastewater the municipal wwtp receiving the industrial effluent the river where the treated wastewater was discharged and in two cooling towers from industrial facilities located 3 km away from the wwtp the industrial wastewater was aerobically pre treated in mixing and equalization tanks and discharged into the municipal wwtp where trickling filters and activated sludge tanks were used to treat the wastewater the highest concentrations of the epidemic strain were found in the effluents from the mixing and equalization tanks 1 1010 cfu l and in the activated sludge tanks 5 107 cfu l exner et al 2014 maisa et al 2015 nogueira et al 2016 the treated wastewater was discharged to the river wester where the concentration of l pneumophila including the epidemic strain was 2 105 cfu l exner 2015 approximately 3 km downstream water drawn from the river to operate a cooling tower resulted in the biggest ld outbreak in germany with 159 suspected cases 78 laboratory confirmed cases and 2 fatalities exner 2015 maisa et al 2015 to eliminate the source of legionella several control measures were implemented the trickling filters were shut down the activated sludge tanks were covered and the aeration with compressed air was replaced with pure oxygen to minimize aerosols production a uv 254 nm disinfection unit was installed at the effluent of the wwtp and a combined performic acid disinfection was tested for a short period of time 5 months after uv treatment the concentration of l pneumophila in the treated wastewater was 1 6 3 4 log units lower than before treatment the combination of uv performic acid reduced further the concentration of the pathogen to values close to the limit of detection of the culture method nogueira et al 2016 currently the equalization tanks used to pre treat brewery wastewater were shut down and substituted by an anaerobic esgb reactor the anaerobically treated wastewater is discharged into the municipal wwtp in addition in the work of nogueira et al 2016 several physical and chemical disinfection agents including microsil hydrogen peroxide chlorine dioxide alkaline ph ozone and ultrasounds were proved to be ineffective to reduce the concentration of l pneumophila in activated sludge at concentrations which would not inhibit biological treatment supressing the growth of l pneumophila directly in the activated sludge is of the utmost importance because it prevents the emission of contaminated aerosols and at the same time the discharge of effluents contaminated with legionella hence future investigations should focus on the development of specific legionella inhibitors that do not affect the activity of key microorganisms necessary for the biological treatment of wastewater food production and dairy industries the composition of dairy wastewater depends on the size of the factory used processes technologies and good manufacturing practices in general wastewater from the milk processing industries has a temperature between 20 and 30 c and a high organic content composed by carbohydrates proteins and lipids with a daily fluctuation varying from 800 to 4500 mg l cod concentrations and 10 110 mg l total nitrogen concentrations atv dvwk 2011b this type of wastewater is characterized by high concentrations of solids colloids and soluble compounds and it is usually treated by mechanical and chemical processes the majority of dairies treat the wastewater aerobically in activated sludge processes moving bed biofilm reactor sequencing batch reactor and membrane reactor among others or through a combination of anaerobic pre treatment followed by an aerobic treatment kolev slavov 2017 lund et al 2014 investigated eight wwtp from dairies with a temperature around 25 c samples taken from the activated sludge tanks were 100 positive for legionella and 34 positive for l pneumophila with a concentration between 103 107 gu l interestingly the authors suggested that dairy wastewater might contain chemical or microbiological inhibitors for instance lactobacillus that prevent the growth of l pneumophila unfortunately no further studies to support the hypothesis were found in the literature in denmark the occurrence of l pneumophila and l londiniensis was reported in a wwtp receiving wastewater from the food industry non specified five workers were infected with l pneumophila after working close to an uncovered decanter used for sludge thickening within the wwtp the concentration of l pneumophila in the sludge was 1 5 106 cfu gw to avoid aerosols propagation the decanters were covered and the use of respiratory protective masks within the wwtp was required gregersen et al 1999 in summer 2017 the institute for sanitary engineering and waste management from leibniz university hannover monitored legionella within a wwtp receiving anaerobically treated effluents from a food industry in belgium for confidential reasons the type of industry will not be mentioned l pneumophila was detected by the qpcr method in a total of 26 samples and the highest concentration was measured in samples from the activated sludge tanks 4 8 106 gu l operated at a temperature ranging between 32 and 35 c and a sludge age of 10 days interestingly the concentration of legionella spp was considerably higher approximately 2 log units higher than the concentration of l pneumophila suggesting that a large community of non l pneumophila species could grow at previously mentioned operating conditions miscellaneous the survey from lund et al 2014 also found l pneumophila in four additional industries chemicals production for wood processing oil industry wafers and potato chips production all wwtps were based on the activated sludge process with a temperature range 20 35 c however it is not possible to infer from this study the concentrations of legionella in the different wwtps and the environmental factors that could have influenced its growth in 2016 2017 two ld outbreaks were reported in boxtel the netherlands related to an industrial wwtp industrial activity not specified which discharged effluents into a municipal wwtp loenenbach et al 2018 during 2016 six ld cases were reported and in 2017 eight more ld cases were confirmed with all events related to biological treatment facilities the three industrial ponds operated at a temperature of 35 c showed l pneumophila concentrations ranging between 2 106 to 23 108 cfu l industrial effluents were directed to a municipal wwtp where l pneumophila was also detected at concentrations of 1 105 cfu l in the influent samples and 2 103 cfu l in the aeration pond in order to prevent contaminated aerosols transmission temporary tents were erected and a permanent cover was studied as a long term solution interestingly in this study the authors determined that contaminated aerosols transmission directly from the aerated ponds reached distances over 1 6 km away from the source this review clearly shows that wwtps with aeration basins and temperatures between 20 and 35 c may be sources of legionella however l pneumophila does not occur in every wwtps operating with ideal conditions for its growth a better understanding of the events that support l pneumophila proliferation to critical threshold levels in complex matrices found in wwtps is extremely challenging the physicochemical parameters as well as operational conditions such as wastewater composition temperature sludge age and biocenosis under which l pneumophila proliferates in wwtps have not been determined such information is indispensable to develop control measures to prevent or eliminate the colonization of l pneumophila in wwtp industrial and mixed wwtps should be constantly monitored and legionella risk assessments should be carried out to identify the facilities with higher risk and to plan new control strategies accordingly 4 reclaimed wastewater reuse reclaimed wastewater is an increasingly important alternative water source in industrialized as well as in developing countries it typically contains higher concentrations of organic carbon nitrogen and phosphorous in comparison to potable water which increases the risk of proliferation of pathogenic microorganisms garner et al 2016 in fact the study of garner et al 2018 investigated the occurrence of legionella in five reclaimed water systems applied for irrigation purposes legionella were positively correlated with phosphorus and ammonia contents suggesting that nutrients play an important role on the incidence of legionella in reclaimed wastewater systems guidelines for the safe use of reclaimed wastewater have been published by the european environment agency eea 2016 the united states environmental protection agency epa 2012 and the world health organization who 2016 however the existing regulations or guidelines regarding pathogenic bacteria in wastewater and reclaimed water are based on fecal indicator microorganisms e g e coli and the presence of opportunistic waterborne pathogens like legionella is not yet included epa 2012 depending on the purpose of use reclaimed wastewater can be transported through distribution systems and kept in storage tanks where its quality decreases compared to that at the point of discharge at the wwtp also designed as point of compliance poc due to several factors namely residence time nutrient concentrations loss of disinfectant residuals warmer temperatures and contact with biofilms johnson et al 2018 regulations and guidelines for reclaimed water systems should consider three key elements for public health concerns i evaluation of the health impact associated with levels of exposure ii assessment of all exposure pathways to chemical and microbial contaminants present in reclaimed water and iii verification of water quality at the final point of use garner et al 2016 the main uses of reclaimed wastewater are cooling purposes agricultural and landscape irrigation and toilet flushing hamilton et al 2018 all uses are associated with aerosol generation which highlights the importance of controlling legionella in treated wastewater legionella have been detected in reclaimed wastewater systems at concentrations ranging from 103 to 105 cfu l in usa ajibode et al 2013 jjemba et al 2010 johnson et al 2018 and 106 107 gu l in france and australia respectively brissaud et al 2008 whiley et al 2015 ajibode et al 2013 and johnson et al 2018 reported the highest concentrations of legionella in reclaimed wastewater during summer months which might indicate a growth seasonal trend of legionella in reclaimed wastewater systems johnson et al 2018 investigated six reclaimed wastewater systems using chlorine disinfection with different lengths of distribution pipes and residence times the highest concentrations of legionella and amoebae were measured at the end of the distribution systems inside the storage tanks legionella spp and total amoeba geometric means 7300 cfu l and 50 mpn l respectively where chlorine was non detectable or below 0 2 mg l l pneumophila was found in all six reclaimed wastewater systems and amounted to 96 and 52 of the legionella spp concentrations determined by the culture and qpcr methods respectively interestingly other pathogenic legionella species co occurred with l pneumophila namely l oakridgensis l moravica l longbeachae and l hackeliae jjemba et al 2010 also reported a rapid decrease in chlorine in reclaimed wastewater distribution systems due to its reaction with organic matter after disinfection they observed a re population of the water distribution systems by legionella spp and mycobacterium spp both genera known to multiply inside amoebae and ciliates suggesting that the interaction with protozoa might increase the resistance against chlorine ajibode et al 2013 compared two reclaimed wastewater systems a and b using different disinfection treatments in system a chlorine was dosed 3 9 mg l at the poc while in system b wastewater was irradiated with ultraviolet light 100 000 μw s cm2 for both systems the concentration of legionella including l pneumophila sg1 was almost 2 log units higher at a distance of 12 km from the poc at this distance the residual chlorine concentration drops to 0 1 mg l in system a which is not sufficient to prevent the re growth of legionella in system b uv treatment does not prevent recolonization of the system by legionella mainly because it is applied at the poc and not close to the point of use as described by liu et al 1995 for a water distribution system kulkarni et al 2018 reported the occurrence of l pneumophila and l feeleii in uv treated wastewater used for spray irrigation from these studies it can be deduced that human health risks from exposure to reclaimed wastewater contaminated with pathogenic legionella species are to be expected quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra is a useful tool to estimate the likelihood of illness due to exposure to a certain pathogen present in a water system us epa 2012 using this tool hamilton et al 2018 evaluated the legionella health risk in reclaimed wastewater for three re use scenarios cooling towers spray irrigation and toilet flushing the risks were calculated with a geometric mean of legionella concentration in reclaimed wastewater in the range of 1000 10 000 cfu l and compared with the usepa annual infection risk of 10 4 infections per person per year ippy for drinking water benchmark the annual infection risk associated to toilet flushing 3 8ˑ10 4 ippy with american model toilets surpassed the benchmark for spray irrigation and cooling towers the annual infection risk was determined by meteorological and operational conditions the authors estimated an annual infection risk exceeding the benchmark for contaminated aerosols at a distance of 1 km and 10 km from the source hamilton et al 2018 depending on the analytical method applied to quantify legionella concentrations culture and qpcr respectively certainly aerosols contaminated with legionella present a higher occupational health risk to the workers within the reclaimed wastewater systems rather than to those in the vicinity areas the study of hamilton et al 2018 highlights the need for further investigations to determine the legionella risks associated to reclaimed wastewater re use and the importance of regular monitoring and mitigation measures such as closing toilet lids using drift eliminators and windbreaks among others best managing practices and adequate planning of reclaimed water systems should focus on maintaining the treated water quality until the final point of use garner et al 2016 in addition as mentioned by jjemba et al 2015 although no legionella s outbreaks have been reported in association with reclaimed water systems municipal and industrial treatment systems should act proactively to establish effective measures to control legionella and protozoa in order to prevent future events in summary this literature review shows that wwtps provide optimal conditions for the growth of legionella with aerated tanks being the principle reservoir of the pathogen this fact is in particular a growing concern not only for the workers within the treatment facility but also for vicinity areas and reclaimed wastewater users the studies that investigated the legionella outbreaks associated with wwtps have shown that contaminated aerosols can be transported over a distance up to 6 10 km blatny et al 2008 nguyen et al 2006 olsen et al 2010 representing a potential public health risk moreover reclaimed wastewater for agricultural and industrial purposes where aerosols are produced is widely applied yet fundamental knowledge regarding the associated legionella risk is still limited for a better public health management it is crucial to control the growth of legionella in wwtps as well as outlining limits for legionella in wastewater discharged indirectly to municipal wwtps and directly into natural water systems 5 legionella regulations in wastewater treatment facilities monitoring the occurrence of legionella in wwtp is crucial from a public health perspective however to our knowledge until now there is only one ordinance for legionella self monitoring in wwtps this ordinance issued in 2016 by the ministry for climate protection environment agriculture nature and consumer protection of the state of north rhine westphalia was based on the report of an expert commission constituted after the largest legionella outbreak in germany warstein 2013 the self monitoring program is addressed to wwtps with biological treatment receiving wastewater with a temperature of 23 c from the following industries milk sugar and meat production breweries and pulp and paper municipal wwtps receiving effluents from these industries are also included in the ordinance the legionella self monitoring program must be done quarterly during the first year in case the results are considered not abnormal the ordinance does not define concentration limits for legionella the monitoring should be continued in the next years at least once a year during the summer months the quantification of legionella spp should be done by the culture method according to iso 11 731 the latest version in case the concentration of legionella spp is 10 000 cfu l l pneumophila concentration and the respective serogroups should also be determined mkulvn 2016 the expert commission recommends in its report the following preventive and control measures that should be taken if certain legionella concentrations are exceeded i when the legionella concentration is 10 000 cfu l no preventive measures are necessary ii for concentrations between 10 000 and 100 000 cfu l the workers and reclaimed wastewater users should be informed about the measured concentrations and potential public health risks legionella species and subgroups should be determined and further monitoring should be done in all treatment steps of the facility iii when the concentration is 100 000 cfu l control measures to reduce legionella must be taken further monitoring should be carried out in water systems receiving the treated wastewater in air samples taken above the aerated tanks and within the influents of the wwtp to determine the source of legionella exner et al 2015 the main reasons for the regulation to focus on treated effluents are the following i by monitoring and controlling legionella in treated wastewater discharged in surface waters or directly re used in reclaimed systems the contamination of other facilities which at the same time are massive aerosol generators e g irrigation systems or cooling towers can be prevented ii the regulation adopted the culture method following the norm iso 11 731 for the quantification of legionella spp in treated wastewater this method is relatively inexpensive and is implemented in many certified laboratories for water and wastewater analytics however the results obtained with the cultivation method in activated sludge samples are not satisfactory due to the additional growth of other bacteria in the plates in addition to treated wastewater we suggest that aerosols in wastewater treatment plants generated in aeration tanks should be monitored for legionella s concentration because they are the direct source of exposure to this bacterium the report of the expert group also includes the uv 254 nm treatment and microfiltration of secondary treated wastewater as control strategies to reduce legionella s concentration alternatively they suggest to decrease the wastewater temperature to 20 c when feasible and to reduce the protein concentration through an anaerobic pre treatment as it was implemented in the wwtp in warstein after the ld outbreak finally the recommendations to reduce aerosol generation include covering open channels transporting legionella contaminated wastewater as well as activated sludge tanks pure oxygen or fine bubble aerations and air filtration the use of respiratory protection during cleaning and maintenance activities sludge treatment and biofilm removal is also recommended exner et al 2015 the european agency for safety and health at work recognizes wwtps with activated sludge basins as possible sources of community acquired legionella infections to prevent exposure of the wwtp operators to the pathogen the use of respiratory protective equipment is recommended in addition cooling towers used to reduce the wastewater temperature should be cleaned and maintained in accordance to the european centre for disease prevention and control and the world health organization legionella guidelines bartram et al 2007 ecdc 2017 eu osha 2011 6 conclusions and remarks this literature review demonstrates that industrial and municipal wwtps are sources of legionella although optimum growth conditions prevail in many wwtps l pneumophila has been reported in few indicating that the specific environmental factors that trigger the growth and persistence of this pathogen are still unknown extensive research done in wwtps from the paper mill industry in the scandinavian countries showed a clear link between temperature and the occurrence of l pneumophila for a temperature equal to or higher than 30 c in the aerobic biological treatment systems l pneumophila was present otherwise it could not be detected such a clear association between occurrence of legionella and environmental parameters could not be obtained for other industrial and municipal wastewaters the following paragraphs present the research gaps identified in the literature which should be addressed so that adequate treatments can be implemented in wwtps and reclaimed water facilities for air wastewater and sludge contaminated with legionella to minimize the growth of legionella in these depuration systems the treatment process itself or the operation conditions should be modified to achieve this goal research must be done under the prevailing operational and environmental conditions characteristic of these systems the diversity of protozoan hosts for legionella growth in activated sludge at different temperatures should be further investigated there is also a lack of information about the dynamics of protozoa and legionella in activated sludge systems the role of protozoa in the growth and persistence of legionella in activated sludge might be the key point in the development of effective elimination or control measures in wwtps the methods to control legionella in biological treatment systems present some limitations that should be further investigated for example uv disinfection was reported to be an effective method to control legionella in treated wastewater nevertheless uv irradiation leaves no residual disinfection and legionella are capable to recolonize reclaimed water systems also legionella are able to repair the dna damaged caused by the uv light which means that legionella are not detectable immediately after the uv treatment but it appears after a period of time or some kilometres downstream from the discharge point ozonation has also been reported as an effective disinfection method for l pneumophila in municipal wastewater dong et al 2018 however ozone does not form a residual concentration in water thus it cannot prevent legionella s regrowth in reclaimed water systems research need exists regarding the evaluation of the most effective disinfectant agents that minimize legionella s regrowth in reclaimed water systems as for example in irrigation systems toilet flushing or cooling purposes among others the development of new and innovative wastewater treatment technologies as well as the use of specific inhibitors could represent feasible solutions to prevent the growth of legionella in wwtps to minimize the emission of contaminated aerosols from industrial and municipal wwtps especially the ones with higher risk of legionella colonization different alternatives like roofing or air filtration should be evaluated to prevent future ld cases within the treatment facility or in the vicinity areas correlations between the occurrence of legionella and wastewater characteristics treatment type operational parameters and microbial communities are necessary not only to evaluate the conditions under which the pathogen grows but also to implement better management practices with focus on wwtps that present higher risks of legionella contamination monitoring approaches of legionella in wastewater face discrepancies between culture and molecular methods it is important to develop new guidelines and policies that define which methods are more appropriate to determine environmental legionella concentrations and the corresponding mitigation and control measurements declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper the authors declare the following financial interests personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests acknowledgments this work was

19125,wastewater treatment plants wwtps have been identified as confirmed but until today underestimated sources of legionella playing an important role in local and community cases and outbreaks of legionnaires disease in general aerobic biological systems provide an optimum environment for the growth of legionella due to high organic nitrogen and oxygen concentrations ideal temperatures and the presence of protozoa however few studies have investigated the occurrence of legionella in wwtps and many questions in regards to the interacting factors that promote the proliferation and persistence of legionella in these treatment systems are still unanswered this critical review summarizes the current knowledge about legionella in municipal and industrial wwtps the conditions that might support their growth as well as control strategies that have been applied furthermore an overview of current quantification methods guidelines and health risks associated with legionella in reclaimed wastewater is also discussed in depth a better understanding of the conditions promoting the occurrence of legionella in wwtps will contribute to the development of improved wastewater treatment technologies and or innovative mitigation approaches to minimize future legionella outbreaks graphical abstract image 1 keywords legionella wastewater treatment plants activated sludge industrial wastewater reclaimed wastewater 1 introduction legionella are gram negative facultative intracellular bacteria found in the natural environment as well as in man made water systems percival et al 2014 the genus legionella includes more than 50 species lesnik et al 2016 from which around 20 species have been confirmed to be pathogens to humans lück 2009 infection occurs exclusively by the inhalation of aerosols contaminated with legionella which can cause a flu like illness called pontiac fever or a severe clinical pneumonia known as legionnaire s disease ld sharaby et al 2017 legionella pneumophila is divided into 15 serogroups among which l pneumophila sg1 is responsible for more than 90 of confirmed ld outbreaks and sporadic cases with 10 15 mortality rate making it the most relevant and studied species within the genus legionella ecdc 2015 fields et al 2002 evidence of other serogroups is rare with l pneumophila sg6 being the second most common serogroup isolated from clinical samples in the united states and europe us epa 2016 l pneumophila is included within the drinking water contaminant candidate list and regulatory determination 4 ccl4 from the united states environmental protection agency us epa us epa 2016 other pathogenic species associated with clinical cases are legionella micdadei legionella longbeachae legionella dumoffii and legionella bozemanii bartram et al 2007 lau and ashbolt 2009 among the documented non l pneumophila infections l micdadei represents the second most common cause of ld in united states and europe us epa 2016 while in australia and new zeeland l longbeachae is the causative agent of approximately 30 of community acquired ld yu et al 2002 it has been reported that ld follows a seasonal trend showing a higher incidence in summer months in comparison to other types of community acquired pneumonia prussin et al 2017 it is plausible that climate change might affect the transmission pathways of legionella increasing the incidence of ld cases the study of brandse et al 2014 showed that warm and wet weather conditions followed by heavy rainfall were the factors associated with the increased cases of community acquired ld in the netherlands contrary in other regions were climate change has caused droughts or longer and extreme summer seasons storing rain water for long periods and the increased use of irrigation systems may lead to a potential rise in the number of people exposed to legionella ahmed et al 2014 in addition with warmer and longer summers water temperature will increase 25 c in different water systems such as cold water supplies within buildings fountains or municipal wwtps increasing the risk of growth and exposure to legionella legionella are considered a nutritionally fastidious bacteria in axenic laboratory growth cultures because of its incapability to metabolize carbohydrates and its strict requirement of amino acids as a source of carbon and energy george et al 1980 percival et al 2014 wieland et al 2005 however legionella are usually detected in poor nutrient environments like engineered water systems where they have developed mechanisms to obtain amino acids by parasitizing and multiplying within protozoa steinert et al 2002 in drinking water systems for instance protozoa and biofilms along the pipe walls are considered the main reservoirs of legionella lau and ashbolt 2009 in complex matrices like biofilms protozoa represent a key factor on the survival of legionella not only by providing amino acids for intracellular growth but also by acting as shelter against hostile environmental conditions and disinfection agents abu kwaik et al 1998 scheikl et al 2014 although intracellular replication within protozoa plays an important role on the growth and survival of l pneumophila studies have shown that environmental l pneumophila is able to grow independently from protozoa by interacting with other water microorganisms and or by obtaining essential nutrients from other sources like decaying organic matter and dead cells devos et al 2005 stout et al 1985 temmerman et al 2006 until now studies have demonstrated that three groups of microorganisms favour the growth of l pneumophila protozoa price et al 2014 rowbotham 1980 cyanobacteria tison et al 1980 and other bacteria states et al 1987 wadowsky and yee 1985 these studies support the idea that despite the strict nutritional conditions shown in pure cultures environmental legionella are able to benefit from associated microorganisms as suppliers of nutrients due to the extensive research that has been done concerning the occurrence of legionella in drinking water systems plenty of preventive and control guidelines have been already established and are in use to decrease the risk of ld outbreaks in these systems cdc 2017 hartemann and hautemaniere 2011 nevertheless there have been only few studies focused on non potable water systems that represent an important source of legionella such a wastewater treatment systems wwtps have been identified as confirmed sources of legionella caicedo et al 2016 nogueira et al 2016 van heijnsbergen et al 2015 wwtps are constructed to treat municipal and industrial effluents that are discharged into natural water bodies or reused for agricultural or industrial purposes briefly conventional wwtps include a primary treatment where sedimentation and skimming processes are used to remove organic and inorganic solids as well as floating material like oil and grease effluents from primary treatment are then directed into a secondary biological treatment generally based on the activated sludge process used to remove dissolved and colloidal compounds from wastewater the aeration of primary treated wastewater in the activated sludge tank promotes the growth of microorganisms in flocs known as activated sludge that are subsequently separated from the treated wastewater by sedimentation within the microorganisms present in activated sludge protozoa are considered as important predators controlling bacterial communities and consuming colloidal particles metcalf and eddy 2003 a tertiary treatment is usually used to remove residual solids nitrogen phosphorus and finally disinfection processes take place by applying chlorine ozone or uv irradiation before treated wastewater is discharged into natural water systems or further re used in aerobic biological treatment systems the combination of ideal temperature in combined systems receiving industrial effluents 30 c lapara and alleman 1999 availability of oxygen and organic nitrogen and the presence of protozoa provide an ideal environment for the proliferation of legionella therefore these facilities may play an important role in local or community transmission of legionella according to the centers for disease control and prevention cdc ld cases are considered as outbreaks when two or more people exposed to legionella are sick at the same time and at the same place cdc 2018 considering this definition and the documented ld cases linked to wwtps blatny et al 2011 loenenbach et al 2018 maisa et al 2015 nguyen et al 2006 nygard et al 2008 it can be assumed that these biological treatment facilities are more likely to be associated with legionella outbreaks rather than sporadic cases direct aerosol dispersion from biological aerated tanks has been reported in ld outbreaks to reach distances of 300 m olsen et al 2010 and 1 6 km loenenbach et al 2018 in two other ld outbreaks associated with wwtps an additional aerosol disseminator was involved e g cooling towers or air scrubbers generating and transmitting aerosols containing legionella to distances up to 6 10 km nguyen et al 2006 olsen et al 2010 it is essential to understand how legionella proliferate and persist in wwtps in order to develop effective preventive and control strategies in this work an extensive literature review was conducted on the methods routinely used for the detection and quantification of legionella in environmental samples on the occurrence of legionella in domestic and industrial wwtp in association to wastewater composition and operational parameters on the elimination measures that have been implemented as well as on the health risks associated with reclaimed wastewater reuse 2 methods for the detection and quantification of legionella in wastewater the detection and quantification of legionella in wastewater is challenging because of the complex chemical and biological composition of the wastewater matrix in comparison to drinking water currently there are several methods for legionella quantification but most of the studies that investigated the occurrence of legionella in wwtps as shown in tables 1 and 2 used the culture method and the real time polymerase chain reaction qpcr method therefore this literature review focuses on the advantages and disadvantages of these two methods as follows culture method the culture method used to quantify legionella in water samples is described in the international standard iso 11 731 2017 water quality and enumeration of legionella this method is considered as the gold standard because it quantifies viable and culturable legionella reischl et al 2002 the results are expressed in colony forming units the cultivation of legionella has been improved through the use of specific agar formulations and sample pre treatments to promote the growth of these bacteria and to suppress the growth of unwanted microorganisms the most widely used solid medium to cultivate legionella is the buffered charcoal yeast extract agar bcye supplemented with cysteine iron salts and α ketoglutarate cdc 2005 to suppress the growth of background flora present in water samples the agar is supplemented with the antibiotics glycine vancomycin polymyxin b and cycloheximide gvpc wadowsky and yee 1981 heat and or acid pre treatments of water samples are usually performed depending on the origin and level of contamination the samples can be heated up to 50 c for 30 min or 60 c for 1 3 min and or treated with hcl ph 2 2 for 5 20 min percival et al 2014 it has been reported in the literature that the culture method underestimates legionella s concentration in wastewater samples caicedo et al 2016 lund et al 2014 medema et al 2004 the main acknowledged disadvantages of this method are i the harsh sample pre treatment conditions that can affect legionella s cultivability whiley and taylor 2016 ii the method is optimized for the detection of l pneumophila sg1 and does not detect all legionella spp lee et al 1993 iii the difficulty in obtaining reproducible and consistent results iv the presence of inhibitors in the samples and or overgrowth of legionella by background flora and v the failure to detect viable but non culturable vbnc legionella delgado viscogliosi et al 2009 pascual et al 2001 in addition mccoy et al 2012 reported that the sampling holding time significantly affects legionella counts the authors showed that in 52 of the samples the concentrations of legionella varied c a 1 log unit within 6 h and up to 2 log units within 24 h despite the above mentioned disadvantages the culture method continues to be widely used due to the lack of alternative methods which quantify viable and culturable legionella and because the majority of the guidelines for drinking water systems and cooling towers use the culture method as the reference standard blanky et al 2015 and rodríguez martínez et al 2015 modified the iso standard 11 731 1998 to quantify legionella in greywater the concentration of microorganisms in greywater is much lower than in wastewater because greywater has not come into contact with human solid waste briefly the modified method includes an additional pre filtration step to remove particles exceeding 100 μm pore size subsequently the sample is filtered again through a 0 2 μm cellulose nitrate filter to concentrate the microorganisms on the surface of the filter the filter is suspended in a buffer and vortexed for 10 min the obtained solution is then centrifuged and the supernatant is replaced with acid buffer after the acid treatment the sample is vortexed and immediately heated for 30 min at 50 c finally for the quantification treated samples are plated on gvpc selective media the maximal recovery rate of this method estimated by using sterile potable water with a known concentration of legionella was only 6 blanky et al 2015 the low recovery rate of this protocol might be related to the highly aggressive acid thermal treatment of the greywater samples with the purpose to suppress growth of background flora it is well documented in the literature that legionella can resist stressful conditions entering into a viable but non culturable vbnc state mansi et al 2014 exposure to high temperatures 50 c and to acid buffer might be seen as stressors for legionella in the vbnc state legionella are not detected by the cultivation method which might explain the low recovery rates described in both studies another limitation of the modified cultivation method proposed by blanky et al 2015 and rodríguez martínez et al 2015 is the underestimation of the concentration of legionella in greywater because the pre filtration step to remove coarse matter also excludes legionella adsorbed to embedded in the solids from the samples to be analysed this protocol can be considered as a method to isolate legionella from complex matrices like greywater or wastewater but the quantification should be further improved to counteract the limitations mentioned before qpcr method this molecular method has been used extensively for the quantification of legionella in wastewater samples the method and quality control procedures for the detection and quantification of legionella by the qpcr are described in the international standard iso ts 12 869 2012 water quality detection and quantification of legionella spp and or legionella pneumophila by concentration and genic amplification by quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr the principle of the method relies on the amplification and quantification of a target dna sequence and the results are expressed in copy numbers or genomic units to detect legionella spp in clinical and environmental samples genus specific primers have been developed to target the 16s rrna jarraud et al 2013 wellinghausen et al 2001 the 5s rrna hayden et al 2001 and the 23s5s genes herpers et al 2003 kao et al 2014 for the detection of l pneumophila primers targeting the macrophage infectivity potentiator gene mip have been used behets et al 2007 jarraud et al 2013 kao et al 2014 wullings et al 2011 yáñez et al 2005 however as described by stølhaug and bergh 2006 other pathogenic non l pneumophila species have been also detected with high accuracy by targeting the mip gene the advantages of the qpcr method are high sensitivity and shorter time required for analysis results can be obtained within hours in comparison to the culture method mansi et al 2014 however it has two main limitations the qpcr reaction can be inhibited by substances present in the sample and it does not differentiate between living injured and dead bacteria which can result in an overestimation of health risks of ld the presence of qpcr inhibitors in environmental samples has been reported in the literature brooks et al 2004 sidstedt et al 2015 they can be divided into amplification inhibitors which are the ones acting directly on the dna polymerase by modifying the buffer composition or binding nucleic acids and detection inhibitors which interfere with the fluorescence signal from dyes or probes sidstedt et al 2015 the inhibitors that are expected to be present in wastewater samples include bile salts polysaccharides urea lipids proteins metal ions e g iron and aluminum humic substances and phytic acids chaturvedi et al 2008 radström et al 2004 rock et al 2010 shieh et al 1995 sidstedt et al 2015 during the last few years several strategies and commercial qpcr kits have been developed for the removal of pcr inhibitors in specific matrices in wastewater inhibitors can readily be detected by applying appropriate internal controls and pcr inhibition can be addressed using different approaches such as additional extraction steps e g heat treatment before the pcr dilution of the sample extraction with solvents ultrafiltration with positively charged membranes addition of unique buffer formulations to separate pcr inhibitors from dna and cleaning steps to obtain pure and intact dna chaturvedi et al 2008 schrader et al 2012 attempts have been also made to improve the qpcr method to differentiate between living and dead legionella several studies demonstrated that it is possible to amplify only living cells by pre treating the samples with the nucleic acid dyes ethidium monoazide ema and propium monoazide pma before dna extraction the ema and pma enter damaged cells membranes and react with dna to restrict its amplification and therefore its quantification bonetta et al 2017 reyneke et al 2017 although viable qpcr could be considered as a promising method for the quantification of legionella in environmental samples it needs to be optimized to overcome reported problems like ema entering undamaged cells insufficient concentrations of ema or pma to block dna amplification from dead cells and the presence of extracellular substances that influence the binding between ema and dna from dead cells fittipaldi et al 2012 whiley and taylor 2016 control assays to assess the effectiveness of the viability dyes ema and pma are done by comparing qpcr threshold cycle values ct for cells treated and non treated with the molecular dyes both viability dyes have been reported to reduce the qpcr signal when they enter living cells resulting in an increase of the ct ema is more likely to enter intact cell membranes hence causing a greater qpcr signal reduction in comparison to pma seinige et al 2014 these control assays are usually done with pure cultures and the increase in the ct values can also indicate either the presence of membrane compromised cells or the presence of dead cells fittipaldi et al 2012 moreover the membrane permeability can vary according to cell growth phase in the study of gedalanga and olson 2009 ema treatment showed to have a lower influence on e coli viable cells during the exponential phase of growth compared to the effect observed at the lag and stationary phases of growth the authors attributed this result to the cellular membrane properties which changes through the different growth phases another disadvantage of the qpcr method is the limited number of specific primer pairs that can be analysed in a qpcr run even using multiplex qpcr this means that by choosing the primer pairs a pre selection of the legionella species to be detected is done an alternative molecular method applied for the detection of legionella in wastewater is high throughput pyrosequencing which generates large amounts of sequence reads in a single run through a massive sequencing by synthesis approach in the study of ma et al 2015 the 454 high throughput pyrosequencing method was reported to be an efficient tool for the characterization of the most dominant potential pathogens in activated sludge and treated wastewater including legionella pathogenic species l parisiensis l longbeachae l bozemanii l pneumophila l micdadei despite the limitations that qpcr presents this molecular technique is considered a rapid versatile and highly specific option for the detection and or quantification of pathogenic bacteria including l pneumophila in environmental samples to minimize ld risks in outbreak situations it is of the utmost importance to improve the response time to take control measures for that collins et al 2015 recommended the use of the qpcr method for legionella quantification and the culture method only in qpcr positive samples to obtain isolates for epidemiological studies an international trial to quantify legionella in artificial water systems by the culture and qpcr methods was done with the purpose to develop an algorithm for the interpretation of qpcr results in routine monitoring or outbreak investigations lee et al 2011 for routine monitoring in cooling towers and non healthcare water systems the authors suggest that for l pneumophila concentrations under 5 103 gu l alert level no actions are required while for higher concentrations samples should be additionally analysed by the culture method and disinfection and control actions are recommended for health care facilities and outbreak investigations the authors suggest a higher qpcr alert level of 4 103 gu l for l pneumophila and 104 gu l for legionella spp for samples above the alert level the legionella quantification should be repeated in parallel by both methods to obtain information about viability and present strains if the results from the culture method or both are positive the actions recommended within the corresponding regulation drinking water systems or cooling towers for monitoring by culture should be applied in case of positive qpcr but negative culture results further investigations are recommended to determine the origin of the legionella signal within the system until now molecular methods are still not considered for the quantification of legionella in standards guidelines and regulations issued for the prevention and control of legionella in potable water systems brooks et al 2004 morio et al 2008 the previously mentioned study could be considered as a step forward to the development of an algorithm for the interpretation of culture and qpcr results in wastewater monitoring a consensus between molecular and culturable methods is necessary to facilitate the decision making process on public health measures and for the establishing of threshold values in activated sludge tanks and discharge limits for legionella in wastewater 3 occurrence of legionella in wwtps wwtps that include aerobic biological treatment processes are systems which provide conditions that promote the proliferation of legionella wastewater typically contains sufficient organic matter nitrogen and phosphorus to support microbial growth organic nitrogen mainly in the forms of protein and urea accounts for at least 30 of the total nitrogen in the wastewater westgate and park 2010 in a study investigating the spatial distribution of protozoa and legionella in activated sludge using fluorescence in situ hybridization fish caicedo et al 2018 reported the occurrence of legionella mainly as clusters dispersed in the activated sludge matrix and only a few protozoa were found infected with legionella these results suggest that legionella might be able to use the organic nitrogen in the wastewater as a source of amino acids however further studies are necessary to validate this hypothesis in complex biocenoses such as biofilms and activated sludge several microorganisms can play a key role in the growth of legionella in biofilms protozoa have been identified as the main environmental reservoir and vehicle for legionella transmission lau and ashbolt 2009 steinert et al 2002 protozoan hosts for legionella growth have been identified by co culturing laboratory techniques or by co isolation from environmental samples in vitro co cultures studies have shown that acanthamoeba spp hartmannella spp naegleria spp echinamoeba exundans tetramitus jugosus dictyostelium discoideum balamuthia mandrillaris and tetrahymena spp can serve as hosts for l pneumophila valster et al 2010 several co isolation studies described the presence of the aforementioned protozoa in environmental water systems with acanthamoeba hartmannella naegleria and vahlkampfia being the most commonly detected genera in several water sources boamah et al 2017 interestingly these genera have also been found in activated sludge systems garcía et al 2011 magnet et al 2013 ramirez et al 2014 1993 the operating conditions in wwtps also represent an advantage for the proliferation of legionella dissolved oxygen concentrations in activated sludge tanks are maintained in a range of 0 5 2 0 mg l to promote the growth of key aerobic microorganisms involved in the removal of carbon and nitrogen the oxygen requirements for the growth of legionella species including l pneumophila reported in literature are in the range of 0 3 2 2 mg l mauchline et al 1992 wadowsky et al 1985 meaning that the dissolved oxygen concentration in the activated sludge tanks is ideal for the growth of legionella the temperature at which wwtps are operated is generally not controlled and can be influenced by many factors such as location weather conditions and type of wastewater in general growth of microorganisms for wastewater treatment occurs in the range of 8 30 c nevertheless in combined systems where municipal and industrial wastewaters are treated together the operating temperature can be 30 c lapara and alleman 1999 the growth of legionella species including l pneumophila has been reported at temperatures ranging from 25 to 42 c with an optimum growth at 35 c falkinham et al 2015 meaning that aerated systems provide ideal conditions for legionella in hot summer periods the temperatures in industrial systems can rise and remain at levels up to 40 c causing temporary die off in the mixed microbial populations present in the activated sludge under these specific events a faster growth of legionella can be hypothesized based on the following reasons i a temperature of 40 c is in the range for optimal growth of legionella as mentioned before legionella compared to other bacteria also resist higher temperatures up to 63 c typical for warm water distribution systems fliermans 1996 wadowsky et al 1985 b l pneumophila can grow on dead biomass reported in the literature as necrotrophic growth temmerman et al 2006 a sudden increase in the wastewater temperature causes die off of the unacclimated biomass that might support necrotrophic growth of legionella this form of growth does not require a microbial host the occurrence of legionella has been reported in municipal as well as in industrial wwtps two main differences between municipal and industrial wastewater are the temperature and the organic nutrient concentrations which are in general higher in industrial wastewaters the treatment of industrial wastewater often combines an anaerobic reactor followed by an aerobic process for a better insight into the conditions associated to the occurrence of legionella in wwtps municipal and industrial plants will be addressed separately 3 1 occurrence of legionella in municipal wwtps municipal wastewater is a mixture of domestic water coming from residential and commercial facilities industrial effluents and run off rain water the occurrence of legionella has been reported in several municipal wwtps based on the activated sludge process in germany caicedo et al 2016 france brissaud et al 2008 netherlands schalk et al 2012 norway lund et al 2014 spain catalan et al 1997 usa kulkarni et al 2018 palmer et al 1993 roll and fujioka 1995 and china cai and zhang 2013 huang et al 2009 these studies reported the presence of legionella at different treatment steps table 1 indicating that this genus is able to grow and survive within wwtps roll and fujioka 1995 and palmer et al 1993 reported legionella spp concentrations 106 cells l and l pneumophila concentrations 106 cells l in all stages of wastewater treatment starting from the settling basins up to and including chlorinated effluents palmer et al 1993 stated that the concentration of legionella spp did not differ significantly throughout the wwtp medema et al 2004 reported legionella spp concentrations of 108 gu l in raw wastewater while brissaud et al 2008 reported legionella spp concentrations between 106 107 gu l in treated wastewater in the study of kulkarni et al 2018 conducted in three wwtps using different biological processes activated sludge sequencing batch reactor and secondary aeration tank the abundance of legionella spp was higher in treated wastewater in comparison to raw wastewater in fact the pathogenic species l pneumophila l feeleii and l tusconensis were not detected in raw wastewater but in activated sludge secondary clarifier and effluent samples after tertiary treatment the survival of legionella within the different steps of the wwtp is presumably due to intracellular growth within protozoa or through growth within the biofilm along the pipes which allow the bacteria to overcome adverse environmental conditions among the reviewed literature only two studies tried to correlate the occurrence of legionella with operational parameters of the municipal wwtp on the one hand caicedo et al 2016 reported legionella spp concentrations between 103 108 gu l in activated sludge tanks from three wwtp and positive correlations between legionella spp concentrations and particulate chemical oxygen demand kjeldahl nitrogen and protein concentrations in wastewater on the other hand the survey done by huang et al 2009 reported that the occurrence of legionella in 10 out of 17 wwtps in taiwan did not correlate with the operational conditions in this study legionella were detected in 75 of the samples with a temperature range between 15 and 20 c in comparison to only 56 of legionella positive samples with a higher temperature range 25 30 c the authors also reported that the detection of legionella does not differ significantly among samples with different ph electrical conductivity turbidity dissolved oxygen concentrations or presence of heterotrophic bacteria even though it is well known that temperature plays an important role in the multiplication of l pneumophila limited information exits about the exact temperature range that promotes the growth of the pathogen in municipal wwtps only few studies reported the wastewater temperature in positive samples for l pneumophila maisa et al 2015 and nogueira et al 2016 reported the occurrence of l pneumophila sg 1 with a concentration 5 107 cfu l in a municipal plant receiving industrial effluents at a temperature between 30 and 35 c lund et al 2014 detected l pneumophila in a concentration range between 103 106 gu l at least once in seven of eight municipal wwtps with a lower wastewater temperature range 7 c 15 c on the other hand brissaud et al 2008 reported the occurrence of l pneumophila at relatively low concentrations detectable but non quantifiable in treated wastewater of a municipal plant receiving mainly domestic effluents with a temperature between 20 c and 30 c these results support the hypothesis that temperature is probably not the only factor responsible for the occurrence of l pneumophila in municipal wwtps and further investigations are needed to define the conditions that favour its growth the occurrence of other pathogenic and non pathogenic legionella species in domestic wwtp has also been reported in the literature huang et al 2009 and schalk et al 2012 found the pathogenic species l anisa and l sainthelensi and the non pathogenic species l lytica and l fallonii in samples taken from the influent of the wwtps as well as samples from aeration ponds bio aerosols generated during wastewater treatment have also been investigated for the presence of legionella roll and fujioka 1995 detected legionella spp in air samples collected above aeration basins 109 cells m3 and mirzaee et al 2015 reported legionella positive results in air samples collected above the aeration basin sludge dewatering process and 250 m downwind from the wwtp similarly pascual et al 2001 obtained l pneumophila positive results in 30 of the air samples taken at the pre treatment stage and in 11 of the samples taken above the activated sludge tanks medema et al 2004 also reported the presence of legionella spp and l pneumophila in aerosols above trickling filters aeration tanks and belt filter press at concentrations of 0 56 56 gu m3 and stated that aerated systems are facilities where prevention measures should be taken to reduce the risk of legionella infections ma et al 2015 reported a decrease in the relative abundance of legionella in a mbr treating restaurant wastewater from 19 to below 0 5 in the membrane effluent showing that membranes can produce legionella free treated wastewater legionella are thus retained by the membrane and accumulated in the reactor at wwtps operating with mbr care has to be taken to avoid a high legionella s concentration in aerosols nguyen et al 2006 and olsen et al 2010 reported that aerosols can be transported by the wind distances up to 10 km from the source thus increasing the risk of a legionella outbreak it has been reported in the literature that aerosols containing legionella with a size of 10 μm are more likely to enter the respiratory system and to be transported further distances whereas aerosols 10 μm are more likely to contain higher concentrations of legionella since they can transport cysts infected with legionella but with reduced dispersion distances due to higher settling velocities prussin et al 2017 schoen and ashbolt 2011 the aerosol size distribution and weather conditions e g wind velocity and direction humidity are important factors in determining the distance that airborne legionella can reach during ld outbreaks future research is needed to characterize aerosols generation of different aeration systems as well as dispersion models of airborne legionella in wwtps risk assessments of legionella in municipal wwtps are not adequately represented in literature studies are necessary to evaluate and classify the risk of growth of legionella in municipal plants based on the size of the facility type of treatment type of influent as well as operating conditions further research should be done in municipal wwtp receiving industrial effluents to clarify the influence of industrial wastewater constituents and temperatures on the growth of legionella 3 2 occurrence of legionella in industrial wwtps the few studies available in the context of legionella in industrial wwtps were done in treatment plants from the wood and paper mills petrochemical beer and food production table 2 the occurrence of legionella in treatment plants from other industrial sectors cannot be excluded a wastewater temperature above 25 c is the common factor within the industrial wastewaters with high compositional variance an overview of the legionella concentrations operating conditions at each industrial wwtp and the efforts from the industrial sector to eradicate the growth of l pneumophila are summarized in the following sections wood production and paper mills wastewater from wood and paper production is characterized by relatively high chemical oxygen demand cod concentrations up to 5700 mg l depending on the type of paper being produced and very low concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorous compounds atv dvwk 2011a the addition of inorganic nutrients is indispensable for microbial growth during wastewater treatment the temperature of the wastewater varies between 30 and 37 c and the characteristics depend on the type of production process raw materials and or internal recirculation for resource recovery among other factors pokhrel and viraraghavan 2004 for a wastewater with a cod concentration less than 1000 mg l aerobic biological treatment processes have been used namely activated sludge bio membrane reactors and stabilization ponds mahmood and paice 2006 pokhrel and viraraghavan 2004 anaerobic treatment is recommended when the cod concentration of the wastewater exceeds 1000 mg l atv dvwk 2011a among the anaerobic treatment processes the most commonly used in the wood and paper industry are the anaerobic granular reactors up flow sludge blanket uasb expanded granular sludge bed egsb and the fluidized bed reactors fykse et al 2016 pokhrel and viraraghavan 2004 in an extensive monitoring of 43 wwtps from paper mills in sweden allestam et al 2006 reported legionella concentrations up to 109 cfu l in 66 of the aerated ponds receiving wastewater with an average temperature of 38 4 c l pneumophila sg 2 14 were dominant in all aerated ponds legionella were not detected in aerated ponds receiving wastewater with a temperature below 30 c additionally aerosols were monitored in cooling towers used to bring down the temperature of the wastewater only 3 samples out of 12 were positive for legionella thus allestam et al 2006 concluded that the cooling towers were not the source of legionella for the wwtps in finland a monitoring study was done in two industrial wwtps from the paper industry with 2 diagnosed cases of ld among workers kusnetsov et al 2010 l pneumophila sg1 and sg13 were found at concentrations of 1 106 cfu l and 2 107 cfu l respectively in the activated sludge tanks from wwtp a operated at 33 36 c in treated wastewater the concentration of l pneumophila sg1 2 3 104 cfu l was ca 2 log lower this reduction is explained by the separation of the sludge from the treated wastewater in the sedimentation tank in the excess sludge l pneumophila sg1 and sg13 were both found at a concentration of 106 cfu l in wwtp b l pneumophila sg5 and l rubrilucens a pathogenic non l pneumophila species were found at concentrations of 3 107 and 8 109 cfu l respectively in the activated sludge tanks operated at 35 37 c kusnetsov et al 2010 in aerosols from the cooling tower used to bring down the temperature of the wastewater l pneumophila sg2 was found at a concentration of 1 7 103 cfu l this same serogroup was isolated from the infected worker suggesting that the cooling tower was the source of infection in norway the aeration ponds receiving wastewater from the wood based factory borregaard were identified as the source of 3 ld outbreaks that occurred between 2005 and 2008 in 2005 56 confirmed cases of ld and 10 deaths were reported and until 2008 50 more people were diagnosed with ld nygard et al 2008 the biological treatment consisted of an anaerobic reactor followed by two aeration ponds operated at 36 38 c fykse et al 2013 in an extensive investigation of the etiology of the ld outbreaks l pneumophila sg1was found in the aeration ponds up to 1010 cfu l in the river downstream of the wwtp outlet 105 cfu l and in air samples collected above the aeration ponds 3 300 cfu m3 contaminated aerosols reached distances up to 200 m downwind the aerated ponds blatny et al 2008 fykse et al 2016 olsen et al 2010 an air scrubber located 200 m away from the aeration ponds was also spreading l pneumophila contaminated aerosols at a distance up to 10 km from the source nygard et al 2008 to prevent more ld cases control measures were taken to eliminate the source of legionella the shut down of the aerated ponds and the dosing of hypochlorite resulted in a 3 4 log reduction in the concentration of l pneumophila in the wastewater in air samples collected above the aeration ponds the concentration of the pathogen decreased to 43 cfu m3 olsen et al 2010 the aeration ponds were not reactivated presently the industrial wastewater is entirely treated anaerobically in a closed egsb full scale reactor before discharge into the river the effluent is filtered by hydrotech disc filters to avoid potential release of legionella or other pathogenic microorganisms fykse et al 2016 petrochemical industry petrochemical industries produce different types of products derived from petroleum and natural gas the wastewater generated in this type of industry contains toxic substances therefore its treatment generally requires a combination of biological and chemical processes before its final discharge in surface waters tiku 2005 l pneumophila sg1 lens in a concentration range of 106 1010 cfu l was found in the activated sludge tanks treating wastewater from a petrochemical industry producing solvents in france hartemann et al 2018 interestingly this strain was identical to l pneumophila sg1 strain 15 found in high concentrations in the previously mentioned wwtp from the wood and paper industry in norway olsen et al 2010 the pathogen was also found in two cooling towers located between 200 and 300 m from the aerated basins the contaminated aerosols produced by the aerated tanks and the cooling towers were spread in a distance up to 6 km from the petrochemical plant causing a ld outbreak with 86 confirmed cases and 18 fatalities nguyen et al 2006 to stop the outbreak it was necessary to shut down the cooling towers and the aerators in the activated sludge tanks in the study from lund et al 2014 samples from nine wwtp from petrochemical industries with aerated lagoons were analysed all samples were positive for l pneumophila in a concentration range of 104 107 gu l the temperature in all monitored wwtps was above 25 c and the lowest concentration of legionella was observed in the wastewater coming from the production of polyethylene or ethylene wastewater composition from the petrochemical industry differs considerably according to the industrial activities thus further studies aiming to correlate wastewater parameters and l pneumophila concentrations are necessary to understand which factors promote the growth of the pathogen in this type of wastewater brewery the composition of brewery wastewater depends on the type of process used for beer production this wastewater is readily biodegradable and it is characterized by the following parameters 300 1800 mg l cod 30 100 mg l total nitrogen 10 30 mg l total phosphorous and a temperature between 25 c and 35 c atv dvwk 2010 brewery wastewater is usually collected in equalization tanks to regulate flow and concentrations these tanks can be aerated to provide an initial biological degradation both aerobic activated sludge fluidized bed reactor and anaerobic processes egsb uasb processes have been used to treat wastewater however when anaerobic processes are applied a post aerated treatment is necessary to eliminate nitrogen for direct discharge into water bodies during the largest legionnaires outbreak in germany ocurred in warstein 2013 l pneumophila sg1 knoxville was isolated from an industrial sewer transporting brewery wastewater the municipal wwtp receiving the industrial effluent the river where the treated wastewater was discharged and in two cooling towers from industrial facilities located 3 km away from the wwtp the industrial wastewater was aerobically pre treated in mixing and equalization tanks and discharged into the municipal wwtp where trickling filters and activated sludge tanks were used to treat the wastewater the highest concentrations of the epidemic strain were found in the effluents from the mixing and equalization tanks 1 1010 cfu l and in the activated sludge tanks 5 107 cfu l exner et al 2014 maisa et al 2015 nogueira et al 2016 the treated wastewater was discharged to the river wester where the concentration of l pneumophila including the epidemic strain was 2 105 cfu l exner 2015 approximately 3 km downstream water drawn from the river to operate a cooling tower resulted in the biggest ld outbreak in germany with 159 suspected cases 78 laboratory confirmed cases and 2 fatalities exner 2015 maisa et al 2015 to eliminate the source of legionella several control measures were implemented the trickling filters were shut down the activated sludge tanks were covered and the aeration with compressed air was replaced with pure oxygen to minimize aerosols production a uv 254 nm disinfection unit was installed at the effluent of the wwtp and a combined performic acid disinfection was tested for a short period of time 5 months after uv treatment the concentration of l pneumophila in the treated wastewater was 1 6 3 4 log units lower than before treatment the combination of uv performic acid reduced further the concentration of the pathogen to values close to the limit of detection of the culture method nogueira et al 2016 currently the equalization tanks used to pre treat brewery wastewater were shut down and substituted by an anaerobic esgb reactor the anaerobically treated wastewater is discharged into the municipal wwtp in addition in the work of nogueira et al 2016 several physical and chemical disinfection agents including microsil hydrogen peroxide chlorine dioxide alkaline ph ozone and ultrasounds were proved to be ineffective to reduce the concentration of l pneumophila in activated sludge at concentrations which would not inhibit biological treatment supressing the growth of l pneumophila directly in the activated sludge is of the utmost importance because it prevents the emission of contaminated aerosols and at the same time the discharge of effluents contaminated with legionella hence future investigations should focus on the development of specific legionella inhibitors that do not affect the activity of key microorganisms necessary for the biological treatment of wastewater food production and dairy industries the composition of dairy wastewater depends on the size of the factory used processes technologies and good manufacturing practices in general wastewater from the milk processing industries has a temperature between 20 and 30 c and a high organic content composed by carbohydrates proteins and lipids with a daily fluctuation varying from 800 to 4500 mg l cod concentrations and 10 110 mg l total nitrogen concentrations atv dvwk 2011b this type of wastewater is characterized by high concentrations of solids colloids and soluble compounds and it is usually treated by mechanical and chemical processes the majority of dairies treat the wastewater aerobically in activated sludge processes moving bed biofilm reactor sequencing batch reactor and membrane reactor among others or through a combination of anaerobic pre treatment followed by an aerobic treatment kolev slavov 2017 lund et al 2014 investigated eight wwtp from dairies with a temperature around 25 c samples taken from the activated sludge tanks were 100 positive for legionella and 34 positive for l pneumophila with a concentration between 103 107 gu l interestingly the authors suggested that dairy wastewater might contain chemical or microbiological inhibitors for instance lactobacillus that prevent the growth of l pneumophila unfortunately no further studies to support the hypothesis were found in the literature in denmark the occurrence of l pneumophila and l londiniensis was reported in a wwtp receiving wastewater from the food industry non specified five workers were infected with l pneumophila after working close to an uncovered decanter used for sludge thickening within the wwtp the concentration of l pneumophila in the sludge was 1 5 106 cfu gw to avoid aerosols propagation the decanters were covered and the use of respiratory protective masks within the wwtp was required gregersen et al 1999 in summer 2017 the institute for sanitary engineering and waste management from leibniz university hannover monitored legionella within a wwtp receiving anaerobically treated effluents from a food industry in belgium for confidential reasons the type of industry will not be mentioned l pneumophila was detected by the qpcr method in a total of 26 samples and the highest concentration was measured in samples from the activated sludge tanks 4 8 106 gu l operated at a temperature ranging between 32 and 35 c and a sludge age of 10 days interestingly the concentration of legionella spp was considerably higher approximately 2 log units higher than the concentration of l pneumophila suggesting that a large community of non l pneumophila species could grow at previously mentioned operating conditions miscellaneous the survey from lund et al 2014 also found l pneumophila in four additional industries chemicals production for wood processing oil industry wafers and potato chips production all wwtps were based on the activated sludge process with a temperature range 20 35 c however it is not possible to infer from this study the concentrations of legionella in the different wwtps and the environmental factors that could have influenced its growth in 2016 2017 two ld outbreaks were reported in boxtel the netherlands related to an industrial wwtp industrial activity not specified which discharged effluents into a municipal wwtp loenenbach et al 2018 during 2016 six ld cases were reported and in 2017 eight more ld cases were confirmed with all events related to biological treatment facilities the three industrial ponds operated at a temperature of 35 c showed l pneumophila concentrations ranging between 2 106 to 23 108 cfu l industrial effluents were directed to a municipal wwtp where l pneumophila was also detected at concentrations of 1 105 cfu l in the influent samples and 2 103 cfu l in the aeration pond in order to prevent contaminated aerosols transmission temporary tents were erected and a permanent cover was studied as a long term solution interestingly in this study the authors determined that contaminated aerosols transmission directly from the aerated ponds reached distances over 1 6 km away from the source this review clearly shows that wwtps with aeration basins and temperatures between 20 and 35 c may be sources of legionella however l pneumophila does not occur in every wwtps operating with ideal conditions for its growth a better understanding of the events that support l pneumophila proliferation to critical threshold levels in complex matrices found in wwtps is extremely challenging the physicochemical parameters as well as operational conditions such as wastewater composition temperature sludge age and biocenosis under which l pneumophila proliferates in wwtps have not been determined such information is indispensable to develop control measures to prevent or eliminate the colonization of l pneumophila in wwtp industrial and mixed wwtps should be constantly monitored and legionella risk assessments should be carried out to identify the facilities with higher risk and to plan new control strategies accordingly 4 reclaimed wastewater reuse reclaimed wastewater is an increasingly important alternative water source in industrialized as well as in developing countries it typically contains higher concentrations of organic carbon nitrogen and phosphorous in comparison to potable water which increases the risk of proliferation of pathogenic microorganisms garner et al 2016 in fact the study of garner et al 2018 investigated the occurrence of legionella in five reclaimed water systems applied for irrigation purposes legionella were positively correlated with phosphorus and ammonia contents suggesting that nutrients play an important role on the incidence of legionella in reclaimed wastewater systems guidelines for the safe use of reclaimed wastewater have been published by the european environment agency eea 2016 the united states environmental protection agency epa 2012 and the world health organization who 2016 however the existing regulations or guidelines regarding pathogenic bacteria in wastewater and reclaimed water are based on fecal indicator microorganisms e g e coli and the presence of opportunistic waterborne pathogens like legionella is not yet included epa 2012 depending on the purpose of use reclaimed wastewater can be transported through distribution systems and kept in storage tanks where its quality decreases compared to that at the point of discharge at the wwtp also designed as point of compliance poc due to several factors namely residence time nutrient concentrations loss of disinfectant residuals warmer temperatures and contact with biofilms johnson et al 2018 regulations and guidelines for reclaimed water systems should consider three key elements for public health concerns i evaluation of the health impact associated with levels of exposure ii assessment of all exposure pathways to chemical and microbial contaminants present in reclaimed water and iii verification of water quality at the final point of use garner et al 2016 the main uses of reclaimed wastewater are cooling purposes agricultural and landscape irrigation and toilet flushing hamilton et al 2018 all uses are associated with aerosol generation which highlights the importance of controlling legionella in treated wastewater legionella have been detected in reclaimed wastewater systems at concentrations ranging from 103 to 105 cfu l in usa ajibode et al 2013 jjemba et al 2010 johnson et al 2018 and 106 107 gu l in france and australia respectively brissaud et al 2008 whiley et al 2015 ajibode et al 2013 and johnson et al 2018 reported the highest concentrations of legionella in reclaimed wastewater during summer months which might indicate a growth seasonal trend of legionella in reclaimed wastewater systems johnson et al 2018 investigated six reclaimed wastewater systems using chlorine disinfection with different lengths of distribution pipes and residence times the highest concentrations of legionella and amoebae were measured at the end of the distribution systems inside the storage tanks legionella spp and total amoeba geometric means 7300 cfu l and 50 mpn l respectively where chlorine was non detectable or below 0 2 mg l l pneumophila was found in all six reclaimed wastewater systems and amounted to 96 and 52 of the legionella spp concentrations determined by the culture and qpcr methods respectively interestingly other pathogenic legionella species co occurred with l pneumophila namely l oakridgensis l moravica l longbeachae and l hackeliae jjemba et al 2010 also reported a rapid decrease in chlorine in reclaimed wastewater distribution systems due to its reaction with organic matter after disinfection they observed a re population of the water distribution systems by legionella spp and mycobacterium spp both genera known to multiply inside amoebae and ciliates suggesting that the interaction with protozoa might increase the resistance against chlorine ajibode et al 2013 compared two reclaimed wastewater systems a and b using different disinfection treatments in system a chlorine was dosed 3 9 mg l at the poc while in system b wastewater was irradiated with ultraviolet light 100 000 μw s cm2 for both systems the concentration of legionella including l pneumophila sg1 was almost 2 log units higher at a distance of 12 km from the poc at this distance the residual chlorine concentration drops to 0 1 mg l in system a which is not sufficient to prevent the re growth of legionella in system b uv treatment does not prevent recolonization of the system by legionella mainly because it is applied at the poc and not close to the point of use as described by liu et al 1995 for a water distribution system kulkarni et al 2018 reported the occurrence of l pneumophila and l feeleii in uv treated wastewater used for spray irrigation from these studies it can be deduced that human health risks from exposure to reclaimed wastewater contaminated with pathogenic legionella species are to be expected quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra is a useful tool to estimate the likelihood of illness due to exposure to a certain pathogen present in a water system us epa 2012 using this tool hamilton et al 2018 evaluated the legionella health risk in reclaimed wastewater for three re use scenarios cooling towers spray irrigation and toilet flushing the risks were calculated with a geometric mean of legionella concentration in reclaimed wastewater in the range of 1000 10 000 cfu l and compared with the usepa annual infection risk of 10 4 infections per person per year ippy for drinking water benchmark the annual infection risk associated to toilet flushing 3 8ˑ10 4 ippy with american model toilets surpassed the benchmark for spray irrigation and cooling towers the annual infection risk was determined by meteorological and operational conditions the authors estimated an annual infection risk exceeding the benchmark for contaminated aerosols at a distance of 1 km and 10 km from the source hamilton et al 2018 depending on the analytical method applied to quantify legionella concentrations culture and qpcr respectively certainly aerosols contaminated with legionella present a higher occupational health risk to the workers within the reclaimed wastewater systems rather than to those in the vicinity areas the study of hamilton et al 2018 highlights the need for further investigations to determine the legionella risks associated to reclaimed wastewater re use and the importance of regular monitoring and mitigation measures such as closing toilet lids using drift eliminators and windbreaks among others best managing practices and adequate planning of reclaimed water systems should focus on maintaining the treated water quality until the final point of use garner et al 2016 in addition as mentioned by jjemba et al 2015 although no legionella s outbreaks have been reported in association with reclaimed water systems municipal and industrial treatment systems should act proactively to establish effective measures to control legionella and protozoa in order to prevent future events in summary this literature review shows that wwtps provide optimal conditions for the growth of legionella with aerated tanks being the principle reservoir of the pathogen this fact is in particular a growing concern not only for the workers within the treatment facility but also for vicinity areas and reclaimed wastewater users the studies that investigated the legionella outbreaks associated with wwtps have shown that contaminated aerosols can be transported over a distance up to 6 10 km blatny et al 2008 nguyen et al 2006 olsen et al 2010 representing a potential public health risk moreover reclaimed wastewater for agricultural and industrial purposes where aerosols are produced is widely applied yet fundamental knowledge regarding the associated legionella risk is still limited for a better public health management it is crucial to control the growth of legionella in wwtps as well as outlining limits for legionella in wastewater discharged indirectly to municipal wwtps and directly into natural water systems 5 legionella regulations in wastewater treatment facilities monitoring the occurrence of legionella in wwtp is crucial from a public health perspective however to our knowledge until now there is only one ordinance for legionella self monitoring in wwtps this ordinance issued in 2016 by the ministry for climate protection environment agriculture nature and consumer protection of the state of north rhine westphalia was based on the report of an expert commission constituted after the largest legionella outbreak in germany warstein 2013 the self monitoring program is addressed to wwtps with biological treatment receiving wastewater with a temperature of 23 c from the following industries milk sugar and meat production breweries and pulp and paper municipal wwtps receiving effluents from these industries are also included in the ordinance the legionella self monitoring program must be done quarterly during the first year in case the results are considered not abnormal the ordinance does not define concentration limits for legionella the monitoring should be continued in the next years at least once a year during the summer months the quantification of legionella spp should be done by the culture method according to iso 11 731 the latest version in case the concentration of legionella spp is 10 000 cfu l l pneumophila concentration and the respective serogroups should also be determined mkulvn 2016 the expert commission recommends in its report the following preventive and control measures that should be taken if certain legionella concentrations are exceeded i when the legionella concentration is 10 000 cfu l no preventive measures are necessary ii for concentrations between 10 000 and 100 000 cfu l the workers and reclaimed wastewater users should be informed about the measured concentrations and potential public health risks legionella species and subgroups should be determined and further monitoring should be done in all treatment steps of the facility iii when the concentration is 100 000 cfu l control measures to reduce legionella must be taken further monitoring should be carried out in water systems receiving the treated wastewater in air samples taken above the aerated tanks and within the influents of the wwtp to determine the source of legionella exner et al 2015 the main reasons for the regulation to focus on treated effluents are the following i by monitoring and controlling legionella in treated wastewater discharged in surface waters or directly re used in reclaimed systems the contamination of other facilities which at the same time are massive aerosol generators e g irrigation systems or cooling towers can be prevented ii the regulation adopted the culture method following the norm iso 11 731 for the quantification of legionella spp in treated wastewater this method is relatively inexpensive and is implemented in many certified laboratories for water and wastewater analytics however the results obtained with the cultivation method in activated sludge samples are not satisfactory due to the additional growth of other bacteria in the plates in addition to treated wastewater we suggest that aerosols in wastewater treatment plants generated in aeration tanks should be monitored for legionella s concentration because they are the direct source of exposure to this bacterium the report of the expert group also includes the uv 254 nm treatment and microfiltration of secondary treated wastewater as control strategies to reduce legionella s concentration alternatively they suggest to decrease the wastewater temperature to 20 c when feasible and to reduce the protein concentration through an anaerobic pre treatment as it was implemented in the wwtp in warstein after the ld outbreak finally the recommendations to reduce aerosol generation include covering open channels transporting legionella contaminated wastewater as well as activated sludge tanks pure oxygen or fine bubble aerations and air filtration the use of respiratory protection during cleaning and maintenance activities sludge treatment and biofilm removal is also recommended exner et al 2015 the european agency for safety and health at work recognizes wwtps with activated sludge basins as possible sources of community acquired legionella infections to prevent exposure of the wwtp operators to the pathogen the use of respiratory protective equipment is recommended in addition cooling towers used to reduce the wastewater temperature should be cleaned and maintained in accordance to the european centre for disease prevention and control and the world health organization legionella guidelines bartram et al 2007 ecdc 2017 eu osha 2011 6 conclusions and remarks this literature review demonstrates that industrial and municipal wwtps are sources of legionella although optimum growth conditions prevail in many wwtps l pneumophila has been reported in few indicating that the specific environmental factors that trigger the growth and persistence of this pathogen are still unknown extensive research done in wwtps from the paper mill industry in the scandinavian countries showed a clear link between temperature and the occurrence of l pneumophila for a temperature equal to or higher than 30 c in the aerobic biological treatment systems l pneumophila was present otherwise it could not be detected such a clear association between occurrence of legionella and environmental parameters could not be obtained for other industrial and municipal wastewaters the following paragraphs present the research gaps identified in the literature which should be addressed so that adequate treatments can be implemented in wwtps and reclaimed water facilities for air wastewater and sludge contaminated with legionella to minimize the growth of legionella in these depuration systems the treatment process itself or the operation conditions should be modified to achieve this goal research must be done under the prevailing operational and environmental conditions characteristic of these systems the diversity of protozoan hosts for legionella growth in activated sludge at different temperatures should be further investigated there is also a lack of information about the dynamics of protozoa and legionella in activated sludge systems the role of protozoa in the growth and persistence of legionella in activated sludge might be the key point in the development of effective elimination or control measures in wwtps the methods to control legionella in biological treatment systems present some limitations that should be further investigated for example uv disinfection was reported to be an effective method to control legionella in treated wastewater nevertheless uv irradiation leaves no residual disinfection and legionella are capable to recolonize reclaimed water systems also legionella are able to repair the dna damaged caused by the uv light which means that legionella are not detectable immediately after the uv treatment but it appears after a period of time or some kilometres downstream from the discharge point ozonation has also been reported as an effective disinfection method for l pneumophila in municipal wastewater dong et al 2018 however ozone does not form a residual concentration in water thus it cannot prevent legionella s regrowth in reclaimed water systems research need exists regarding the evaluation of the most effective disinfectant agents that minimize legionella s regrowth in reclaimed water systems as for example in irrigation systems toilet flushing or cooling purposes among others the development of new and innovative wastewater treatment technologies as well as the use of specific inhibitors could represent feasible solutions to prevent the growth of legionella in wwtps to minimize the emission of contaminated aerosols from industrial and municipal wwtps especially the ones with higher risk of legionella colonization different alternatives like roofing or air filtration should be evaluated to prevent future ld cases within the treatment facility or in the vicinity areas correlations between the occurrence of legionella and wastewater characteristics treatment type operational parameters and microbial communities are necessary not only to evaluate the conditions under which the pathogen grows but also to implement better management practices with focus on wwtps that present higher risks of legionella contamination monitoring approaches of legionella in wastewater face discrepancies between culture and molecular methods it is important to develop new guidelines and policies that define which methods are more appropriate to determine environmental legionella concentrations and the corresponding mitigation and control measurements declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence

19126,carbon rich waste materials solid liquid or gaseous are largely considered to be a burden on society due to the large capital and energy costs for their treatment and disposal however solid and liquid organic wastes have inherent energy and value and similar as waste co2 gas they can be reused to produce value added chemicals and materials there has been a paradigm shift towards developing a closed loop biorefinery approach for the valorization of these wastes into value added products and such an approach enables a more carbon efficient and circular economy this review quantitatively analyzes the state of the art of the emerging microbial electrochemical technology met platform and provides critical perspectives on research advancement and technology development the review offers side by side comparison between microbial electrosynthesis mes and electro fermentation ef processes in terms of principles key performance metrics data analysis and microorganisms the study also summarizes all the processes and products that have been developed using mes and ef to date for organic waste and co2 valorization it finally identifies the technological and economic potentials and challenges on future system development graphical abstract image 1 keywords microbial electrochemical technology bioelectrochemical system carbon valorization microbial electrosynthesis electro fermentation 1 introduction traditonally waste has been considered a societal burden and its treatment and disposal requires large amounts of land energy and capital every year nearly 35 5 gigatonnes gt of anthropogenic co2 are emitted to the atmosphere which is believed to be the main cause of climate change mac dowell et al 2017 in addition approximately 1000 km3 municipal wastewater and 2 01 gt municipal solid waste are released globally which pose serious environmental and public health concerns especially in developing countries kaza 2018 wwap 2017 considering these carbon rich waste materials solid liquid and gaseous have inherent energy that can be reused to produce value added products a paradigm shift is underway towards developing a closed loop apporach for the valorization of these wastes by converting them into biomaterials biochemicals and biofuels this waste biorefinery approach holds the potential to further transform the waste treatment industry into a resource recovery business thereby generating marketable products enhancing process economics and environmental sustainability and enabling a more carbon efficient and circular economy a recent report published by the us department of energy doe bioenergy technology office beto estimated that 50 million dry tons of combined primary organic waste streams sludge biosolids animal manure food waste and fats oils and greases are available every year for conversion to biofuels bioproducts or biopower in addition gaseous waste streams possess an additional 734 trillion btu tbtu bringing the total energy potential of these waste feedstocks to nearly 2 6 quadrillion btu doe 2017 different technologies and processes have been developed to convert waste carbon materials including those in the solid liquid or gaseous forms into value added products the platforms may include thermochemical biochemical photochemical and electrochemical approaches and each approach has its advantages and challenges doe 2017 a microbial electrochemical technology met platform is a hybrid approach that uses electroactive microorganisms to catalyze bioelectrochemical reactions to convert waste carbon materials into bioenergy and bioproducts hou et al 2017 zou and he 2018 this unique platform is capable of separating oxidation and reduction reactions for the first time in ambient environmental conditions as the electrodes can be used to serve as either the anode electron acceptor or the cathode electron donor jiang and zeng 2019 pandey et al 2016 wang and ren 2013 in 2009 cheng et al presented an early met process to valorize waste carbon into methane by using an abiotic anode and a biocathode acclimated with methanobacterium palustre cheng et al 2009 which was called electromethanogenesis the term microbial electrosynthesis or mes was firstly introduced in 2010 by nevin et al in their study of using sporomusa ovata to accept electrons from a cathode and reduce co2 into acetic acid they defined mes as the reduction of carbon dioxide to multicarbon compounds with electrons donated from an electrode as the electron donor nevin et al 2010 soon after a comprehensive review published by rabaey and rozendal discussed very thoroughly the principles challenges and opportunities of mes in that review they also introduced electro fermentation ef as an electrochemical process to control fermentation pathways using electrical current rabaey and rozendal 2010 the application of electric current to fermentation can be traced back to a study published in 1940 in which the electric current was proved to reduce the process time and improve the brew and taste of tea during a two year fermentation study lominadze 1940 the use of mes and ef for organic waste or co2 valorization carries great potential as these processes can capture electrons from solar wind biomass or renewable sources and store the energy by forming covalent chemical bonds there have been excellent reviews on the working principles and microbial electron transfer mechanisms bajracharya et al 2017a geppert et al 2016 may et al 2016 tremblay et al 2017 the logical data representation and frameworks patil et al 2015b economic feasibility of mes christodoulou and velasquez orta 2016 shemfe et al 2018 and the principles and industrial potentials of ef moscoviz et al 2016 schievano et al 2016 but there has been no quantitative review that summarizes the state of the art of met for organic chemicals production and explains side by side the principles key performance metrics data analysis and microorganisms this article aims to provide the first complete review that summarizes and discusses all the processes and products that have been developed using the mes and ef platform to date for organic waste and co2 valorization and it identifies the challenges and potentials on future system development the review provides quantitative analyses of mes and ef studies based on different parameters including production rates coulombic efficiency current density electrode potential as well as economic potentials and environmental impacts 2 the two major microbial electrochemical processes mes and ef for co2 and organic waste valorization both mes and ef use electrochemical mechanisms to influence microbial metabolic activities and produce targeted bioproducts so in principle they both belong to the broad met platform early studies tended to include ef in the broad concept of mes rabaey et al 2011 rabaey and rozendal 2010 however recent studies separated ef out as it carries unique properties with regards to reaction principles and operational specificities which are different from the traditional definition of mes moscoviz et al 2016 schievano et al 2016 fig 1 illustrates the principles of mes and ef and table 1 summarizes the similarities and differences between the two processes a typical mes process leverages autotrophic microorganisms using a solid electrode cathode as the electron donor and soluble co2 as the electron acceptor for organic compound synthesis the electrode serves as the reducing power even though the exact electron transfer mechanisms can be direct or mediated by h2 or other redox agents some electroactive microbes such as geobacter and clostridium have been hypothesized to be capable of direct electron transfer det during which the cells produce conductive nanowires and or c type cytochromes to directly acquire electrons from the electrode at certain redox potentials lovley and nevin 2011 under most conditions electron shuttles such as in situ generated h2 or other small molecules such as formate and flavin are believed to play important roles as electron transfer mediators and the exact mechanisms are largely influenced by the cathode working potential blanchet et al 2015 deutzmann et al 2015 compared with mes that features electrons exchange between electrodes and microbial cells electro fermentation intends to stimulate microbial metabolism via electrochemical modification of the intracellular redox state and therefore doesn t prefer direct contact the electric current supplied by the electrodes in ef is not the sole source of electrons rather it influences the flux of the self driven fermentation by regulating the oxidation reduction potential orp and the nad nadh ratio moscoviz et al 2016 similar to ph as a measure of proton activity the extracellular orp corresponds to the activity of the electrons present in the electrolyte and influences the nad nadh ratio within cells the nad nadh ratio represents intracellular orp because of intracellular redox homeostasis which controls gene expression and enzyme synthesis for overall metabolic activity therefore it is reasonable to hypothesize that by regulating the redox potential in the reactor fermentation pathways can be influenced and the product spectrum can be changed because ef provides an effective method to consume or supply electrons during microbial fermentation the electro fermentation process can be divided into anodic ef and cathodic ef in an anodic ef the solid electrode serves as an electron acceptor so microorganisms can deliver electrons to the anode during organic degradation with an ef cathode the working electrode serves as an electron donor which can be used by microbes to synthesize different products depending on the redox potential the electron transfer between the electrodes and microbes can be bidirectional and extracellular electron transfer mechanisms including det and mediated electron transfer similar as suggested for mes processes were proposed however syntrophic interactions between fermentative bacteria and electroactive bacteria were found to dominate and played essential roles in ef reactors mainly because of the degradation of complex polymeric organic substrates moscoviz et al 2017 the ef process is an electrochemically influenced spontaneous fermentation so the current density in ef 0 001 10 a m 2 moscoviz et al 2018 sturm richter et al 2015 zhou et al 2015 is generally smaller than the current measured in mess 0 01 200 a m 2 jourdin et al 2016 nevin et al 2011 zhang et al 2013 for instance a cathodic ef study reported that only 0 2 of the cathodic electron inputs were used for butanol production while 99 8 of the electrons were originated from the glucose substrate choi et al 2014 in contract most mess solely depend on the reducing power provided by the electrode so their reactions are not spontaneous without the external driving force bajracharya et al 2017a may et al 2016 a useful parameter to differentiate mes and ef is called the ef coefficient eq 1 which is used to calculate the contribution of charge transferred across the external circuit to the total charge in the end products moscoviz et al 2016 by this calculation the value of the ef coefficient in ef ranges between 0 and 1 choi et al 2014 since a fraction of the charges are also from the substrates in contrast the coefficient of mes is 1 due to the fact that the electrode is used as the only source of reducing power 1 η e f i d t n product n product f for eq 2 where η ef is the ef efficiency i is the electric current t is the operation time n product is moles of product and f is the faraday constant n product is determined by the molecular formula of product which can be calculated as eq 2 2 n product c w n x o y h z 4 w 3 x 2 y z 3 carbon dioxide valorization using mes the utilization of co2 as a renewable carbon feedstock for products not only takes advantage of this low cost and abundant carbon resource and generates economic values it also actively mitigates carbon emissions with tremendous environmental and societal benefits there are multiple options for co2 capture and utilization including photochemical biochemical electrochemical and thermochemical pathways and each of them has advantages and challenges qiao et al 2014 to utilize co2 as a feedstock concentrated or atmospheric co2 source needs to be firstly captured and solubilized for subsequent reduction reactions either via biotic or abiotic process microbial electrosynthesis is a novel hybrid of bio and electrochemical approaches to utilize microbial cells to convert dissolved co2 into value added organic compounds especially those with multiple carbons that are precursors for desirable value added chemicals or liquid transportation fuels li et al 2018b the unique advantage of mes for co2 valorization lies in the utilization of electrons as the reducing power which can be generated from natural gas biogas or solar and wind sources even though the supply of these electron sources can be intermittent del pilar anzola rojas et al 2018 because microbes may harvest solar energy in a 100 fold higher efficiency than biomass based chemical production claassens et al 2016 zhang 2015 mes may help address the pressing problems of renewable energy storage and distribution many microorganisms can fix co2 and there are 6 known fixation pathways found in bacteria and archaea saini et al 2011 among these autotrophic microorganisms methanogens and acetogens have been utilized in mes as pure cultures or enriched in mixed cultures in this section we quantitatively summarized and analyzed how mes has been used for co2 utilization what products were generated and how did systems perform under different conditions in addition economic and environmental impacts of mes for carbon dioxide valorization are analyzed and discussed 3 1 co2 conversion into ch4 by mes methane is the intend product of power to gas p2g process for renewable electricity conversion and storage and methanogens can readily utilize the h2 formate or acetate to produce ch4 jiang et al 2014 lu and ren 2016 methane can be produced electrochemically at 0 24 v vs she under biological relevant conditions ph 7 and 25 c eq 3 which is more positive than that of other common organic chemicals such as acetate butyrate or ethanol so ch4 is the most thermodynamically favorable product of co2 reduction lü et al 2018 practically more negative working potentials were applied to overcome overpotential loss and improve production rate geppert et al 2016 all working potentials reported in this review are normalized to the standard hydrogen electrode she 3 co 2 8 h 8 e ch 4 2 h 2 o e cat 0 24 v vs she the first proof of concept study on electromethanogenesis was reported by using a two chamber reactor with an abiotic anode and biotic cathode methanobacterium palustre was found to utilize the electrons from the cathode to reduce co2 into ch4 cheng et al 2009 marshall et al enriched an mes biocathode using brewery wastewater sludge the ch4 producing microbiome consisted of 93 methanobacterium and 5 methanobrevibacte marshall et al 2012 another study enriched a ch4 producing biocathode from anaerobic sludge with the archaeal phylotypes mostly related to methanobacterium palustre and methanobacterium aarhusense van eerten jansen et al 2013b pure culture methanococcus maripaludis was also tested in electromethanogenesis but it could only produce ch4 at a much lower potential 0 6 v beese vasbender et al 2014 later studies identified that rather than directly using the electrode m maripaludis primarily used h2 formic acid and self secreted compounds to mediate co2 reduction deutzmann et al 2015 lohner et al 2014 fig 2 summarizes the key performance of mes reactors on ch4 production reported to date when normalized to the projected cathode area the ch4 production rate ranged from 0 005 to 9 78 l m 2 d 1 beese vasbender et al 2014 villano et al 2010 when normalized to the cathode chamber volume the production rates were between 0 02 and 295 8 l m 3 d 1 beese vasbender et al 2014 van eerten jansen et al 2013b methane generation was observed under a cathode potential as high as 0 28 v beese vasbender et al 2014 which is close to the theoretical potential of 0 24 v eq 3 mixed culture systems showed much higher performance than pure culture reactors by all measures production rate current density and coulombic efficiency and the production rate can differ by as much as two orders of magnitudes this is likely associated with the synergistic interactions as well as the higher flexibility in inward extracellular electron transfer conducted by the mixed community one study showed that when switching from mixed culture system to pure culture of m palustre atcc baa 1077 ch4 production rate decreased by an order of magnitude from 4 9 to 0 3 l m 2 d 1 which was also accompanied by a sharp decrease in current density cheng et al 2009 electromethanogenesis reactors have shown long term stability for up to a year and have been operated at pilot scale schlager et al 2017 but the production rate is still poor when compared with traditional anaerobic digestion ad this low rate is understandable because methanogens in mes are autolithotrophs that uses co2 as the carbon source and electron acceptor and their main electron source is the cathode such metabolism is slow and energy expensive i e the energy available per reaction δg is low a recent study comparing ch4 generation with different substrates discovered that the production rate with dual electron donors acetic acid and electrode was about 5 times higher than when a single electron donor electrode only was supplied fu et al 2015 3 2 co2 conversion into acetic acid by mes acetic acid is another major product of co2 reduction in mes and this has been observed in reactors with pure or mixed acetogenic cultures may et al 2016 acetic acid can be produced electrochemically under biologically relevant conditions at 0 28 v eq 4 which is slightly lower than the methane generation potential 0 24 v rabaey and rozendal 2010 4 2 hco 3 9 h 8 e ch 3 coo 4 h 2 o e cat 0 28 v vs she practically more negative working potentials were applied to overcome the overpotential loss and improve production rate nevin et al firstly reported that six acetogenic microorganisms sporomusa ovata sporomusa sphaeriodes sporomusa silvacetica clostridium ljungdahlii clostridium aceticum and moorella thermoacetica showed electrosynthesis capability with acetic acid production from co2 at 0 4 v the potential was above the h2 evolution value using unpolished graphite as the cathode which was measured by an earlier study to be 0 6 v with an overpotential of 0 2 v so the authors assumed that the microbes used the electrode as the electron donor nevin et al 2010 2011 interestingly the acetogen acetobacterium woodii was unable to consume the electrons under similar conditions nevin et al 2011 which was presumably due to its lack of cytochromes or quinones for energy conservation and the use of na dependent atpase for energy conservation however it was enriched on a mixed culture biocathode poised at a potential low enough for h2 evolution su et al 2013 fig 3 summarizes the key performance of mes reactors on acetic acid production using either pure or mixed cultures the production rates of acetic acid ranges from 0 02 to 685 g m 2 d 1 when normalized by cathode surface area jourdin et al 2015 yu et al 2017 or 0 0015 18 72 g l 1 d 1 when normalized by cathode liquid volume labelle et al 2014 labelle and may 2017 nevin et al 2011 while most mes studies reported acetate production below 1 g l 1 d 1 studies found that a graphite granule packed bed cathode could obtain high area to volume ratio and achieved 3 1 g l 1 d 1 in production rate labelle et al 2014 in addition a recently study used galvanostatic control to overcome the reducing power limitation and obtained a high production rate of 18 72 g l 1 d 1 in which some of the acetate was believed to be produced by planktonic cells labelle and may 2017 negative cathode potential led to the increased acetic acid production rate fig 3a and current density fig 3c acetic acid was observed to accumulate when the cathode potential dropped to 0 3 v at a high temperature of 60 c faraghiparapari and zengler 2017 it is also worth noting that fig 3 reveals higher production rate and current density were reported in mixed culture than pure culture within each cathode potential this is likely attributed to the syntrophic interactions among different communities blanchet et al 2015 deutzmann and spormann 2017 however mixed culture reactors also showed larger fluctuations in ce from near 0 to almost 100 with low efficiency generally associated with re consumption by methanogenesis jiang et al 2013 saheb alam et al 2018 the lack of reducing force to trigger hydrogen mediated electron consumption at a more positive potential blanchet et al 2015 and the absence of biofilm development on inefficient cathode material recent efforts focused on investigating new electrode materials bian et al 2018 optimizing operating conditions patil et al 2015a and designing new reactor configurations gildemyn et al 2015 labelle and may 2017 for improved performance for example different cathode materials including nonporous bulk electrode e g graphite plate or graphite stick fiber based porous monolithic porous electrodes e g reticulated vitreous carbon rvc and packed bed electrode e g graphite granule have all been tested in mes reactors xie et al 2015 the accumulated titer of acetic acid has increased from 0 015 to 13 5 g l 1 gildemyn et al 2015 nevin et al 2011 and higher titer is expected after mes optimization as up to 44 g l 1 of acetic acid was reported when acetobacterium woodi was grown with h2 and co2 in a batch operated stirred tank bioreactor str demler and weuster botz 2011 while some studies suggested that co2 was reduced by electroactive bacteria using the electrons directly provided by the cathode the role of h2 in mes co2 reduction needs to be further investigated as many studies did not specify the actual working potential or lacked precise h2 monitoring method it is likely that h2 played an important role as a reducing power but it may be only present in trace amount and consumed quickly by microbes similar as interspecies h2 transfer h2 evolution was largely influenced by the changes of ph temperature and h2 partial pressure and a recent study reported that h2 evolution potential fluctuated from 0 06 v to 0 47 v when ph changed from 5 to 8 and h2 partial pressure varied from 10 nbar to 1 bar may et al 2016 in fact many mes reactors were not consistently operated at the standard conditions ph 7 25 c and 1 bar corresponding to 0 42 v for h2 evolution or with precise h2 detection plus the actual working potential generally deviates from the setting value due to the internal resistance drop especially when 3 d porous materials high current densities were used madjarov et al 2017 3 3 co2 conversion into other organic compounds by mes in addition to ch4 and acetic acid other organic compounds are also produced in mess mostly as mixed products it is believed that acetyl coenzyme a acetyl coa served as a key intermediate for different synthetic pathways may et al 2016 and fig 4 shows the potential pathways that lead to the generation of different organic compounds depending on microbial catalysts and operating conditions arends et al 2017 mohan et al 2016 lu et al 2016 it should be noted that the producion of organic compounds with more than one carbon atom is largely restricted by the increased kinetically challenging of proton coupled electron transfer pcet reactions and thus the formation of multiple c c bonds is not favorable weekes et al 2018 in addition a model based on stoichiometric and energetic analyses has pointed out that the producing of acetic acid in wood ljungdahl pathway is directly linked with the regeneration of atp and thus it helps to explain why the production of other organic compounds in mes is unfavorable fast and papoutsakis 2012 while recent studies are just starting to explore the opportunities of generating higher value organic compounds from co2 using the mes platform the potential can be high considering the versatility of microbial metabolisms and the abundance of renewable electrons and co2 various organic compounds have been produced in mes from co2 reduction including formic acid nevin et al 2011 propionic acid modestra and mohan 2017 zaybak et al 2013 butyric acid bajracharya et al 2016 ganigue et al 2015 modestra and mohan 2017 isobutyric acid vassilev et al 2018b caproic acid jourdin et al 2018 vassilev et al 2018b 2 oxobutyrate nevin et al 2010 ethanol bajracharya et al 2016 isopropanol arends et al 2017 butanol zaybak et al 2013 isobutanol vassilev et al 2018b and hexanol vassilev et al 2018b the production of these compounds is generally associated with acetic acid production and the production rates are generally much lower than those observed in acetic acid production regardless of the variations in reactors organisms working potentials etc fig 5 a summarizes the production rates for formic acid 0 0004 0 7 g l 1 d 1 propionic acid 0 0004 0 03 g l 1 d 1 butyric acid isobutyric acid 0 0008 3 2 g l 1 d 1 caproic acid 0 95 1 41 g l 1 d 1 2 oxobutyrate 0 0003 0 002 g l 1 d 1 ethanol 0 0001 0 18 g l 1 d 1 isopropanol 0 16 g l 1 d 1 and butanol isobutanol 0 005 0 1 g l 1 d 1 and hexanol 0 3 g l 1 d 1 in addition some of these compounds such as formic acid and ethanol were not stable and only presented as intermediate species rather than the final products the coulombic efficiency of these mixed culture systems ranged from 3 to 82 with most studies showing efficiencies around 40 60 fig 5b possibly caused by the combination of different metabolic pathways in the mixed cultures interesting development was made recently to use sequential reactions of acetogenesis solventogenesis and reverse β oxidation to produce alcohols and medium chain fatty acids mcfas srikanth et al 2018 vassilev et al 2018b as well as for product upgrade by using mixed culture systems to firstly generate acetate from co2 which was then followed by utilizing acetate for the production of polyhydroxybutyrate phb pepè sciarria et al 2018 or alkyl esters lehtinen et al 2017 metabolic engineering and synthetic biology tools have showed good promise in expanding the product spectrum of pure culture based mes krieg et al 2018 recent studies have promoted the electrical biological li et al 2012 tashiro et al 2018 or enzyme assisted hybrid system chen et al 2018 to take advantage of the high performance of the electrolytic co2 reduction into c1 compounds mostly formic acid as well as the high selectivity of engineered bacteria to convert c1 compounds to higher valued products in addition to co2 reduction organic chemicals with short carbon chains such as volatile fatty acids vfas have been feeding into mes to generate the corresponding alcohols and also mcfa via a chain elongation process reddy et al 2018 for example using an electrode with a poised potential of 0 55 v acetate was reduced to ethanol by mixed culture of bacteria using methyl viologen mv as a mediator steinbusch et al 2010 other studies reported that mixed culture such as sulfate reducing bacteria srb could also reduce acetic and butyric acids to alcohols ethanol butanol methanol and propanol and acetone in mes without the addition of artificial mediators kondaveeti and min 2015 sharma et al 2013 2014 using the solid electrode as the electron donor with a working potential caproic acid butyric acid and caprylic acid were produced from acetic acid likely through the h2 route of inward eet raes et al 2017 van eerten jansen et al 2013a 3 4 co2 valorization potential from the mes platform though no pilot or full scale mes study has been reported to date lab scale studies provide enough data to conduct a preliminary analysis on the potential of the mes platform for co2 valorization to organic chemicals fig 6 a b shows the values of the different products that were reported in the literature as well as their respective market size it can be seen that methane has low unit and overall value due to its low production rate in mes but it does have a large market size worldwide similarly acetate may not be an ideal product either due to low unit price but it also has a large market size 10 mton and can be used as a precursor for the synthesis of higher valued chemicals products including formate propionate butyrate and ethanol have slightly higher unit values with the market size ranging from 100 kton to mton per year but their overall economic potentials in mes are currently limited due to the low product rates however they do carry good economic potentials if technological breakthroughs are made to significantly improve system performance a recently published review indicated that there are economic challenges using other alternative routes to produce organic chemicals with only 1 2 carbon atoms which could be easily produced from conventional industrial methods with costs 1 usd kg 1 weekes et al 2018 one promising product is 2 oxobutyrate which has a much higher unit price compared with other chemicals and it can be produced at a relatively higher rate in mes with a sizable world market fig 6a b fig 6c d shows the co2 capture and utilization potential of mes when generating different products it is based on the moles of co2 converted to unit mole of product as well as the maximum production rate of the product in mes reported in the literature compounds with a higher carbon number have a higher conversion ratio on a molar basis but the overall co2 conversion potential largely depends on the chemical production rate and world market size it can be seen that acetate 9988 kg m 3 year 1 has a much higher market potential than other chemicals from 11 to 244 kg m 3 year 1 due to a good combination of carbon number and conversion rate fig 6c the world market size in terms of valorized co2 is primarily associated with ch4 due to the abundance of natural gas fig 6d such quantifications not only provide insights on the product portfolio for increased economic value it also helps us evaluate the co2 capture potential that may lead to additional carbon credit 4 organic waste valorization by ef electro fermentation also uses electrochemistry to influence microbial metabolism but its main purpose is to regulate fermentation pathways to valorize organic waste materials such as municipal and agriculture waste into value added products solid electrodes are inserted in fermentation reactors and serve as inexhaustible electron donors or acceptors and the externally poised potential can regulate pure culture fermentation pathways or that of mixed culture communities schievano et al 2016 for environmental systems the reactions are generally performed via syntrophic interactions between electroactive bacteria and the fermentation bacteria moscoviz et al 2016 the extracellular electron transfer in ef can be either outward for anodic ef or inward for cathodic ef and both processes can influence the fermentation by regulating the orp and the nad nadh ratio moscoviz et al 2016 in addition the anodic electron sinks are expected to drive more atp synthesis by creating a proton gradient while the cathodic electron soures are expected to have impacts on the production of more reduced redox cofactors e g nadph kracke and krömer 2014 in this regard both anodic and cathodic efs could improve fermentration performance which was exemplified by a recent study using lysine producing corynebacterium glutamicum xafenias et al 2017 in traditional organic waste fermentation process a wide variety of commodity chemicals can be produced such as lower alcohols e g ethanol propanol and butanol hydrocarbons e g butadiene isobutene isoprene sesquiterpene andβ farnesene diols e g 1 2 propane diol 1 2 pdo 1 3 propane diol 1 3 pdo 2 3 butane diol 2 3 bdo and 1 4 butane diol 1 4 bdo carboxylic acids lactic acid citric acid succinic acid amino acids aspartate lysine threonine methionine and isoleucine and biopolymers i e polyhydroxyalkanoates and bacterial cellulose sheldon 2014 in the context of ef the number of studies is limited but a variety of chemicals have been generated under the influence of electrical potentials fig 7 4 1 organic waste valorization via anodic ef fig 7a summarizes the anodic ef studies that used electrodes as an electron sink to improve product selectivity and production rate while substrates inocula and products vary significantly these studies did confirm that a variety of chemicals including h2 ethanol acetoin lysine poly β hydroxybutyrate phb and 2 keto gluconate could be produced under different potentials most of which with higher rates than open circuit controls anodic ef was used to stimulate h2 production which can be regarded as a hybrid system of fermentation and microbial electrolysis h2 is commonly generated from both dark fermentations of organics and electrolysis of water under electric potential in such ef process acidogens produce h2 and vfas during fermentation while electroactive bacteria can utilize vfas for current generation and in turn enhance fermentation nikhil et al 2015 further studies reported that h2 production was influenced by the anode potential and the concentration of the autocrine mediators while a decrease in ph drop caused by vfa accumulation led to drop in performance chandrasekhar et al 2015 hydrogen however can be consumed by electroactive bacteria such as g sulfurreducens or methanogens and efforts have been made to minimize such loss by using chemical inhibitors or operational controls genetic modification of electroactive bacteria has also been investigated to prevent h2 consumption while improving vfa oxidation awate et al 2017 enhanced ethanol production from glycerol has been studied in anodic efs engineered bacterial strains were mainly used in this effort for example an engineered shewanella oneidensis strain was used to realize the conversion by using the electrode as an electron acceptor so the excess electrons could be removed flynn et al 2010 another study reported that an engineered escherichia coli strain with new respiratory chains consisting of 3 cytochromes cyma mtra and stc produced more oxidized products ethanol and acetic acid from glycerol sturm richter et al 2015 using a co culture of geobacter sulfurreducens and clostridium cellobioparum synergistic relationships could be formed with the fermenter to convert glycerol into ethanol while geobacter removed the fermentative byproducts speers et al 2014 genetically modified proteobacterium s oneidensis was used in anodic ef to produce high yield acetoin from lactate with the deletion of λ prophage acetate kinase and phosphotransacetylase genes while expression of codon optimized acetolactate synthase and acetolactate decarboxylase the mutant was able to achieve up to 86 of the theoretical maximum acetoin from lactate bursac et al 2017 this expands the substrates that can be used by s oneidensis another study used an e coli mutant with the insertion of c type cytochromes from s oneidensis and it imporved acetoin yield to 79 of the theoretical maximum from glucose by using methylene blue as the electron mediator forster et al 2017 it was also found that ralstonia eutropha could produce 60 more phbs under a working potential of 0 6 v with added mediator compared with the control nishio et al 2014 in summary the application of anodic ef could turn traditional aerobic fermentation with the oxygen as the final electron accepter into an anaerobic fermentation process to decrease the substrate lose in addition anodic ef holds the advantage of increased biomass loading than that of cathodic ef vassilev et al 2018a because the low electrode potential in cathodic ef inevitably restrict energy gaining moreover the use of anodic ef for regulatory central flux control in fermentative bacteria was found to increase yield vassilev et al 2018a 4 2 organic waste valorization via cathodic ef different from anodic ef cathodic ef uses the electrode as an electron source and reducing power to regulate product selectivity and production rate shanthi sravan et al 2018 villano et al 2017 xue et al 2017 in this case organic compounds such as butanol acetate lactate butyrate 1 3 pdo lysine and polyhydroxyalkanoates pha have been produced fig 7b studies have demonstrated that by using the electrons directly supplied by the electrode nadh formation could be altered in clostridium tyrobutyricum bas 7 and butyric acid or butanol production from sucrose was stimulated choi et al 2012 similarly such regulation triggered a metabolic shift in clostridium pasteurianum toward nadh consuming production of butanol from glucose choi et al 2014 khosravanipour mostafazadeh et al 2016 cathode ef has also been used to stimulate 1 3 propandiol 1 3 pdo production with a working potential of 0 045 v a metabolic shift from glycerol to the production of the nadh consuming metabolite 1 3 pdo was observed in clostridium pasteurianum choi et al 2014 recently much effort was focused on the use of mixed cultures for 1 3 pdo production from glycerol in electro fermentation zhou et al 2013 and the working potential was found to significantly influence the microbial community on the biocathode for instance by changing the starting working potential from 0 8 v to 1 1 v the dominant community shifted from veillonellaceae 56 72 to clostridiaceae 55 57 which was accompanied by a product shift from propionate to 1 3 pdo xafenias et al 2015 in addition another study found that after long term operation 150 days the yield of 1 3 pdo decreased by 77 2 which was believed to be due to the loss of the dominant citrobacter spp on the biocathode zhou et al 2015 these studies indicate that metabolite profiles of glycerol ef was directly associated with the changes of a functional community which has broader implications for other substrates as well dennis et al 2013 the cathodic ef has also been used to generate biopolymers such pha from sugars by providing a microaerophilic microenvironment with continuous supply of electrons a mixed culture was shown to accumulate pha as high as 19 of dry cell weight in a cathodic ef srikanth et al 2012 mediators were shown to boost performance in some ef studies when anthraquinone 2 6 disulfonate was added the yield of lactic acid from glucose was increased by 47 3 when corynebacterium glutamicum was grown with an electrode poised at 0 4 v sasaki et al 2014 similarly lactic acid production was increased by 15 when neutral red was added in an ef which was believed to reduce the menaquinone in the inner membrane of e coli and altered the redox state of the arcb sensor protein harrington et al 2015b the effects of the mediator were highly dependent on the microorganisms and also the redox conditions in efs for instance neutral red addition stimulated e coli and klebsiella pneumoniae to produce more ethanol or lactic acid compared with the control but the addition of the mediator did not influence the metabolism of zymomonas mobilis harrington et al 2015a the cathodic ef provides a new approach to regulate fermentation pathways by providing an alternative reducing power to reduce orp and inhibition caused by the accumulation of vfa h2s and other compounds de vrieze et al 2018 this method overcomes some major barriers faced by previous direct h2 injection which is limited by thermodynamic barrier caused by h2 partial pressure and low solubility omar et al 2018 such impacts can be augmented by increasing the surface area and structure of the electrodes so more microbial interactions with the electrodes can be facilitated martins et al 2018 recent findings on direct interspecies electron transfer diet via conductive solid materials such as iron oxide minerals granular activated carbon and conductive biochar greatly enhanced understanding and technology development of anaerobic digestion huggins et al 2016 lovley 2017 martins et al 2018 and the influence of redox potential in ef brings a new opportunity to advance diet process in anaerobic reactors especially for the majority of microorganisms that only carry week electroactive activities doyle and marsili 2018 liu et al 2017 5 future perspectives microbial electrochemical platforms hold great promise for the valorization of co2 and waste organic carbon this review discusses the two major processes for such a purpose and demonstrates their technological feasibility and economic potential while different products have been demonstrated and lab scale systems have been developed there are still major breakthroughs before large scale demonstrations can be deployed challenges remain with regards to identifying and producing high quality products developing high performing reactors revealing electron transfer mechanisms and reducing cost to put this into perspective and stimulate more interest and research we think the following areas will require more investigation 5 1 what to produce and not to produce since the main products from mes are still dominated by 1 2 carbon products such as methane and acetic acid compounds with longer carbon chains and higher value are receiving more research attention in recent years though with limited success this is mainly because of the limited availability of biocatalysts that can concurrently utilize external electrons and inorganic co2 for cell synthesis to overcome such barriers synthetic biology tools will be needed to rationally design metabolic pathways for inward eet and establish a better catalytic interface between the electrode and cells liao et al 2016 in particular metabolic engineering tools can be used to manipulate the most well connected node i e acetyl coa as the building block for chain elongation and product regulation studies suggested that two stage conversion may bring flexibility and higher efficiency than a single step process jiang and zeng 2018 mes carries an advantage in producing higher purity c2 products but fermentation based carboxylate platform can enable chain elongation to produce medium chain carboxylate c6 c8 angenent et al 2018 it thus will be interesting to explore an integrated mes ef system to produce carboxylate from co2 it is also very important to perform technoeconomic and life cycle analyses on the different production approaches so that system development can be guided and critically evaluated shemfe et al 2018 5 2 the need of genetic engineering studies showed the potential of using heterotrophic electroactive bacteria such as geobacter and shewanella for chemical production are restricted because most of them have limited capability of carbon fixation rabaey and rozendal 2010 soussan et al 2013 on the other hand few autotrophs that are known for carbon fixation have also demonstrated eet capability therefore to couple these metabolisms genetic tools are needed to either transfer extracellular electron transfer pathways to known co2 fixers or integrate co2 fixation pathways into the electroactive microorganisms kracke et al 2018 however the practical application of using genetic modification to integrate eet and substrate metabolism is restricted by the unresolved inward eet mechanism as well as the lack of molecular tools for using electroactive microbes as genetic hosts nealson and rowe 2016 it is also worth noting that many autotrophs can use h2 as the reducing power very efficiently therefore for engineering applications indirect inward electron transfer may be realized with h2 or other mediators rather than focusing on direct electron uptake so far the use of metabolic engineering for organic chemicals production in geobacter species have yet not been reported however the engineered s oneidensis for production of chemicals such as butanol la et al 2017 and acetoin bursac et al 2017 with increased producing rate by modified electrode have been reported recent reviews discussed the synthetic biology strategies for engineering electroactive microbes kracke et al 2018 li et al 2018a 5 3 the need of microbial community optimization for the treatment and valorization of wet organic wastes mixed culture reactor systems are generally needed due to the high heterogeneity of the feedstock and difficulty of sterilization for co2 conversion pure culture systems may be used but co culture or mixed culture reactors will likely be more common and resilient than single culture operations mixed culture contains a variety of microorganisms that form collaborative ecological network for waste treatment and product generation and the community structure evolves depending on the substrate and the operational conditions recently findings on in interspecies electron transfer lead to more insights on these syntrophic relationships while many mes and ef studies focused on pure cultures more studies are needed to understand the syntrophy between different members of the community decipher conversion metabolisms and develop reactor and operation strategies to select and maintain high performing microbial communities for targeted product conversion marshall et al 2017 5 4 understand the mechanisms of inward extracellular electron transfer the mechanisms of inward eet at the cathode are still under debate while some studies proposed that direct extracellular electron transfer via nanowires and cytochromes are primary mechanisms for certain bacteria others showed evidence that electron shuttles such as in situ generated h2 or other small molecules such as formate and flavin play critical roles and the exact mechanisms are largely influenced by the cathode working potential and species of microbes there still is a lack of quantitative physiological evidence regarding microbial metabolisms in response to electrochemical environments a central area of research to be expected in the near future compared with mes the inward eet in ef has yet been investigated in detail though similar mechanisms are expected it is also hypothesized that the direct eet may be restricted in efs due to the lack of efficient eet routes by known fermentative bacteria recent studies showed that cell growth and gene expression of electroactive bacteria shewanella oneidensis mr 1 and fermentative bacteria escherichia coli can be regulated by electrode potentials hirose et al 2018 tschirhart et al 2017 advanced analytical methods will help advance the understanding of the cell electrode interface one example is by using transient absorption spectroscopy charge transfer between semiconductor nanoparticles and purified h2ases was revealed sakimoto et al 2018 5 5 how to increase production yield and rate a recent study reported that the total capital and operational costs of mes for acetic acid production is about 5 4 12 6 times of methanol carbonylation or direct ethane oxidation which is mainly due to the low production rates 100 t y 1 compared with 200 kt y 1 christodoulou and velasquez orta 2016 to make mes or ef more efficient and competitive in large scale applications the production rate needs to be significantly increased via the optimization of microbial biocatalysts materials and reactor configuration and operation aryal et al 2017 gildemyn et al 2017 huggins et al 2015 katuri et al 2018 to date the largest mes or ef reactors reported are still in liter scale while relatively high current density as high as 200 a m 2 is required in mess jourdin et al 2016 the reactor scale ups can be tested using stack systems or fluidized beds to increase production efficiency tejedor sanz et al 2018 the scale up experience for fermentation reactors and mfc reactors can be good references and there have been excellent reviews discussing the approaches and possibilities liang et al 2018 santoro et al 2017 wu et al 2016 5 6 better selection and separation maximizing the titer of targeted chemicals requires efficient collection and separation of the products from the media broth while limited mes and ef studies have focused on this aspect effective product separation is a key factor determining the viability of the technology product separation can be based on chemical differences in size volatility charge and other properties and popular separation methods include membrane filtration electrodialysis pervaporation as well as phase separation and other approaches recently liquid membrane extraction pepè sciarria et al 2018 electrodialysis gildemyn et al 2015 and ion exchange resin bajracharya et al 2017b were applied to increase product titer and purity in addition external supply of h2 was used in separation and obtained a high titer of 37 0 g l 1 acetate via improved balance of charge and electron transfers verbeeck et al 2018 one other issue related to product separation is the need for methanogenesis inhibition while ch4 is the common product of anaerobic processes it is not an ideal product due to its low value and strong greenhouse gas effect methanogenesis can be inhibited by chemical inhibitors ultraviolet irradiation temperature shock and other approaches but they all face different challenges lu and ren 2016 the concept of arrested methanogenesis can be interesting as it uses redox potential or other methods to inhibit methanogenesis without using chemical or high energy and it can produce valued added chemicals and bioproduct precursors using a shorter stable and known pathway jiang et al 2018 mahmoud et al 2017 6 conclusions microbial electrosynthesis and electro fermentation based microbial electrochemical technology platform carries good potentials to convert co2 and organic waste into value added chemicals

19126,carbon rich waste materials solid liquid or gaseous are largely considered to be a burden on society due to the large capital and energy costs for their treatment and disposal however solid and liquid organic wastes have inherent energy and value and similar as waste co2 gas they can be reused to produce value added chemicals and materials there has been a paradigm shift towards developing a closed loop biorefinery approach for the valorization of these wastes into value added products and such an approach enables a more carbon efficient and circular economy this review quantitatively analyzes the state of the art of the emerging microbial electrochemical technology met platform and provides critical perspectives on research advancement and technology development the review offers side by side comparison between microbial electrosynthesis mes and electro fermentation ef processes in terms of principles key performance metrics data analysis and microorganisms the study also summarizes all the processes and products that have been developed using mes and ef to date for organic waste and co2 valorization it finally identifies the technological and economic potentials and challenges on future system development graphical abstract image 1 keywords microbial electrochemical technology bioelectrochemical system carbon valorization microbial electrosynthesis electro fermentation 1 introduction traditonally waste has been considered a societal burden and its treatment and disposal requires large amounts of land energy and capital every year nearly 35 5 gigatonnes gt of anthropogenic co2 are emitted to the atmosphere which is believed to be the main cause of climate change mac dowell et al 2017 in addition approximately 1000 km3 municipal wastewater and 2 01 gt municipal solid waste are released globally which pose serious environmental and public health concerns especially in developing countries kaza 2018 wwap 2017 considering these carbon rich waste materials solid liquid and gaseous have inherent energy that can be reused to produce value added products a paradigm shift is underway towards developing a closed loop apporach for the valorization of these wastes by converting them into biomaterials biochemicals and biofuels this waste biorefinery approach holds the potential to further transform the waste treatment industry into a resource recovery business thereby generating marketable products enhancing process economics and environmental sustainability and enabling a more carbon efficient and circular economy a recent report published by the us department of energy doe bioenergy technology office beto estimated that 50 million dry tons of combined primary organic waste streams sludge biosolids animal manure food waste and fats oils and greases are available every year for conversion to biofuels bioproducts or biopower in addition gaseous waste streams possess an additional 734 trillion btu tbtu bringing the total energy potential of these waste feedstocks to nearly 2 6 quadrillion btu doe 2017 different technologies and processes have been developed to convert waste carbon materials including those in the solid liquid or gaseous forms into value added products the platforms may include thermochemical biochemical photochemical and electrochemical approaches and each approach has its advantages and challenges doe 2017 a microbial electrochemical technology met platform is a hybrid approach that uses electroactive microorganisms to catalyze bioelectrochemical reactions to convert waste carbon materials into bioenergy and bioproducts hou et al 2017 zou and he 2018 this unique platform is capable of separating oxidation and reduction reactions for the first time in ambient environmental conditions as the electrodes can be used to serve as either the anode electron acceptor or the cathode electron donor jiang and zeng 2019 pandey et al 2016 wang and ren 2013 in 2009 cheng et al presented an early met process to valorize waste carbon into methane by using an abiotic anode and a biocathode acclimated with methanobacterium palustre cheng et al 2009 which was called electromethanogenesis the term microbial electrosynthesis or mes was firstly introduced in 2010 by nevin et al in their study of using sporomusa ovata to accept electrons from a cathode and reduce co2 into acetic acid they defined mes as the reduction of carbon dioxide to multicarbon compounds with electrons donated from an electrode as the electron donor nevin et al 2010 soon after a comprehensive review published by rabaey and rozendal discussed very thoroughly the principles challenges and opportunities of mes in that review they also introduced electro fermentation ef as an electrochemical process to control fermentation pathways using electrical current rabaey and rozendal 2010 the application of electric current to fermentation can be traced back to a study published in 1940 in which the electric current was proved to reduce the process time and improve the brew and taste of tea during a two year fermentation study lominadze 1940 the use of mes and ef for organic waste or co2 valorization carries great potential as these processes can capture electrons from solar wind biomass or renewable sources and store the energy by forming covalent chemical bonds there have been excellent reviews on the working principles and microbial electron transfer mechanisms bajracharya et al 2017a geppert et al 2016 may et al 2016 tremblay et al 2017 the logical data representation and frameworks patil et al 2015b economic feasibility of mes christodoulou and velasquez orta 2016 shemfe et al 2018 and the principles and industrial potentials of ef moscoviz et al 2016 schievano et al 2016 but there has been no quantitative review that summarizes the state of the art of met for organic chemicals production and explains side by side the principles key performance metrics data analysis and microorganisms this article aims to provide the first complete review that summarizes and discusses all the processes and products that have been developed using the mes and ef platform to date for organic waste and co2 valorization and it identifies the challenges and potentials on future system development the review provides quantitative analyses of mes and ef studies based on different parameters including production rates coulombic efficiency current density electrode potential as well as economic potentials and environmental impacts 2 the two major microbial electrochemical processes mes and ef for co2 and organic waste valorization both mes and ef use electrochemical mechanisms to influence microbial metabolic activities and produce targeted bioproducts so in principle they both belong to the broad met platform early studies tended to include ef in the broad concept of mes rabaey et al 2011 rabaey and rozendal 2010 however recent studies separated ef out as it carries unique properties with regards to reaction principles and operational specificities which are different from the traditional definition of mes moscoviz et al 2016 schievano et al 2016 fig 1 illustrates the principles of mes and ef and table 1 summarizes the similarities and differences between the two processes a typical mes process leverages autotrophic microorganisms using a solid electrode cathode as the electron donor and soluble co2 as the electron acceptor for organic compound synthesis the electrode serves as the reducing power even though the exact electron transfer mechanisms can be direct or mediated by h2 or other redox agents some electroactive microbes such as geobacter and clostridium have been hypothesized to be capable of direct electron transfer det during which the cells produce conductive nanowires and or c type cytochromes to directly acquire electrons from the electrode at certain redox potentials lovley and nevin 2011 under most conditions electron shuttles such as in situ generated h2 or other small molecules such as formate and flavin are believed to play important roles as electron transfer mediators and the exact mechanisms are largely influenced by the cathode working potential blanchet et al 2015 deutzmann et al 2015 compared with mes that features electrons exchange between electrodes and microbial cells electro fermentation intends to stimulate microbial metabolism via electrochemical modification of the intracellular redox state and therefore doesn t prefer direct contact the electric current supplied by the electrodes in ef is not the sole source of electrons rather it influences the flux of the self driven fermentation by regulating the oxidation reduction potential orp and the nad nadh ratio moscoviz et al 2016 similar to ph as a measure of proton activity the extracellular orp corresponds to the activity of the electrons present in the electrolyte and influences the nad nadh ratio within cells the nad nadh ratio represents intracellular orp because of intracellular redox homeostasis which controls gene expression and enzyme synthesis for overall metabolic activity therefore it is reasonable to hypothesize that by regulating the redox potential in the reactor fermentation pathways can be influenced and the product spectrum can be changed because ef provides an effective method to consume or supply electrons during microbial fermentation the electro fermentation process can be divided into anodic ef and cathodic ef in an anodic ef the solid electrode serves as an electron acceptor so microorganisms can deliver electrons to the anode during organic degradation with an ef cathode the working electrode serves as an electron donor which can be used by microbes to synthesize different products depending on the redox potential the electron transfer between the electrodes and microbes can be bidirectional and extracellular electron transfer mechanisms including det and mediated electron transfer similar as suggested for mes processes were proposed however syntrophic interactions between fermentative bacteria and electroactive bacteria were found to dominate and played essential roles in ef reactors mainly because of the degradation of complex polymeric organic substrates moscoviz et al 2017 the ef process is an electrochemically influenced spontaneous fermentation so the current density in ef 0 001 10 a m 2 moscoviz et al 2018 sturm richter et al 2015 zhou et al 2015 is generally smaller than the current measured in mess 0 01 200 a m 2 jourdin et al 2016 nevin et al 2011 zhang et al 2013 for instance a cathodic ef study reported that only 0 2 of the cathodic electron inputs were used for butanol production while 99 8 of the electrons were originated from the glucose substrate choi et al 2014 in contract most mess solely depend on the reducing power provided by the electrode so their reactions are not spontaneous without the external driving force bajracharya et al 2017a may et al 2016 a useful parameter to differentiate mes and ef is called the ef coefficient eq 1 which is used to calculate the contribution of charge transferred across the external circuit to the total charge in the end products moscoviz et al 2016 by this calculation the value of the ef coefficient in ef ranges between 0 and 1 choi et al 2014 since a fraction of the charges are also from the substrates in contrast the coefficient of mes is 1 due to the fact that the electrode is used as the only source of reducing power 1 η e f i d t n product n product f for eq 2 where η ef is the ef efficiency i is the electric current t is the operation time n product is moles of product and f is the faraday constant n product is determined by the molecular formula of product which can be calculated as eq 2 2 n product c w n x o y h z 4 w 3 x 2 y z 3 carbon dioxide valorization using mes the utilization of co2 as a renewable carbon feedstock for products not only takes advantage of this low cost and abundant carbon resource and generates economic values it also actively mitigates carbon emissions with tremendous environmental and societal benefits there are multiple options for co2 capture and utilization including photochemical biochemical electrochemical and thermochemical pathways and each of them has advantages and challenges qiao et al 2014 to utilize co2 as a feedstock concentrated or atmospheric co2 source needs to be firstly captured and solubilized for subsequent reduction reactions either via biotic or abiotic process microbial electrosynthesis is a novel hybrid of bio and electrochemical approaches to utilize microbial cells to convert dissolved co2 into value added organic compounds especially those with multiple carbons that are precursors for desirable value added chemicals or liquid transportation fuels li et al 2018b the unique advantage of mes for co2 valorization lies in the utilization of electrons as the reducing power which can be generated from natural gas biogas or solar and wind sources even though the supply of these electron sources can be intermittent del pilar anzola rojas et al 2018 because microbes may harvest solar energy in a 100 fold higher efficiency than biomass based chemical production claassens et al 2016 zhang 2015 mes may help address the pressing problems of renewable energy storage and distribution many microorganisms can fix co2 and there are 6 known fixation pathways found in bacteria and archaea saini et al 2011 among these autotrophic microorganisms methanogens and acetogens have been utilized in mes as pure cultures or enriched in mixed cultures in this section we quantitatively summarized and analyzed how mes has been used for co2 utilization what products were generated and how did systems perform under different conditions in addition economic and environmental impacts of mes for carbon dioxide valorization are analyzed and discussed 3 1 co2 conversion into ch4 by mes methane is the intend product of power to gas p2g process for renewable electricity conversion and storage and methanogens can readily utilize the h2 formate or acetate to produce ch4 jiang et al 2014 lu and ren 2016 methane can be produced electrochemically at 0 24 v vs she under biological relevant conditions ph 7 and 25 c eq 3 which is more positive than that of other common organic chemicals such as acetate butyrate or ethanol so ch4 is the most thermodynamically favorable product of co2 reduction lü et al 2018 practically more negative working potentials were applied to overcome overpotential loss and improve production rate geppert et al 2016 all working potentials reported in this review are normalized to the standard hydrogen electrode she 3 co 2 8 h 8 e ch 4 2 h 2 o e cat 0 24 v vs she the first proof of concept study on electromethanogenesis was reported by using a two chamber reactor with an abiotic anode and biotic cathode methanobacterium palustre was found to utilize the electrons from the cathode to reduce co2 into ch4 cheng et al 2009 marshall et al enriched an mes biocathode using brewery wastewater sludge the ch4 producing microbiome consisted of 93 methanobacterium and 5 methanobrevibacte marshall et al 2012 another study enriched a ch4 producing biocathode from anaerobic sludge with the archaeal phylotypes mostly related to methanobacterium palustre and methanobacterium aarhusense van eerten jansen et al 2013b pure culture methanococcus maripaludis was also tested in electromethanogenesis but it could only produce ch4 at a much lower potential 0 6 v beese vasbender et al 2014 later studies identified that rather than directly using the electrode m maripaludis primarily used h2 formic acid and self secreted compounds to mediate co2 reduction deutzmann et al 2015 lohner et al 2014 fig 2 summarizes the key performance of mes reactors on ch4 production reported to date when normalized to the projected cathode area the ch4 production rate ranged from 0 005 to 9 78 l m 2 d 1 beese vasbender et al 2014 villano et al 2010 when normalized to the cathode chamber volume the production rates were between 0 02 and 295 8 l m 3 d 1 beese vasbender et al 2014 van eerten jansen et al 2013b methane generation was observed under a cathode potential as high as 0 28 v beese vasbender et al 2014 which is close to the theoretical potential of 0 24 v eq 3 mixed culture systems showed much higher performance than pure culture reactors by all measures production rate current density and coulombic efficiency and the production rate can differ by as much as two orders of magnitudes this is likely associated with the synergistic interactions as well as the higher flexibility in inward extracellular electron transfer conducted by the mixed community one study showed that when switching from mixed culture system to pure culture of m palustre atcc baa 1077 ch4 production rate decreased by an order of magnitude from 4 9 to 0 3 l m 2 d 1 which was also accompanied by a sharp decrease in current density cheng et al 2009 electromethanogenesis reactors have shown long term stability for up to a year and have been operated at pilot scale schlager et al 2017 but the production rate is still poor when compared with traditional anaerobic digestion ad this low rate is understandable because methanogens in mes are autolithotrophs that uses co2 as the carbon source and electron acceptor and their main electron source is the cathode such metabolism is slow and energy expensive i e the energy available per reaction δg is low a recent study comparing ch4 generation with different substrates discovered that the production rate with dual electron donors acetic acid and electrode was about 5 times higher than when a single electron donor electrode only was supplied fu et al 2015 3 2 co2 conversion into acetic acid by mes acetic acid is another major product of co2 reduction in mes and this has been observed in reactors with pure or mixed acetogenic cultures may et al 2016 acetic acid can be produced electrochemically under biologically relevant conditions at 0 28 v eq 4 which is slightly lower than the methane generation potential 0 24 v rabaey and rozendal 2010 4 2 hco 3 9 h 8 e ch 3 coo 4 h 2 o e cat 0 28 v vs she practically more negative working potentials were applied to overcome the overpotential loss and improve production rate nevin et al firstly reported that six acetogenic microorganisms sporomusa ovata sporomusa sphaeriodes sporomusa silvacetica clostridium ljungdahlii clostridium aceticum and moorella thermoacetica showed electrosynthesis capability with acetic acid production from co2 at 0 4 v the potential was above the h2 evolution value using unpolished graphite as the cathode which was measured by an earlier study to be 0 6 v with an overpotential of 0 2 v so the authors assumed that the microbes used the electrode as the electron donor nevin et al 2010 2011 interestingly the acetogen acetobacterium woodii was unable to consume the electrons under similar conditions nevin et al 2011 which was presumably due to its lack of cytochromes or quinones for energy conservation and the use of na dependent atpase for energy conservation however it was enriched on a mixed culture biocathode poised at a potential low enough for h2 evolution su et al 2013 fig 3 summarizes the key performance of mes reactors on acetic acid production using either pure or mixed cultures the production rates of acetic acid ranges from 0 02 to 685 g m 2 d 1 when normalized by cathode surface area jourdin et al 2015 yu et al 2017 or 0 0015 18 72 g l 1 d 1 when normalized by cathode liquid volume labelle et al 2014 labelle and may 2017 nevin et al 2011 while most mes studies reported acetate production below 1 g l 1 d 1 studies found that a graphite granule packed bed cathode could obtain high area to volume ratio and achieved 3 1 g l 1 d 1 in production rate labelle et al 2014 in addition a recently study used galvanostatic control to overcome the reducing power limitation and obtained a high production rate of 18 72 g l 1 d 1 in which some of the acetate was believed to be produced by planktonic cells labelle and may 2017 negative cathode potential led to the increased acetic acid production rate fig 3a and current density fig 3c acetic acid was observed to accumulate when the cathode potential dropped to 0 3 v at a high temperature of 60 c faraghiparapari and zengler 2017 it is also worth noting that fig 3 reveals higher production rate and current density were reported in mixed culture than pure culture within each cathode potential this is likely attributed to the syntrophic interactions among different communities blanchet et al 2015 deutzmann and spormann 2017 however mixed culture reactors also showed larger fluctuations in ce from near 0 to almost 100 with low efficiency generally associated with re consumption by methanogenesis jiang et al 2013 saheb alam et al 2018 the lack of reducing force to trigger hydrogen mediated electron consumption at a more positive potential blanchet et al 2015 and the absence of biofilm development on inefficient cathode material recent efforts focused on investigating new electrode materials bian et al 2018 optimizing operating conditions patil et al 2015a and designing new reactor configurations gildemyn et al 2015 labelle and may 2017 for improved performance for example different cathode materials including nonporous bulk electrode e g graphite plate or graphite stick fiber based porous monolithic porous electrodes e g reticulated vitreous carbon rvc and packed bed electrode e g graphite granule have all been tested in mes reactors xie et al 2015 the accumulated titer of acetic acid has increased from 0 015 to 13 5 g l 1 gildemyn et al 2015 nevin et al 2011 and higher titer is expected after mes optimization as up to 44 g l 1 of acetic acid was reported when acetobacterium woodi was grown with h2 and co2 in a batch operated stirred tank bioreactor str demler and weuster botz 2011 while some studies suggested that co2 was reduced by electroactive bacteria using the electrons directly provided by the cathode the role of h2 in mes co2 reduction needs to be further investigated as many studies did not specify the actual working potential or lacked precise h2 monitoring method it is likely that h2 played an important role as a reducing power but it may be only present in trace amount and consumed quickly by microbes similar as interspecies h2 transfer h2 evolution was largely influenced by the changes of ph temperature and h2 partial pressure and a recent study reported that h2 evolution potential fluctuated from 0 06 v to 0 47 v when ph changed from 5 to 8 and h2 partial pressure varied from 10 nbar to 1 bar may et al 2016 in fact many mes reactors were not consistently operated at the standard conditions ph 7 25 c and 1 bar corresponding to 0 42 v for h2 evolution or with precise h2 detection plus the actual working potential generally deviates from the setting value due to the internal resistance drop especially when 3 d porous materials high current densities were used madjarov et al 2017 3 3 co2 conversion into other organic compounds by mes in addition to ch4 and acetic acid other organic compounds are also produced in mess mostly as mixed products it is believed that acetyl coenzyme a acetyl coa served as a key intermediate for different synthetic pathways may et al 2016 and fig 4 shows the potential pathways that lead to the generation of different organic compounds depending on microbial catalysts and operating conditions arends et al 2017 mohan et al 2016 lu et al 2016 it should be noted that the producion of organic compounds with more than one carbon atom is largely restricted by the increased kinetically challenging of proton coupled electron transfer pcet reactions and thus the formation of multiple c c bonds is not favorable weekes et al 2018 in addition a model based on stoichiometric and energetic analyses has pointed out that the producing of acetic acid in wood ljungdahl pathway is directly linked with the regeneration of atp and thus it helps to explain why the production of other organic compounds in mes is unfavorable fast and papoutsakis 2012 while recent studies are just starting to explore the opportunities of generating higher value organic compounds from co2 using the mes platform the potential can be high considering the versatility of microbial metabolisms and the abundance of renewable electrons and co2 various organic compounds have been produced in mes from co2 reduction including formic acid nevin et al 2011 propionic acid modestra and mohan 2017 zaybak et al 2013 butyric acid bajracharya et al 2016 ganigue et al 2015 modestra and mohan 2017 isobutyric acid vassilev et al 2018b caproic acid jourdin et al 2018 vassilev et al 2018b 2 oxobutyrate nevin et al 2010 ethanol bajracharya et al 2016 isopropanol arends et al 2017 butanol zaybak et al 2013 isobutanol vassilev et al 2018b and hexanol vassilev et al 2018b the production of these compounds is generally associated with acetic acid production and the production rates are generally much lower than those observed in acetic acid production regardless of the variations in reactors organisms working potentials etc fig 5 a summarizes the production rates for formic acid 0 0004 0 7 g l 1 d 1 propionic acid 0 0004 0 03 g l 1 d 1 butyric acid isobutyric acid 0 0008 3 2 g l 1 d 1 caproic acid 0 95 1 41 g l 1 d 1 2 oxobutyrate 0 0003 0 002 g l 1 d 1 ethanol 0 0001 0 18 g l 1 d 1 isopropanol 0 16 g l 1 d 1 and butanol isobutanol 0 005 0 1 g l 1 d 1 and hexanol 0 3 g l 1 d 1 in addition some of these compounds such as formic acid and ethanol were not stable and only presented as intermediate species rather than the final products the coulombic efficiency of these mixed culture systems ranged from 3 to 82 with most studies showing efficiencies around 40 60 fig 5b possibly caused by the combination of different metabolic pathways in the mixed cultures interesting development was made recently to use sequential reactions of acetogenesis solventogenesis and reverse β oxidation to produce alcohols and medium chain fatty acids mcfas srikanth et al 2018 vassilev et al 2018b as well as for product upgrade by using mixed culture systems to firstly generate acetate from co2 which was then followed by utilizing acetate for the production of polyhydroxybutyrate phb pepè sciarria et al 2018 or alkyl esters lehtinen et al 2017 metabolic engineering and synthetic biology tools have showed good promise in expanding the product spectrum of pure culture based mes krieg et al 2018 recent studies have promoted the electrical biological li et al 2012 tashiro et al 2018 or enzyme assisted hybrid system chen et al 2018 to take advantage of the high performance of the electrolytic co2 reduction into c1 compounds mostly formic acid as well as the high selectivity of engineered bacteria to convert c1 compounds to higher valued products in addition to co2 reduction organic chemicals with short carbon chains such as volatile fatty acids vfas have been feeding into mes to generate the corresponding alcohols and also mcfa via a chain elongation process reddy et al 2018 for example using an electrode with a poised potential of 0 55 v acetate was reduced to ethanol by mixed culture of bacteria using methyl viologen mv as a mediator steinbusch et al 2010 other studies reported that mixed culture such as sulfate reducing bacteria srb could also reduce acetic and butyric acids to alcohols ethanol butanol methanol and propanol and acetone in mes without the addition of artificial mediators kondaveeti and min 2015 sharma et al 2013 2014 using the solid electrode as the electron donor with a working potential caproic acid butyric acid and caprylic acid were produced from acetic acid likely through the h2 route of inward eet raes et al 2017 van eerten jansen et al 2013a 3 4 co2 valorization potential from the mes platform though no pilot or full scale mes study has been reported to date lab scale studies provide enough data to conduct a preliminary analysis on the potential of the mes platform for co2 valorization to organic chemicals fig 6 a b shows the values of the different products that were reported in the literature as well as their respective market size it can be seen that methane has low unit and overall value due to its low production rate in mes but it does have a large market size worldwide similarly acetate may not be an ideal product either due to low unit price but it also has a large market size 10 mton and can be used as a precursor for the synthesis of higher valued chemicals products including formate propionate butyrate and ethanol have slightly higher unit values with the market size ranging from 100 kton to mton per year but their overall economic potentials in mes are currently limited due to the low product rates however they do carry good economic potentials if technological breakthroughs are made to significantly improve system performance a recently published review indicated that there are economic challenges using other alternative routes to produce organic chemicals with only 1 2 carbon atoms which could be easily produced from conventional industrial methods with costs 1 usd kg 1 weekes et al 2018 one promising product is 2 oxobutyrate which has a much higher unit price compared with other chemicals and it can be produced at a relatively higher rate in mes with a sizable world market fig 6a b fig 6c d shows the co2 capture and utilization potential of mes when generating different products it is based on the moles of co2 converted to unit mole of product as well as the maximum production rate of the product in mes reported in the literature compounds with a higher carbon number have a higher conversion ratio on a molar basis but the overall co2 conversion potential largely depends on the chemical production rate and world market size it can be seen that acetate 9988 kg m 3 year 1 has a much higher market potential than other chemicals from 11 to 244 kg m 3 year 1 due to a good combination of carbon number and conversion rate fig 6c the world market size in terms of valorized co2 is primarily associated with ch4 due to the abundance of natural gas fig 6d such quantifications not only provide insights on the product portfolio for increased economic value it also helps us evaluate the co2 capture potential that may lead to additional carbon credit 4 organic waste valorization by ef electro fermentation also uses electrochemistry to influence microbial metabolism but its main purpose is to regulate fermentation pathways to valorize organic waste materials such as municipal and agriculture waste into value added products solid electrodes are inserted in fermentation reactors and serve as inexhaustible electron donors or acceptors and the externally poised potential can regulate pure culture fermentation pathways or that of mixed culture communities schievano et al 2016 for environmental systems the reactions are generally performed via syntrophic interactions between electroactive bacteria and the fermentation bacteria moscoviz et al 2016 the extracellular electron transfer in ef can be either outward for anodic ef or inward for cathodic ef and both processes can influence the fermentation by regulating the orp and the nad nadh ratio moscoviz et al 2016 in addition the anodic electron sinks are expected to drive more atp synthesis by creating a proton gradient while the cathodic electron soures are expected to have impacts on the production of more reduced redox cofactors e g nadph kracke and krömer 2014 in this regard both anodic and cathodic efs could improve fermentration performance which was exemplified by a recent study using lysine producing corynebacterium glutamicum xafenias et al 2017 in traditional organic waste fermentation process a wide variety of commodity chemicals can be produced such as lower alcohols e g ethanol propanol and butanol hydrocarbons e g butadiene isobutene isoprene sesquiterpene andβ farnesene diols e g 1 2 propane diol 1 2 pdo 1 3 propane diol 1 3 pdo 2 3 butane diol 2 3 bdo and 1 4 butane diol 1 4 bdo carboxylic acids lactic acid citric acid succinic acid amino acids aspartate lysine threonine methionine and isoleucine and biopolymers i e polyhydroxyalkanoates and bacterial cellulose sheldon 2014 in the context of ef the number of studies is limited but a variety of chemicals have been generated under the influence of electrical potentials fig 7 4 1 organic waste valorization via anodic ef fig 7a summarizes the anodic ef studies that used electrodes as an electron sink to improve product selectivity and production rate while substrates inocula and products vary significantly these studies did confirm that a variety of chemicals including h2 ethanol acetoin lysine poly β hydroxybutyrate phb and 2 keto gluconate could be produced under different potentials most of which with higher rates than open circuit controls anodic ef was used to stimulate h2 production which can be regarded as a hybrid system of fermentation and microbial electrolysis h2 is commonly generated from both dark fermentations of organics and electrolysis of water under electric potential in such ef process acidogens produce h2 and vfas during fermentation while electroactive bacteria can utilize vfas for current generation and in turn enhance fermentation nikhil et al 2015 further studies reported that h2 production was influenced by the anode potential and the concentration of the autocrine mediators while a decrease in ph drop caused by vfa accumulation led to drop in performance chandrasekhar et al 2015 hydrogen however can be consumed by electroactive bacteria such as g sulfurreducens or methanogens and efforts have been made to minimize such loss by using chemical inhibitors or operational controls genetic modification of electroactive bacteria has also been investigated to prevent h2 consumption while improving vfa oxidation awate et al 2017 enhanced ethanol production from glycerol has been studied in anodic efs engineered bacterial strains were mainly used in this effort for example an engineered shewanella oneidensis strain was used to realize the conversion by using the electrode as an electron acceptor so the excess electrons could be removed flynn et al 2010 another study reported that an engineered escherichia coli strain with new respiratory chains consisting of 3 cytochromes cyma mtra and stc produced more oxidized products ethanol and acetic acid from glycerol sturm richter et al 2015 using a co culture of geobacter sulfurreducens and clostridium cellobioparum synergistic relationships could be formed with the fermenter to convert glycerol into ethanol while geobacter removed the fermentative byproducts speers et al 2014 genetically modified proteobacterium s oneidensis was used in anodic ef to produce high yield acetoin from lactate with the deletion of λ prophage acetate kinase and phosphotransacetylase genes while expression of codon optimized acetolactate synthase and acetolactate decarboxylase the mutant was able to achieve up to 86 of the theoretical maximum acetoin from lactate bursac et al 2017 this expands the substrates that can be used by s oneidensis another study used an e coli mutant with the insertion of c type cytochromes from s oneidensis and it imporved acetoin yield to 79 of the theoretical maximum from glucose by using methylene blue as the electron mediator forster et al 2017 it was also found that ralstonia eutropha could produce 60 more phbs under a working potential of 0 6 v with added mediator compared with the control nishio et al 2014 in summary the application of anodic ef could turn traditional aerobic fermentation with the oxygen as the final electron accepter into an anaerobic fermentation process to decrease the substrate lose in addition anodic ef holds the advantage of increased biomass loading than that of cathodic ef vassilev et al 2018a because the low electrode potential in cathodic ef inevitably restrict energy gaining moreover the use of anodic ef for regulatory central flux control in fermentative bacteria was found to increase yield vassilev et al 2018a 4 2 organic waste valorization via cathodic ef different from anodic ef cathodic ef uses the electrode as an electron source and reducing power to regulate product selectivity and production rate shanthi sravan et al 2018 villano et al 2017 xue et al 2017 in this case organic compounds such as butanol acetate lactate butyrate 1 3 pdo lysine and polyhydroxyalkanoates pha have been produced fig 7b studies have demonstrated that by using the electrons directly supplied by the electrode nadh formation could be altered in clostridium tyrobutyricum bas 7 and butyric acid or butanol production from sucrose was stimulated choi et al 2012 similarly such regulation triggered a metabolic shift in clostridium pasteurianum toward nadh consuming production of butanol from glucose choi et al 2014 khosravanipour mostafazadeh et al 2016 cathode ef has also been used to stimulate 1 3 propandiol 1 3 pdo production with a working potential of 0 045 v a metabolic shift from glycerol to the production of the nadh consuming metabolite 1 3 pdo was observed in clostridium pasteurianum choi et al 2014 recently much effort was focused on the use of mixed cultures for 1 3 pdo production from glycerol in electro fermentation zhou et al 2013 and the working potential was found to significantly influence the microbial community on the biocathode for instance by changing the starting working potential from 0 8 v to 1 1 v the dominant community shifted from veillonellaceae 56 72 to clostridiaceae 55 57 which was accompanied by a product shift from propionate to 1 3 pdo xafenias et al 2015 in addition another study found that after long term operation 150 days the yield of 1 3 pdo decreased by 77 2 which was believed to be due to the loss of the dominant citrobacter spp on the biocathode zhou et al 2015 these studies indicate that metabolite profiles of glycerol ef was directly associated with the changes of a functional community which has broader implications for other substrates as well dennis et al 2013 the cathodic ef has also been used to generate biopolymers such pha from sugars by providing a microaerophilic microenvironment with continuous supply of electrons a mixed culture was shown to accumulate pha as high as 19 of dry cell weight in a cathodic ef srikanth et al 2012 mediators were shown to boost performance in some ef studies when anthraquinone 2 6 disulfonate was added the yield of lactic acid from glucose was increased by 47 3 when corynebacterium glutamicum was grown with an electrode poised at 0 4 v sasaki et al 2014 similarly lactic acid production was increased by 15 when neutral red was added in an ef which was believed to reduce the menaquinone in the inner membrane of e coli and altered the redox state of the arcb sensor protein harrington et al 2015b the effects of the mediator were highly dependent on the microorganisms and also the redox conditions in efs for instance neutral red addition stimulated e coli and klebsiella pneumoniae to produce more ethanol or lactic acid compared with the control but the addition of the mediator did not influence the metabolism of zymomonas mobilis harrington et al 2015a the cathodic ef provides a new approach to regulate fermentation pathways by providing an alternative reducing power to reduce orp and inhibition caused by the accumulation of vfa h2s and other compounds de vrieze et al 2018 this method overcomes some major barriers faced by previous direct h2 injection which is limited by thermodynamic barrier caused by h2 partial pressure and low solubility omar et al 2018 such impacts can be augmented by increasing the surface area and structure of the electrodes so more microbial interactions with the electrodes can be facilitated martins et al 2018 recent findings on direct interspecies electron transfer diet via conductive solid materials such as iron oxide minerals granular activated carbon and conductive biochar greatly enhanced understanding and technology development of anaerobic digestion huggins et al 2016 lovley 2017 martins et al 2018 and the influence of redox potential in ef brings a new opportunity to advance diet process in anaerobic reactors especially for the majority of microorganisms that only carry week electroactive activities doyle and marsili 2018 liu et al 2017 5 future perspectives microbial electrochemical platforms hold great promise for the valorization of co2 and waste organic carbon this review discusses the two major processes for such a purpose and demonstrates their technological feasibility and economic potential while different products have been demonstrated and lab scale systems have been developed there are still major breakthroughs before large scale demonstrations can be deployed challenges remain with regards to identifying and producing high quality products developing high performing reactors revealing electron transfer mechanisms and reducing cost to put this into perspective and stimulate more interest and research we think the following areas will require more investigation 5 1 what to produce and not to produce since the main products from mes are still dominated by 1 2 carbon products such as methane and acetic acid compounds with longer carbon chains and higher value are receiving more research attention in recent years though with limited success this is mainly because of the limited availability of biocatalysts that can concurrently utilize external electrons and inorganic co2 for cell synthesis to overcome such barriers synthetic biology tools will be needed to rationally design metabolic pathways for inward eet and establish a better catalytic interface between the electrode and cells liao et al 2016 in particular metabolic engineering tools can be used to manipulate the most well connected node i e acetyl coa as the building block for chain elongation and product regulation studies suggested that two stage conversion may bring flexibility and higher efficiency than a single step process jiang and zeng 2018 mes carries an advantage in producing higher purity c2 products but fermentation based carboxylate platform can enable chain elongation to produce medium chain carboxylate c6 c8 angenent et al 2018 it thus will be interesting to explore an integrated mes ef system to produce carboxylate from co2 it is also very important to perform technoeconomic and life cycle analyses on the different production approaches so that system development can be guided and critically evaluated shemfe et al 2018 5 2 the need of genetic engineering studies showed the potential of using heterotrophic electroactive bacteria such as geobacter and shewanella for chemical production are restricted because most of them have limited capability of carbon fixation rabaey and rozendal 2010 soussan et al 2013 on the other hand few autotrophs that are known for carbon fixation have also demonstrated eet capability therefore to couple these metabolisms genetic tools are needed to either transfer extracellular electron transfer pathways to known co2 fixers or integrate co2 fixation pathways into the electroactive microorganisms kracke et al 2018 however the practical application of using genetic modification to integrate eet and substrate metabolism is restricted by the unresolved inward eet mechanism as well as the lack of molecular tools for using electroactive microbes as genetic hosts nealson and rowe 2016 it is also worth noting that many autotrophs can use h2 as the reducing power very efficiently therefore for engineering applications indirect inward electron transfer may be realized with h2 or other mediators rather than focusing on direct electron uptake so far the use of metabolic engineering for organic chemicals production in geobacter species have yet not been reported however the engineered s oneidensis for production of chemicals such as butanol la et al 2017 and acetoin bursac et al 2017 with increased producing rate by modified electrode have been reported recent reviews discussed the synthetic biology strategies for engineering electroactive microbes kracke et al 2018 li et al 2018a 5 3 the need of microbial community optimization for the treatment and valorization of wet organic wastes mixed culture reactor systems are generally needed due to the high heterogeneity of the feedstock and difficulty of sterilization for co2 conversion pure culture systems may be used but co culture or mixed culture reactors will likely be more common and resilient than single culture operations mixed culture contains a variety of microorganisms that form collaborative ecological network for waste treatment and product generation and the community structure evolves depending on the substrate and the operational conditions recently findings on in interspecies electron transfer lead to more insights on these syntrophic relationships while many mes and ef studies focused on pure cultures more studies are needed to understand the syntrophy between different members of the community decipher conversion metabolisms and develop reactor and operation strategies to select and maintain high performing microbial communities for targeted product conversion marshall et al 2017 5 4 understand the mechanisms of inward extracellular electron transfer the mechanisms of inward eet at the cathode are still under debate while some studies proposed that direct extracellular electron transfer via nanowires and cytochromes are primary mechanisms for certain bacteria others showed evidence that electron shuttles such as in situ generated h2 or other small molecules such as formate and flavin play critical roles and the exact mechanisms are largely influenced by the cathode working potential and species of microbes there still is a lack of quantitative physiological evidence regarding microbial metabolisms in response to electrochemical environments a central area of research to be expected in the near future compared with mes the inward eet in ef has yet been investigated in detail though similar mechanisms are expected it is also hypothesized that the direct eet may be restricted in efs due to the lack of efficient eet routes by known fermentative bacteria recent studies showed that cell growth and gene expression of electroactive bacteria shewanella oneidensis mr 1 and fermentative bacteria escherichia coli can be regulated by electrode potentials hirose et al 2018 tschirhart et al 2017 advanced analytical methods will help advance the understanding of the cell electrode interface one example is by using transient absorption spectroscopy charge transfer between semiconductor nanoparticles and purified h2ases was revealed sakimoto et al 2018 5 5 how to increase production yield and rate a recent study reported that the total capital and operational costs of mes for acetic acid production is about 5 4 12 6 times of methanol carbonylation or direct ethane oxidation which is mainly due to the low production rates 100 t y 1 compared with 200 kt y 1 christodoulou and velasquez orta 2016 to make mes or ef more efficient and competitive in large scale applications the production rate needs to be significantly increased via the optimization of microbial biocatalysts materials and reactor configuration and operation aryal et al 2017 gildemyn et al 2017 huggins et al 2015 katuri et al 2018 to date the largest mes or ef reactors reported are still in liter scale while relatively high current density as high as 200 a m 2 is required in mess jourdin et al 2016 the reactor scale ups can be tested using stack systems or fluidized beds to increase production efficiency tejedor sanz et al 2018 the scale up experience for fermentation reactors and mfc reactors can be good references and there have been excellent reviews discussing the approaches and possibilities liang et al 2018 santoro et al 2017 wu et al 2016 5 6 better selection and separation maximizing the titer of targeted chemicals requires efficient collection and separation of the products from the media broth while limited mes and ef studies have focused on this aspect effective product separation is a key factor determining the viability of the technology product separation can be based on chemical differences in size volatility charge and other properties and popular separation methods include membrane filtration electrodialysis pervaporation as well as phase separation and other approaches recently liquid membrane extraction pepè sciarria et al 2018 electrodialysis gildemyn et al 2015 and ion exchange resin bajracharya et al 2017b were applied to increase product titer and purity in addition external supply of h2 was used in separation and obtained a high titer of 37 0 g l 1 acetate via improved balance of charge and electron transfers verbeeck et al 2018 one other issue related to product separation is the need for methanogenesis inhibition while ch4 is the common product of anaerobic processes it is not an ideal product due to its low value and strong greenhouse gas effect methanogenesis can be inhibited by chemical inhibitors ultraviolet irradiation temperature shock and other approaches but they all face different challenges lu and ren 2016 the concept of arrested methanogenesis can be interesting as it uses redox potential or other methods to inhibit methanogenesis without using chemical or high energy and it can produce valued added chemicals and bioproduct precursors using a shorter stable and known pathway jiang et al 2018 mahmoud et al 2017 6 conclusions microbial electrosynthesis and electro fermentation based microbial electrochemical technology platform carries good potentials to convert co2 and organic waste into value added chemicals

19127,wastewater treatment processes with granular sludge are compact and are becoming increasingly popular interest has been accompanied by the development of mathematical models this contribution simultaneously reviews available models in the scientific literature for anaerobic aerobic and partial nitritation anammox granular sludge reactors because they comprise common phenomena e g liquid gas and granule transport and thus pose similar challenges many of the publications were found to have no clearly defined goal the importance of a goal is stressed because it determines the appropriate model complexity and helps other potential users to find a suitable model in the vast amount of literature secondly a wide variety was found in the model features this review explains the chosen modelling assumptions based on the different reactor types and goals wherever possible but some assumptions appeared to be habitual within fields of research without clear reason we therefore suggest further research to more clearly define the range of operational conditions and goals for which certain simplifying assumptions can be made e g when intragranule solute transport can be lumped in apparent kinetics and when biofilm models are needed which explicitly calculate substrate concentration gradients inside granules furthermore research is needed to better mechanistically understand detachment removal of influent particulate matter and changes in the mixing behaviour inside anaerobic systems before these phenomena can be adequately incorporated in models finally it is suggested to perform full scale model validation studies for aerobic and anammox reactors a spreadsheet in the supplementary information provides an overview of the features in the 167 reviewed models graphical abstract image 1 keywords granular sludge model wastewater anammox anaerobic digestion asm 1 introduction granular sludge technology underpins key emerging and established technologies for wastewater treatment across industrial and municipal sectors pollutant removal in these reactors relies on microorganisms that grow in approximately spherical aggregates biofilms that can freely move within the reactor compared to flocs granules have a higher biomass density and a more regular shape they are mechanically stronger and they can become larger liu and tay 2004 these characteristics can lead to microscale substrate concentration gradients inside the aggregates but even more importantly they lead to high settling velocities winkler et al 2018 fast settling is the common benefit of all types of granular sludge it facilitates solid liquid separation and therefore allows high reactor biomass concentrations nicolella et al 2000 in addition granular sludge reactors provide a high biofilm specific surface area morgenroth 2008 and the geometry and free movement of granules limits external boundary layer resistances promoting mass transfer of substrate towards the organisms the combination of the high biomass concentration and fast mass transfer allows high removal rates ultimately enabling compact installations heijnen et al 1993 anaerobic granular sludge has been applied in upflow sludge blanket reactors since the 1970s lettinga et al 1980 and later in variations of this technology to remove organic pollution from wastewater through biological conversion into biogas the potential to recover energy in compact installations with a low sludge production made anaerobic granular sludge technologies very popular van lier 2008 especially for industrial wastewaters aerobic treatment processes using small spherical carriers for biofilm growth were developed in the 1970s for removal of organics and ammonium jeris et al 1977 later combined with nitrate and nitrite removal under anoxic conditions via denitrification nutt et al 1984 self sustained granules for aerobic treatment only became feasible much later with the development of a sequencing batch reactor technology which also enables biological phosphorus removal de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 this has evolved into a mature technology with distinct benefits compared to conventional activated sludge systems it requires 25 75 less space due high biomass concentrations and the absence of settling tanks and it has 20 50 lower energy demands due to the lack of recycle and sludge return pumps and mixers pronk et al 2017 moreover the waste sludge offers potential for recovery of valuable biopolymers lin et al 2015 the discovery of the anammox reaction mulder et al 1995 stimulated the development of a third important type of granular sludge technology one stage partial nitritation anammox is now frequently used to treat nitrogen rich wastewaters lackner et al 2014 this also offers potential for the recovery of phosphorus because it can accumulate inside the granules johansson et al 2017 granular sludge is also promising for emerging biological treatment processes such as phototrophic processes abouhend et al 2016 and sulfide based organics removal hao et al 2013 and denitrification yang et al 2016 but these are not yet available at commercial scale modelling is a widely acknowledged tool for fundamental understanding design and optimization of wastewater treatment processes van loosdrecht et al 2008 reviews on wastewater treatment models have generally focussed on either anaerobic batstone et al 2015 liotta et al 2015 sadino riquelme et al 2018 tomei et al 2009 or aerobic processes hauduc et al 2013 karpinska and bridgeman 2016 liotta et al 2014 because these require different redox conditions except for nicolella et al 2000 liu and tay 2004 and milferstedt et al 2017a reviews focussing on granular sludge have discussed anaerobic chong et al 2012 saravanan and sreekrishnan 2006 schmidt and ahring 1996 and aerobic processes bengtsson et al 2018 ni and yu 2010a winkler et al 2018 separately as well however from a physical and chemical point of view anaerobic aerobic and partial nitritation anammox granular sludge reactors share much in common such as hydrolysis of particulate substrates interactions between gas bubbles and the water phase mass transfer of substrates from the bulk liquid to the granule surface and acid base reactions also stable granule formation probably relies on the same interplay between mass transfer of solutes conversion rates and detachment forces van loosdrecht et al 2002 therefore modelling these different reactors poses largely the same challenges this review discusses models of anaerobic aerobic and partial nitritation anammox granular sludge reactors together to assess commonalities and discrepancies in approaches first the scope of the review is defined next the different modelling goals of the studies are discussed the two main sections describe differences in assumptions about transport phenomena and transformations and explain them based on the different reactor types and modelling goals wherever possible as such suggestions for further modelling studies are extracted and habitual assumptions and gaps in the knowledge are identified afterwards the trends advantages and disadvantages of model complexity are discussed next the availability of calibration and validation studies for different reactor scales is discussed and finally future research needs are summarized 2 scope and key phenomena 2 1 scope of the review this review focuses on mechanistic models for reactors with mixed microbial granules published in the english scientific literature the review was limited to anaerobic aerobic and partial nitritation anammox often referred to as simply anammox further on granular sludge reactors that are commercially available as these are commonly applied and numerous modelling studies exist eight different reactor types with or without small carriers were identified upflow sludge blanket expanded granular sludge bed internal circulation baffled fluidized bed air lift sequencing batch and simple aerated reactors fig 1 mechanistic models are here understood as models that are based on mass balances with transport and reaction terms models that only describe batch tests were not considered because the focus is on models for operational reactors as a whole meaning they can predict the effluent concentration of at least one substrate i e pollutant in case more than one model for a single reactor type was described in a publication only the model that the authors labelled as the most accurate or reference was analyzed with these selection criteria this review covers 164 publications including 167 models table 1 provides an overview and the spreadsheet in supplementary information shows the model features omitting yearly fluctuations there has been an increase in publication rate from the first publication in 1981 until 1997 followed by a brief decline and then another increase until it stagnated around 2006 fig 2 a the first publications modelling aerobic systems described fluidized bed and air lift reactors but most models for aerobic systems were developed for sequencing batch reactors fig 2b because the focus shifted almost completely since 2001 preceding the commercialization of this technology de kreuk et al 2007a anaerobic granular sludge models appeared a few years after the invention of the technology lettinga et al 1980 models for upflow sludge blanket reactors are by far the most abundant in literature followed by anaerobic fluidized bed reactors fig 2b but interest in the latter type has sharply declined in the last decade as application of the technology also decreased van lier et al 2016 in 2007 the first model for one reactor partial nitritation anammox granular sludge was published quickly following the full scale implementation of the technology wett 2007 2 2 key phenomena in granular sludge reactors a number of key phenomena based on wanner et al 2006 that occur in granular sludge reactors can be included in models fig 3 transformations both biological conversions e g nitrification and purely physico chemical reactions occur such as precipitation and acid base reactions these are the main drivers for the removal of pollutants e g ammonia organics or phosphate and production of sludge biomass and precipitates liquid phase transport liquid flows through a reactor with a certain pattern influencing the transport of solutes and colloidal matter through advection the hydraulics determine whether the liquid phase is well mixed or shows spatial gradients granule transport granules move as a result of gravity drag and contact forces e g collision with a separator the balance of these forces regulates the retention of granules inside the system and the distribution of biomass along the reactor height there is a mutual interaction between the movement of granules solid phase and liquid intragranule transport solutes move through the granule matrix primarily via diffusion but also advection can take place via pores together with the biological conversions and physico chemical reactions this determines the concentration gradients inside granules also matrix embedded particles and microorganisms move which influences the microbial population distribution inside granules liquid granule mass transfer solutes are exchanged across the external mass transfer boundary layer surrounding granules and are subsequently potentially adsorbed onto the biofilm matrix these processes can influence the removal rate of pollutants from the wastewater also exchange of particulate components through detachment and attachment occurs this can affect the microbial population distribution inside granules and the granule size granule transformations and size distribution granules can grow shrink and break up together with granule transport e g wash out of small granules this determines the size distribution which ranges from small flocs to millimetre thick granules pereboom 1994 pronk et al 2015 vlaeminck et al 2010 gas phase transport the gas phase air or biogas mostly moves upwards due to buoyant forces but can also flow downwards e g in the downcomer of air lift reactors the gas transport mutually interacts with the liquid phase transport the different gas phase constituents such as oxygen o2 carbon dioxide co2 methane ch4 hydrogen sulfide h2s nitrous oxide n2o nitric oxide no and nitrogen gas n2 can be well mixed or show concentration gradients liquid gas mass transfer components such as oxygen and methane experience a resistance when exchanged between the gas and the liquid phase due to stagnant layers on the inside and outside of a bubble this resistance determines the mass transfer rate and therefore affects the distribution of compounds between the liquid and gas phase heat transport and production heat enters and leaves via the liquid through work done by mechanical equipment and through heat exchange with the environment while biological conversions and physico chemical reactions can produce heat these phenomena determine the temperature distribution in the reactor a spreadsheet in the supplementary information provides a complete overview of the assumptions that were made for these key phenomena in all the analyzed models it also indicates the applications that were proposed or demonstrated the scale of the largest modelled reactor whether calibration and or validation was performed and which software was used for modelling and simulation this spreadsheet is available as a tool for practitioners and scientists to find an appropriate model to tackle their specific problem 3 modelling goal given the vast number of published models and the variation among them it becomes ever more important to specifically state the model purpose in every publication still one third of the analyzed models had no specific goal or at least it was not clearly defined the publications may state that the model is capable of characterisation description understanding prediction simulation design optimization or control of a system but this is very general it does not differentiate the model in comparison with other available models for example if a model is said to be suitable for design it is not clear whether this means that it can determine the required reactor volume the optimal height to width ratio or the required capacity of aerators therefore we did not consider such general applications or goals this does not mean that the models are not useful only that the applications are not clearly communicated generally speaking three different types of applications of granular sludge reactor models could be distinguished table 2 the first type is to gain fundamental insight in the relationship between micro and mesoscale phenomena e g intragranule transport and macroscale reactor operation e g influent characteristics and performance e g effluent quality the second type is the assessment of alternative operational strategies or reactor plant designs to have a better overall reactor performance for this micro or mesoscale phenomena were sometimes included but only the prediction of the macroscale reactor behaviour was of interest finally the third application is to extract more information from measurements e g about the microbial activity of course this pragmatic classification of goals is not absolute e g models that are primarily used for fundamental insight are often used also for design and optimization and some models that were purely used for design optimization questions in a publication also have potential to gain more fundamental insight still it gives a structure to the vast amount of publications 4 transport and mass transfer phenomena this section discusses how transport of substrates and organisms inside the liquid granule and gas phase or transport of these phases themselves has been included in models to calculate different kinds of spatial heterogeneity in a reactor fig 4 illustrates the multi scale nature of this spatial heterogeneity which will be further elaborated in the subsections 4 1 liquid phase transport liquid phase transport patterns depend on the reactor geometry hu et al 2017 inlet flow wang et al 2009 inlet distribution asif et al 1992 and gas production or injection buffiere et al 1998 for anaerobic granular sludge reactors the absence of aeration induced mixing explains why spatial concentration gradients of soluble compounds are often considered fig 5 this was done assuming an ideal plug flow bonnet et al 1997 wang shi and zhou 1994 combinations of tanks bolle et al 1986 tanaka et al 1981 the advection dispersion equation kalyuzhnyi et al 2006 seifi and fazaelipoor 2012 or computational fluid dynamics cfd yang et al 2015 the latter is the only technique that can predict the mixing behaviour instead of assuming it only some authors verified the hydraulic behaviour using tracer tests or measurements of concentration profiles in the specific modelled reactor huang et al 2003 lin and yang 1995 no studies experimentally verified complete mixing in baffled fluidized bed or internal circulation reactors even though it has been assumed it seems contradictory that an ideal plug flow or non ideal flow has been assumed slightly more often for large scale than for lab scale anaerobic sludge blanket reactors zoom on fig 5 because experiments have shown that mixing improves with the scale batstone et al 2005 in expanded granular sludge bed reactors both thorough mixing chou et al 2008 fuentes et al 2011 and semi plug flow behaviour has been observed yang et al 2015 zheng et al 2012 on both large and small scale because the liquid phase transport can differ even between two anaerobic reactors of the same type tracer tests or measurements of gradients are preferred whenever possible if the reactor is still to be built e g if a model is used for design tracer tests from reactors with a similar scale operation and construction can give an approximation but also preliminary cfd calculations with a simplified conversion model could help find an appropriate assumption for baffled reactors in particular the experimental evidence and physical compartmentation encourages to always assume a non ideal flow bachmann et al 1985 li et al 2016b finally semi plug flow behaviour is essential for specific applications e g to assess the effect of an internal recirculation flow mu et al 2008a or short circuiting bolle et al 1986 for aerobic and partial nitritation anammox reactors the choice of a flow pattern is often more straightforward because active air injection induces mixing only for fluidized bed reactors tracer tests and measurements of concentration gradients have confirmed that complete mixing cannot always be assumed seifi and fazaelipoor 2012 stevens et al 1989 which is reflected in fig 5 for one stage partial nitritation anammox reactors the assumption of a completely mixed liquid phase has not yet received experimental verification even though it seems a reasonable assumption due to the active aeration for aerobic sequencing batch reactors it is known that semi plug flow behaviour exists during the unaerated feeding phase but this has not been considered in whole reactor models yet weissbrodt et al 2017 4 2 granules 4 2 1 granule transport no heterogeneous vertical distribution of biomass is considered in aerobic and anammox based granular sludge reactors except sometimes during a settling phase this is justified by the air induced mixing of the sludge bed in contrast a vertical biomass concentration profile is considered in 31 of the anaerobic granular sludge models because it is also often experimentally observed lettinga et al 1980 wu and huang 1996 sometimes the profile is predefined in the model based on measurements feldman et al 2017 or an educated guess sam soon et al 1991 but often the profile is predicted more mechanistically through mass transport as a result of upward drag forces and gravity acting upon the sludge bed bolle et al 1986 bonnet et al 1997 only when plug flow characteristics are considered do the simulated effluent concentrations become sensitive to the assumption of a vertical biomass distribution an uneven distribution of biomass has no effect on the reactor performance if the liquid phase is completely mixed to avoid that the simulated biomass concentration becomes unrealistically high models with biomass growth need to include washout from the reactor as well apart from decay models for anaerobic reactors often 49 consider imperfect retention of granules by imposing a predefined solids retention time eq 1 as suggested in the adm1 report batstone et al 2002 or by using a fixed solids separation efficiency bolle et al 1986 1 dx reactor i dt q in x in i v reactor x reactor i srt r i where xreactor i represents the concentration of a microbial group i or other

rates of the group e g of decay and growth g m 3 d 1 sometimes the degree of retention is incorporated more mechanistically via the settling behaviour of granules and advective upflow kalyuzhnyi et al 2006 saravanan and sreekrishnan 2008 as described above for granule transport inside the reactor only a few models for aerobic and partial nitritation anammox reactors estimate the washout of granules via a fixed separation efficiency wett et al 2010 or mechanistic settling behaviour kagawa et al 2015 su et al 2013 in fact most aerobic 87 and anammox 80 models that consider biomass growth assume that granules are perfectly retained beun et al 2001 stevens et al 1989 tang et al 1987 volcke et al 2010 this means that no granules are lost via the effluent but loss of biomass through detachment followed by wash out of suspended cells or by intentional sludge removal can still be considered the two approaches can also be combined by defining a perfectly retained granule fraction and imperfectly suspended biomass fraction corbala robles et al 2016 hubaux et al 2015 pons et al 2008 it is not immediately clear why imperfect granule retention is so common for anaerobic systems while perfect retention is often used for aerobic and anammox systems fig 6 it could be partly habitual within each of these scientific domains possibly authors interested in modelling anaerobic systems were inspired by previous models of such systems and those about to model aerobic and anammox systems based their assumptions on existing models of these systems respectively as such a habit can arise a few models did not consider any retention of biomass compared to the liquid phase i e hrt srt ghorbanian et al 2014a b setiadi et al 1996 shi et al 2016 this last approach misses one of the key characteristics of granular sludge reactors namely that granules settle fast and are therefore easily retained reach high concentrations and as such allow high volumetric conversion rates 4 2 2 intragranule transport models of granular sludge reactors can be divided into two main categories those that consider the intragranule transport biofilm models and those that treat biomass as a suspension in the liquid phase using apparent kinetics biofilm models calculate the macroscale conversion rate by solving the mass balance of substrates inside granules the intragranule substrate concentration profile and related flux are derived considering simultaneous conversion and diffusion wanner et al 2006 e g eq 2 assumes monod kinetics and 1d radial transport 2 b i o f i l m m o d e l

for the conversion g m 3 and k the intrinsic half saturation coefficient g m 3 appropriate boundary conditions are applied normally spherical symmetry and a bulk concentration biomass concentrations inside the granules and granule geometry size may be likewise included in biofilm models as state variables see below mass transport between the bulk liquid and the microorganisms inside the biofilm decreases macroscale conversion rates compared to suspended systems with the same amount of biomass this effect becomes more pronounced with a thicker biofilm faster local conversion rates through a higher local biomass concentration and or specific uptake rate or lower substrate diffusivity wang shi and zhou 1994 this may be considered fundamentally through biofilm modelling as outlined above however when granular sludge is treated as a suspension intragranule transport is not explicitly simulated so this effect on the macroscale rates should be represented through modified kinetic parameters apparent kinetics are thus obtained for example by increasing half saturation coefficients eq 3 to incorporate the diffusional resistance beccari et al 1992 manser et al 2005 pérez et al 2005 3 apparent kinetics r i apparent t r i max c i t x i t c i t k app where ri apparent is the macroscale substrate uptake rate g m 3 d 1 at time t d ci the bulk substrate concentration g m 3 and kapp the apparent half saturation coefficient g m 3 changes in the granule size microbial population distribution and competition between different microbial groups for the same substrates e g competition for oxygen between nitrifiers and heterotrophs can alter the apparent kinetics which may require re calibration baeten et al 2018 only a minority explicitly modelled intragranule transport of substrates using a biofilm model for anaerobic granular sludge 21 of the analyzed models even though intragranule transport has been shown to significantly influence macroscale rates for at least sludge blanket wu and hickey 1997 expanded granular sludge bed chou et al 2008 and fluidized bed reactors seok and komisar 2003b this means that the use of apparent kinetics is widespread for anaerobic granular sludge 77 of the reviewed models in contrast more than three quarters of the aerobic and anammox granular sludge models explicitly describe intragranule solute transport it is not immediately clear why biofilm models are more common for aerobic and anammox systems while apparent kinetics are mostly used for anaerobic ones fig 6 adm1 might be more complex than most aerobic or anammox conversion models but it is still reasonably technically straightforward to apply it in a biofilm model with dedicated software like aquasim reichert 1994 the difference in popularity can also not be solely explained by an increased availability of tools or computing power since many models for anaerobic systems with apparent kinetics were published in the same period as biofilm models for aerobic systems fig s1 a possible explanation is that publications on aerobic beun et al 2001 de kreuk et al 2007a kagawa et al 2015 winkler et al 2015b and anammox systems castro barros et al 2018 corbala robles et al 2016 mozumder et al 2014 volcke et al 2010 often looked into intragranule substrate profiles and ecological interactions between different microorganisms insight while those dealing with anaerobic systems generally focussed more on overall reactor design and optimization batstone and keller 2003 kleerebezem 2003 lohani et al 2016 mu et al 2007 yetilmezsoy 2012 or were used for monitoring biological activity lopez and borzacconi 2011 perez et al 2001 not only solutes but also matrix embedded particles and microorganisms can move throughout a granule which influences the microbial population distribution along the granule depth therefore this distribution is dependent on the reactor operating conditions even for the same type of reactor batstone et al 2004 such dynamics can be described mechanistically with an intragranule mass balance for biomass as state variables including reaction and transport terms analogous to eq 3 this time diffusive transport is often neglected but advective transport is required because a net growth of microorganisms causes biofilm geometry to move i e deeper layers push outer layers outwards the advective velocity of particles and microorganisms towards the granule surface is often calculated in 1d with eq 4 as this is used in aquasim wanner and reichert 1996 4 advective velocity u advection t z 1 a z 0 z 1 1 ε l

the 2d or 3d heterogeneity of granules fig 4c but comes at a high computational cost de kreuk et al 2007a a dynamic microbial population distribution has been predicted mechanistically in all the biofilm models for anammox reactors but some of the biofilm models for aerobic and anaerobic systems used a predefined distribution either heterogeneous huang et al 2006 saravanan and sreekrishnan 2008 tang et al 1987 wu and hickey 1997 or homogeneous chou et al 2011a huang et al 2011 huang et al 2006 claimed that 1d biomass spatial heterogeneity is necessary to effectively simulate the performance of an upflow sludge blanket reactor however the fact that 28 of the analyzed publications used a homogeneous distribution bachmann et al 1985 rodriguez gomez et al 2014 or even neglected all intragranule transport processes indicates that these effects are often lumped in apparent kinetic parameters moreover it has been shown that dense micro colonies of nitrifiers which can only be described in 2d or 3d can influence the macroscale kinetics picioreanu et al 2016 this shows that even kinetic parameters that are calibrated for 1d biofilm models might cluster some processes when dense micro colonies are present 4 2 3 liquid granule transfer adsorption of solutes on the biofilm matrix is hardly ever considered kennedy et al 2001 sam soon et al 1991 tsuneda et al 2002 even though organic compounds can adsorb onto anaerobic granules ning et al 1997 and ammonium can adsorb on anammox li et al 2016c and aerobic granules the latter is probably caused by the attraction between the negatively charged granule matrix and positively charged ammonium ions bassin et al 2011 these adsorption processes could play a role in the removal of these pollutants the compounds are transferred from the liquid phase to the solid phase decreasing their discharge with the effluent and enabling removal with the waste sludge at the same time adsorption may reduce the availability for biological conversions desorption can occur when bulk liquid concentrations decrease again bassin et al 2011 solutes need to pass through an external boundary layer prior to reaching the granule surface its negative effect on the overall conversion rates becomes stronger when the local uptake rate inside the biofilm or boundary layer thickness increases and when the limiting substrate concentration or diffusivity decreases picioreanu 2015 wu and hickey 1997 chou et al 2008 and wu and huang 1995 estimated that the external resistance was not rate limiting in the upflow sludge blanket expanded granular sludge bed and anaerobic fluidized bed reactors they respectively studied stevens et al 1989 also found that it was not rate limiting in an aerobic fluidized bed reactor whereas tang et al 1987 judged it to be important for an airlift reactor vangsgaard et al 2012 found that it can sometimes be influential for anammox based systems so even though the extra turbulence created by aeration in anammox based and aerobic systems can decrease the boundary layer thickness other influencing factors can make its effect significant especially a rapid oxygen uptake rate and relatively low bulk oxygen concentrations understandably an external mass transfer resistance is considered most often in aerobic granular sludge models 31 it is advisable for future modelling to make a rough estimation of the effect for aerobic and anammox based reactors under the specific operating conditions as in stevens et al 1989 if quantitative predictions are aimed at alternatively the effect can be clustered in apparent kinetic parameters if no significant changes in the turbulence or other influencing factors are expected also solids and microorganisms undergo liquid granule transfer through attachment onto the granule surface and detachment from the surface detachment has a strong impact on biofilm thickness in the long term wanner et al 2006 consequently steady state simulations with biofilm models that included intragranule transport of microorganisms always considered detachment to avoid predicting unrealistically large granule sizes except for kagawa et al 2015 who focussed on the start up of a reactor the detachment rate is often defined with an equation to obtain a specific predefined steady state granule size for example eq 5 was used by volcke et al 2010 5 d e t a c h m e n t velocity u detachment δ δ steady state 10 u advection δ where udetachment represents the detachment velocity m d 1 δ the simulated granule radius δ steady state the predefined steady state radius which is either measured or based on experience with similar systems m and uadvection δ is the advective velocity with which the granule expands due to biomass growth eq 4 this approach allows a dynamic microbial population distribution while keeping the granule size below a realistic limit but it cannot actually predict the granule size also the convergence rate to the steady state size relies on the arbitrary exponent 10 a realistic convergence rate can only be obtained a posteriori through calibration of such empirical parameters ni et al 2010 finally only a few publications considered attachment batstone et al 2004 showed that modelling attachment was necessary to explain the observed acidogenic layer in anaerobic granules treating brewery wastewater 4 2 4 granule transformations and size distribution the majority of granular sludge models 82 assume a single granule size with a predefined steady state value or implicitly assume a constant granule size by using constant apparent kinetics sixteen models predict the size dynamically without a predefined steady state value but this has never been done for partial nitritation anammox based reactors some predicted the granule size without using detachment e g rodriguez gomez et al 2014 meaning that the granule size is only limited by decay the accuracy of the predicted size is doubtful for long term simulations in these cases since detachment is driven by liquid shear and granule shear strength its rate is a function of the operating conditions for example odriozola et al 2016 su et al 2013 and fuentes et al 2008a applied an empirical equation linking the detachment rate to the biogas production rate and liquid upflow velocity or aeration rate the generalizability of such equations is uncertain as they contain an empirical parameter that might require calibration for different reactor operating conditions which again makes it non predictive detachment rates can in principle be determined mechanistically from biofilm strength and liquid shear rate horn and lackner 2014 van loosdrecht et al 2002 it might also be possible to estimate the granule shear strength based on influent wastewater properties batstone and keller 2001 yet integrating these aspects to fundamentally dynamically predict the granule size has not yet been done even though it is technically possible note that a dynamic granule size only affects the predicted macro scale conversion rates directly if intragranule solute transport is included otherwise only indirect effects are considered such as the better settleability of bigger granules and accompanying higher biomass concentration e g in kalyuzhnyi et al 2006 and fuentes et al 2009a some models consider the size distribution of granules inside a reactor the simplest approach is to distinguish two classes granules and suspended sludge fuentes et al 2008c hubaux et al 2015 pons et al 2008 but more size classes have also been used feldman et al 2017 huang et al 2003 su and yu 2006a wu and huang 1996 volcke et al 2012 showed that the use of a single average granule size is sufficient to predict the effluent nitrogen concentration and speciation from a partial nitritation anammox reactor odriozola et al 2016 also found that the predicted methane production and effluent soluble substrate concentrations were similar with and without considering the granule size distribution in an anaerobic system this means that a size distribution is only necessary for fundamental understanding e g to get insight in the solute exchange between different size classes to get insight in the formation of a granular sludge bed a size distribution as well as the dynamics of each size class need to be considered this has been done in three publications odriozola et al 2016 seok and komisar 2003a su et al 2013 su et al 2013 provides the most comprehensive approach using a population balance model for an aerobic granular sludge reactor apart from the mass balances of particulate and soluble compounds such models use balances on the number of particles in each size class by estimating wash out growth break up into smaller pieces etc as such the selective retention of larger granules can be simulated which is seen as one of the factors promoting granulation of sludge beun 1999 because this approach still relies on calibrated relationships for the detachment rate as discussed above and a calibrated granule breakage probability it is difficult to quantitatively predict the granule size distribution before a reactor is operational e g for design purposes this might even be impossible in a quantitative deterministic way given the complex mutual interaction between the shear stress and granule shear strength and stochastic processes like the influent composition temperature microbial species and related kinetics and breakage events 4 3 gas phase transport and liquid gas transfer more than half of the selected models 56 assume an instant equilibrium between the gas and liquid phase concentrations or do not consider transfer of gases at all for example the liquid gas transfer resistance of methane in anaerobic systems is often neglected probably because it is the final product of the conversions and will therefore not directly influence the predicted conversion rates nonetheless if the biogas composition flow or induced mixing is of interest liquid gas transfer is important pauss et al 1990 gas entrapment onto or inside granules can also cause sludge to rise in anaerobic bolle et al 1986 and anammox based reactors van hulle et al 2010 this effect has never been included explicitly but it has been incorporated through calibrated correction parameters to predict the vertical biomass concentration distribution in a reactor as well as wash out bolle et al 1986 kalyuzhnyi et al 2006 when modelling aerobic and anammox based reactors the influence of the liquid phase oxygen concentration has often been studied directly so the gas phase is actually not of interest therefore resistances in the liquid gas boundary layer for oxygen are neglected by choosing an unrealistically high transfer rate beun et al 2001 volcke et al 2010 yet a realistic oxygen transfer resistance would be required to quantify the necessary airflow rate to obtain a certain liquid phase oxygen concentration garcia ochoa and gomez 2009 the mass transfer dynamics are also crucial to compare different online control strategies for aeration e g under variations in load a well known application of activated sludge models åmand and carlsson 2012 belchior et al 2012 the delay between an increase in the aeration rate and the resulting increase in the dissolved oxygen concentration due to the mass transfer resistance can be important along with other dynamics like the sensor response times alex et al 2008 when a liquid gas mass transfer resistance is used for gases an assumption about the transport phenomena within the gas phase needs to be made mostly a completely mixed gas phase is used but some publications consider that vertical concentration gradients can exist within the gas phase for now the only clear benefit of this model feature is that concentration gradients inside the gas phase can be estimated wisecarver and fan 1989 but there might be some indirect effects on the predicted effluent quality aeration requirements or biogas quality which have not yet been investigated explicitly 5 transformations 5 1 biological conversions biological conversions occurring in anaerobic aerobic and partial nitritation anammox granular sludge reactors show overlap because some processes are not specific for certain redox conditions e g hydrolysis and because anaerobic and anoxic conditions can exist in aerobic and anammox based reactors due to spatial and temporal heterogeneity fig 7 most models include biological conversions of substrate as a primary function these can include different types of organics ammonium nitrate and nitrite phosphorus and sulfate under anaerobic anoxic and aerobic conditions models of anaerobic granular sludge reactors all include the conversion of organics to methane because this is the primary goal a varying degree of detail has been used regarding the actual pathways conversions of sulfate are generally not included fedorovich et al 2003 pokorna krayzelova et al 2017 sun et al 2016 but are important for sulfate containing wastewaters since sulfate is readily reduced to sulfide causing odour corrosion and safety issues the sulfide concentration in biogas increases almost linearly with the influent sulfate to organics ratio at low sulfate concentrations batstone 2006 pokorna krayzelova et al 2017 high sulfate concentrations 0 125 g s g cod 1 also significantly reduce methane production due to inhibition of conversions by sulfide vavilin et al 1995 and because sulfate reducing bacteria compete with methanogens for organic substrates for aerobic systems most models consider organics and ammonium conversions sometimes combined with denitrification of nitrite nitrate depending on the wastewater composition and presence of anoxic conditions only four out of 22 models for aerobic sequencing batch reactors include biological phosphorus removal because they were often developed for lab scale reactors with short feeding phases however in full scale systems nereda slow anaerobic feeding is applied to promote phosphate accumulating organisms and achieve more stable granules de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 pronk et al 2015 this constitutes a substantial discrepancy between available models and practice furthermore the models that did consider phosphorus conversions in a reactor with slow anaerobic feeding required significant alterations of the kinetic parameters of phosphate accumulating organisms in order to match experimental results de kreuk et al 2007b winkler et al 2015b xavier et al 2007 which might be due to an inappropriate description of their metabolism barnard et al 2017 in anammox based systems ammonium and nitrate nitrite conversions via nitritation and anammox are always considered but conversions of organics are sometimes neglected because these are generally not the main target nevertheless about 300 1400 mg cod l 1 is removed in full scale reactors lackner et al 2014 and these conversions influence the total nitrogen removal mozumder et al 2014 so it is always recommended to include denitrification and aerobic oxidation of organics particulate organics were considered as separate state variable s in thirty models for anaerobic granular sludge reactors but this was rarely done for aerobic or anammox based systems this lack of particulates conversions in the latter two probably originates from the more complex hydrolysis kinetics that are usually assumed for aerobic henze et al 2000 compared to anaerobic sludge batstone et al 2002 activated sludge models asms henze et al 2000 use a hydrolysis rate dependent on the concentration of heterotrophic organisms eq 6 6 a s m r particulate k m 1 m i x particulate x heterotrophs k x particulate x heterotrophs x heterotrophs where rparticulate is the removal rate of particulates g m 3 d 1 k is a rate coefficient d 1 mi are monod expressions k is a half saturation coefficient xparticulate the concentration of particulate organics g m 3 and xheterotrophs the concentration of heterotrophs g m 3 such kinetics are not easily compatible with biofilm models which are often used for aerobic and anammox granular sludge reactors the reason is that biofilm models assume that most of the heterotrophic organisms reside inside the granules on the other hand particulates enter via the bulk liquid and thus they do not come into contact with heterotrophs as such the predicted rate eq 6 is zero in the granules because xparticulate is zero and the rate is small or zero in the bulk liquid because xheterotrophs is small or zero removal would thus only be predicted if liquid granule transfer attachment and or intragranule transport of particulates are defined to bring this substrate in contact with heterotrophs but the rates of these transport processes are rarely analyzed and the exact mechanisms are poorly understood boltz et al 2010 pronk et al 2015 it is unclear how some biofilm models predicted removal of influent particulates without defining any transfer of particulates to aerobic granules ni et al 2009 ni et al 2008 su and yu 2006a b lübken et al 2005 and pons et al 2008 could apply asm type kinetics because they assumed a suspension of biomass no biofilm modelling meaning that both the particulate organics and heterotrophs reside in the bulk liquid simpler kinetics could be used in future biofilm models for aerobic and anammox granules eq 7 as often applied for anaerobic granular sludge systems batstone et al 2004 and mu et al 2008a this more empirical approach predicts conversion irrespective of the contact between the substrate and heterotrophs 7 a d m r particulate k x p a r t i c u l a t e biological conversions of substrates are generally linked to biomass growth biological wastewater treatment is an autocatalytic process in the sense that biomass is the catalyst for the degradation of substrates and at the same time more biomass is created during these conversions most models consider this explicitly by using one or more microbial groups e g heterotrophs and nitrifiers as state variables the total amount or microbial composition of the biomass is then calculated via mass balances which include a growth term nevertheless about one third of the models for anaerobic and aerobic reactors do not include microbial growth they assume a fixed amount of biomass for every microbial group or simply use a fixed maximal conversion rate when these models are used to design the required reactor volume the expected biomass concentration or maximal conversion rate must be assumed for an already operational reactor these parameters can be measured directly and used as parameters yet without growth changes in the biomass or conversion capacity cannot be predicted therefore these models are less suitable to simulate long term changes in operating conditions or to design reactors for a significantly different wastewater composition concentration or loading rate 5 2 physico chemical reactions the reactor ph is affected by acid base consumption and production during biological conversions and can in turn influence biological conversion rates the ph can be calculated by solving implicit algebraic acid base equations costello et al 1991a by solving differential equations with reaction rates batstone et al 2004 or through reformulation to an explicit expression for the hydrogen ion concentration ph log h in simple cases alvarez et al 1992 the former two can be complicated when intragranule transfer batstone et al 2004 or a non ideal liquid phase kalyuzhnyi and fedorovich 1997 is considered because the equations need to be solved in each grid point ph prediction is particularly important in anaerobic systems fed with poorly buffered industrial wastewater which is often the case these are prone to failure due to acid type overload also in other cases ph can be critical to determine the biogas quality in terms of carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide concentrations and when ammonia inhibition is likely to take place accordingly ph calculations are included in a fairly high proportion 35 of the anaerobic granular sludge models despite the technical challenges for aerobic and anammox granular sludge reactors ph calculations are only included in models for one aerobic stevens et al 1989 and two anammox jones et al 2007 wett et al 2010 reactors which means that a constant ph is assumed in most cases in aerobic treatment problems with nitrification are expected for low alkalinity or nitrogen rich wastewaters sötemann et al 2005 and about half of the full scale anammox reactors have been reported to have experienced negative effects due to ph fluctuations lackner et al 2014 the large difference in popularity of ph calculations between anaerobic and aerobic anammox reactors might be not purely based on commonly encountered issues it seems that the broad application of ph prediction for anaerobic digestion non granular sludge in literature including adm1 batstone et al 2002 has been adopted for granular sludge systems on the other hand asms do not include extensive ph predictions and this might have influenced aerobic and anammox granular sludge reactor modelling only alkalinity is used as a state variable to identify when ph inhibitions can occur in asm2 and asm3 henze et al 2000 precipitation reactions occur when the solubility of mineral components in the bulk liquid or granules is exceeded these are complex to model as acid base reactions are generally a prerequisite to determine supersaturation and the chemistry involved is not always completely understood wilfert et al 2015 precipitation reactions can occur for all three wastewater treatment processes common precipitants are calcium and magnesium phosphates and carbonates including struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o for example in anammox johansson et al 2017 and aerobic systems lin et al 2012 phosphorus precipitates have been encountered huang et al 2015 this can both contribute to phosphorus removal and open up possibilities for recovery of this nutrient but it is also associated with reduced reactor performance li et al 2011 phosphorus precipitation can also be actively induced by addition of metal salts inside aerobic granular sludge reactors to supplement biological phosphorus removal pronk et al 2015 excessive formation of calcium precipitates in calcium rich industrial wastewaters can cause cementation of anaerobic granular sludge beds batstone and keller 2003 iron sulfide precipitation on the other hand can decrease the sulfide concentration and thus improve the biogas quality wei et al 2018 despite the possible influence of precipitation reactions on the process performance they are only included in eight granular sludge models batstone and keller 2003 feldman et al 2017 feldman et al 2017 provided the most rigorous approach with the largest amount of possible precipitation reactions that can occur in the bulk liquid and even inside granules their work showed that intragranule precipitation may reduce conversion rates due to physical displacement of active biomass from the granules similar phenomena might occur when phosphorus precipitates inside aerobic or anammox granular sludge but this has not been studied yet 6 model complexity the literature survey spreadsheet in supplementary information shows that there is not one generally accepted way to model granular sludge reactors to get an overall idea of the complexity of the models every model feature was assigned a certain score qualitatively representing its complexity and these were summed up to a complexity index of the model as a whole defined by table 3 the complexity of models appears to diverge over time fig 8 more complex models become available in literature feldman et al 2017 fuentes et al 2009c kagawa et al 2015 but simple models are still being used the benefits of simple models are the more straightforward interpretation easier calibration and lower computational demand however complex models describe more processes and thus provide more detailed predictions such as intragranule substrate gradients it is also sometimes believed that more complex models lead to more accurate predictions of the overall reactor performance over a broader range of operational conditions yet as wanner and gujer 1986 state a model should be as simple as possible and only as complex as needed this means that the burden of proof for a higher predictive accuracy always lies with those that develop more complex models in other words a more complex model should only be used if a simpler model failed for the intended application e g a completely mixed reactor has failed to predict the effect of an internal recirculation mu et al 2008a and a biofilm model without attachment has sometimes failed to predict the microbial population distribution qualitatively batstone et al 2004 moreover it is difficult to validate some sub models like intragranule transport for realistic conditions for example micro sensors e g hydrogen gas ph or oxygen can only be used for granules after harvesting them from the reactor and positioning them in specialized laboratory equipment the gradients also differ for different sites on a granule and between different granules van loosdrecht et al 1995 winkler et al 2011 this makes it difficult in practice to know whether the quantitative accuracy of these microscale models is high enough to improve the quantitative predictions of the macroscale reactor performance a mechanistic model could be very strictly defined as one that takes into account every known phenomenon which would lead to a very high complexity our survey found that none of the models do this thus a more pragmatic definition was used namely a model based on mass balances with transport and reaction terms one should acknowledge that every single wastewater treatment model has parameters that cluster several processes because these were not described explicitly for example none of the selected models include the many different species within every microbial group vannecke and volcke 2015 as a second but definitely not conclusive example the 3d architecture of granules is far more complex than ever considered 3d micro colonies exist inside granules picioreanu et al 2016 granules are not perfect spheres de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 and herrling et al 2017 stated that even the diffusivity inside granules is spatially heterogeneous due to variations in the density of the matrix the inclusion of these aspects could lead to more fundamental understanding e g about 3d substrate gradients and microbial competition but it is not per se necessary for optimization or design purposes in practice the estimation of parameters via experiments is always necessary for quantitative simulations to compensate for neglected phenomena problems arise when simulation results are interpreted quantitatively when using parameter values for a complex model that were calibrated for a simpler model or the other way around or when a simulation scenario differs strongly from the conditions during calibration or validation to aid further developments it is thus essential to always clearly state which processes are neglected unfortunately we were unable to identify the assumptions for at least one of the analyzed model features in 32 of the 167 analyzed models 7 model calibration and validation most publications included calibration of the model 75 but less included validation with an independent data set 43 there is especially a lack of published validation results for large scale anammox and aerobic granular sludge reactors only one study shows limited validation results for a full scale anammox based reactor corbala robles et al 2016 and only one for a pilot scale aerobic system stevens et al 1989 of course calibration and or validation is not necessary for all modelling goals for example most partial nitritation anammox granular sludge reactor models did not aim at quantitative predictions but at qualitatively understanding the relationship between micro and mesoscale phenomena also the effect of alternative operational strategies on the reactor performance was explored in general but not for one specific reactor with a specific influent and effluent requirements aerobic granular sludge models on the other hand were mostly used for simulations of lab scale systems this indicates that aerobic and anammox granular sludge models are not yet used in the way that activated sludge models are used for flocculent sludge systems e g to find a cost effective approach to improve an existing full scale plant through changes in the operation or configuration or to design a plant for the treatment of a specific wastewater stream brdjanovic et al 2015 it could also be that models are already used for these purposes for example using commercial simulators but that the results are simply not published in scientific literature 8 future directions 8 1 finding the appropriate degree of complexity it is clear that the appropriate complexity of a model depends on the modelling goal for fundamental insight the required model complexity follows logically from the research question for example if the goal is to assess the influence of the oxygen set point or wastewater type on the microbial population distribution obviously the dynamics of the microbial population should be included by modelling intragranule transport of particulates batstone et al 2004 de kreuk et al 2007b however if the focus is on optimizing the operation or design for a better overall reactor performance the search for optimal complexity to have easy use and interpretation fast simulations and easy calibration while maintaining predictive accuracy is less straightforward two approaches have been put forward for this in literature fig 9 the top down approach starts with a simple model and adds more known underlying phenomena until the macroscale dynamics of interest e g effluent quality are predicted with the required accuracy this approach was used during the development of asms van loosdrecht et al 2008 model validation is an essential part of this approach and it can be used to develop practically applicable models on a reasonable time scale other authors have proposed arnaldos et al 2015 or used a bottom up approach baeten et al 2018 noguera and picioreanu 2004 volcke et al 2012 which uses models with more microscale phenomena to simulate the reactor performance and as such determine under which conditions certain phenomena can be neglected the benefit of this approach is that it is clearly understood why certain simplifications can be made but it is more time consuming both approaches have their value and should be used in parallel to more clearly define the range of operational conditions and modelling goals for which certain assumptions can be made to find the optimal complexity of granular sludge reactor models the most prominent question identified here is when a biofilm model is necessary and when apparent kinetics suffice 8 2 need for mechanistic understanding some phenomena in granular sludge reactors are still poorly understood for example the fate of particulate organics from the influent needs to be elucidated different particle sizes probably react differently for example small colloids could enter the granule matrix while larger particles probably cannot but they might still attach to the surface also the exact role of protozoa in the degradation of particles in aerobic systems is unknown pronk et al 2015 secondly the liquid phase transport in anaerobic systems appears to be unpredictable because of the high sensitivity towards changes in the reactor scale and operation cfd simulations including interactions between the gas and liquid phase of differently sized reactors could help to better understand this dependency and develop rules of thumb for suitable assumptions in simpler reactor models also the hydraulic behaviours of full scale anammox based reactors and aerobic reactors during the unaerated feeding phase may warrant further characterisation finally the mechanistic dependency of detachment and breakage rates on operating conditions needs further study to better understand the development of a granular sludge bed and to simulate changes in the granule size distribution 8 3 model applications first of all more publications with validation results on full scale aerobic and anammox granular sludge reactors could increase confidence in the quantitative simulation results and thus extend the applications beyond general qualitative optimization projects secondly heat balance modelling has further potential since it has only been applied once haugen et al 2015 it could be used to find the optimal balance between heat recovery which lowers the temperature or heating which increases the temperature and biological conversion rates which increase at higher temperatures thirdly given that only a few aerobic granular sludge models considered phosphorus conversions there is still room to better understand and optimize the phosphorus removal that occurs in full scale systems e g to determine the optimal aeration control strategy for phosphorus removal furthermore problems with ph fluctuations in anammox systems could be diagnosed and possibly solved with models further research can also combine available precipitation models mbamba et al 2015 solon et al 2017 with granular sludge models like feldman et al 2017 did for an internal circulation reactor this could help to understand precipitation dynamics in these systems tackle problems caused by excessive precipitation and optimize recovery of resources like phosphorus recent additions of aerobic granular sludge reactor models in commercial simulation software such as biowin and simba might stimulate a wider application of models for granular sludge 9 conclusions this contribution reviewed granular sludge reactor models for anaerobic aerobic and partial nitritation anammox processes a clearly defined modelling goal is not always provided but it is necessary to find an appropriate model complexity and to differentiate between the many other available models the immense variation in assumptions about the key phenomena in a granular sludge reactor can partly be explained by the different reactor types and goals to eliminate habitual assumptions further research should more clearly define the range of operational conditions and goals for which certain approaches can be used in particular the applicability of biofilm models versus the use of apparent kinetics needs further study more mechanistic understanding is needed on the dependency of the detachment rate on the operational conditions the fate of particulate organics and the transition between plug flow and mixed conditions with increasing anaerobic reactor scale more full scale calibration and validation studies would help in extending the applications of aerobic and anammox granular sludge models beyond qualitative studies and quantitative predictions on lab scale e g to diagnose and prevent ph problems and optimize biological

19127,wastewater treatment processes with granular sludge are compact and are becoming increasingly popular interest has been accompanied by the development of mathematical models this contribution simultaneously reviews available models in the scientific literature for anaerobic aerobic and partial nitritation anammox granular sludge reactors because they comprise common phenomena e g liquid gas and granule transport and thus pose similar challenges many of the publications were found to have no clearly defined goal the importance of a goal is stressed because it determines the appropriate model complexity and helps other potential users to find a suitable model in the vast amount of literature secondly a wide variety was found in the model features this review explains the chosen modelling assumptions based on the different reactor types and goals wherever possible but some assumptions appeared to be habitual within fields of research without clear reason we therefore suggest further research to more clearly define the range of operational conditions and goals for which certain simplifying assumptions can be made e g when intragranule solute transport can be lumped in apparent kinetics and when biofilm models are needed which explicitly calculate substrate concentration gradients inside granules furthermore research is needed to better mechanistically understand detachment removal of influent particulate matter and changes in the mixing behaviour inside anaerobic systems before these phenomena can be adequately incorporated in models finally it is suggested to perform full scale model validation studies for aerobic and anammox reactors a spreadsheet in the supplementary information provides an overview of the features in the 167 reviewed models graphical abstract image 1 keywords granular sludge model wastewater anammox anaerobic digestion asm 1 introduction granular sludge technology underpins key emerging and established technologies for wastewater treatment across industrial and municipal sectors pollutant removal in these reactors relies on microorganisms that grow in approximately spherical aggregates biofilms that can freely move within the reactor compared to flocs granules have a higher biomass density and a more regular shape they are mechanically stronger and they can become larger liu and tay 2004 these characteristics can lead to microscale substrate concentration gradients inside the aggregates but even more importantly they lead to high settling velocities winkler et al 2018 fast settling is the common benefit of all types of granular sludge it facilitates solid liquid separation and therefore allows high reactor biomass concentrations nicolella et al 2000 in addition granular sludge reactors provide a high biofilm specific surface area morgenroth 2008 and the geometry and free movement of granules limits external boundary layer resistances promoting mass transfer of substrate towards the organisms the combination of the high biomass concentration and fast mass transfer allows high removal rates ultimately enabling compact installations heijnen et al 1993 anaerobic granular sludge has been applied in upflow sludge blanket reactors since the 1970s lettinga et al 1980 and later in variations of this technology to remove organic pollution from wastewater through biological conversion into biogas the potential to recover energy in compact installations with a low sludge production made anaerobic granular sludge technologies very popular van lier 2008 especially for industrial wastewaters aerobic treatment processes using small spherical carriers for biofilm growth were developed in the 1970s for removal of organics and ammonium jeris et al 1977 later combined with nitrate and nitrite removal under anoxic conditions via denitrification nutt et al 1984 self sustained granules for aerobic treatment only became feasible much later with the development of a sequencing batch reactor technology which also enables biological phosphorus removal de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 this has evolved into a mature technology with distinct benefits compared to conventional activated sludge systems it requires 25 75 less space due high biomass concentrations and the absence of settling tanks and it has 20 50 lower energy demands due to the lack of recycle and sludge return pumps and mixers pronk et al 2017 moreover the waste sludge offers potential for recovery of valuable biopolymers lin et al 2015 the discovery of the anammox reaction mulder et al 1995 stimulated the development of a third important type of granular sludge technology one stage partial nitritation anammox is now frequently used to treat nitrogen rich wastewaters lackner et al 2014 this also offers potential for the recovery of phosphorus because it can accumulate inside the granules johansson et al 2017 granular sludge is also promising for emerging biological treatment processes such as phototrophic processes abouhend et al 2016 and sulfide based organics removal hao et al 2013 and denitrification yang et al 2016 but these are not yet available at commercial scale modelling is a widely acknowledged tool for fundamental understanding design and optimization of wastewater treatment processes van loosdrecht et al 2008 reviews on wastewater treatment models have generally focussed on either anaerobic batstone et al 2015 liotta et al 2015 sadino riquelme et al 2018 tomei et al 2009 or aerobic processes hauduc et al 2013 karpinska and bridgeman 2016 liotta et al 2014 because these require different redox conditions except for nicolella et al 2000 liu and tay 2004 and milferstedt et al 2017a reviews focussing on granular sludge have discussed anaerobic chong et al 2012 saravanan and sreekrishnan 2006 schmidt and ahring 1996 and aerobic processes bengtsson et al 2018 ni and yu 2010a winkler et al 2018 separately as well however from a physical and chemical point of view anaerobic aerobic and partial nitritation anammox granular sludge reactors share much in common such as hydrolysis of particulate substrates interactions between gas bubbles and the water phase mass transfer of substrates from the bulk liquid to the granule surface and acid base reactions also stable granule formation probably relies on the same interplay between mass transfer of solutes conversion rates and detachment forces van loosdrecht et al 2002 therefore modelling these different reactors poses largely the same challenges this review discusses models of anaerobic aerobic and partial nitritation anammox granular sludge reactors together to assess commonalities and discrepancies in approaches first the scope of the review is defined next the different modelling goals of the studies are discussed the two main sections describe differences in assumptions about transport phenomena and transformations and explain them based on the different reactor types and modelling goals wherever possible as such suggestions for further modelling studies are extracted and habitual assumptions and gaps in the knowledge are identified afterwards the trends advantages and disadvantages of model complexity are discussed next the availability of calibration and validation studies for different reactor scales is discussed and finally future research needs are summarized 2 scope and key phenomena 2 1 scope of the review this review focuses on mechanistic models for reactors with mixed microbial granules published in the english scientific literature the review was limited to anaerobic aerobic and partial nitritation anammox often referred to as simply anammox further on granular sludge reactors that are commercially available as these are commonly applied and numerous modelling studies exist eight different reactor types with or without small carriers were identified upflow sludge blanket expanded granular sludge bed internal circulation baffled fluidized bed air lift sequencing batch and simple aerated reactors fig 1 mechanistic models are here understood as models that are based on mass balances with transport and reaction terms models that only describe batch tests were not considered because the focus is on models for operational reactors as a whole meaning they can predict the effluent concentration of at least one substrate i e pollutant in case more than one model for a single reactor type was described in a publication only the model that the authors labelled as the most accurate or reference was analyzed with these selection criteria this review covers 164 publications including 167 models table 1 provides an overview and the spreadsheet in supplementary information shows the model features omitting yearly fluctuations there has been an increase in publication rate from the first publication in 1981 until 1997 followed by a brief decline and then another increase until it stagnated around 2006 fig 2 a the first publications modelling aerobic systems described fluidized bed and air lift reactors but most models for aerobic systems were developed for sequencing batch reactors fig 2b because the focus shifted almost completely since 2001 preceding the commercialization of this technology de kreuk et al 2007a anaerobic granular sludge models appeared a few years after the invention of the technology lettinga et al 1980 models for upflow sludge blanket reactors are by far the most abundant in literature followed by anaerobic fluidized bed reactors fig 2b but interest in the latter type has sharply declined in the last decade as application of the technology also decreased van lier et al 2016 in 2007 the first model for one reactor partial nitritation anammox granular sludge was published quickly following the full scale implementation of the technology wett 2007 2 2 key phenomena in granular sludge reactors a number of key phenomena based on wanner et al 2006 that occur in granular sludge reactors can be included in models fig 3 transformations both biological conversions e g nitrification and purely physico chemical reactions occur such as precipitation and acid base reactions these are the main drivers for the removal of pollutants e g ammonia organics or phosphate and production of sludge biomass and precipitates liquid phase transport liquid flows through a reactor with a certain pattern influencing the transport of solutes and colloidal matter through advection the hydraulics determine whether the liquid phase is well mixed or shows spatial gradients granule transport granules move as a result of gravity drag and contact forces e g collision with a separator the balance of these forces regulates the retention of granules inside the system and the distribution of biomass along the reactor height there is a mutual interaction between the movement of granules solid phase and liquid intragranule transport solutes move through the granule matrix primarily via diffusion but also advection can take place via pores together with the biological conversions and physico chemical reactions this determines the concentration gradients inside granules also matrix embedded particles and microorganisms move which influences the microbial population distribution inside granules liquid granule mass transfer solutes are exchanged across the external mass transfer boundary layer surrounding granules and are subsequently potentially adsorbed onto the biofilm matrix these processes can influence the removal rate of pollutants from the wastewater also exchange of particulate components through detachment and attachment occurs this can affect the microbial population distribution inside granules and the granule size granule transformations and size distribution granules can grow shrink and break up together with granule transport e g wash out of small granules this determines the size distribution which ranges from small flocs to millimetre thick granules pereboom 1994 pronk et al 2015 vlaeminck et al 2010 gas phase transport the gas phase air or biogas mostly moves upwards due to buoyant forces but can also flow downwards e g in the downcomer of air lift reactors the gas transport mutually interacts with the liquid phase transport the different gas phase constituents such as oxygen o2 carbon dioxide co2 methane ch4 hydrogen sulfide h2s nitrous oxide n2o nitric oxide no and nitrogen gas n2 can be well mixed or show concentration gradients liquid gas mass transfer components such as oxygen and methane experience a resistance when exchanged between the gas and the liquid phase due to stagnant layers on the inside and outside of a bubble this resistance determines the mass transfer rate and therefore affects the distribution of compounds between the liquid and gas phase heat transport and production heat enters and leaves via the liquid through work done by mechanical equipment and through heat exchange with the environment while biological conversions and physico chemical reactions can produce heat these phenomena determine the temperature distribution in the reactor a spreadsheet in the supplementary information provides a complete overview of the assumptions that were made for these key phenomena in all the analyzed models it also indicates the applications that were proposed or demonstrated the scale of the largest modelled reactor whether calibration and or validation was performed and which software was used for modelling and simulation this spreadsheet is available as a tool for practitioners and scientists to find an appropriate model to tackle their specific problem 3 modelling goal given the vast number of published models and the variation among them it becomes ever more important to specifically state the model purpose in every publication still one third of the analyzed models had no specific goal or at least it was not clearly defined the publications may state that the model is capable of characterisation description understanding prediction simulation design optimization or control of a system but this is very general it does not differentiate the model in comparison with other available models for example if a model is said to be suitable for design it is not clear whether this means that it can determine the required reactor volume the optimal height to width ratio or the required capacity of aerators therefore we did not consider such general applications or goals this does not mean that the models are not useful only that the applications are not clearly communicated generally speaking three different types of applications of granular sludge reactor models could be distinguished table 2 the first type is to gain fundamental insight in the relationship between micro and mesoscale phenomena e g intragranule transport and macroscale reactor operation e g influent characteristics and performance e g effluent quality the second type is the assessment of alternative operational strategies or reactor plant designs to have a better overall reactor performance for this micro or mesoscale phenomena were sometimes included but only the prediction of the macroscale reactor behaviour was of interest finally the third application is to extract more information from measurements e g about the microbial activity of course this pragmatic classification of goals is not absolute e g models that are primarily used for fundamental insight are often used also for design and optimization and some models that were purely used for design optimization questions in a publication also have potential to gain more fundamental insight still it gives a structure to the vast amount of publications 4 transport and mass transfer phenomena this section discusses how transport of substrates and organisms inside the liquid granule and gas phase or transport of these phases themselves has been included in models to calculate different kinds of spatial heterogeneity in a reactor fig 4 illustrates the multi scale nature of this spatial heterogeneity which will be further elaborated in the subsections 4 1 liquid phase transport liquid phase transport patterns depend on the reactor geometry hu et al 2017 inlet flow wang et al 2009 inlet distribution asif et al 1992 and gas production or injection buffiere et al 1998 for anaerobic granular sludge reactors the absence of aeration induced mixing explains why spatial concentration gradients of soluble compounds are often considered fig 5 this was done assuming an ideal plug flow bonnet et al 1997 wang shi and zhou 1994 combinations of tanks bolle et al 1986 tanaka et al 1981 the advection dispersion equation kalyuzhnyi et al 2006 seifi and fazaelipoor 2012 or computational fluid dynamics cfd yang et al 2015 the latter is the only technique that can predict the mixing behaviour instead of assuming it only some authors verified the hydraulic behaviour using tracer tests or measurements of concentration profiles in the specific modelled reactor huang et al 2003 lin and yang 1995 no studies experimentally verified complete mixing in baffled fluidized bed or internal circulation reactors even though it has been assumed it seems contradictory that an ideal plug flow or non ideal flow has been assumed slightly more often for large scale than for lab scale anaerobic sludge blanket reactors zoom on fig 5 because experiments have shown that mixing improves with the scale batstone et al 2005 in expanded granular sludge bed reactors both thorough mixing chou et al 2008 fuentes et al 2011 and semi plug flow behaviour has been observed yang et al 2015 zheng et al 2012 on both large and small scale because the liquid phase transport can differ even between two anaerobic reactors of the same type tracer tests or measurements of gradients are preferred whenever possible if the reactor is still to be built e g if a model is used for design tracer tests from reactors with a similar scale operation and construction can give an approximation but also preliminary cfd calculations with a simplified conversion model could help find an appropriate assumption for baffled reactors in particular the experimental evidence and physical compartmentation encourages to always assume a non ideal flow bachmann et al 1985 li et al 2016b finally semi plug flow behaviour is essential for specific applications e g to assess the effect of an internal recirculation flow mu et al 2008a or short circuiting bolle et al 1986 for aerobic and partial nitritation anammox reactors the choice of a flow pattern is often more straightforward because active air injection induces mixing only for fluidized bed reactors tracer tests and measurements of concentration gradients have confirmed that complete mixing cannot always be assumed seifi and fazaelipoor 2012 stevens et al 1989 which is reflected in fig 5 for one stage partial nitritation anammox reactors the assumption of a completely mixed liquid phase has not yet received experimental verification even though it seems a reasonable assumption due to the active aeration for aerobic sequencing batch reactors it is known that semi plug flow behaviour exists during the unaerated feeding phase but this has not been considered in whole reactor models yet weissbrodt et al 2017 4 2 granules 4 2 1 granule transport no heterogeneous vertical distribution of biomass is considered in aerobic and anammox based granular sludge reactors except sometimes during a settling phase this is justified by the air induced mixing of the sludge bed in contrast a vertical biomass concentration profile is considered in 31 of the anaerobic granular sludge models because it is also often experimentally observed lettinga et al 1980 wu and huang 1996 sometimes the profile is predefined in the model based on measurements feldman et al 2017 or an educated guess sam soon et al 1991 but often the profile is predicted more mechanistically through mass transport as a result of upward drag forces and gravity acting upon the sludge bed bolle et al 1986 bonnet et al 1997 only when plug flow characteristics are considered do the simulated effluent concentrations become sensitive to the assumption of a vertical biomass distribution an uneven distribution of biomass has no effect on the reactor performance if the liquid phase is completely mixed to avoid that the simulated biomass concentration becomes unrealistically high models with biomass growth need to include washout from the reactor as well apart from decay models for anaerobic reactors often 49 consider imperfect retention of granules by imposing a predefined solids retention time eq 1 as suggested in the adm1 report batstone et al 2002 or by using a fixed solids separation efficiency bolle et al 1986 1 dx reactor i dt q in x in i v reactor x reactor i srt r i where xreactor i represents the concentration of a microbial group i or other

rates of the group e g of decay and growth g m 3 d 1 sometimes the degree of retention is incorporated more mechanistically via the settling behaviour of granules and advective upflow kalyuzhnyi et al 2006 saravanan and sreekrishnan 2008 as described above for granule transport inside the reactor only a few models for aerobic and partial nitritation anammox reactors estimate the washout of granules via a fixed separation efficiency wett et al 2010 or mechanistic settling behaviour kagawa et al 2015 su et al 2013 in fact most aerobic 87 and anammox 80 models that consider biomass growth assume that granules are perfectly retained beun et al 2001 stevens et al 1989 tang et al 1987 volcke et al 2010 this means that no granules are lost via the effluent but loss of biomass through detachment followed by wash out of suspended cells or by intentional sludge removal can still be considered the two approaches can also be combined by defining a perfectly retained granule fraction and imperfectly suspended biomass fraction corbala robles et al 2016 hubaux et al 2015 pons et al 2008 it is not immediately clear why imperfect granule retention is so common for anaerobic systems while perfect retention is often used for aerobic and anammox systems fig 6 it could be partly habitual within each of these scientific domains possibly authors interested in modelling anaerobic systems were inspired by previous models of such systems and those about to model aerobic and anammox systems based their assumptions on existing models of these systems respectively as such a habit can arise a few models did not consider any retention of biomass compared to the liquid phase i e hrt srt ghorbanian et al 2014a b setiadi et al 1996 shi et al 2016 this last approach misses one of the key characteristics of granular sludge reactors namely that granules settle fast and are therefore easily retained reach high concentrations and as such allow high volumetric conversion rates 4 2 2 intragranule transport models of granular sludge reactors can be divided into two main categories those that consider the intragranule transport biofilm models and those that treat biomass as a suspension in the liquid phase using apparent kinetics biofilm models calculate the macroscale conversion rate by solving the mass balance of substrates inside granules the intragranule substrate concentration profile and related flux are derived considering simultaneous conversion and diffusion wanner et al 2006 e g eq 2 assumes monod kinetics and 1d radial transport 2 b i o f i l m m o d e l c i z t t a c c u m u l a t i o n d i 2 c i z t z 2 2 z c i z t z d i f f u s i v e t r a n s p o r t r i max c i z t x i z t c i z t k r e a c t i o n where ci is the local substrate concentration g

for the conversion g m 3 and k the intrinsic half saturation coefficient g m 3 appropriate boundary conditions are applied normally spherical symmetry and a bulk concentration biomass concentrations inside the granules and granule geometry size may be likewise included in biofilm models as state variables see below mass transport between the bulk liquid and the microorganisms inside the biofilm decreases macroscale conversion rates compared to suspended systems with the same amount of biomass this effect becomes more pronounced with a thicker biofilm faster local conversion rates through a higher local biomass concentration and or specific uptake rate or lower substrate diffusivity wang shi and zhou 1994 this may be considered fundamentally through biofilm modelling as outlined above however when granular sludge is treated as a suspension intragranule transport is not explicitly simulated so this effect on the macroscale rates should be represented through modified kinetic parameters apparent kinetics are thus obtained for example by increasing half saturation coefficients eq 3 to incorporate the diffusional resistance beccari et al 1992 manser et al 2005 pérez et al 2005 3 apparent kinetics r i apparent t r i max c i t x i t c i t k app where ri apparent is the macroscale substrate uptake rate g m 3 d 1 at time t d ci the bulk substrate concentration g m 3 and kapp the apparent half saturation coefficient g m 3 changes in the granule size microbial population distribution and competition between different microbial groups for the same substrates e g competition for oxygen between nitrifiers and heterotrophs can alter the apparent kinetics which may require re calibration baeten et al 2018 only a minority explicitly modelled intragranule transport of substrates using a biofilm model for anaerobic granular sludge 21 of the analyzed models even though intragranule transport has been shown to significantly influence macroscale rates for at least sludge blanket wu and hickey 1997 expanded granular sludge bed chou et al 2008 and fluidized bed reactors seok and komisar 2003b this means that the use of apparent kinetics is widespread for anaerobic granular sludge 77 of the reviewed models in contrast more than three quarters of the aerobic and anammox granular sludge models explicitly describe intragranule solute transport it is not immediately clear why biofilm models are more common for aerobic and anammox systems while apparent kinetics are mostly used for anaerobic ones fig 6 adm1 might be more complex than most aerobic or anammox conversion models but it is still reasonably technically straightforward to apply it in a biofilm model with dedicated software like aquasim reichert 1994 the difference in popularity can also not be solely explained by an increased availability of tools or computing power since many models for anaerobic systems with apparent kinetics were published in the same period as biofilm models for aerobic systems fig s1 a possible explanation is that publications on aerobic beun et al 2001 de kreuk et al 2007a kagawa et al 2015 winkler et al 2015b and anammox systems castro barros et al 2018 corbala robles et al 2016 mozumder et al 2014 volcke et al 2010 often looked into intragranule substrate profiles and ecological interactions between different microorganisms insight while those dealing with anaerobic systems generally focussed more on overall reactor design and optimization batstone and keller 2003 kleerebezem 2003 lohani et al 2016 mu et al 2007 yetilmezsoy 2012 or were used for monitoring biological activity lopez and borzacconi 2011 perez et al 2001 not only solutes but also matrix embedded particles and microorganisms can move throughout a granule which influences the microbial population distribution along the granule depth therefore this distribution is dependent on the reactor operating conditions even for the same type of reactor batstone et al 2004 such dynamics can be described mechanistically with an intragranule mass balance for biomass as state variables including reaction and transport terms analogous to eq 3 this time diffusive transport is often neglected but advective transport is required because a net growth of microorganisms causes biofilm geometry to move i e deeper layers push outer layers outwards the advective velocity of particles and microorganisms towards the granule surface is often calculated in 1d with eq 4 as this is used in aquasim wanner and reichert 1996 4 advective velocity u advection t z 1 a z 0 z 1 1 ε l

used to consider these dynamics in granules kagawa et al 2015 xavier et al 2007 which considers microorganisms as discrete entities instead of a continuum this approach is especially relevant to study the 2d or 3d heterogeneity of granules fig 4c but comes at a high computational cost de kreuk et al 2007a a dynamic microbial population distribution has been predicted mechanistically in all the biofilm models for anammox reactors but some of the biofilm models for aerobic and anaerobic systems used a predefined distribution either heterogeneous huang et al 2006 saravanan and sreekrishnan 2008 tang et al 1987 wu and hickey 1997 or homogeneous chou et al 2011a huang et al 2011 huang et al 2006 claimed that 1d biomass spatial heterogeneity is necessary to effectively simulate the performance of an upflow sludge blanket reactor however the fact that 28 of the analyzed publications used a homogeneous distribution bachmann et al 1985 rodriguez gomez et al 2014 or even neglected all intragranule transport processes indicates that these effects are often lumped in apparent kinetic parameters moreover it has been shown that dense micro colonies of nitrifiers which can only be described in 2d or 3d can influence the macroscale kinetics picioreanu et al 2016 this shows that even kinetic parameters that are calibrated for 1d biofilm models might cluster some processes when dense micro colonies are present 4 2 3 liquid granule transfer adsorption of solutes on the biofilm matrix is hardly ever considered kennedy et al 2001 sam soon et al 1991 tsuneda et al 2002 even though organic compounds can adsorb onto anaerobic granules ning et al 1997 and ammonium can adsorb on anammox li et al 2016c and aerobic granules the latter is probably caused by the attraction between the negatively charged granule matrix and positively charged ammonium ions bassin et al 2011 these adsorption processes could play a role in the removal of these pollutants the compounds are transferred from the liquid phase to the solid phase decreasing their discharge with the effluent and enabling removal with the waste sludge at the same time adsorption may reduce the availability for biological conversions desorption can occur when bulk liquid concentrations decrease again bassin et al 2011 solutes need to pass through an external boundary layer prior to reaching the granule surface its negative effect on the overall conversion rates becomes stronger when the local uptake rate inside the biofilm or boundary layer thickness increases and when the limiting substrate concentration or diffusivity decreases picioreanu 2015 wu and hickey 1997 chou et al 2008 and wu and huang 1995 estimated that the external resistance was not rate limiting in the upflow sludge blanket expanded granular sludge bed and anaerobic fluidized bed reactors they respectively studied stevens et al 1989 also found that it was not rate limiting in an aerobic fluidized bed reactor whereas tang et al 1987 judged it to be important for an airlift reactor vangsgaard et al 2012 found that it can sometimes be influential for anammox based systems so even though the extra turbulence created by aeration in anammox based and aerobic systems can decrease the boundary layer thickness other influencing factors can make its effect significant especially a rapid oxygen uptake rate and relatively low bulk oxygen concentrations understandably an external mass transfer resistance is considered most often in aerobic granular sludge models 31 it is advisable for future modelling to make a rough estimation of the effect for aerobic and anammox based reactors under the specific operating conditions as in stevens et al 1989 if quantitative predictions are aimed at alternatively the effect can be clustered in apparent kinetic parameters if no significant changes in the turbulence or other influencing factors are expected also solids and microorganisms undergo liquid granule transfer through attachment onto the granule surface and detachment from the surface detachment has a strong impact on biofilm thickness in the long term wanner et al 2006 consequently steady state simulations with biofilm models that included intragranule transport of microorganisms always considered detachment to avoid predicting unrealistically large granule sizes except for kagawa et al 2015 who focussed on the start up of a reactor the detachment rate is often defined with an equation to obtain a specific predefined steady state granule size for example eq 5 was used by volcke et al 2010 5 d e t a c h m e n t velocity u detachment δ δ steady state 10 u advection δ where udetachment represents the detachment velocity m d 1 δ the simulated granule radius δ steady state the predefined steady state radius which is either measured or based on experience with similar systems m and uadvection δ is the advective velocity with which the granule expands due to biomass growth eq 4 this approach allows a dynamic microbial population distribution while keeping the granule size below a realistic limit but it cannot actually predict the granule size also the convergence rate to the steady state size relies on the arbitrary exponent 10 a realistic convergence rate can only be obtained a posteriori through calibration of such empirical parameters ni et al 2010 finally only a few publications considered attachment batstone et al 2004 showed that modelling attachment was necessary to explain the observed acidogenic layer in anaerobic granules treating brewery wastewater 4 2 4 granule transformations and size distribution the majority of granular sludge models 82 assume a single granule size with a predefined steady state value or implicitly assume a constant granule size by using constant apparent kinetics sixteen models predict the size dynamically without a predefined steady state value but this has never been done for partial nitritation anammox based reactors some predicted the granule size without using detachment e g rodriguez gomez et al 2014 meaning that the granule size is only limited by decay the accuracy of the predicted size is doubtful for long term simulations in these cases since detachment is driven by liquid shear and granule shear strength its rate is a function of the operating conditions for example odriozola et al 2016 su et al 2013 and fuentes et al 2008a applied an empirical equation linking the detachment rate to the biogas production rate and liquid upflow velocity or aeration rate the generalizability of such equations is uncertain as they contain an empirical parameter that might require calibration for different reactor operating conditions which again makes it non predictive detachment rates can in principle be determined mechanistically from biofilm strength and liquid shear rate horn and lackner 2014 van loosdrecht et al 2002 it might also be possible to estimate the granule shear strength based on influent wastewater properties batstone and keller 2001 yet integrating these aspects to fundamentally dynamically predict the granule size has not yet been done even though it is technically possible note that a dynamic granule size only affects the predicted macro scale conversion rates directly if intragranule solute transport is included otherwise only indirect effects are considered such as the better settleability of bigger granules and accompanying higher biomass concentration e g in kalyuzhnyi et al 2006 and fuentes et al 2009a some models consider the size distribution of granules inside a reactor the simplest approach is to distinguish two classes granules and suspended sludge fuentes et al 2008c hubaux et al 2015 pons et al 2008 but more size classes have also been used feldman et al 2017 huang et al 2003 su and yu 2006a wu and huang 1996 volcke et al 2012 showed that the use of a single average granule size is sufficient to predict the effluent nitrogen concentration and speciation from a partial nitritation anammox reactor odriozola et al 2016 also found that the predicted methane production and effluent soluble substrate concentrations were similar with and without considering the granule size distribution in an anaerobic system this means that a size distribution is only necessary for fundamental understanding e g to get insight in the solute exchange between different size classes to get insight in the formation of a granular sludge bed a size distribution as well as the dynamics of each size class need to be considered this has been done in three publications odriozola et al 2016 seok and komisar 2003a su et al 2013 su et al 2013 provides the most comprehensive approach using a population balance model for an aerobic granular sludge reactor apart from the mass balances of particulate and soluble compounds such models use balances on the number of particles in each size class by estimating wash out growth break up into smaller pieces etc as such the selective retention of larger granules can be simulated which is seen as one of the factors promoting granulation of sludge beun 1999 because this approach still relies on calibrated relationships for the detachment rate as discussed above and a calibrated granule breakage probability it is difficult to quantitatively predict the granule size distribution before a reactor is operational e g for design purposes this might even be impossible in a quantitative deterministic way given the complex mutual interaction between the shear stress and granule shear strength and stochastic processes like the influent composition temperature microbial species and related kinetics and breakage events 4 3 gas phase transport and liquid gas transfer more than half of the selected models 56 assume an instant equilibrium between the gas and liquid phase concentrations or do not consider transfer of gases at all for example the liquid gas transfer resistance of methane in anaerobic systems is often neglected probably because it is the final product of the conversions and will therefore not directly influence the predicted conversion rates nonetheless if the biogas composition flow or induced mixing is of interest liquid gas transfer is important pauss et al 1990 gas entrapment onto or inside granules can also cause sludge to rise in anaerobic bolle et al 1986 and anammox based reactors van hulle et al 2010 this effect has never been included explicitly but it has been incorporated through calibrated correction parameters to predict the vertical biomass concentration distribution in a reactor as well as wash out bolle et al 1986 kalyuzhnyi et al 2006 when modelling aerobic and anammox based reactors the influence of the liquid phase oxygen concentration has often been studied directly so the gas phase is actually not of interest therefore resistances in the liquid gas boundary layer for oxygen are neglected by choosing an unrealistically high transfer rate beun et al 2001 volcke et al 2010 yet a realistic oxygen transfer resistance would be required to quantify the necessary airflow rate to obtain a certain liquid phase oxygen concentration garcia ochoa and gomez 2009 the mass transfer dynamics are also crucial to compare different online control strategies for aeration e g under variations in load a well known application of activated sludge models åmand and carlsson 2012 belchior et al 2012 the delay between an increase in the aeration rate and the resulting increase in the dissolved oxygen concentration due to the mass transfer resistance can be important along with other dynamics like the sensor response times alex et al 2008 when a liquid gas mass transfer resistance is used for gases an assumption about the transport phenomena within the gas phase needs to be made mostly a completely mixed gas phase is used but some publications consider that vertical concentration gradients can exist within the gas phase for now the only clear benefit of this model feature is that concentration gradients inside the gas phase can be estimated wisecarver and fan 1989 but there might be some indirect effects on the predicted effluent quality aeration requirements or biogas quality which have not yet been investigated explicitly 5 transformations 5 1 biological conversions biological conversions occurring in anaerobic aerobic and partial nitritation anammox granular sludge reactors show overlap because some processes are not specific for certain redox conditions e g hydrolysis and because anaerobic and anoxic conditions can exist in aerobic and anammox based reactors due to spatial and temporal heterogeneity fig 7 most models include biological conversions of substrate as a primary function these can include different types of organics ammonium nitrate and nitrite phosphorus and sulfate under anaerobic anoxic and aerobic conditions models of anaerobic granular sludge reactors all include the conversion of organics to methane because this is the primary goal a varying degree of detail has been used regarding the actual pathways conversions of sulfate are generally not included fedorovich et al 2003 pokorna krayzelova et al 2017 sun et al 2016 but are important for sulfate containing wastewaters since sulfate is readily reduced to sulfide causing odour corrosion and safety issues the sulfide concentration in biogas increases almost linearly with the influent sulfate to organics ratio at low sulfate concentrations batstone 2006 pokorna krayzelova et al 2017 high sulfate concentrations 0 125 g s g cod 1 also significantly reduce methane production due to inhibition of conversions by sulfide vavilin et al 1995 and because sulfate reducing bacteria compete with methanogens for organic substrates for aerobic systems most models consider organics and ammonium conversions sometimes combined with denitrification of nitrite nitrate depending on the wastewater composition and presence of anoxic conditions only four out of 22 models for aerobic sequencing batch reactors include biological phosphorus removal because they were often developed for lab scale reactors with short feeding phases however in full scale systems nereda slow anaerobic feeding is applied to promote phosphate accumulating organisms and achieve more stable granules de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 pronk et al 2015 this constitutes a substantial discrepancy between available models and practice furthermore the models that did consider phosphorus conversions in a reactor with slow anaerobic feeding required significant alterations of the kinetic parameters of phosphate accumulating organisms in order to match experimental results de kreuk et al 2007b winkler et al 2015b xavier et al 2007 which might be due to an inappropriate description of their metabolism barnard et al 2017 in anammox based systems ammonium and nitrate nitrite conversions via nitritation and anammox are always considered but conversions of organics are sometimes neglected because these are generally not the main target nevertheless about 300 1400 mg cod l 1 is removed in full scale reactors lackner et al 2014 and these conversions influence the total nitrogen removal mozumder et al 2014 so it is always recommended to include denitrification and aerobic oxidation of organics particulate organics were considered as separate state variable s in thirty models for anaerobic granular sludge reactors but this was rarely done for aerobic or anammox based systems this lack of particulates conversions in the latter two probably originates from the more complex hydrolysis kinetics that are usually assumed for aerobic henze et al 2000 compared to anaerobic sludge batstone et al 2002 activated sludge models asms henze et al 2000 use a hydrolysis rate dependent on the concentration of heterotrophic organisms eq 6 6 a s m r particulate k m 1 m i x particulate x heterotrophs k x particulate x heterotrophs x heterotrophs where rparticulate is the removal rate of particulates g m 3 d 1 k is a rate coefficient d 1 mi are monod expressions k is a half saturation coefficient xparticulate the concentration of particulate organics g m 3 and xheterotrophs the concentration of heterotrophs g m 3 such kinetics are not easily compatible with biofilm models which are often used for aerobic and anammox granular sludge reactors the reason is that biofilm models assume that most of the heterotrophic organisms reside inside the granules on the other hand particulates enter via the bulk liquid and thus they do not come into contact with heterotrophs as such the predicted rate eq 6 is zero in the granules because xparticulate is zero and the rate is small or zero in the bulk liquid because xheterotrophs is small or zero removal would thus only be predicted if liquid granule transfer attachment and or intragranule transport of particulates are defined to bring this substrate in contact with heterotrophs but the rates of these transport processes are rarely analyzed and the exact mechanisms are poorly understood boltz et al 2010 pronk et al 2015 it is unclear how some biofilm models predicted removal of influent particulates without defining any transfer of particulates to aerobic granules ni et al 2009 ni et al 2008 su and yu 2006a b lübken et al 2005 and pons et al 2008 could apply asm type kinetics because they assumed a suspension of biomass no biofilm modelling meaning that both the particulate organics and heterotrophs reside in the bulk liquid simpler kinetics could be used in future biofilm models for aerobic and anammox granules eq 7 as often applied for anaerobic granular sludge systems batstone et al 2004 and mu et al 2008a this more empirical approach predicts conversion irrespective of the contact between the substrate and heterotrophs 7 a d m r particulate k x p a r t i c u l a t e biological conversions of substrates are generally linked to biomass growth biological wastewater treatment is an autocatalytic process in the sense that biomass is the catalyst for the degradation of substrates and at the same time more biomass is created during these conversions most models consider this explicitly by using one or more microbial groups e g heterotrophs and nitrifiers as state variables the total amount or microbial composition of the biomass is then calculated via mass balances which include a growth term nevertheless about one third of the models for anaerobic and aerobic reactors do not include microbial growth they assume a fixed amount of biomass for every microbial group or simply use a fixed maximal conversion rate when these models are used to design the required reactor volume the expected biomass concentration or maximal conversion rate must be assumed for an already operational reactor these parameters can be measured directly and used as parameters yet without growth changes in the biomass or conversion capacity cannot be predicted therefore these models are less suitable to simulate long term changes in operating conditions or to design reactors for a significantly different wastewater composition concentration or loading rate 5 2 physico chemical reactions the reactor ph is affected by acid base consumption and production during biological conversions and can in turn influence biological conversion rates the ph can be calculated by solving implicit algebraic acid base equations costello et al 1991a by solving differential equations with reaction rates batstone et al 2004 or through reformulation to an explicit expression for the hydrogen ion concentration ph log h in simple cases alvarez et al 1992 the former two can be complicated when intragranule transfer batstone et al 2004 or a non ideal liquid phase kalyuzhnyi and fedorovich 1997 is considered because the equations need to be solved in each grid point ph prediction is particularly important in anaerobic systems fed with poorly buffered industrial wastewater which is often the case these are prone to failure due to acid type overload also in other cases ph can be critical to determine the biogas quality in terms of carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide concentrations and when ammonia inhibition is likely to take place accordingly ph calculations are included in a fairly high proportion 35 of the anaerobic granular sludge models despite the technical challenges for aerobic and anammox granular sludge reactors ph calculations are only included in models for one aerobic stevens et al 1989 and two anammox jones et al 2007 wett et al 2010 reactors which means that a constant ph is assumed in most cases in aerobic treatment problems with nitrification are expected for low alkalinity or nitrogen rich wastewaters sötemann et al 2005 and about half of the full scale anammox reactors have been reported to have experienced negative effects due to ph fluctuations lackner et al 2014 the large difference in popularity of ph calculations between anaerobic and aerobic anammox reactors might be not purely based on commonly encountered issues it seems that the broad application of ph prediction for anaerobic digestion non granular sludge in literature including adm1 batstone et al 2002 has been adopted for granular sludge systems on the other hand asms do not include extensive ph predictions and this might have influenced aerobic and anammox granular sludge reactor modelling only alkalinity is used as a state variable to identify when ph inhibitions can occur in asm2 and asm3 henze et al 2000 precipitation reactions occur when the solubility of mineral components in the bulk liquid or granules is exceeded these are complex to model as acid base reactions are generally a prerequisite to determine supersaturation and the chemistry involved is not always completely understood wilfert et al 2015 precipitation reactions can occur for all three wastewater treatment processes common precipitants are calcium and magnesium phosphates and carbonates including struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o for example in anammox johansson et al 2017 and aerobic systems lin et al 2012 phosphorus precipitates have been encountered huang et al 2015 this can both contribute to phosphorus removal and open up possibilities for recovery of this nutrient but it is also associated with reduced reactor performance li et al 2011 phosphorus precipitation can also be actively induced by addition of metal salts inside aerobic granular sludge reactors to supplement biological phosphorus removal pronk et al 2015 excessive formation of calcium precipitates in calcium rich industrial wastewaters can cause cementation of anaerobic granular sludge beds batstone and keller 2003 iron sulfide precipitation on the other hand can decrease the sulfide concentration and thus improve the biogas quality wei et al 2018 despite the possible influence of precipitation reactions on the process performance they are only included in eight granular sludge models batstone and keller 2003 feldman et al 2017 feldman et al 2017 provided the most rigorous approach with the largest amount of possible precipitation reactions that can occur in the bulk liquid and even inside granules their work showed that intragranule precipitation may reduce conversion rates due to physical displacement of active biomass from the granules similar phenomena might occur when phosphorus precipitates inside aerobic or anammox granular sludge but this has not been studied yet 6 model complexity the literature survey spreadsheet in supplementary information shows that there is not one generally accepted way to model granular sludge reactors to get an overall idea of the complexity of the models every model feature was assigned a certain score qualitatively representing its complexity and these were summed up to a complexity index of the model as a whole defined by table 3 the complexity of models appears to diverge over time fig 8 more complex models become available in literature feldman et al 2017 fuentes et al 2009c kagawa et al 2015 but simple models are still being used the benefits of simple models are the more straightforward interpretation easier calibration and lower computational demand however complex models describe more processes and thus provide more detailed predictions such as intragranule substrate gradients it is also sometimes believed that more complex models lead to more accurate predictions of the overall reactor performance over a broader range of operational conditions yet as wanner and gujer 1986 state a model should be as simple as possible and only as complex as needed this means that the burden of proof for a higher predictive accuracy always lies with those that develop more complex models in other words a more complex model should only be used if a simpler model failed for the intended application e g a completely mixed reactor has failed to predict the effect of an internal recirculation mu et al 2008a and a biofilm model without attachment has sometimes failed to predict the microbial population distribution qualitatively batstone et al 2004 moreover it is difficult to validate some sub models like intragranule transport for realistic conditions for example micro sensors e g hydrogen gas ph or oxygen can only be used for granules after harvesting them from the reactor and positioning them in specialized laboratory equipment the gradients also differ for different sites on a granule and between different granules van loosdrecht et al 1995 winkler et al 2011 this makes it difficult in practice to know whether the quantitative accuracy of these microscale models is high enough to improve the quantitative predictions of the macroscale reactor performance a mechanistic model could be very strictly defined as one that takes into account every known phenomenon which would lead to a very high complexity our survey found that none of the models do this thus a more pragmatic definition was used namely a model based on mass balances with transport and reaction terms one should acknowledge that every single wastewater treatment model has parameters that cluster several processes because these were not described explicitly for example none of the selected models include the many different species within every microbial group vannecke and volcke 2015 as a second but definitely not conclusive example the 3d architecture of granules is far more complex than ever considered 3d micro colonies exist inside granules picioreanu et al 2016 granules are not perfect spheres de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 and herrling et al 2017 stated that even the diffusivity inside granules is spatially heterogeneous due to variations in the density of the matrix the inclusion of these aspects could lead to more fundamental understanding e g about 3d substrate gradients and microbial competition but it is not per se necessary for optimization or design purposes in practice the estimation of parameters via experiments is always necessary for quantitative simulations to compensate for neglected phenomena problems arise when simulation results are interpreted quantitatively when using parameter values for a complex model that were calibrated for a simpler model or the other way around or when a simulation scenario differs strongly from the conditions during calibration or validation to aid further developments it is thus essential to always clearly state which processes are neglected unfortunately we were unable to identify the assumptions for at least one of the analyzed model features in 32 of the 167 analyzed models 7 model calibration and validation most publications included calibration of the model 75 but less included validation with an independent data set 43 there is especially a lack of published validation results for large scale anammox and aerobic granular sludge reactors only one study shows limited validation results for a full scale anammox based reactor corbala robles et al 2016 and only one for a pilot scale aerobic system stevens et al 1989 of course calibration and or validation is not necessary for all modelling goals for example most partial nitritation anammox granular sludge reactor models did not aim at quantitative predictions but at qualitatively understanding the relationship between micro and mesoscale phenomena also the effect of alternative operational strategies on the reactor performance was explored in general but not for one specific reactor with a specific influent and effluent requirements aerobic granular sludge models on the other hand were mostly used for simulations of lab scale systems this indicates that aerobic and anammox granular sludge models are not yet used in the way that activated sludge models are used for flocculent sludge systems e g to find a cost effective approach to improve an existing full scale plant through changes in the operation or configuration or to design a plant for the treatment of a specific wastewater stream brdjanovic et al 2015 it could also be that models are already used for these purposes for example using commercial simulators but that the results are simply not published in scientific literature 8 future directions 8 1 finding the appropriate degree of complexity it is clear that the appropriate complexity of a model depends on the modelling goal for fundamental insight the required model complexity follows logically from the research question for example if the goal is to assess the influence of the oxygen set point or wastewater type on the microbial population distribution obviously the dynamics of the microbial population should be included by modelling intragranule transport of particulates batstone et al 2004 de kreuk et al 2007b however if the focus is on optimizing the operation or design for a better overall reactor performance the search for optimal complexity to have easy use and interpretation fast simulations and easy calibration while maintaining predictive accuracy is less straightforward two approaches have been put forward for this in literature fig 9 the top down approach starts with a simple model and adds more known underlying phenomena until the macroscale dynamics of interest e g effluent quality are predicted with the required accuracy this approach was used during the development of asms van loosdrecht et al 2008 model validation is an essential part of this approach and it can be used to develop practically applicable models on a reasonable time scale other authors have proposed arnaldos et al 2015 or used a bottom up approach baeten et al 2018 noguera and picioreanu 2004 volcke et al 2012 which uses models with more microscale phenomena to simulate the reactor performance and as such determine under which conditions certain phenomena can be neglected the benefit of this approach is that it is clearly understood why certain simplifications can be made but it is more time consuming both approaches have their value and should be used in parallel to more clearly define the range of operational conditions and modelling goals for which certain assumptions can be made to find the optimal complexity of granular sludge reactor models the most prominent question identified here is when a biofilm model is necessary and when apparent kinetics suffice 8 2 need for mechanistic understanding some phenomena in granular sludge reactors are still poorly understood for example the fate of particulate organics from the influent needs to be elucidated different particle sizes probably react differently for example small colloids could enter the granule matrix while larger particles probably cannot but they might still attach to the surface also the exact role of protozoa in the degradation of particles in aerobic systems is unknown pronk et al 2015 secondly the liquid phase transport in anaerobic systems appears to be unpredictable because of the high sensitivity towards changes in the reactor scale and operation cfd simulations including interactions between the gas and liquid phase of differently sized reactors could help to better understand this dependency and develop rules of thumb for suitable assumptions in simpler reactor models also the hydraulic behaviours of full scale anammox based reactors and aerobic reactors during the unaerated feeding phase may warrant further characterisation finally the mechanistic dependency of detachment and breakage rates on operating conditions needs further study to better understand the development of a granular sludge bed and to simulate changes in the granule size distribution 8 3 model applications first of all more publications with validation results on full scale aerobic and anammox granular sludge reactors could increase confidence in the quantitative simulation results and thus extend the applications beyond general qualitative optimization projects secondly heat balance modelling has further potential since it has only been applied once haugen et al 2015 it could be used to find the optimal balance between heat recovery which lowers the temperature or heating which increases the temperature and biological conversion rates which increase at higher temperatures thirdly given that only a few aerobic granular sludge models considered phosphorus conversions there is still room to better understand and optimize the phosphorus removal that occurs in full scale systems e g to determine the optimal aeration control strategy for phosphorus removal furthermore problems with ph fluctuations in anammox systems could be diagnosed and possibly solved with models further research can also combine available precipitation models mbamba et al 2015 solon et al 2017 with granular sludge models like feldman et al 2017 did for an internal circulation reactor this could help to understand precipitation dynamics in these systems tackle problems caused by excessive precipitation and optimize recovery of resources like phosphorus recent additions of aerobic granular sludge reactor models in commercial simulation software such as biowin and simba might stimulate a wider application of models for granular sludge 9 conclusions this contribution reviewed granular sludge reactor models for anaerobic aerobic and partial nitritation anammox processes a clearly defined modelling goal is not always provided but it is necessary to find an appropriate model complexity and to differentiate between the many other available models the immense variation in assumptions about the key phenomena in a granular sludge reactor can partly be explained by the different reactor types and goals to eliminate habitual assumptions further research should more clearly define the range of operational conditions and goals for which certain approaches can be used in particular the applicability of biofilm models versus the use of apparent kinetics needs further study more mechanistic understanding is needed on the dependency of the detachment rate on the operational conditions the fate of particulate organics and the transition between plug flow and mixed conditions with increasing anaerobic reactor scale more full scale calibration and validation studies would help in extending the applications of aerobic and anammox granular sludge models beyond qualitative studies and quantitative predictions on lab scale e g to diagnose and prevent ph problems and optimize biological

19128,forward osmosis fo has emerged as a potentially energy efficient membrane treatment technology to yield high quality reusable water from various wastewater saline water sources a key challenge remained to be solved for fo is reverse solute flux rsf which can cause issues like reduced concentration gradient and loss of draw solutes yet no universal parameters have been developed to compare rsf control performance among various studies making it difficult to position us in this battle against rsf in this paper we have conducted a concise review of existing rsf reduction approaches including operational strategies e g pressure electrolysis and ultrasound assisted osmosis and advanced membrane development e g new membrane fabrication and existing membrane modification we have also analyzed the literature data to reveal the current status of rsf reduction a new parameter mitigation ratio mr was proposed and used together with specific rsf srsf to evaluate rsf reduction

based systems have emerged as a potentially energy efficient alternative for versatile applications such as seawater desalination linares et al 2014 mccutcheon et al 2006 wastewater treatment holloway et al 2007 iskander et al 2017 zou et al 2017 brine concentration mcginnis et al 2013 tang and ng 2008 food processing garcia castello et al 2009 sant anna et al 2012 bioenergy production ge et al 2013b qin and he 2017 and power generation logan and elimelech 2012 yip et al 2011 fo harnesses osmotic pressure gradient across a semi permeable membrane to reclaim high quality water offering major merits include reduced operating pressure high rejection of undesired compounds comparable to ro reversible membrane fouling and less energy demand if energy intensive draw regeneration can be properly addressed or avoided liu et al 2011 mcginnis and elimelech 2007 though natural osmosis phenomenon has long been observed the term forward osmosis first appeared in 1956 kamiya and tazawa 1956 over the following 60 years the development of fo has gone through four stages with substantial process advancement in each stage fig 1 before the middle 1970s the initial effort was dedicated to propose a general framework including design parameters osmosis kinetics and the feasibility of extracting potable water from various feed sources in fo systems kessler and moody 1976 moody and kessler 1976 votta 1974 as a result the trinity fo setup was proposed including the low osmotic pressure feed solution the high osmotic pressure draw solution and the middle semi permeable membrane during the 1970s 1990s the fo research started to focus more on fabricating a special fo membrane towards a more efficient water recovery performance instead of using general semi permeable materials e g animal bladders and rubber anderson 1977 and ro membranes kravath and davis 1975 these efforts led to the development of asymmetric fo membrane made of non porous active layer and porous support layer zhao et al 2012 unlike a pressure driven ro process that generates fresh water directly the energy efficient fo process can only yield a diluted draw solution which requires energy and cost intensive downstream separation to regenerate draw solutes ds zou et al 2017 the third stage of fo development focused on smart selection of easily recoverable ds ranging from economically viable and non toxic inorganic ds achilli et al 2010 to phase separation ds cai and hu 2016 such as magnetic nanoparticles alejo et al 2017 thermolytic ammonium bicarbonate mccutcheon et al 2005 2006 and organic polymers yang et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 however these types of ds suffer from high cost due to complicated preparation minami et al 2010 large solute loss zou et al 2017 or weakened phase separation after regeneration ling et al 2010 alternatively ds that do not require regeneration would potentially address energy and cost issues zhao et al 2012 for example the fertilizer driven fo employs the commercial fertilizers as ds phuntsho et al 2012 xiang et al 2017 zou and he 2016 and diluted draw solution may be directly used for agricultural irrigation hoover et al 2011 phuntsho et al 2016 despite great promise and much progress of fo based technologies a major challenge and also an impediment remain to be solved in the fourth current stage is the salinity buildup on the feed side resulted from both reverse solute flux rsf a major contributor and concentrating effect by fo membrane rejection hancock and cath 2009 rsf is defined as the cross membrane diffusion of ds to the feed side driven by solute concentration difference phillip et al 2010 and has been utilized for process intensification such as supplying substrate or buffer reagents in an osmotic microbial fuel cell bowden et al 2012 wu et al 2018 enhancement of anti scaling resistance zhang et al 2017 or facilitating struvite precipitation from sludge centrate digestate wu et al 2018b xie et al 2014 still the detrimental effects of rsf include gradual loss of ds reduced osmotic driving force i e lower water flux increased fouling propensity and elevated operation cost due to periodical replenishment of ds akther et al 2015 accumulation of the reverse fluxed ds such as nitrogen and phosphorus will require further treatment of the feed stream phillip et al 2010 to understand the solute permeation process lab experiments integrated with mathematical modeling have been conducted to explore concentration polarization both external and internal polarizations phillip et al 2010 yaroshchuk 2010 solute solvent interaction su and chung 2011 yong et al 2012b solute solute interaction irvine et al 2013 lu et al 2014 and chemical equilibrium yong et al 2012a the reverse permeation of solute ions is strongly linked to both membrane intrinsic parameters affected by thickness tortuosity and porosity mccutcheon and elimelech 2006 and solute characteristics e g hydrated ion radius aqueous diffusivity solution viscosity and ion charge zhao and zou 2011 for example smaller hydrated ions have elevated tendency to penetrate fo active layer wang et al 2010 meanwhile ion charge plays a pivotal role in the magnitude of rsf because most fo membranes made of either cellulose triacetate cta or polyamide thin film composite tfc are negatively charged ds cations can migrate more easily than anions via donnan dialysis sarkar et al 2010 to maintain electroneutrality ds anions either permeate fo membrane together with cations or exchange with anions in the feed solution irvine et al 2013 it is worth noting that some neutral ds e g urea and ethylene glycol have demonstrated significantly higher rsf compared to charged ions in an fo process yong et al 2012b zou and he 2016 control and reduction of rsf is critically important to a healthy fo operation reducing the rsf of a particular ds can be accomplished via operational strategies or advanced membrane development smart selection of novel and less permeable ds will help achieve less rsf in an fo system thereby mitigating rsf however lack of rsf data in many studies hinders our exploration and understanding of rsf and its mitigation there also lack reliable judging criteria or universal parameters to compare rsf control performance among various reduction strategies herein this paper aims to provide a concise review focusing on rsf quantification and control strategies and to analyze and discuss the challenges and possible solutions for further investigation of rsf mitigation a new parameter rsf mitigation ratio mr is proposed and used for comparison based on the data computed from available references it should be noted that there have been a number of previous review papers on general fo development akther et al 2015 cath et al 2006 chekli et al 2016 chung et al 2012a 2012b coday et al 2014a lutchmiah et al 2014 shaffer et al 2015 valladares linares et al 2014 zhao et al 2012 selection regeneration of draw solutes cai and hu 2016 chekli et al 2012 ge et al 2013a luo et al 2014a and membrane rejection of pollutants coday et al 2014b the present review paper tends not to repeat what have been discussed before and aims to provide a unique perspective of elucidating and evaluating rsf control approaches and efficiency 2 quantification of reverse solute flux rsf js can be quantified according to the following equation eq 1 phillip et al 2010 1 j s j w c d 1 1 j w b exp j w s d where j w l m 2 h 1 lmh is the water flux c d is the experimentally accessible bulk draw solution concentration d is draw solute diffusion coefficient in the bulk solution s is the membrane structural parameter determined from fo and ro experiments mccutcheon and elimelech 2006 yip et al 2010 and b is the active layer draw solute permeability coefficient determined from ro or pro experiments paul 2004 phillip et al 2010 the above theoretical equation has its limitations e g for strong electrolyte and single solute system and is not convenient to directly quantify rsf ds cations and anions may also exhibit varied rsf due to charge difference though most fo studies report rsf on the whole ds level to quantify rsf in an fo system fed with a complicated feed stream e g wastewater solute buildup sbu in the feed solution for a ds or a specific ion can be first calculated by using eq 2 zou and he 2016 2 s b u n f f n i f m w s t v f f c f f v i f c i f s t where n i f and n f f are the initial and final mole of a ds or a specific ion in the feed respectively c i f and c f f are the initial and final mass concentration in the feed respectively v i f and v f f are the initial and final feed volume t stands for operating time s is the effective surface area of the fo membrane and mw stands for the molecular weight all these parameters can be directly measured or monitored during experiments sbu is typically resulted from both the concentrating effect in the feed due to membrane rejection and rsf from the draw side the concentrating effect ce and rsf j s g m 2 h 1 gmh of a ds or a specific ion are calculated according to eqs 3 and 4 respectively 3 c e v r e cov e r e d c i f s t v f d v i

used as the feed or no draw solute ion is presented in the feed stream c i f equals to 0 with no concentrating effect in such a case j s sbu to more accurately quantify rsf in an fo system specific rsf srsf g l 1 can be calculated to rule out the influence of both membrane structural parameter s and bulk draw solution concentration c d phillip et al 2010 srsf reveals the amount mass of a ds or an ion that can leak across fo membrane to the feed side per unit water recovered i e 1 liter and is defined as the ratio of j s gmh and j w lmh 5 s r s f j s j w in this paper a new parameter rsf mitigation ratio mr is proposed and quantified based on srsf to enable better comparison among various rsf control strategies mr is determined by the ratio between the mitigated specific rsf srsf m and the original specific rsf srsf o 6 m r 1 s r s f m s r s f o 100 1 j s m j w m j s o j w o 100 where j s o and j w o are the original rsf and water flux respectively j s m and j w m are the rsf and water flux under the rsf control operation respectively in the case where no change in water flux is observed j w m j w o eq 6 can be simplified to 7 m r 1 j s m j s o 100 in some literature system conductivity profiles are usually reported instead of rsf or srsf values under such cases total dissolved solids tds mg l 1 instead of the ds concentration in the feed solution can be used to quantify sbu tds ce tds and j tds 8 s b u t d s v f f t d s f f v i f t d s i f s t 9 c e t d s v r e cov e r e d t d s i f s t v f d v i d t d s i f s t 10 j t d s s b u t d s c e t d s where tds i f

deploying operational strategies to reduce ds permeation is a straightforward approach these strategies including optimizing operation conditions and externally assisted methods have been investigated in previous studies to potentially reduce rsf or srsf in terms of optimizing operation conditions hydrodynamic condition of an fo system can affect rsf and a higher cross flow velocity tends to reduce fouling propensity in a fo process leading to diminished fouling induced concentration polarization she et al 2012 higher water flux lee et al 2010 and thus lower srsf operating temperature of feed and draw solutions however is not very effective in srsf reduction xie et al 2013 due to a lack of systematic rsf studies via optimizing operation conditions only externally assisted approaches including pressure electrolysis and ultrasonic assisted osmosis are discussed in this section 3 1 pressure assisted osmosis pao unlike a natural fo process δp 0 δp is the transmembrane pressure chekli et al 2016 pressure assisted osmosis pao can realize energy efficient 2 0 kwh m 3 enhancement of system performance i e higher water flux and reduced solute transport by exerting a relatively low hydraulic pressure on the feed side 10 bar banchik et al 2016 blandin et al 2017 as compared to pro 10 bar han et al 2015 straub et al 2016 or ro 59 bar seawater as the feed fig 2 davenport et al 2018 one must not confuse pao δp 0 with the pressure retarded osmosis pro 0 δp δπ or ro δp δπ lutchmiah et al 2015 comparing to conventional fo processes an equivalent or elevated water flux could be obtained in these pao systems depending on the applied pressure j w m j w o fig 3 a the water flux in a pao process can consist of two portions shibuya et al 2015 13 j w m j w o s m o t i c j w h y d r a u l i c when the active layer of fo membrane faces the feed side al fs the external hydraulic pressure exerted on the feed side can lead to an increased internal concentration polarization coday et al 2013 especially under the operation with a relatively high salinity feed stream shibuya et al 2015 as a result a reduced effective cross membrane osmotic pressure gradient will diminish water flux in the osmotic portion j w osmotic j w o yun et al 2014 meanwhile the compensation of water flux in the hydraulic portion j w hydraulic makes the overall water flux comparable to that in the original operation 14 j w m j w o s m o t i c j w h y d r a u l i c j w o low hydraulic pressure with the increase of exerted hydraulic pressure the increment of j w hydraulic outcompetes the

2013 15 j w m j w o s m o t i c j w h y d r a u l i c j w o high hydraulic pressure the reduced effective cross membrane osmotic pressure gradient δπ eff in pao may lead to a reduced rsf fig 3b with the highest reduction of j s from 0 857 to 0 102 gmh 85 7 by applying 15 bar hydraulic pressure shibuya et al 2015 both cta and tfc membranes show significantly reduced srsf under an applied hydraulic pressure p 0 001 fig 3c the srsf of cta membrane can be reduced from 2 02 2 64 to 1 07 1 12 g l 1 rendering an average mr of 47 1 for tfc membrane srsf is reduced from 1 10 0 47 to 0 31 0 25 g l 1 with a much higher average mr of 71 6 tfc membrane only requires a hydraulic pressure of 5 bar to achieve a 50 mr whereas a 10 bar hydraulic pressure must be exerted on cta membrane to obtain the same performance fig 3d the highest mr is 95 0 by applying 10 bar pressure on a lab prepared tfc membrane with compacted woven backing fabric inside sahebi et al 2017 there are some limitations and challenges that must be properly addressed for pao development pao may obtain a negative mr under certain operation conditions for example negative srsf and mr 30 7 to 61 5 were observed in a study with an al ds mode despite an enhanced water flux j w m blandin et al 2013 that is probably due to the potential cracking in supportive layer as a consequence of local stretching under a hydraulic pressure accelerating the ds partitioning process to minimize membrane deformation and obtain a positive mr appropriate spacers can be developed and placed inside pao blandin et al 2016 the magnitude of exerted hydraulic pressure is vital to yield a desirable mr for example a low hydraulic pressure 1 bar can result in elevated rsf j s m duan et al 2014 and a negative mr 8 1 to 84 6 lutchmiah et al 2015 on the other hand a high hydraulic pressure that theoretically yields a more reduced rsf can cause membrane cracking pressure enhanced membrane fouling has been observed in pao jamil et al 2016 and may lead to fouling enhanced concentration polarization and larger rsf she et al 2012 to minimize fouling enhanced rsf periodic chemical cleaning lotfi et al 2017 or osmotic backwashing blandin et al 2015 must be performed to cleanse the foulants at the expense of deteriorated pollutant rejection and shortened membrane lifespan 3 2 electrolysis assisted osmosis eao electrolysis assisted osmosis eao or e fo process utilizes the electrolysis and an electric field to manipulate cross membrane ion migration towards reduced solute permeation electrolysis and applied electric field have long been deployed in electrodialysis ed processes to drive charged ions migration across ion exchange membrane it has been reported that effective rsf reduction 57 decrease could be obtained at an applied voltage 1 5 v water splitting detected zou and he 2017a to minimize the effect of ph on electrodes and fo membrane a unique design of three chamber eao with bilateral draw chambers hydraulically connected and middle feed chamber was proposed fig 4 a in a conventional fo process with al fs orientation ds will diffuse first through the support layer j s o s which is governed by the fick s law of diffusion fig 4b black line phillip et al 2010 16 j s s d s d c d t d s t s c d i c s i d s t s c d 0 where d s is the ds diffusion coefficient in supportive layer t s is the thickness of supportive layer c d i is the ds concentration on the surface of support layer c s i is the ds concentration on the supportive layer side of the supportive layer active layer interface initially equals to 0 and c d is the ds concentration in the bulk draw solution assuming c d i c d under a negligible external concentration polarization cath et al 2006 when water electrolysis h reduced to h2 at the cathode and oh oxidized to o2 at the anode is sustained in eao the generated electric field manipulates ion movement inside the system and such a movement across the supportive layer j s e s e

constant z is the valence of specific ion r is the gas constant t is the temperature and e is the applied voltage in a cathode chamber sodium ions in both the draw and the support layer will be

this further renders slower ion transport in the active layer under effective electrolysis j a e a j a a leading to reduced sodium concentration in the feed compared to that of conventional fo c f e c f fig 4b red line however electrolysis assisted strategy can be a double edge sword when electrodes pose a dragging effect towards the opposite charged ions favoring rsf reduction in eao the repelling effect of those electrodes on same charged ions can accelerate their accumulation in the boundary layer and eventually create enhanced leakage of same charged ions as a result the adverse effect of repelling effect can hinder or even exceed the mitigated effect caused by the dragging effect especially at a high applied voltage this was confirmed by a study that showed an increased rsf from 0 96 gmh at 1 5 v to 1 35 gmh at 3 v resulting in a deteriorated mr from 56 9 at 1 5 v to 39 4 at 3 v fig 4c hence a weak electrolysis v 1 5 2 0 v should be exploited in eao to achieve stable water flux reduced rsf and less energy consumption zou and he 2017a eao may offer an energy efficient solution 0 022 kwh m 3 recovered water or 0 044 0 002 kwh kg 1 reduced reversed solute to secure an mr over 50 and more research effort should be invested to better understand the underlying mechanism and optimizing system performance using alternative power sources to sustain an effective electric field for example via bioelectrochemical systems may further reduce energy consumption of eao while accomplishing rsf reduction qin et al 2016 selection of a suitable ds for eao also warrants further investigation the chemically stable na2so4 which was used in the prior study still requires a downstream ds separation regeneration process to produce high quality water as an electrochemical system eao needs optimized system design e g chamber dimension and electrode distance for more effective rsf control in particular conductive fo membrane serving as both the fo membrane and electrode will be of strong interest to achieve better electrochemical performance in eao hou et al 2018 3 3 ultrasonic assisted osmosis uao ultrasonic assisted osmosis uao takes advantage of ultrasound to reduce icp and has been used to concentrate fruit juice as well as natural colorant chanukya and rastogi 2017 kowalski et al 2015 with the aid of ultrasound uao gains enhanced water flux up to 75 at the expense of slightly increased rsf due to the combined effects of reduced icp and localized heating heikkinen et al 2017 comparing to a conventional fo process a reduced srsf can be obtained in uao based on eq 5 j s m j s o while j w m j w o for example notably reduced srsf an mr tds of 51 8 na2so4 as the ds was observed when 20 khz ultrasound was applied in 1 min on and off mode with comparable feed conductivity mainly contributed by rsf but an enhanced water flux from 13 lmh fo to 24 lmh uao heikkinen et al 2017 however the effects of the operation mode on rsf reduction have yet to understand the pulse operation i e on and off mode appears to be the most cost effective mode to reduce rsf in uao and the optimal time period for on and off operation remains to be explored applications of ultrasound may potentially damage membrane integrity and irreversibly alter the physicochemical features of the membrane e g functional groups leading to deteriorated rsf and even a negative mr long term operation of uao needs to be performed to better understand system stability during rsf reduction in conclusion uao demands more investigation to demonstrate its rsf reduction performance 4 advancing membrane development towards a better barrier the existing commercial fo membranes though progressed with increasing membrane performance and decreasing cost still suffer from relatively high icp and reverse solute leakage leading to reduced δπ eff lower water flux fig 5 a gradual loss of ds and elevated operational cost hence developing the next generation fo membranes to achieve both low icp i e high δπ eff and more desirable water flux fig 5b and low solute permeation i e high selectivity is crucial towards a more environmental friendly and cost effective fo based water reclamation process werber et al 2016 a significant amount of research efforts have been invested to advance material development and fabrication techniques at the lab scale li et al 2016 rsf reduction can be potentially achieved in two ways modification of existing membranes either commercial or previously developed fo membranes and fabrication of new membranes 4 1 membrane modification membrane modification is usually realized via surface coating on the active layer of an existing membrane mostly tfc to enhance antifouling and elevate surface hydrophilicity guo et al 2016 tiraferri et al 2012 leading to reduced icp and higher water flux arena et al 2014 however very few studies of membrane modification have focused on rsf reduction and thus there is a limited amount of data about solute leakage table 1 an mr of 20 9 was estimated for a polydopamine pda coated commercial tfc membrane tfc c0 5 in the original paper guo et al 2018 such a reduction of rsf was likely due to that the coated pda layer although increasing physical water transport resistance has enhanced membrane surface hydrophilicity while reducing water contact angle thereby leading to comparable water permeability coefficient and similar water flux meanwhile the solute permeability coefficient was reduced due to the coated pda layer rendering a higher salt rejection rate a reduced srsf eq 5 and a desirable mr comparing to pristine tfc silver nanoparticle decorated graphene oxide nanosheets agnp go have also been utilized as a surface modification material soroush et al 2015 leading to an mr of up to 15 9 under the al ds orientation soroush et al 2016 that was because of the enhanced water transport 13 sustained by improved membrane hydrophilicity due to surface functional groups from go and presence of cations from agnps and a minor change in solute leakage 3 5 increase in rsf however in some cases of membrane modification for anti fouling enhancement the coated layer would unfortunately hinder effective water permeation j w m j w o 1 while facilitating salt permeation j s m j s o 1 rendering a negative mr for example an mr of 40 0 to 50 0 table 1 was obtained in tfc membranes coated with either agnp go or ag polyethylene glycol pegylated dendrimer nanocomposites soroush et al 2015 zhang et al 2013 this was probably due to the introduction of biocidal surface functional groups agnps to the original ones carboxyl groups but the exact reasons remain unclear thus more research efforts are required to fully understand the mass transport and ion interactions within the coated layer to yield both a consistent antifouling performance and a positive mr via membrane modification 4 2 membrane fabrication new membrane fabrication has shown more promising results in terms of rsf reduction we have analyzed more than 70 studies published in the past decade 2008 2018 to provide a comprehensive evaluation and comparison of water flux srsf and mr among various modified membranes

to tfc membrane was observed especially in the past five years with the latter being used in over 90 of the studies the newly developed tfc fo membranes have exhibited an average water flux of 30 7 14 4 lmh al fs orientation n 35 data points or 49 9 19 0 lmh al ds orientation n 32 data points by using 1 m nacl as the draw solution fig 5c much higher p 0 05 than that of either commercial tfc membranes 9 8 4 0 and 20 7 4 4 lmh or commercial cta 9 5 3 5 and 15 7 1 8 lmh the highest water flux of 70 3 and 84 2 lmh al fs and al ds orientations unless otherwise stated was reported for a tfc membrane with vertically oriented porous substrates to significantly facilitate mass transport and reduce icp liang et al 2017 despite enhanced water flux the newly developed tfc membranes have comparable rsf 1 m nacl as the draw 8 23 4 66 gmh under al fs and 11 23 5 23 gmh under al ds p 0 05 to that of the commercial tfc 3 84 4 24 under al fs and 8 20 6 36 gmh under al ds or commercial cta 7 53 1 86 gmh under al ds fig 5d however solute leakage propensity of an fo membrane needs to be analyzed by considering water flux and the available srsf from literature is provided in fig 5e n 362 data points sorted by year when nacl is selected as the ds the commercial cta membranes exhibit an average srsf of 0 60 0 32 g l 1 0 10 1 29 g l 1 the lowest srsf 0 10 g l 1 was reported with a cta nw flat sheet membrane manufactured by hti wei et al 2011 as for the commercial tfc membranes an average srsf value of 0 44 0 32 g l 1 0 07 1 17 g l 1 has been reported the lowest srsf of a commercial tfc was obtained in a hollow fiber membrane hfb in the original study manufactured by toyobo co ltd ren and mccutcheon 2018 by taking advantage of new membrane fabrication srsf could be significantly decreased comparing to commercial membranes srsf 0 10 g l 1 table 2 for example a novel hydrophilic nylon 6 6 microfiltration membrane supported tfc showed an srsf of 0 036 g l 1 under the al ds orientation huang et al 2013 owing to a notably higher water permeability coefficient a 0 917 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 twice that of hti cta a much reduced solute permeability coefficient b 0 300 l m 2 h 1 31 8 of hti cta and a desirable membrane structure parameter s 1940 μm twice that of hti cta the same research group reproduced a similar srsf of 0 035 g l 1 via selecting nylon 6 6 microfiltration membrane as novel supporting material rendering an mr of 92 4 and 92 0 compared to that of commercial cta and tfc membrane huang and mccutcheon 2015 in addition to the selection of novel supporting materials for tfc duong et al 2015 li et al 2012 srsf could also be reduced to less than 0 10 g l 1 via optimized substrate composition bui and mccutcheon 2013 advanced substrate fabrication instead of conventional wet phase inversion luo et al 2014b shi et al 2011 xiao et al 2015 and new development of active layer shen et al 2016 table 2 nonetheless the majority of srsf reported from new membrane fabrication falls inside the srsf range of commercial ones especially in the past three years fig 5e based on the current analysis and results neither membrane modification nor new membrane fabrication has achieved the consistent results for notably reducing solute permeation several new membranes with significantly lower srsf should be further examined for reliable performance under varied conditions e g feeding stream operating conditions etc future efforts should consider rsf reduction in such design development of fo membranes 5 future of rsf control to further advance rsf control for facilitating fo development extensive efforts are still required in several aspects rsf mitigation via smart selection of ds with low leakage propensity will be desired these novel ds especially stimuli responsive polymers can potentially achieve rsf mitigation due to their relatively large hydrodynamic diameter 100 nm hartanto et al 2015 and membrane size exclusion effect stimuli responsive substances have been studied as ds in recent years because they can be regenerated via reversible separation under a certain stimulus such as temperature ph magnetic field electric or light fig 6 razmjou et al 2015 as a result much less energy compared to that of conventional inorganic ds will be required in the ds separation regeneration process for example polyacrylic acid sodium salt paa na is a well studied ph responsive ds ge et al 2012a gwak et al 2015 besides good water extraction capability up to 25 lmh water flux ge et al 2012b paa na also exhibits extremely low rsf 0 004 0 08 gmh for cta and 0 002 0 009 gmh for tfc and very low srsf 0 002 0 007 g l 1 for paa na with a mw of 2000 5000 and less than 0 001 g l 1 for paa na with a mw of 50 000 due to size exclusion hydrodynamic diameter 120 nm yang et al 2017 nonetheless little rsf data can be found for most thermal magnetic electric or light responsive ds to the best of our knowledge making it extremely difficult to evaluate rsf decrease for these smart ds enhanced reporting of rsf data srsf and or mr should be encouraged in future research development effort to render a comprehensive review adding surfactant as an additive into conventional inorganic ds provides another promising solution for effective rsf reduction surfactants have been proposed as a ds since 2014 with low rsf due to their low level of high micellar mass 14 000 29 000 g mol 1 and membrane size exclusion effect gadelha et al 2014 however surfactants are subject to difficult regeneration process requiring high energy investment and operation cost alternatively surfactants have been added into conventional inorganic ds e g mgcl2 as an additive at a very small amount nguyen et al 2015 achieving desirable water flux 11 4 lmh while providing sufficient electrostatic repulsion force to reduce rsf rsf of 2 03 gmh and srsf of 0 18 g l 1 nguyen et al 2016 recently one surfactant tergitol 15 s 9 was added as an additive in a fertilizer driven fo using nh4 2so4 as the ds tfc membrane resulting in an mr of over 50 with a dosage of only 0 25 mm srsf reduced from 0 18 to 0 09 g l 1 chekli et al 2018 those preliminary results have demonstrated that surfactant additives are worth further research effort for rsf reduction however the fate transport and potential health effects of surfactants even at extremely low concentrations in the final draw solution should be carefully evaluated in a regeneration free fo process e g direct fertigation in fertilizer driven fo the relevant data for better understanding of rsf reduction and mitigation should be properly presented parameters such as srsf and mr should be analyzed in parallel with conventional performance index e g water flux and rsf and membrane intrinsic constant e g water permeation coefficient and solute diffusion coefficient report of srsf and or mr especially for those stimuli responsive polymers can enable more accurate assessment for overall system performance a threshold srsf value e g srsf 0 1 g l 1 should be proposed and used for future rsf control studies to enable better comparison meanwhile though mathematical modeling of solute transport has been conducted for pristine fo membranes to evaluate the effect of concentration polarization solute solvent interaction solute solute interaction and chemical equilibrium detailed studies listed in introduction section such research efforts have not been well utilized to better understand the rsf reduction performance and reveal the underlying mechanism of an rsf control strategy for example existing models should further extend to investigate ion transport migration diffusion within the coating layer furthermore rsf control has received much less attention comparing to anti fouling research in the fo field though these two subjects are closely correlated in terms of operational strategies and advanced membrane development a large rsf may increase biofouling and scaling whereas the deposited cake layer can promote solute leakage as well hence rsf control should be strongly related to membrane anti fouling features last but not the least complete elimination of rsf may not be possible and thus effective backup strategies should be developed to neutralize salinity buildup i e the consequence of rsf on the feed side via solute removal or recovery to remove the accumulated ds physical separation has been employed by using mf or uf systems to create a backdoor for accumulated salts luo et al 2015 chemical separation takes advantage of reverse fluxed ds to facilitate resource recovery via induced chemical precipitation xie et al 2014 biological removal relies on degradation and assimilation of microorganisms to eliminate biodegradable ds li et al 2015 solute recovery one step beyond removal can be an attractive option to reuse and regenerate reverse fluxed ds and can be realized with the help of electric field e g bioelectrochemical system or electrodialysis to separate charged ds ions from the feed stream qin and he 2014 zou and he 2017b 6 conclusions in this review we have evaluated the potential strategies to decrease reverse permeation of draw solutes in fo processes with the following conclusions rsf is a key challenge in fo based water treatment to accurately quantify the leakage magnitude

membrane offering an energy efficient solution 0 022 kwh m 3 1 5 v to secure an over 50 mr uao harnesses the power of ultrasound to reduce icp rendering an mr tds of 51 8 at the expense of high energy consumption the research results encourage further effort to optimize system design develop robust membrane enhance system stability and evaluate long term reduction rsf reduction can also be realized via advanced membrane development including membrane modification and fabrication existing membrane modification via surface coating on active layer can yield an mr over 20 and more research efforts are required to better understand the mass transport and ion interactions within the coating layer to yield both a consistent antifouling performance and a positive mr new membrane fabrication has shown more promising results and can achieve significantly reduced srsf an mr over 92 the future of rsf control lies in further development of smart ds particularly large size stimuli responsive

19128,forward osmosis fo has emerged as a potentially energy efficient membrane treatment technology to yield high quality reusable water from various wastewater saline water sources a key challenge remained to be solved for fo is reverse solute flux rsf which can cause issues like reduced concentration gradient and loss of draw solutes yet no universal parameters have been developed to compare

2013b qin and he 2017 and power generation logan and elimelech 2012 yip et al 2011 fo harnesses osmotic pressure gradient across a semi permeable membrane to reclaim high quality water offering major merits include reduced operating pressure high rejection of undesired compounds comparable to ro reversible membrane fouling and less energy demand if energy intensive draw regeneration can be properly addressed or avoided liu et al 2011 mcginnis and elimelech 2007 though natural osmosis phenomenon has long been observed the term forward osmosis first appeared in 1956 kamiya and tazawa 1956 over the following 60 years the development of fo has gone through four stages with substantial process advancement in each stage fig 1 before the middle 1970s the initial effort was dedicated to propose a general framework including design parameters osmosis kinetics and the feasibility of extracting potable water from various feed sources in fo systems kessler and moody 1976 moody and kessler 1976 votta 1974 as a result the trinity fo setup was proposed including the low osmotic pressure feed solution the high osmotic pressure draw solution and the middle semi permeable membrane during the 1970s 1990s the fo research started to focus more on fabricating a special fo membrane towards a more efficient water recovery performance instead of using general semi permeable materials e g animal bladders and rubber anderson 1977 and ro membranes kravath and davis 1975 these efforts led to the development of asymmetric fo membrane made of non porous active layer and porous support layer zhao et al 2012 unlike a pressure driven ro process that generates fresh water directly the energy efficient fo process can only yield a diluted draw solution which requires energy and cost intensive downstream separation to regenerate draw solutes ds zou et al 2017 the third stage of fo development focused on smart selection of easily recoverable ds ranging from economically viable and non toxic inorganic ds achilli et al 2010 to phase separation ds cai and hu 2016 such as magnetic nanoparticles alejo et al 2017 thermolytic ammonium bicarbonate mccutcheon et al 2005 2006 and organic polymers yang et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 however these types of ds suffer from high cost due to complicated preparation minami et al 2010 large solute loss zou et al 2017 or weakened phase separation after regeneration ling et al 2010 alternatively ds that do not require regeneration would potentially address energy and cost issues zhao et al 2012 for example the fertilizer driven fo employs the commercial fertilizers as ds phuntsho et al 2012 xiang et al 2017 zou and he 2016 and diluted draw solution may be directly used for agricultural irrigation hoover et al 2011 phuntsho et al 2016 despite great promise and much progress of fo based technologies a major challenge and also an impediment remain to be solved in the fourth current stage is the salinity buildup on the feed side resulted from both reverse solute flux rsf a major contributor and concentrating effect by fo membrane rejection hancock and cath 2009 rsf is defined as the cross membrane diffusion of ds to the feed side driven by solute concentration difference phillip et al 2010 and has been utilized for process intensification such as supplying substrate or buffer reagents in an osmotic microbial fuel cell bowden et al 2012 wu et al 2018 enhancement of anti scaling resistance zhang et al 2017 or facilitating struvite precipitation from sludge centrate digestate wu et al 2018b xie et al 2014 still the detrimental effects of rsf include gradual loss of ds reduced osmotic driving force i e lower water flux increased fouling propensity and elevated operation cost due to periodical replenishment of ds akther et al 2015 accumulation of the reverse fluxed ds such as nitrogen and phosphorus will require further treatment of the feed stream phillip et al 2010 to understand the solute permeation process lab experiments integrated with mathematical modeling have been conducted to explore concentration polarization both external and internal polarizations phillip et al 2010 yaroshchuk 2010 solute solvent interaction su and chung 2011 yong et al 2012b solute solute interaction irvine et al 2013 lu et al 2014 and chemical equilibrium yong et al 2012a the reverse permeation of solute ions is strongly linked to both membrane intrinsic parameters affected by thickness tortuosity and porosity mccutcheon and elimelech 2006 and solute characteristics e g hydrated ion radius aqueous diffusivity solution viscosity and ion charge zhao and zou 2011 for example smaller hydrated ions have elevated tendency to penetrate fo active layer wang et al 2010 meanwhile ion charge plays a pivotal role in the magnitude of rsf because most fo membranes made of either cellulose triacetate cta or polyamide thin film composite tfc are negatively charged ds cations can migrate more easily than anions via donnan dialysis sarkar et al 2010 to maintain electroneutrality ds anions either permeate fo membrane together with cations or exchange with anions in the feed solution irvine et al 2013 it is worth noting that some neutral ds e g urea and ethylene glycol have demonstrated significantly higher rsf compared to charged ions in an fo process yong et al 2012b zou and he 2016 control and reduction of rsf is critically important to a healthy fo operation reducing the rsf of a particular ds can be accomplished via operational strategies or advanced membrane development smart selection of novel and less permeable ds will help achieve less rsf in an fo system thereby mitigating rsf however lack of rsf data in many studies hinders our exploration and understanding of rsf and its mitigation there also lack reliable judging criteria or universal parameters to compare rsf control performance among various reduction strategies herein this paper aims to provide a concise review focusing on rsf quantification and control strategies and to analyze and discuss the challenges and possible solutions for further investigation of rsf mitigation a new parameter rsf mitigation ratio mr is proposed and used for comparison based on the data computed from available references it should be noted that there have been a number of previous review papers on general fo development akther et al 2015 cath et al 2006 chekli et al 2016 chung et al 2012a 2012b coday et al 2014a lutchmiah et al 2014 shaffer et al 2015 valladares linares et al 2014 zhao et al 2012 selection regeneration of draw solutes cai and hu 2016 chekli et al 2012 ge et al 2013a luo et al 2014a and membrane rejection of pollutants coday et al 2014b the present review paper tends not to repeat what have been discussed before and aims to provide a unique perspective of elucidating and evaluating rsf control approaches and efficiency 2 quantification of reverse solute flux rsf js can be quantified according to the following equation eq 1 phillip et al 2010 1 j s j w c d 1 1 j w b exp j w s d where j w l m 2 h 1 lmh is the water flux c d is the experimentally accessible bulk draw solution concentration d is draw solute diffusion coefficient in the bulk solution s is the membrane structural parameter determined from fo and ro experiments mccutcheon and elimelech 2006 yip et al 2010 and b is the active layer draw solute permeability coefficient determined from ro or pro experiments paul 2004 phillip et al 2010 the above theoretical equation has its limitations e g for strong electrolyte and single solute system and is not convenient to directly quantify rsf ds cations and anions may also exhibit varied rsf due to charge difference though most fo studies report rsf on the whole ds level to quantify rsf in an fo system fed with a complicated feed stream e g wastewater solute buildup sbu in the feed solution for a ds or a specific ion can be first calculated by using eq 2 zou and he 2016 2 s b u n f f n i f m w s t v f f c f f v i f c i f s t where n i f and n f f are the initial and final mole of a ds or a specific ion in the feed respectively c i f and c f f are the initial and final mass

molecular weight all these parameters can be directly measured or monitored during experiments sbu is typically resulted from both the concentrating effect in the feed due to membrane rejection and

deploying operational strategies to reduce ds permeation is a straightforward approach these strategies including optimizing operation conditions and externally assisted methods have been investigated in previous studies to potentially reduce rsf or srsf in terms of optimizing operation conditions hydrodynamic condition of an fo system can affect rsf and a higher cross flow velocity tends to reduce fouling propensity in a fo process leading to diminished fouling induced concentration polarization she et al 2012 higher water flux lee et al 2010 and thus lower srsf operating temperature of feed and draw solutions however is not very effective in srsf reduction xie et al 2013 due to a lack of systematic rsf studies via optimizing operation conditions only externally assisted approaches including pressure electrolysis and ultrasonic assisted osmosis are discussed in this section 3 1 pressure assisted osmosis pao unlike a natural fo process δp 0 δp is the transmembrane pressure chekli et al 2016 pressure assisted osmosis pao can realize energy efficient 2 0 kwh m 3 enhancement of system performance i e higher water flux and reduced solute transport by exerting a relatively low hydraulic pressure on the feed side 10 bar banchik et al 2016 blandin et al 2017 as compared to pro 10 bar han et al 2015 straub et al 2016 or ro 59 bar seawater as the feed fig 2 davenport et al 2018 one must not confuse pao δp 0 with the pressure retarded osmosis pro 0 δp δπ or ro δp δπ lutchmiah et al 2015 comparing to conventional fo processes an equivalent or elevated water flux could be obtained in these pao systems depending on the applied pressure j w m j w o fig 3 a the water flux in a pao process can consist of two portions shibuya et al 2015 13 j w m j w o s m o t i c j w h y d r a u l i c when the active layer of fo membrane faces the feed side al fs the external hydraulic pressure exerted on the feed side can lead to an increased internal concentration polarization coday et al 2013 especially under the operation with a relatively high salinity feed stream shibuya et al 2015 as a result a reduced effective cross membrane osmotic pressure gradient will diminish water flux in the osmotic portion j w osmotic j w o yun et al 2014 meanwhile the compensation of water flux in the hydraulic portion j w hydraulic makes the overall water flux comparable to that in the original operation 14 j w m j w o s m o t i c j w h y d r a u l i c j w o low hydraulic pressure with the increase of exerted hydraulic pressure the increment of j w hydraulic outcompetes the decrement of j w osmotic rendering an elevated overall water flux for example from 14 0 0 bar j w o to 24 0 lmh 6 bar j w m in a pao fed with red sea water as the draw and di as the feed blandin et al 2013 15 j w m j w o s m o t i c j w h y d r a u l i c j w o high hydraulic pressure the reduced effective cross membrane osmotic pressure gradient δπ eff in pao may lead to a reduced rsf fig 3b with the highest reduction of j s from 0 857 to 0 102 gmh 85 7 by applying 15 bar hydraulic pressure shibuya et al 2015 both cta and tfc membranes show significantly reduced srsf under an applied hydraulic pressure p 0 001 fig 3c the srsf of cta membrane can be reduced from 2 02 2 64 to 1 07 1 12 g l 1 rendering an average mr of 47 1 for tfc membrane srsf is reduced from 1 10 0 47 to 0 31 0 25 g l 1 with a much higher average mr of 71 6 tfc membrane only requires a hydraulic pressure of 5 bar to achieve a 50 mr whereas a 10 bar hydraulic pressure must be exerted on cta membrane to obtain the same performance fig 3d the highest mr is 95 0 by applying 10 bar pressure on a lab prepared tfc membrane with compacted woven backing fabric inside sahebi et al 2017 there are some limitations and challenges that must be properly addressed for pao development pao may obtain a negative mr under certain operation conditions for example negative srsf and mr 30 7 to 61 5 were observed in a study with an al ds mode despite an enhanced water flux j w m blandin et al 2013 that is probably due to the potential cracking in supportive layer as a consequence of local stretching under a hydraulic pressure accelerating the ds partitioning process to minimize membrane deformation and obtain a positive mr appropriate spacers can be developed and placed inside pao blandin et al 2016 the magnitude of exerted hydraulic pressure is vital to yield a desirable mr for example a low hydraulic pressure 1 bar can result in elevated rsf j s m duan et al 2014 and a negative mr 8 1 to 84 6 lutchmiah et al 2015 on the other hand a high hydraulic pressure that theoretically yields a more reduced rsf can cause membrane cracking pressure enhanced membrane fouling has been observed in pao jamil et al 2016 and may lead to fouling enhanced concentration polarization and larger rsf she et al 2012 to minimize fouling enhanced rsf periodic chemical cleaning lotfi et al 2017 or osmotic backwashing blandin et al 2015 must be performed to cleanse the foulants at the expense of deteriorated pollutant rejection and shortened membrane lifespan 3 2 electrolysis assisted osmosis eao electrolysis assisted osmosis eao or e fo process utilizes the electrolysis and an electric field to manipulate cross membrane ion migration towards reduced solute permeation electrolysis and applied electric field have long been deployed in electrodialysis ed processes to drive charged ions migration across ion exchange membrane it has been reported that effective rsf reduction 57 decrease could be obtained at an applied voltage 1 5 v water splitting detected zou and he 2017a to minimize the effect of ph on electrodes and fo membrane a unique design of three chamber eao with bilateral draw chambers hydraulically connected and middle feed chamber was proposed fig 4 a in a conventional fo process with al fs orientation ds will diffuse first through the support layer j s o s which is governed by the fick s law of diffusion fig 4b black line phillip et al 2010 16 j s s d s d c d t d s t s c d i c s i d s t s c d 0 where d s is the ds diffusion coefficient in supportive layer t s is the thickness of supportive layer c d i is the ds concentration on the surface of support layer c s i is the ds concentration on the supportive layer side of the supportive layer active layer interface initially equals to 0 and c d is the ds concentration in the bulk draw solution assuming c d i c d under a negligible external concentration polarization cath et al 2006 when water electrolysis h reduced to h2

constant z is the valence of specific ion r is the gas constant t is the temperature and e is the applied voltage in a cathode chamber sodium ions in both the draw and the support layer will be dragged towards the cathode electrode i e the dragging effect leading to a relatively lower ds concentration on the supportive layer c d e i c d c d i and hence reduced ion transport j s e s j s s this further renders slower ion transport in the active layer under effective electrolysis j a e a j a a leading to reduced sodium concentration in the feed compared to that of conventional fo c f e c f fig 4b red line however electrolysis assisted strategy can be a double edge sword when electrodes pose a dragging effect towards the opposite charged ions favoring rsf reduction in eao the repelling effect of those electrodes on same charged ions can accelerate their accumulation in the boundary layer and eventually create enhanced leakage of same charged ions as a result the adverse effect of repelling effect can hinder or even exceed the mitigated effect caused by the dragging effect especially at a high applied voltage this was confirmed by a study that showed an increased rsf from 0 96 gmh at 1 5 v to 1 35 gmh at 3 v resulting in a deteriorated mr from 56 9 at 1 5 v to 39 4 at 3 v fig 4c hence a weak electrolysis v 1 5 2 0 v should be exploited in eao to achieve stable water flux reduced rsf and less energy consumption zou and he 2017a eao may offer an energy efficient solution 0 022 kwh m 3 recovered water or 0 044 0 002 kwh kg 1 reduced reversed solute to secure an mr over 50 and more research effort should be invested to better understand the underlying mechanism and optimizing system performance using alternative power sources to sustain an effective electric field for example via bioelectrochemical systems may further reduce energy consumption of eao while accomplishing rsf reduction qin et al 2016 selection of a suitable ds for eao also warrants further investigation the chemically stable na2so4 which was used in the prior study still requires a downstream ds separation regeneration process to produce high quality water as an electrochemical system eao needs optimized system design e g chamber dimension and electrode distance for more effective rsf control in particular conductive fo membrane serving as both the fo membrane and electrode will be of strong interest to achieve better electrochemical performance in eao hou et al 2018 3 3 ultrasonic assisted osmosis uao ultrasonic assisted osmosis uao takes advantage of ultrasound to reduce icp and has been used to concentrate fruit juice as well as natural colorant chanukya and rastogi 2017 kowalski et al 2015 with the aid of ultrasound uao gains enhanced water flux up to 75 at the expense of slightly increased rsf due to the combined effects of reduced icp and localized heating heikkinen et al 2017 comparing to a conventional fo process a reduced srsf can be obtained in uao based on eq 5 j s m j s o while j w m j w o for example notably reduced srsf an mr tds of 51 8 na2so4 as the ds was observed when 20 khz ultrasound was applied in 1 min on and off mode with comparable feed conductivity mainly contributed by rsf but an enhanced water flux from 13 lmh fo to 24 lmh uao heikkinen et al 2017 however the effects of the operation mode on rsf reduction have yet to understand the pulse operation i e on and off mode appears to be the most cost effective mode to reduce rsf in uao and the optimal time period for on and off operation remains to be explored applications of ultrasound may potentially damage membrane integrity and irreversibly alter the physicochemical features of the membrane e g functional groups leading to deteriorated rsf and even a negative mr long term operation of uao needs to be performed to better understand system stability during rsf reduction in conclusion uao demands more investigation to demonstrate its rsf reduction performance 4 advancing membrane development towards a better barrier the existing commercial fo membranes though progressed with increasing membrane performance and decreasing cost still suffer from relatively high icp and reverse solute leakage leading to reduced δπ eff lower water flux fig 5 a gradual loss of ds and elevated operational cost hence developing the next generation fo membranes to achieve both low icp i e high δπ eff and more desirable water flux fig 5b and low solute permeation i e high selectivity is crucial towards a more environmental friendly and cost effective fo based water reclamation process werber et al 2016 a significant amount of research efforts have been invested to advance material development and fabrication techniques at the lab scale li et al 2016 rsf reduction can be potentially achieved in two ways modification of existing membranes either commercial or previously developed fo membranes and fabrication of new membranes 4 1 membrane modification membrane modification is usually realized via surface coating on the active layer of an existing membrane mostly tfc to enhance antifouling and elevate surface hydrophilicity guo et al 2016 tiraferri et al 2012 leading to reduced icp and higher water flux arena et al 2014 however very few studies of membrane modification have focused on rsf reduction and thus there is a limited amount of data about solute leakage table 1 an mr of 20 9 was estimated for a polydopamine pda coated commercial tfc membrane tfc c0 5 in the original paper guo et al 2018 such a reduction of rsf was likely due to that the coated pda layer although increasing physical water transport resistance has enhanced membrane surface hydrophilicity while reducing water contact angle thereby leading to comparable water permeability coefficient and similar water flux meanwhile the solute permeability coefficient was reduced due to the coated pda layer rendering a higher salt rejection rate a reduced srsf eq 5 and a desirable mr comparing to pristine tfc silver nanoparticle decorated graphene oxide nanosheets agnp go have also been utilized as a surface modification material soroush et al 2015 leading to an mr of up to 15 9 under the al ds orientation soroush et al 2016 that was because of the enhanced water transport 13 sustained by improved membrane hydrophilicity due to surface functional groups from go and presence of cations from agnps and a minor change in solute leakage 3 5 increase in rsf however in some cases of membrane modification for anti fouling enhancement the coated layer would unfortunately hinder effective water permeation j w m j w o 1 while facilitating salt permeation j s m j s o 1 rendering a negative mr for example an mr of 40 0 to 50 0 table 1 was obtained in tfc membranes coated with either agnp go or ag polyethylene glycol pegylated dendrimer nanocomposites soroush et al 2015 zhang et al 2013 this was probably due to the introduction of biocidal surface functional groups agnps to the original ones carboxyl groups but the exact reasons remain unclear thus more research efforts are required to fully understand the mass transport and ion interactions within the coated layer to yield both a consistent antifouling performance and a positive mr via membrane modification 4 2 membrane fabrication new membrane fabrication has shown more promising results in terms of rsf reduction we have analyzed more than 70 studies published in the past decade 2008 2018 to provide a comprehensive evaluation and comparison of water flux srsf and mr among various modified membranes

to tfc membrane was observed especially in the past five years with the latter being used in over 90 of the studies the newly developed tfc fo membranes have exhibited an average water flux of 30 7 14 4 lmh al fs orientation n 35 data points or 49 9 19 0 lmh al ds orientation n 32 data points by using 1 m nacl as the draw solution fig 5c much higher p 0 05 than that of either commercial tfc membranes 9 8 4 0 and 20 7 4 4 lmh or commercial cta 9 5 3 5 and 15 7 1 8 lmh the highest water flux of 70 3 and 84 2 lmh al fs and al ds orientations unless otherwise stated was reported for a tfc membrane with vertically oriented porous substrates to significantly facilitate mass transport and reduce icp liang et al 2017 despite enhanced water flux the newly developed tfc membranes have comparable rsf 1 m nacl as the draw 8 23 4 66 gmh under al fs and 11 23 5 23 gmh under al ds p 0 05 to that of the commercial tfc 3 84 4 24 under al fs and 8 20 6 36 gmh under al ds or commercial cta 7 53 1 86 gmh under al ds fig 5d however solute leakage propensity of an fo membrane needs to be analyzed by considering water flux and the available srsf from literature is provided in fig 5e n 362 data points sorted by year when nacl is selected as the ds the commercial cta membranes exhibit an average srsf of 0 60 0 32 g l 1 0 10 1 29 g l 1 the lowest srsf 0 10 g l 1 was reported with a cta nw flat sheet membrane manufactured by hti wei et al 2011 as for the commercial tfc membranes an average srsf value of 0 44 0 32 g l 1 0 07 1 17 g l 1 has been reported the lowest srsf of a commercial tfc was obtained in a hollow fiber membrane hfb in the original study manufactured by toyobo co ltd ren and mccutcheon 2018 by taking advantage of new membrane fabrication srsf could be significantly decreased comparing to commercial membranes srsf 0 10 g l 1 table 2 for example a novel hydrophilic nylon 6 6 microfiltration membrane supported tfc showed an srsf of 0 036 g l 1 under the al ds orientation huang et al 2013 owing to a notably higher water permeability coefficient a 0 917 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 twice that of hti cta a much reduced solute permeability coefficient b 0 300 l m 2 h 1 31 8 of hti cta and a desirable membrane structure parameter s 1940 μm twice that of hti cta the same research group reproduced a similar srsf of 0 035 g l 1 via selecting nylon 6 6 microfiltration membrane as novel supporting material rendering an mr of 92 4 and 92 0 compared to that of commercial cta and tfc membrane huang and mccutcheon 2015 in addition to the selection of novel supporting materials for tfc duong et al 2015 li et al 2012 srsf could also be reduced to less than 0 10 g l 1 via optimized substrate composition bui and mccutcheon 2013 advanced substrate fabrication instead of conventional wet phase inversion luo et al 2014b shi et al 2011 xiao et al 2015 and new development of active layer shen et al 2016 table 2 nonetheless the majority of srsf reported from new membrane fabrication falls inside the srsf range of commercial ones especially in the past three years fig 5e based on the current analysis and results neither membrane modification nor new membrane fabrication has achieved the consistent results for notably reducing solute permeation several new membranes with significantly lower srsf should be further examined for reliable performance under varied conditions e g feeding stream operating conditions etc future efforts should consider rsf reduction in such design development of fo membranes 5 future of rsf control to further advance rsf control for facilitating fo development extensive efforts are still required in several aspects rsf mitigation via smart selection of ds with low leakage propensity will be desired these novel ds especially stimuli responsive polymers can potentially achieve rsf mitigation due to their relatively large hydrodynamic diameter 100 nm hartanto et al 2015 and membrane size exclusion effect stimuli responsive substances have been studied as ds in recent years because they can be regenerated via reversible separation under a certain stimulus such as temperature ph magnetic field electric or light fig 6 razmjou et al 2015 as a result much less energy compared to that of conventional inorganic ds will be required in the ds separation regeneration process for example polyacrylic acid sodium salt paa na is a well studied ph responsive ds ge et al 2012a gwak et al 2015 besides good water extraction capability up to 25 lmh water flux ge et al 2012b paa na also exhibits extremely low rsf 0 004 0 08 gmh for cta and 0 002 0 009 gmh for tfc and very low srsf 0 002 0 007 g l 1 for paa na with a mw of 2000 5000 and less than 0 001 g l 1 for paa na with a mw of 50 000 due to size exclusion hydrodynamic diameter 120 nm yang et al 2017 nonetheless little rsf data can be found for most thermal magnetic electric or light responsive ds to the best of our knowledge making it extremely difficult to evaluate rsf decrease for these smart ds enhanced reporting of rsf data srsf and or mr should be encouraged in future research development effort to render a comprehensive review adding surfactant as an additive into conventional inorganic ds provides another promising solution for effective rsf reduction surfactants have been proposed as a ds since 2014 with low rsf due to their low level of high micellar mass 14 000 29 000 g mol 1 and membrane size exclusion effect gadelha et al 2014 however surfactants are subject to difficult regeneration process requiring high energy investment and operation cost alternatively surfactants have been added into conventional inorganic ds e g mgcl2 as an additive at a very small amount nguyen et al 2015 achieving desirable water flux 11 4 lmh while providing sufficient electrostatic repulsion force to reduce rsf rsf of 2 03 gmh and srsf of 0 18 g l 1 nguyen et al 2016 recently one surfactant tergitol 15 s 9 was added as an additive in a fertilizer driven fo using nh4 2so4 as the ds tfc membrane resulting in an mr of over 50 with a dosage of only 0 25 mm srsf reduced from 0 18 to 0 09 g l 1 chekli et al 2018 those preliminary results have demonstrated that surfactant additives are worth further research effort for rsf reduction however the fate transport and potential health effects of surfactants even at extremely low concentrations in the final draw solution should be carefully evaluated in a regeneration free fo process e g direct fertigation in fertilizer driven fo the relevant data for better

assessment for overall system performance a threshold srsf value e g srsf 0 1 g l 1 should be proposed and used for future rsf control studies to enable better comparison meanwhile though mathematical modeling of solute transport has been conducted for pristine fo membranes to evaluate the effect of concentration polarization solute solvent interaction solute solute interaction and chemical equilibrium detailed studies listed in introduction section such research efforts have not been well utilized to better understand the rsf reduction performance and reveal the underlying mechanism of an rsf control strategy for example existing models should further extend to investigate ion transport migration diffusion within the coating layer furthermore rsf control has received much less attention comparing to anti fouling research in the fo field though these two subjects are closely correlated in terms of operational strategies and advanced membrane development a large rsf may increase biofouling and scaling whereas the deposited cake layer can promote solute leakage as well hence rsf control should be strongly related to membrane anti fouling features last but not the least complete elimination of rsf may not be possible and thus effective backup strategies should be developed to neutralize salinity buildup i e the consequence of rsf on the feed side via solute removal or recovery to remove the accumulated ds physical separation has been employed by using mf or uf systems to create a backdoor for accumulated salts luo et al 2015 chemical separation takes advantage of reverse fluxed ds to facilitate resource recovery via induced chemical precipitation xie et al 2014 biological removal relies on degradation and assimilation of microorganisms to eliminate biodegradable ds li et al 2015 solute recovery one step beyond removal can be an attractive option to reuse and regenerate reverse fluxed ds and can be realized with the help of electric field e g bioelectrochemical system or electrodialysis to separate charged ds ions from the feed stream qin and he 2014 zou and he 2017b 6 conclusions in this review we have evaluated the potential strategies to decrease reverse permeation of draw solutes in fo processes with the following conclusions rsf is a key challenge in fo based water treatment to accurately quantify the leakage magnitude

membrane offering an energy efficient solution 0 022 kwh m 3 1 5 v to secure an over 50 mr uao harnesses the power of ultrasound to reduce icp rendering an mr tds of 51 8 at the expense of high energy

19129,gravity driven membrane gdm filtration has been investigated for almost 10 years the technology is characterized not only by relatively lower transmembrane pressures which can be achieved by gravity extremely low energy consumption but also by the phenomenon of flux stabilization a biofilm is allowed to form on the membrane and a stabilization of flux occurs which is related to biological processes within the biofilm layer on the membrane this enables stable operation during a year or longer without any cleaning or flushing initially the technology was developed mainly for household drinking water treatment but in the meantime the research and application has expanded to the treatment of greywater rainwater and wastewater as well as the pretreatment of seawater for desalination this review covers the field from the rather fundamental research on biofilm morphology and microbial community analysis to the impact of feedwater composition process parameters and organic removal performance not only household applications but also for community scale treatment and full scale applications are discussed in addition the application potential is highlighted in comparison to conventional ultrafiltration finally an overall assessment is illustrated and the research and development needs are identified keywords gravity driven ultrafiltration biofilm flux stabilization nom

mulder 1996 baker 2012b whereas first research and development efforts mainly focused on food and medical applications water treatment gained increasing attention from about 1990 with an initial focus on the removal of turbidity and pathogens for drinking water production clark and heneghan 1991 the membrane costs were still relatively high at that time so that high flux values were required to make the process economically feasible these high flux values were obtained by applying high pressures around 1 bar or higher combined with an array of methods to prevent fouling and biofouling baker 2012b these methods included energy intensive hydraulically cleaning and chemical cleaning such as cross flow backwash chemical cleaning and disinfection mulder 1996 during the last two decades the membrane price has dropped significantly churchhouse 2000 as a consequence the membrane flux has become less dominant in the cost calculation and a more significant cost reduction could be achieved by reducing energy and chemicals the energy consumption can be reduced by applying low operation pressures and applying effective hydraulic fouling control strategies such as cross flow while reduced chemical consumption can be achieved by less frequent chemical cleaning and disinfection typical operation pressures are around 0 2 1 0 bar with flux values between 50 and 100 l m2h lmh crittenden et al 2005 however measures to control fouling and biofouling were considered indispensable for a stable filtration operation until the first publication appeared on the phenomenon of biofilm controlled flux stabilization peter varbanets et al 2010 in this study it was shown that a dead end operated no cross flow uf system without any chemical or hydraulic control of fouling and biofouling lead to a stable flux value over an extended period of time with a biologically active fouling layer playing an essential role for the stabilization of flux stable flux values were recorded during months of operation in laboratory studies and during one year in field studies peter varbanets et al 2017 while the required transmembrane pressure tmp was lower 0 04 0 1 bar also the stable flux value was reported to be considerably lower than in conventional uf 2 10 lmh depending on the feed water quality in view of the absence of cleaning strategies and the low flux the process was considered to be attractive mainly for decentralized surface water treatment applications the process was first described as gravity driven membrane gdm filtration but can also be described as biofilm controlled ultrafiltration because gdm is meanwhile a widely and generally accepted term we will use this in the present review a description of the principle of gdm filtration with external and submerged membrane configurations is shown in fig 1 since the first discovery of flux stabilization in gdm processes much research has been devoted to better understand the morphology and hydraulic resistance of the biofilm layer on the membrane its biological ecosystem the parameters influencing the process the impact of feed water characteristics the ability of the biofilm in removing dissolved or suspended substances the influence of pre treatment and the application potential in laboratory and field studies this review will provide an overview of all of these aspects of gdm filtration furthermore a comparison will be made with other uf based systems which have been developed to provide low maintenance or low energy systems suitable for decentralized application 2 characteristics of gdm processes the phenomenon of flux stabilization in dead end systems without cleaning and backwashing was first published in 2010 by peter varbanets et al 2010 in the initial period of filtration the flux dropped rapidly to reach a stable level after around 5 days of operation different types of feedwater were treated at a transmembrane pressure tmp of 0 065 bar 65 mbar obtained by gravity

introduced by field et al 1995 as the flux above which fouling occurs it assumes that at critical flux the convection of foulants by flux is just balanced by back transport for non interacting particles such as latex particles operating below critical flux this could represent a long term steady state providing concentration and cross flow are unchanged since the necessary back transport is caused by tangential shear due to cross flow bubbling etc the classical critical flux concept does not apply to dead end filtration as used in the gdm process in addition the application of critical flux to systems with biofouling such as membrane bioreactors mbrs is questionable cho and fane 2002 bacchin et al 2006 to broaden the concept of criticality field and pearce 2011 introduced the idea of threshold flux which is the flux that divides a low fouling region from a high fouling region the threshold flux can apply to cross flow or dead end and any foulants including biofouling based on these considerations it is reasonable to say that the bio stabilized flux in gdm operation is not a critical flux but a type of threshold flux 2 2 morphology and compositions of biofilm on the membrane during gdm filtration the microorganisms organic aggregated colloidal material and particulate organic and inorganic material in the feed water can be rejected by the membrane and then accumulated on the membrane surface these retained substances on the membrane tend to form a biofilm layer which is considered as mini ecological system the characterization of the biofilm in gdm is a complex matter since it includes a range of different fields such as 1 morphology 3 dimensional structure 2 biological activity community composition and their spatial distribution such as prokaryotes bacteria eukaryotes including predators 3 composition of organic and inorganic constituents and their spatial distribution 2 2 1 biofilm morphology in the first paper describing the phenomenon of flux stabilization in the gdm process it was found that flux stabilization was associated with the morphology of the biofilm developed on the membrane surface which was observed by a confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm peter varbanets et al 2010 during the first 3 days of operation a relatively flat and dense biofilm structure was noticed the first detachment of the biofilm from the membrane surface took place at the 7 day after that increased heterogeneity and porosity with the occurrence of large voids between patches of biofilm occurred fig 2 recently optical coherence tomography oct has been widely applied in biofilm structure observation as it provides image acquisition in the range of millimeters wagner et al 2010 image analysis methods based on matlab routines have been developed for the analysis of oct pictures with the possibility of calculating the surface roughness porosity and mean thickness of the biofilm derlon et al 2012 fortunato et al 2016 wang et al 2017 therefore the image acquisition by oct at the meso scale can provide details of important structure function relationships wagner et al 2010 martin et al 2014 desmond et al 2018 several previous studies derlon et al 2012 2013 akhondi et al 2015 wu et al 2016 have employed the oct technique to in situ observe biofilm morphology during gdm filtration similarly to clsm observation results it was also found that with extended filtration time the biofouling layer became thicker more heterogeneous and porous fig 2 the findings from both morphology observation techniques indicate that during gdm filtration the structures i e roughness and porosity of the biofilm developed on the membrane surface experienced dynamic changes with filtration time almost regardless of the feed water type in addition the oct images also revealed the existence of spatial differences in the biofilm with a more dense layer at the membrane surface this so called basal layer achieved a thickness up to 25 μm peter varbanets et al 2011 derlon et al 2012 such a spatial resolution of the biofilm on the membrane provides us valuable information to understand the correlation between the biofilm structure and flux stabilization besides clsm and oct a range of other techniques have been applied in order to reveal the structure of the biofilm a range of methods for the characterization of fouling layer structure architecture fouling composition and biological activity in the gdm process was applied by fortunato et al 2016 besides visualization methods such as oct also the chemical composition was analyzed using different methods including size exclusion chromatography coupled to organic carbon detection sec ocd flow cytometry fcm adenosine triphosphate atp and total organic carbon toc analysis three different scanning electron microscope sem techniques were evaluated environmental sem esem cryo sem and freeze drying sem demonstrating that freeze drying sem provided the best preservation of structural characteristics of the biofouling layer in addition to the techniques mentioned above raman spectroscopy has recently been employed to characterize the composition of biofilms desmond et al 2018 raman spectroscopy has shown to be a useful tool for molecular finger printing of biofilms limitations include poor utility for inorganic foulants for which the signal intensity is very weak raman spectroscopy enabled 2 d mapping of biofilm showing raman shift peaks representative for functional groups relevant for biofilms such as op2 representative for dna rna glucoside ring structures representative for polysaccharides carboxyl groups organic acids and cc stretch modes representative for the backbone of a long chain polysaccharide or peptide using these techniques it was shown that the composition of the biofilm alters for different feedwater compositions including p and n limiting conditions desmond et al 2018 another technique for determining the composition of biofilm is extraction followed by toc analysis and colorimetric determination with these technique specific fouling components can be analyzed such as polysaccharides using the anthrone method proteins using the bicinchoninic acid method and extracellular dna edna using picogreen staining ding et al 2016b 2017c desmond et al 2018 a general limitation of these extraction and colorimetric based methods is the fact that artefacts can occur by interference by other matrix compounds thus hindering quantitative interpretation of the data besides liquid chromatography coupled to organic carbon detection sec ocd has been used to characterize the composition of gdm biofilms huber et al 2011 fortunato et al 2016 another technique which can be used to characterize the organic matter in biofilms is 3d fluorescence excitation emission matrix analysis 3d eem in gdm biofilms it was used to identify the occurrence of aromatic proteins tryptophan containing proteins and humic like substances tang et al 2016b ding et al 2017c a limitation of this technique is however that it only allows for semi quantitative determination of these compounds a comparison of visualization and chemical characterization methods for gdm biofilms is provided in tables 1 and 2 2 2 2 biological composition and function the biological parameters such as amounts of live dead cells microbial community compositions and predation behaviors are relevant to the characteristics of the membrane biofilm in gdm processes several methods have been employed to reveal the amounts of live and dead cells the gdm biofilms including atp analysis peter varbanets et al 2010 flow cytometry and clsm live dead staining akhondi et al 2015 the analytical results in the previous studies revealed that the biofilm layer formed on the membranes displayed a high viability the viable cells were found to be related to the heterogeneity of the biofilm layer i e leading to the formation of cavities and channels inside of the biofilm peter varbanets et al 2010 further identification of microbial community compositions in the gdm biofilm were generally performed by suing pyrosequencing technique several previous studies akhondi et al 2015 have revealed that the bacterial community attached to the membrane was highly diversified the significant differences in prokaryotic and eukaryotic communities existed between the gdm systems with different configurations provide useful information to explain the difference in permeability of those systems wu et al 2017b importantly the presence of the predators could impact the microbial community distribution and biofilm morphology klein et al 2016 when metazoans were spiked to gdm systems operated with river water a substantial improvement of stable flux could be achieved klein et al 2016 in presence of oligochaetes the stable flux at 61 5 mbar value increased to 9 2 12 5 lmh in the presence of nematodes the stable flux increased to 14 0 20 8 lmh while the stable flux in the control systems was 5 7 8 8 lmh this indicates that the activity of metazoans particularly nematodes resulted in major changes of biofilm morphology oligochaetes and nematodes transformed relatively smooth and dense biofilms into highly porous and heterogeneous structures while the basal layer was practically completely removed by nematodes klein et al 2016 resulting in a marked increase in flux similarly böhme showed that protists can influence the basal layer structure with different basal layer thicknesses for different protists böhme et al 2009 previous work on gdm filtration of seawater has demonstrated that the permeate flux can be maintained at about 20 lmh at an equivalent hydraulic pressure of 40 mbar for over almost a year without using any flushing or cleaning this is attributed to the movement and predation behaviors of stichotrichia copepoda and pterygota which were predominant eukaryotes at genus level in the gdm wu et al 2017b on basis of these results the increase of flux was associated with an increased heterogeneity roughness of the basal layer on the membrane surface which was attributed to the activity of the predators it remains partly unclear how the bacterial and eukaryotic population of the biofilm is by the water composition and operation conditions more research will be required in order to reveal such mechanisms 2 2 3 organic inorganic substance composition organic inorganic substances accumulated in the biofilm layer perform several roles 1 they are considered as nutrients for bacterial growth 2 they could cause membrane organic inorganic fouling to influence permeate water productivity 3 their presence could influence the morphology of biofilm matrix a range of methods such as extracellular polymeric substances eps extraction and analysis ding et al 2016b 2017c desmond et al 2018 size exclusion chromatography coupled to organic carbon detection sec ocd peter varbanets et al 2010 2011 chomiak et al 2015 fortunato et al 2016 ding et al 2017a 3d fluorescence excitation emission matrix technique 3d eem tang et al 2016b ding et al 2017c raman spectroscopy desmond et al 2018 have been applied for the characterization of organic compositions in the biofilm layer on the membrane surface in the gdm systems although these gdm systems were fed with different types of water with dissimilar characteristics it was found that 1 microbial products protein and polysaccharides derived products and slowly biodegraded products were majorly present in the biofilm matrixes 2 lower organic substances present in the biofilm matrix led to higher permeate flux furthermore the accumulated organic inorganic substances in the biofilm layer could affect the biofilm morphology structure for example the presence of small kaolin particles 3 6 μm in the feedwater was shown to lead to more compact fouling layer structures with an increased hydraulic resistance chomiak et al 2014 the presence of large particles 18 1 μm diatomaceous earth mixed with kaolin on the other hand did not increase the hydraulic resistance in comparison to a gdm system without addition of kaolin 3 the parameters influencing stable flux and biofilm cake properties 3 1 feed water gdm systems have been reported to be applied in treating river water for decentralized potable use rain water and greywater for decentralized non potable use wastewater for safe discharge and pre treating seawater for desalination as shown in table 3 the stabilized flux levels in the gdm systems are related to the types of feed water generally the feed water containing higher organic substances appears to result in forming biofilm with higher resistance leading to permeate flux in a sequence as follows diluted wastewater greywater rainwater river water seawater this trend was further confirmed by the facts that 1 the addition of wastewater to river water resulted in a lower stable flux value peter varbanets et al 2011 2 the average flux in treating low organics containing lake water was 5 lmh and decreased to 2 lmh in treating high organics containing lake water due to algal growth lee et al 2017 possibly higher organic substances in the feed water could cause 1 more organic accumulation in the biofilm matrix this could be due to the organic amounts deposited on the membrane surface were sufficient and beyond microbial utilization capability and 2 limited oxygen levels in the gdm systems such oxygen conditions may be unfavorable to the growth and predation activity of the eukaryotes derived from the feed water 3 2 operation pressure in conventional mf uf membrane processes with effective fouling control strategies an increased driving pressure generally leads to almost linearly increase of the permeate flux in the gdm system however the variation of tmp did not result in a significant difference in stable flux illustrated in several studies peter varbanets et al 2010 kus et al 2013a akhondi et al 2015 derlon et al 2016 tang et al 2016a this means the total resistance of the fouled membrane increased with the increase of pressure during membrane filtration this effect was attributed to compression of the fouling layer at higher pressures leading to a lower porosity and higher resistance of the fouling layer peter varbanets et al 2010 derlon et al 2016 for example tang et al 2016a operated out the gdm system under different operation pressures 60 120 and 200 mbar for reservoir water treatment the flux stabilized around 8 6 lmh at a tmp of 200 mbar which was only slightly higher than at the lowest pressure 60 mbar with a stable flux of 6 6 lmh kus et al 2013a also reported that flux was independent of the water head in the gdm system which was varied in the range of 0 15 2 0 m corresponding to 15 200 mbar this implies that the total resistance varied between 11 1011 1 4 1014 m 1 therefore it is suggested that lower pressure 40 60 mbar is more favorable for this type of passive membrane filtration process due to the reduced energy consumption 3 3 temperature in the gdm systems temperature is an important parameter 1 relating to the permeate water viscosity which determines the water permeate flux based on the darcy s law and 2 influencing microbial growth and activity thus the gdm performance could be influenced by operating temperature akhondi et al 2015 found that when the operating temperature varied from 21 1 c to 29 1 c the fouling resistance was reduced by 25 at 40 mbar of driving force and 21 at 100 mbar of driving force meanwhile at a higher temperature 29 1 c it was noticed that the biovolume reduced and porosity increased with the filtration time this may be associated with a higher predation activity of the grazers 3 4 intermittent operation as gdm or gravity driven membrane bioreactor gdmbr systems have been considered as suitable decentralized water or wastewater treatment technique it is likely their operation is carried out on a discontinuous base the impact of intermittent operation and forward flushing on the flux stabilization during dead end ultrafiltration of drinking water was investigated derlon et al 2012 the results revealed that a standstill period resulted in fouling layer relaxation and consequently temporary flux increase followed by a flux decrease towards the stable flux value furthermore it was shown that flushing after a standstill period further intensifies this process flux decline and recovery during intermittent operation with or without flushing were reversible additionally they found that particles deposited in the fouling layer form larger aggregates during standstill periods thus in addition to back diffusion aggregation processes also play an important role during standstill and flux recovery moreover the impact of intermittent operation can be predicted depending on the duration of the standstill and operating periods in addition combined intermittent air sparging a few minutes per day and intermittent relaxation several hours per day was also attempted to be applied for the gdm system in treating a mixture of pond and tap water oka et al 2017 by optimizing the intermittent air sparging conditions a stable permeability was achieved amounting for 40 of the initial permeability while without air sparging the stable permeability was 21 of the initial permeability furthermore intermittent relaxation resulted in a 40 60 increase in stable flux depending on the time of relaxation 1 8 h per day although increasing the permeation standstill period could increase the flux level this may decrease the average permeate water production rate l d tang et al 2016a found that when the standstill period was as high as 12 h the water production rate was lower than the control although the flux during operation was higher than the control 3 5 shear conditions in conventional membrane filtration processes shear force was generally applied to alleviate membrane fouling in the gdm systems shear force was also proposed to improve permeate flux however ding et al 2016a found in the gdm system for grey water treatment the permeate flux did not stabilize in the shear reactor and decreased down to 0 5 lmh at the end of the test period which was much lower than the non shear gdm system with the stable value of 2 lmh it was attributed to the fact that the shear stress resulted in a thinner but denser bio fouling layer with higher eps content proteins and polysaccharides the shear conditions might select for the strongly binding micro organisms while the higher eps content was related to this binding capacity and the high resistance of the fouling layer additionally the hydraulically reversible resistance and irreversible resistance were higher which indicates that strong shear stress would increase the cleaning frequency it has also been reported that shear stress produced at the membrane surface might cause cell damage with subsequent release of intracellular dissolved organic matters and signs of membrane fouling behavior chow et al 1999 campinas and rosa 2010 while a combination of shear force with permeation relaxation could improve permeate flux in the gdm systems for example after a standstill time of 2 7 days the biofilm was expanded and could easily be removed by gentle shaking sloughing off resulting in about 50 flux recovery peter varbanets et al 2011 3 6 do concentration it is well known that oxygen is necessary for the metabolism of microorganisms in mbr systems it was found that the do concentration not only influences the growth of the bacteria on the membrane during the filtration but also the properties of the suspended biomass in submerged membrane systems such as the floc structure particle size distribution and the content of eps in a mbr system as well as the permeate flux wilén and balmér 1999 yoon kim et al 2006 yun et al 2006 however dissimilar conclusions were generally drawn because of complexity of mbrs in the gdm systems the effect of do concentration on membrane performance was also examined and it appears that high do levels benefited to membrane performance peter varbanets et al 2011 prepared feed water containing different fractions of wastewater for gdm filtration and the do concentration ranged from 0 1 to 7 9 mg l results showed that the flux stabilized with all feed waters but that a high do 7 9 mg l resulted in a considerably higher permeate flux 8 9 lmh compared with the low do 0 1 mg l which achieved a stable value of 0 8 lmh a similar observation was also noticed by ding et al 2017a that low do 0 4 0 6 mg l increased the hydraulically reversible resistance and cake layer resistance compared with high do 6 0 6 5 mg l in a gdmbr system for grey water treatment this phenomenon was attributed to the fact that the bio fouling layer grown under low do condition exhibited a lower biological activity was thicker and had a lower surface roughness as well as contained higher eps contents including proteins and polysaccharides 3 7 membrane and membrane module configuration in the gdm systems the biofilm layer performs a predominant role in controlling the permeate flux while the membrane resistance has less contribution to the gdm performance table 3 however it still needs to be further clarified whether the properties of membrane and membrane module configurations influence the biofilm development which may lead to an impact on the gdm performance frechen et al 2011 compared the performance of the membranes with a pore size of 100 nm and 20 nm flat sheet membrane in the gdm system treating river water although initial flux values were quite different stable flux values were similar around 4 5 lmh in the gdm systems for seawater pretreatment several types of microfiltration mf and uf polymeric flat sheet membranes were used wu et al 2016 2017a as shown in table 4 a wide range of clean water permeate flux values 27 795 lmh was noticed depending on the membrane pore size and materials however their stabilized flux was comparable within a range of 2 7 8 4 lmh in the dead end filtration cell systems shorter hrt or 16 3 18 6 lmh in the submerged gdm reactors longer hrt lee et al 2017 tested three uf membranes pes 100 kda pvdf 120 kda and pvdf 100 kda and one mf membrane ptfe 0 3 μm in the gdm systems for treating lake water the flux variations were quite similar for the four membranes during the entire gdm filtration these observations indicated that membrane property has little effect on the flux furthermore chawla et al made a comparison of hollow fiber outside in and flat sheet membrane modules for the treatment of river water chawla et al 2017 monitoring the flux during around 1 month it appears that the flux stabilized in the flat sheet system at around 2 lmh corresponding to a hydraulic resistance of around 2 0 1013 m 1 but it cannot be concluded with certainty if the flux stabilized in the hollow fiber system since still some flux decrease could be observed in the last days of operation higher flux values were monitored with decreasing duration of filtration and increasing frequency of standstill in the submerged gdm systems treating seawater table 4 it was found that the flat sheet membrane modules had a higher permeate flux than the hollow fibre membrane modules however the hollow fibre membrane modules offer greater productivity per footprint furthermore compared to the tested flat sheet membrane modules the tested hollow fibre membrane modules displayed less cake layer fouling potential possibly because hollow fibre configuration led to more effective detachment of such fouling layers from the membrane in addition for the hollow fibre membrane module the fibre packing density is another crucial parameter impacting gdm performance less packing density tends to provide more space for the eukaryotes to move and predate the bacteria attached on the membrane which benefits to flux improvement while once the available space is enough for the movement of the eukaryotes further expanding the space could not benefit to further increase permeate flux table 5 when the reactor space is limited the hollow fibre membrane module with higher packing density can be a suitable choice due to greater productivity per footprint therefore the hollow fibre membrane with less membrane resistance reduced irreversible fouling potential greater packing density i e smaller hollow fibre diameter and a degree of looseness can be the optimal membrane for the gdm system in order to achieve economically comparable to conventional uf processes overall the results from these studies imply that membrane properties have limited influence on the gdm performance but membrane module and reactor configurations could have significant effects on the gdm performance 3 8 integration with other processes to improve gdm performance in terms of membrane permeate flux and organic removal the gdm system was proposed to be combined with other processes such as biofilm reactor adsorption process coagulation process etc the purposes of additional processes are expected to reduce organic substances in the gdm by enhancing biodegradation or by physical removal however whether the additional processes benefit to gdm performance appears case by case wu et al 2016 integrated biofilm reactor with the submerged gdm system to extend the organic retention time and promote biomass the hybrid biofilm submerged gdm reactor displayed a higher permeate flux 5 7 8 6 lmh than that of single gdm filtration cell 4 5 lmh in addition an increased hydraulic retention time was beneficial to improve the removal of the dissolved organic substances during gdm filtration leading to improved permeate quality ding et al 2018a 2018b added a granular activated carbon gac layer or powered activated carbon pac layer or sand layer on the membrane surface in the gdm system treating rainwater it was found that improved 20 25 removal efficiency of organics because gac or pac layer could effectively adsorb florescent compounds e g aromatic proteins tryptophan proteins and humics however compared to the gdm system without gac or pac layer 4 5 lmh the presence of gac layer decreased the level of stable flux 3 0 3 2 lmh due to a denser bio fouling layer with higher amount of biomass and extracellular polymeric substances contents however the sand layer assisted system did not show any improvement in organic removal and led to a lower permeate flux compared to the control system ding et al 2017b combined in situ coagulation or pre coagulation with the gdmbr system for treating synthetic sewage the results showed that in situ coagulation and pre coagulation increased more than two fold and one fold of permeability respectively compared to the control system without coagulation this is due to the presence of the dosed aluminum preventing formation of microbial metabolites and helping avoid membrane pore blocking 4 contribution of biofilm cake layer to organic removal in gdm processes in the gdm process the membrane is expected to reject greater sized particles or colloidal and the biofilm developed on the membrane is expected to enhance dissolved organic substances as the biofilm can either act as a secondary membrane separation role or perform biodegradation of organic substances in order to illustrate the biofilm role in the gdm system detailed analysis of organic removal effectiveness by the gdm process was emphasized in previous studies table 6 using sec ocd to analyze the organic fractions of doc in feed and permeate it was shown that around 5 40 of the humic acids and 70 90 of the biopolymers in river water are removed by the gdm system peter varbanets et al 2011 chawla et al 2017 while the removal of biopolymers by uf membranes is expected because of their size the removal of humic compounds is supposed to be due to the biofilm acting as a secondary membrane since the molecular weight of the humic acids 1000 da is much smaller than the mwco of the uf membrane peter varbanets et al 2011 in order to confirm this hypothesis ding et al compared the removal of organics in the gdm process with the removal by a virgin membrane ding et al 2017a the results showed that the removal of several nom fractions in the gdm process was significantly higher than that by the pristine uf membrane the uf membrane rejected biopolymers by 44 47 7 while the rejections in the gdm systems were around 93 9 95 9 furthermore the uf membrane rejected humic substances by 31 2 38 1 while the rejections in the gdm systems were 48 1 51 6 since humic acids are considered to be a relatively stable end product of degradation processes their increased rejection can be attributed to the gdm fouling layer acting as a secondary membrane the increased rejection of biopolymers can be attributed to either biological activity the action of a secondary membrane or a combination of both also in case of diluted wastewater treated by the gdm system a substantial reduction of doc was observed by comparing the organic compositions of the feed and permeate with significant reduction of biopolymers from 539 to 64 74 mg l humic substances 738 55 155 mg l and building blocks 157 41 63 mg l wang et al 2017 a complete rejection of proteins was reported in the final stage of operation it is elucidated that the high removal of humic substances was attributed to retention by the fouling layer acting as a secondary membrane an improved permeate quality due to the presence of the biofilm in gdm was also observed in gdm systems operated with synthetic water spiked with organic substances dextran chomiak et al 2015 it was reported that the removal of low molecular weight dextran 1 kda progressively increased to almost 30 after a few days of operation and finally reached nearly 100 which was attributed to biological activity in the biofilm high molecular weight dextran molecules 150 and 2000 kda were initially retained due to their size but hydrolysis combined with biological degradation occurred with extending operation time 7 days as assimilable organic carbon aoc has been identified as an advanced indicator for assessment of biofilm regrowth the aoc removal efficiency by the gdm system has paid more attentions it is worth noting that the removal of aoc in the gdm system is a more complex process in a system with acetate as carbon source the presence of the biofilm on the membrane was found to increase the removal of aoc with 80 of aoc removed in the gdm system compared to 10 removed by the virgin membrane derlon et al 2014 in case of natural river water the aoc removal ranged between 60 and 80 during the first 2 months of operation with relatively stable aoc concentrations in the permeate upon longer operation the aoc concentration in the permeate increase and the removal ranged between 10 and 60 it was suggested that the decrease in aoc during longer operation times might be caused by increasing accumulation of organic matter on the membrane in combination with hydrolysis and release of low mw material which is detected as aoc in the gdm pilot system pre treating seawater more than 50 of aoc removal was also observed wu et al 2017a this increased aoc removal resulted in an improved performance of the subsequent ro system the tmp in the ro did not increase with gdm pretreatment while a steady increase was observed with a conventional uf pretreatment wu et al 2017b besides organic related parameters the removal of specific compounds has been investigated in gdm systems for example microcystins are cyanobacterial toxins as excreted substances derived from microcystis aeruginosa which can incur a problem for drinking water safety kohler et al 2014 found that the biofilm on the membrane in the gdm system could successfully reduce the amount of microcystins to below the critical threshold concentration of 1 μg l this could be related to the activity of microcystin degrading bacteria developing within the biofilm after exposure to microcystins the removal of different classes of compounds is summarized in table 6 5 implementation aspects of field and pilot gdm processes initially gdm systems are expected to be applied as decentralized drinking water treatment facility several pilot gdm systems have been reported to be installed in the areas without available drinking water facility and successfully operated with plenty of fundamental research works carried on the gdm systems the optimized optimization conditions of the gdm systems have been achieved and the gdm systems have been also scaled up for other applications case 1 a gravity driven hollow fiber ultrafiltration with periodical backwashing was designed to treat microbiological water with periodic cleaning and backwashing the system can produce 9 l h of clean water for household use the cost per liter treated is estimated at us 0 001 l clasen et al 2009 case 2 a gravity driven water treatment on a smaller scale membrane area of 6 and 11 m2 termed as water backpack intended for emergency relief such as earth quakes or tsunamis frechen et al 2011 a flux of around 5 lmh could be maintained over two months of operation without any flushing or cleaning treating surface water with turbidity values of up to 70 ntu case 3 a community scale pilot study using gdm filtration was reported by boulestreau boulestreau et al 2012 treating river water in south africa ogunjini region for decentralized drinking water production with a capacity of 5 m3 day the pilot consisted of a submerged flat sheet membrane module of 40 m2 installed in a marine container for ease of transportation the membrane tank was regularly drained on a day to week basis in order to remove debris during about 3 months of operation the turbidity of the feedwater was most of the time around 10 50 ntu but regular peaks occurred with turbidity raising up to 605 ntu it was concluded that the stable flux remained high 5 7 lmh when the turbidity remained in a reasonable range 160 ntu while extremely high peaks of turbidity 600 ntu led to a decrease in flux to about 2 4 lmh case 4 three gdm pilot systems were operated at schools in uganda during an extended period of time peter varbanets et al 2017 treating lake victoria water at different locations busime bulwande lugala the lake water was pumped with a pipe line to a storage tank which fed the gdm system and another storage tank was used for the purified water monthly maintenance included draining the gdm tank as well as shock chlorination of the clean water tank and network after almost one year of operation the flux was 2 95 lmh in bulwande and 5 2 lmh in lugala while the clean water flux of the membrane was 11 6 lmh at the applied pressure of 75 100 mbar the highest flux was achieved in busima 10 7 lmh although this system was not yet stable each system had a membrane area of 75 m2 so that the water treatment capacity of the systems was between 5 3 and 19 3 m3 per day case 5 the pilot gdm system has been used to pre treat seawater for reverse osmosis desalination wu et al 2017b a stable flux of 18 6 1 4 lmh could be maintained at a gravitational pressure of 40 mbar during an operating time of more than one year this corresponds to a total resistance of 7 7 1011 m 1 which in fact is only slightly higher than many virgin uf membranes and in fact is the lowest resistance value observed for the reported gdm systems in treating different types of water this may be associated with relatively low organic contents and the abundance of eukaryotes in raw seawater contributing to form more heterogeneous cake layers on the membranes it was shown that the gdm pretreatment had a beneficial effect in comparison to a conventional uf the tmp of the subsequent reverse osmosis system did not increase when gdm pretreated seawater was fed while a steady tmp increase of the subsequent reverse osmosis system was observed with uf pretreated seawater wu et al 2017b case 6 rainwater was treated by gdm combined with gac in a pilot study by kus et al kus et al 2013b a a hollow fiber polysulfone membrane with a pore size of 100 nm was operated in a submerged manner outside in a stable flux of 0 47 lmh was maintained during 60 days of operation 6 economic assessment of gdm processes due to gravity driven nature gdm systems are energy efficient processes in the comparison of gdm with other technologies the decreased energy consumption or complete absence of external energy has been mentioned often as an advantage indeed in household water treatment systems the system is usually operated manually so no external energy is required however in larger scale gravity driven systems for drinking water production a pumping system is required to transport the feed water up to the inlet of the system it is reported that the gdm system that was developed as an autonomous water treatment system for emergency relief had a membrane area of 11 m2 at an estimated price of 700 euro around 860 us and consumed only 0 02 0 04 kwh m3 which is substantially less than for normal mbrs frechen et al 2011 in addition in a gdm pilot plant in south africa treating river water with a capacity of 5 m3 day the energy demand consisted only of the pump energy required to transport to the inlet which amounted to 0 006 kwh m3 boulestreau et al 2012 in gravity driven systems for wastewater or greywater treatment aeration is required which increases the energy consumption a so called gravity driven mbr gdmbr consumed 0 040 kwh m3 for the treatment of grey water for comparison a low energy mbr without cleaning flushing in a moving bed biofilm membrane reactor mbbmr consumed less than 1 3 kwh m3 jabornig and favero 2013 for conventional mbrs the energy consumption is in the range of 0 3 6 1 kwh m3 with 4 9 6 1 kwh m3 reported by gil et al 2010 0 64 kwh m3 by fenu et al 2010 1 1 2 53 kwh m3 by komesli et al 2015 and 0 3 0 4 kwh m3 by van dijk et al vandijk and roncken 1997 obviously the decreased energy consumption in the gdmbr goes to the expense of flux the flux in the gdmbr was in the range of 1 2 lmh while conventional mbrs are operated at a flux of 8 25 lmh also for drinking water treatment by gdm systems reported stable flux values of 4 20 lmh are considerably smaller than those in uf plants with flushing and cleaning which are in the range of 50 100 lmh mulder 1996 baker 2012a crittenden et al 2012 it is obvious that a cost comparison between gdm and uf is dependent on case specific parameters e g local electricity tariff and labor costs and therefore a cost comparison cannot be made on a quantitative basis thus we will make a cost assessment and comparison between gdm and conventional uf on a qualitative basis the integral costs of a membrane plant are considered to be the sum the capital expenditure capex and operating expenditure opex judd 2017 capex includes all equipment land and installation services costs whereas opex is primarily determined by the chemical and energy costs membrane replacement costs labor and other items such as water supply and wastewater discharge costs whereby both opex and capex are expressed as costs per m3 of water produced this means that in order to calculate capex the investment costs are depreciated over a certain period of time comparing the costs of gdm versus conventional uf technology it should be noticed that the cost balance will depend strongly on the scale the capex is mainly determined by 1 the membrane investment costs and 2 auxiliary equipment such as pumps vessels and process control because membranes are packed in modules the investment costs increase almost linearly with the plant capacity thus the membrane investment costs for gdm are higher than for conventional uf as schematically shown in fig 3 a obviously the relative position of these lines depends on the level of stable flux in gdm and the average flux value in conventional uf on the other hand the costs for auxiliary equipment such as pumps and process control will be higher for conventional uf in contrary to the membrane costs which increase almost linearly in view of the modular concept the rule of scale applies for auxiliary equipment which means that these costs increase less than linear with scale usually exponential functions are applied to describe the costs depending on production scale with typical exponents in the order of 0 6 westney 1997 a schematic qualitative presentation of the costs of auxiliary costs as a function of production capacity is shown in fig 3b the sum of membrane and equipment costs is schematically shown in fig 3c the graphs show a break even point at which the investment costs for both processes are the same arrow in fig 3c the capex however is expressed not as investment costs but as investment costs per m3 of water produced and the result of this conversion is shown in fig 3d as mentioned above the operating costs opex are determined mainly by i chemical consumption ii energy consumption iii membrane replacement costs and iv labor costs i no chemical membrane cleaning is applied in gdm although in some cases intermittent disinfection of the feed lines or storage vessels was applied peter varbanets et al 2017 however in comparable treatment plants the chemical consumption is expected to be lower than in conventional uf ii in view of the absence of flushing and the lower tmp the energy consumption of gdm is considerably lower than for conventional uf or conventional mbr s iii the membrane replacement costs will be higher due to the higher membrane area of gdm on the other hand the membrane lifetime expectance is considerably larger than for conventional uf since gdm is operated without chemicals which is considered to be the main lifetime limiting factor of polymeric membranes baker 2012b peter varbanets et al 2017 iv since the gdm does not need supervision no skilled personnel is required the operation maintenance labor costs are therefore are expected to be lower than in conventional uf based on the assessments above a qualitative comparison of costs was made for gdm versus conventional uf on 3 different scales 1 household scale with a capacity of 20 50 l day 2 treatment for small communities with a capacity of 1 10 m3 day 3 full scale with a capacity of more than 100 m3 day the cost trends concerning both capex and opex are summarized in table 7 as already mentioned the cost balance will depend on many factors which are locally determined for example the energy price and the costs of labor will have a large impact while also the comparative levels of flux in gdm and uf are important factors thus the feasibility of gdm should be calculated for each situation specifically however the above considerations show that the niche for application is for small to mid scale plant sizes 7 perspectives for research and potential applications of gdm processes 7 1 stabilization of flux the literature describes high flux values 10 20 lmh to be associated mainly with the occurrence of higher organisms metazoans while low flux values 5 lmh seem to be associated with water sources with a high fouling potential such as greywater the question is how high flux values can be achieved for a broad range of water types and conditions the growth of metazoans in the biofilm seems to be a rather erratic process since 1 the occurrence in the feed water is dependent on the water source and seasonal conditions and 2 the growth and sustainability of these organisms in the biofilm is hard to control on basis of the existing knowledge on their ecology therefore cultivation and dosing of specific types of metazoans has been discussed as a possible measure to sustain a constant level of organisms in the system klein et al 2016 however it is questionable if this measure is economically and technically feasible at least for a small scale application this does not seem to be the case for large scale applications the implementation of such a measure is worthwhile to investigate since it could reduce the required membrane area by a factor 2 or higher in comparison to gdm without metazoan control the relatively low flux obtained in the case of greywater kunzle et al 2015 ding et al 2016b appears to be associated with the high general fouling potential of this type of water pretreatment of the feedwater by gac adsorption has been shown effective to increase the stable flux in gdm tang et al 2017 from 2 to 6 lmh this effect was associated with the removal of foulants and the improvement of growth conditions for higher organisms while the above study was carried out for river water the same technology could be studied for greywater 7 2 improvement of permeate quality as discussed the presence of a biofilm in the gdm process can result in higher rejections of a range of compounds including humic acids polysaccharides proteins aoc and microcystins although it was speculated that both straining effects the biofilm acting as a secondary membrane and biological degradation processes within the biofilm can play a role in this improved removal the exact mechanisms still remain unclear in order to obtain a better understanding of these mechanisms dedicated experiments could be designed for example using radioactively labelled compounds to trace the fate of specific compounds also it would be worthwhile to investigate the fate of other compounds in gdm as compared to conventional uf specifically the fate of organic and inorganic micropollutants should be investigated since they occur in many drinking water resources and are relevant for human health with regard to the removal of aoc it was observed that removal takes place by fresh biofilms but leaching occurs in more mature biofilms presumably due to hydrolysis and release from the biofilm itself chomiak et al 2015 in order to sustain a high aoc removal during longer operation periods it could be considered if it is possible to intermittently remove the biofilm from the membrane for example using flushing or aeration strategies 7 3 potentials of application table 7 gives a qualitative overview of different cost factors of gdm in comparison to conventional uf for different scales of application in order to make a quantification of costs a specific case study should be selected where experience is available on the process parameters for gdm and uf this means that long term optimization studies are required for both technologies a first step in this direction was made by pilot experiments with different membrane module configuration for seawater treatment wu et al 2017a but also in this case the experiments were carried out on a small scale which may not be representative for a full scale treatment plant in such studies also the required operation and maintenance for gdm if any should be studied and the membrane life time should be estimated table 7 identifies household scale water treatment systems as a clear niche for application of gdm which is also proven by the commercialization for emergency relief in the so called water backpack frechen et al 2011 application on community scale is being investigated for water kiosks at schools in uganda peter varbanets et al 2017 the benefits of the gdm technology compared to uf for this specific setting including the reduced need for operation and maintenance no moving parts and process control as well as independence from grid electricity for other settings on community scale e g for community scale rainwater treatment in industrialized countries the benefits of gdm may be less clear long term studies are required also here to provide a more quantitative basis for comparison for large scale application it remains unclear if gdm technology can ever compete with conventional uf in order to investigate this option not only long term pilot studies are needed but also a collaboration with commercial partners is required in order to make an assessment of all relevant cost factors 8 conclusions different types of water resources including river and pond water greywater sea water and diluted wastewater can be treated by ultrafiltration at a stable flux without cleaning or flushing a higher transmembrane pressures results in increased hydraulic resistance and therefore the process is mostly operated at low pressures below 0 1 bar which can be obtained by gravity less than 1 m of water head the flux stabilization in the gdm process is related to the formation of a biofouling layer a range of visualization methods and analytical techniques has been applied to characterize the biofouling layer this has revealed that different types of organisms contribute to the formation of a heterogeneous fouling layer containing with a stable hydraulic resistance the available publications show a correlation between stable flux and water composition with lower stable fluxes reported for waters with a higher content of toc in addition the composition of the microbial community composition and the content of extracellular polymeric substances eps in the fouling layer have been reported to correlate to the stable flux value the presence of the biofouling layer was found to contribute to the improvement of the water quality improving the removal of a range of compounds including humic acids biopolymers aoc and algal toxins the presence of specific types of predators was reported to result in an increase in fouling layer heterogeneity and a higher permeability thus process and membrane module configurations which allowed the proliferation of higher organisms predators lead to an increased productivity after standstill periods a flux recovery was reported by several authors this feature can be used to optimize productivity in decentralized operation which are characterized by a varying water demand in comparison to conventional uf the costs of the gdm process show a stronger correlation with treatment capacity therefore the gdm process is typically more favorable than conventional uf at low capacities in remote settings and situations where the process operators and electricity is not always available the gdm process provides additional advantages in terms of process robustness declaration of interests the authors

19129,gravity driven membrane gdm filtration has been investigated for almost 10 years the technology is characterized not only by relatively lower transmembrane pressures which can be achieved by gravity extremely low energy consumption but also by the phenomenon of flux stabilization a biofilm is allowed to form on the membrane and a stabilization of flux occurs which is related to biological processes within the biofilm layer on the membrane this enables stable operation during a year or longer without any cleaning or flushing initially the technology was developed mainly for household drinking water treatment but in the meantime the research and application has expanded to the treatment of greywater rainwater and wastewater as well as the pretreatment of seawater for desalination this review covers the field from the rather fundamental research on biofilm morphology and microbial community analysis to the impact of feedwater composition process parameters and organic removal performance not only household applications but also for community scale treatment and full scale applications are discussed in addition the application potential is highlighted in comparison to conventional ultrafiltration finally an overall assessment is illustrated and the research and development needs are identified keywords gravity driven ultrafiltration biofilm flux stabilization nom removal cake layer membrane fouling 1 introduction for more than half a century ultrafiltration uf has been an established technology featuring membranes with a pore size in the range of 5 100 nm mulder 1996 baker 2012b whereas first research and development efforts mainly focused on food and medical applications water treatment gained increasing attention from about 1990 with an initial focus on the removal of turbidity and pathogens for drinking water production clark and heneghan 1991 the membrane costs were still relatively high at that time so that high flux values were required to make the process economically feasible these high flux values were obtained by applying high pressures around 1 bar or higher combined with an array of methods to prevent fouling and biofouling baker 2012b these methods included energy intensive hydraulically cleaning and chemical cleaning such as cross flow backwash chemical cleaning and disinfection mulder 1996 during the last two decades the membrane price has dropped significantly churchhouse 2000 as a consequence the membrane flux has become less dominant in the cost calculation and a more significant cost reduction could be achieved by reducing energy and chemicals the energy consumption can be reduced by applying low operation pressures and applying effective hydraulic fouling control strategies such as cross flow while reduced chemical consumption can be achieved by less frequent chemical cleaning and disinfection typical operation pressures are around 0 2 1 0 bar with flux values between 50 and 100 l m2h lmh crittenden et al 2005 however measures to control fouling and biofouling were considered indispensable for a stable filtration operation until the first publication appeared on the phenomenon of biofilm controlled flux stabilization peter varbanets et al 2010 in this study it was shown that a dead end operated no cross flow uf system without any chemical or hydraulic control of fouling and biofouling lead to a stable flux value over an extended period of time with a biologically active fouling layer playing an essential role for the stabilization of flux stable flux values were recorded during months of operation in laboratory studies and during one year in field studies peter varbanets et al 2017 while the required transmembrane pressure tmp was lower 0 04 0 1 bar also the stable flux value was reported to be considerably lower than in conventional uf 2 10 lmh depending on the feed water quality in view of the absence of cleaning strategies and the low flux the process was considered to be attractive mainly for decentralized surface water treatment applications the process was first described as gravity driven membrane gdm filtration but can also be described as biofilm controlled ultrafiltration because gdm is meanwhile a widely and generally accepted term we will use this in the present review a description of the principle of gdm filtration with external and submerged membrane configurations is shown in fig 1 since the first discovery of flux stabilization in gdm processes much research has been devoted to better understand the morphology and hydraulic resistance of the biofilm layer on the membrane its biological ecosystem the parameters influencing the process the impact of feed water characteristics the ability of the biofilm in removing dissolved or suspended substances the influence of pre treatment and the application potential in laboratory and field studies this review will provide an overview of all of these aspects of gdm filtration furthermore a comparison will be made with other uf based systems which have been developed to provide low maintenance or low energy systems suitable for decentralized application 2 characteristics of gdm processes the phenomenon of flux stabilization in dead end systems without cleaning and backwashing was first published in 2010 by peter varbanets et al 2010 in the initial period of filtration the flux dropped rapidly to reach a stable level after around 5 days of operation different types of feedwater were treated at a transmembrane pressure tmp of 0 065 bar 65 mbar obtained by gravity depending on the feed water composition the flux stabilized at a value of 4 10 l m 2 h 1 lmh 2 1 the stable flux of gdm versus critical or threshold flux concept the concept of critical flux was introduced by field et al 1995 as the flux above which fouling occurs it assumes that at critical flux the convection of foulants by flux is just balanced by back transport for non interacting particles such as latex particles operating below critical flux this could represent a long term steady state providing concentration and cross flow are unchanged since the necessary back transport is caused by tangential shear due to cross flow bubbling etc the classical critical flux concept does not apply to dead end filtration as used in the gdm process in addition the application of critical flux to systems with biofouling such as membrane bioreactors mbrs is questionable cho and fane 2002 bacchin et al 2006 to broaden the concept of criticality field and pearce 2011 introduced the idea of threshold flux which is the flux that divides a low fouling region from a high fouling region the threshold flux can apply to cross flow or dead end and any foulants including biofouling based on these considerations it is reasonable to say that the bio stabilized flux in gdm operation is not a critical flux but a type of threshold flux 2 2 morphology and compositions of biofilm on the membrane during gdm filtration the microorganisms organic aggregated colloidal material and particulate organic and inorganic material in the feed water can be rejected by the membrane and then accumulated on the membrane surface these retained substances on the membrane tend to form a biofilm layer which is considered as mini ecological system the characterization of the biofilm in gdm is a complex matter since it includes a range of different fields such as 1 morphology 3 dimensional structure 2 biological activity community composition and their spatial distribution such as prokaryotes bacteria eukaryotes including predators 3 composition of organic and inorganic constituents and their spatial distribution 2 2 1 biofilm morphology in the first paper describing the phenomenon of flux stabilization in the gdm process it was found that flux stabilization was associated with the morphology of the biofilm developed on the membrane surface which was observed by a confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm peter varbanets et al 2010 during the first 3 days of operation a relatively flat and dense biofilm structure was noticed the first detachment of the biofilm from the membrane surface took place at the 7 day after that increased heterogeneity and porosity with the occurrence of large voids between patches of biofilm occurred fig 2 recently optical coherence tomography oct has been widely applied in biofilm structure observation as it provides image acquisition in the range of millimeters wagner et al 2010 image analysis methods based on matlab routines have been developed for the analysis of oct pictures with the possibility of calculating the surface roughness porosity and mean thickness of the biofilm derlon et al 2012 fortunato et al 2016 wang et al 2017 therefore the image acquisition by oct at the meso scale can provide details of important structure function relationships wagner et al 2010 martin et al 2014 desmond et al 2018 several previous studies derlon et al 2012 2013 akhondi et al 2015 wu et al 2016 have employed the oct technique to in situ observe biofilm morphology during gdm filtration similarly to clsm observation results it was also found that with extended filtration time the biofouling layer became thicker more heterogeneous and porous fig 2 the findings from both morphology observation techniques indicate that during gdm filtration the structures i e roughness and porosity of the biofilm developed on the membrane surface experienced dynamic changes with filtration time almost regardless of the feed water type in addition the oct images also revealed the existence of spatial differences in the biofilm with a more dense layer at the membrane surface this so called basal layer achieved a thickness up to 25 μm peter varbanets et al 2011 derlon et al 2012 such a spatial resolution of the biofilm on the membrane provides us valuable information to understand the correlation between the biofilm structure and flux stabilization besides clsm and oct a range of other techniques have been applied in order to reveal the structure of the biofilm a range of methods for the characterization of fouling layer structure architecture fouling composition and biological activity in the gdm process was applied by fortunato et al 2016 besides visualization methods such as oct also the chemical composition was analyzed using different methods including size exclusion chromatography coupled to organic carbon detection sec ocd flow cytometry fcm adenosine triphosphate atp and total organic carbon toc analysis three different scanning electron microscope sem techniques were evaluated environmental sem esem cryo sem and freeze drying sem demonstrating that freeze drying sem provided the best preservation of structural characteristics of the biofouling layer in addition to the techniques mentioned above raman spectroscopy has recently been employed to characterize the composition of biofilms desmond et al 2018 raman spectroscopy has shown to be a useful tool for molecular finger printing of biofilms limitations include poor utility for inorganic foulants for which the signal intensity is very weak raman spectroscopy enabled 2 d mapping of biofilm showing raman shift peaks representative for functional groups relevant for biofilms such as op2 representative for dna rna glucoside ring structures representative for polysaccharides carboxyl groups organic acids and cc stretch modes representative for the backbone of a long chain polysaccharide or peptide using these techniques it was shown that the composition of the biofilm alters for different feedwater compositions including p and n limiting conditions desmond et al 2018 another technique for determining the composition of biofilm is extraction followed by toc analysis and colorimetric determination with these technique specific fouling components can be analyzed such as polysaccharides using the anthrone method proteins using the bicinchoninic acid method and extracellular dna edna using picogreen staining ding et al 2016b 2017c desmond et al 2018 a general limitation of these extraction and colorimetric based methods is the fact that artefacts can occur by interference by other matrix compounds thus hindering quantitative interpretation of the data besides liquid chromatography coupled to organic carbon detection sec ocd has been used to characterize the composition of gdm biofilms huber et al 2011 fortunato et al 2016 another technique which can be used to characterize the organic matter in biofilms is 3d fluorescence excitation emission matrix analysis 3d eem in gdm biofilms it was used to identify the occurrence of aromatic proteins tryptophan containing proteins and humic like substances tang et al 2016b ding et al 2017c a limitation of this technique is however that it only allows for semi quantitative determination of these compounds a comparison of visualization and chemical characterization methods for gdm biofilms is provided in tables 1 and 2 2 2 2 biological composition and function the biological parameters such as amounts of live dead cells microbial community compositions and predation behaviors are relevant to the characteristics of the membrane biofilm in gdm processes several methods have been employed to reveal the amounts of live and dead cells the gdm biofilms including atp analysis peter varbanets et al 2010 flow cytometry and clsm live dead staining akhondi et al 2015 the analytical results in the previous studies revealed that the biofilm layer formed on the membranes displayed a high viability the viable cells were found to be related to the heterogeneity of the biofilm layer i e leading to the formation of cavities and channels inside of the biofilm peter varbanets et al 2010 further identification of microbial community compositions in the gdm biofilm were generally performed by suing pyrosequencing technique several previous studies akhondi et al 2015 have revealed that the bacterial community attached to the membrane was highly diversified the significant differences in prokaryotic and eukaryotic communities existed between the gdm systems with different configurations provide useful information to explain the difference in permeability of those systems wu et al 2017b importantly the presence of the predators could impact the microbial community distribution and biofilm morphology klein et al 2016 when metazoans were spiked to gdm systems operated with river water a substantial improvement of stable flux could be achieved klein et al 2016 in presence of oligochaetes the stable flux at 61 5 mbar value increased to 9 2 12 5 lmh in the presence of nematodes the stable flux increased to 14 0 20 8 lmh while the stable flux in the control systems was 5 7 8 8 lmh this indicates that the activity of metazoans particularly nematodes resulted in major changes of biofilm morphology oligochaetes and nematodes transformed relatively smooth and dense biofilms into highly porous and heterogeneous structures while the basal layer was practically completely removed by nematodes klein et al 2016 resulting in a marked increase in flux similarly böhme showed that protists can influence the basal layer structure with different basal layer thicknesses for different protists böhme et al 2009 previous work on gdm filtration of seawater has demonstrated that the permeate flux can be maintained at about 20 lmh at an equivalent hydraulic pressure of 40 mbar for over almost a year without using any flushing or cleaning this is attributed to the movement and predation behaviors of stichotrichia copepoda and pterygota which were predominant eukaryotes at genus level in the gdm wu et al 2017b on basis of these results the increase of flux was associated with an increased heterogeneity roughness of the basal layer on the membrane surface which was attributed to the activity of the predators it remains partly unclear how the bacterial and eukaryotic population of the biofilm is by the water composition and operation conditions more research will be required in order to reveal such mechanisms 2 2 3 organic inorganic substance composition organic inorganic substances accumulated in the biofilm layer perform several roles 1 they are considered as nutrients for bacterial growth 2 they could cause membrane organic inorganic fouling to influence permeate water productivity 3 their presence could influence the morphology of biofilm matrix a range of methods such as extracellular polymeric substances eps extraction and analysis ding et al 2016b 2017c desmond et al 2018 size exclusion chromatography coupled to organic carbon detection sec ocd peter varbanets et al 2010 2011 chomiak et al 2015 fortunato et al 2016 ding et al 2017a 3d fluorescence excitation emission matrix technique 3d eem tang et al 2016b ding et al 2017c raman spectroscopy desmond et al 2018 have been applied for the characterization of organic compositions in the biofilm layer on the membrane surface in the gdm systems although these gdm systems were fed with different types of water with dissimilar characteristics it was found that 1 microbial products protein and polysaccharides derived products and slowly biodegraded products were majorly present in the biofilm matrixes 2 lower organic substances present in the biofilm matrix led to higher permeate flux furthermore the accumulated organic inorganic substances in the biofilm layer could affect the biofilm morphology structure for example the presence of small kaolin particles 3 6 μm in the feedwater was shown to lead to more compact fouling layer structures with an increased hydraulic resistance chomiak et al 2014 the presence of large particles 18 1 μm diatomaceous earth mixed with kaolin on the other hand did not increase the hydraulic resistance in comparison to a gdm system without addition of kaolin 3 the parameters influencing stable flux and biofilm cake properties 3 1 feed water gdm systems have been reported to be applied in treating river water for decentralized potable use rain water and greywater for decentralized non potable use wastewater for safe discharge and pre treating seawater for desalination as shown in table 3 the stabilized flux levels in the gdm systems are related to the types of feed water generally the feed water containing higher organic substances appears to result in forming biofilm with higher resistance leading to permeate flux in a sequence as follows diluted wastewater greywater rainwater river water seawater this trend was further confirmed by the facts that 1 the addition of wastewater to river water resulted in a lower stable flux value peter varbanets et al 2011 2 the average flux in treating low organics containing lake water was 5 lmh and decreased to 2 lmh in treating high organics containing lake water due to algal growth lee et al 2017 possibly higher organic substances in the feed water could cause 1 more organic accumulation in the biofilm matrix this could be due to the organic amounts deposited on the membrane surface were sufficient and beyond microbial utilization capability and 2 limited oxygen levels in the gdm systems such oxygen conditions may be unfavorable to the growth and predation activity of the eukaryotes derived from the feed water 3 2 operation pressure in conventional mf uf membrane processes with effective fouling control strategies an increased driving pressure generally leads to almost linearly increase of the permeate flux in the gdm system however the variation of tmp did not result in a significant difference in stable flux illustrated in several studies peter varbanets et al 2010 kus et al 2013a akhondi et al 2015 derlon et al 2016 tang et al 2016a this means the total resistance of the fouled membrane increased with the increase of pressure during membrane filtration this effect was attributed to compression of the fouling layer at higher pressures leading to a lower porosity and higher resistance of the fouling layer peter varbanets et al 2010 derlon et al 2016 for example tang et al 2016a operated out the gdm system under different operation pressures 60 120 and 200 mbar for reservoir water treatment the flux stabilized around 8 6 lmh at a tmp of 200 mbar which was only slightly higher than at the lowest pressure 60 mbar with a stable flux of 6 6 lmh kus et al 2013a also reported that flux was independent of the water head in the gdm system which was varied in the range of 0 15 2 0 m corresponding to 15 200 mbar this implies that the total resistance varied between 11 1011 1 4 1014 m 1 therefore it is suggested that lower pressure 40 60 mbar is more favorable for this type of passive membrane filtration process due to the reduced energy consumption 3 3 temperature in the gdm systems temperature is an important parameter 1 relating to the permeate water viscosity which determines the water permeate flux based on the darcy s law and 2 influencing microbial growth and activity thus the gdm performance could be influenced by operating temperature akhondi et al 2015 found that when the operating temperature varied from 21 1 c to 29 1 c the fouling resistance was reduced by 25 at 40 mbar of driving force and 21 at 100 mbar of driving force meanwhile at a higher temperature 29 1 c it was noticed that the biovolume reduced and porosity increased with the filtration time this may be associated with a higher predation activity of the grazers 3 4 intermittent operation as gdm or gravity driven membrane bioreactor gdmbr systems have been considered as suitable decentralized water or wastewater treatment technique it is likely their operation is carried out on a discontinuous base the impact of intermittent operation and forward flushing on the flux stabilization during dead end ultrafiltration of drinking water was investigated derlon et al 2012 the results revealed that a standstill period resulted in fouling layer relaxation and consequently temporary flux increase followed by a flux decrease towards the stable flux value furthermore it was shown that flushing after a standstill period further intensifies this process flux decline and recovery during intermittent operation with or without flushing were reversible additionally they found that particles deposited in the fouling layer form larger aggregates during standstill periods thus in addition to back diffusion aggregation processes also play an important role during standstill and flux recovery moreover the impact of intermittent operation can be predicted depending on the duration of the standstill and operating periods in addition combined intermittent air sparging a few minutes per day and intermittent relaxation several hours per day was also attempted to be applied for the gdm system in treating a mixture of pond and tap water oka et al 2017 by optimizing the intermittent air sparging conditions a stable permeability was achieved amounting for 40 of the initial permeability while without air sparging the stable permeability was 21 of the initial permeability furthermore intermittent relaxation resulted in a 40 60 increase in stable flux depending on the time of relaxation 1 8 h per day although increasing the permeation standstill period could increase the flux level this may decrease the average permeate water production rate l d tang et al 2016a found that when the standstill period was as high as 12 h the water production rate was lower than the control although the flux during operation was higher than the control 3 5 shear conditions in conventional membrane filtration processes shear force was generally applied to alleviate membrane fouling in the gdm systems shear force was also proposed to improve permeate flux however ding et al 2016a found in the gdm system for grey water treatment the permeate flux did not stabilize in the shear reactor and decreased down to 0 5 lmh at the end of the test period which was much lower than the non shear gdm system with the stable value of 2 lmh it was attributed to the fact that the shear stress resulted in a thinner but denser bio fouling layer with higher eps content proteins and polysaccharides the shear conditions might select for the strongly binding micro organisms while the higher eps content was related to this binding capacity and the high resistance of the fouling layer additionally the hydraulically reversible resistance and irreversible resistance were higher which indicates that strong shear stress would increase the cleaning frequency it has also been reported that shear stress produced at the membrane surface might cause cell damage with subsequent release of intracellular dissolved organic matters and signs of membrane fouling behavior chow et al 1999 campinas and rosa 2010 while a combination of shear force with permeation relaxation could improve permeate flux in the gdm systems for example after a standstill time of 2 7 days the biofilm was expanded and could easily be removed by gentle shaking sloughing off resulting in about 50 flux recovery peter varbanets et al 2011 3 6 do concentration it is well known that oxygen is necessary for the metabolism of microorganisms in mbr systems it was found that the do concentration not only influences the growth of the bacteria on the membrane during the filtration but also the properties of the suspended biomass in submerged membrane systems such as the floc structure particle size distribution and the content of eps in a mbr system as well as the permeate flux wilén and balmér 1999 yoon kim et al 2006 yun et al 2006 however dissimilar conclusions were generally drawn because of complexity of mbrs in the gdm systems the effect of do concentration on membrane performance was also examined and it appears that high do levels benefited to membrane performance peter varbanets et al 2011 prepared feed water containing different fractions of wastewater for gdm filtration and the do concentration ranged from 0 1 to 7 9 mg l results showed that the flux stabilized with all feed waters but that a high do 7 9 mg l resulted in a considerably higher permeate flux 8 9 lmh compared with the low do 0 1 mg l which achieved a stable value of 0 8 lmh a similar observation was also noticed by ding et al 2017a that low do 0 4 0 6 mg l increased the hydraulically reversible resistance and cake layer resistance compared with high do 6 0 6 5 mg l in a gdmbr system for grey water treatment this phenomenon was attributed to the fact that the bio fouling layer grown under low do condition exhibited a lower biological activity was thicker and had a lower surface roughness as well as contained higher eps contents including proteins and polysaccharides 3 7 membrane and membrane module configuration in the gdm systems the biofilm layer performs a predominant role in controlling the permeate flux while the membrane resistance has less contribution to the gdm performance table 3 however it still needs to be further clarified whether the properties of membrane and membrane module configurations influence the biofilm development which may lead to an impact on the gdm performance frechen et al 2011 compared the performance of the membranes with a pore size of 100 nm and 20 nm flat sheet membrane in the gdm system treating river water although initial flux values were quite different stable flux values were similar around 4 5 lmh in the gdm systems for seawater pretreatment several types of microfiltration mf and uf polymeric flat sheet membranes were used wu et al 2016 2017a as shown in table 4 a wide range of clean water permeate flux values 27 795 lmh was noticed depending on the membrane pore size and materials however their stabilized flux was comparable within a range of 2 7 8 4 lmh in the dead end filtration cell systems shorter hrt or 16 3 18 6 lmh in the submerged gdm reactors longer hrt lee et al 2017 tested three uf membranes pes 100 kda pvdf 120 kda and pvdf 100 kda and one mf membrane ptfe 0 3 μm in the gdm systems for treating lake water the flux variations were quite similar for the four membranes during the entire gdm filtration these observations indicated that membrane property has little effect on the flux furthermore chawla et al made a comparison of hollow fiber outside in and flat sheet membrane modules for the treatment of river water chawla et al 2017 monitoring the flux during around 1 month it appears that the flux stabilized in the flat sheet system at around 2 lmh corresponding to a hydraulic resistance of around 2 0 1013 m 1 but it cannot be concluded with certainty if the flux stabilized in the hollow fiber system since still some flux decrease could be observed in the last days of operation higher flux values were monitored with decreasing duration of filtration and increasing frequency of standstill in the submerged gdm systems treating seawater table 4 it was found that the flat sheet membrane modules had a higher permeate flux than the hollow fibre membrane modules however the hollow fibre membrane modules offer greater productivity per footprint furthermore compared to the tested flat sheet membrane modules the tested hollow fibre membrane modules displayed less cake layer fouling potential possibly because hollow fibre configuration led to more effective detachment of such fouling layers from the membrane in addition for the hollow fibre membrane module the fibre packing density is another crucial parameter impacting gdm performance less packing density tends to provide more space for the eukaryotes to move and predate the bacteria attached on the membrane which benefits to flux improvement while once the available space is enough for the movement of the eukaryotes further expanding the space could not benefit to further increase permeate flux table 5 when the reactor space is limited the hollow fibre membrane module with higher packing density can be a suitable choice due to greater productivity per footprint therefore the hollow fibre membrane with less membrane resistance reduced irreversible fouling potential greater packing density i e smaller hollow fibre diameter and a degree of looseness can be the optimal membrane for the gdm system in order to achieve economically comparable to conventional uf processes overall the results from these studies imply that membrane properties have limited influence on the gdm performance but membrane module and reactor configurations could have significant effects on the gdm performance 3 8 integration with other processes to improve gdm performance in terms of membrane permeate flux and organic removal the gdm system was proposed to be combined with other processes such as biofilm reactor adsorption process coagulation process etc the purposes of additional processes are expected to reduce organic substances in the gdm by enhancing biodegradation or by physical removal however whether the additional processes benefit to gdm performance appears case by case wu et al 2016 integrated biofilm reactor with the submerged gdm system to extend the organic retention time and promote biomass the hybrid biofilm submerged gdm reactor displayed a higher permeate flux 5 7 8 6 lmh than that of single gdm filtration cell 4 5 lmh in addition an increased hydraulic retention time was beneficial to improve the removal of the dissolved organic substances during gdm filtration leading to improved permeate quality ding et al 2018a 2018b added a granular activated carbon gac layer or powered activated carbon pac layer or sand layer on the membrane surface in the gdm system treating rainwater it was found that improved 20 25 removal efficiency of organics because gac or pac layer could effectively adsorb florescent compounds e g aromatic proteins tryptophan proteins and humics however compared to the gdm system without gac or pac layer 4 5 lmh the presence of gac layer decreased the level of stable flux 3 0 3 2 lmh due to a denser bio fouling layer with higher amount of biomass and extracellular polymeric substances contents however the sand layer assisted system did not show any improvement in organic removal and led to a lower permeate flux compared to the control system ding et al 2017b combined in situ coagulation or pre coagulation with the gdmbr system for treating synthetic sewage the results showed that in situ coagulation and pre coagulation increased more than two fold and one fold of permeability respectively compared to the control system without coagulation this is due to the presence of the dosed aluminum preventing formation of microbial metabolites and helping avoid membrane pore blocking 4 contribution of biofilm cake layer to organic removal in gdm processes in the gdm process the membrane is expected to reject greater sized particles or colloidal and the biofilm developed on the membrane is expected to enhance dissolved organic substances as the biofilm can either act as a secondary membrane separation role or perform biodegradation of organic substances in order to illustrate the biofilm role in the gdm system detailed analysis of organic removal effectiveness by the gdm process was emphasized in previous studies table 6 using sec ocd to analyze the organic fractions of doc in feed and permeate it was shown that around 5 40 of the humic acids and 70 90 of the biopolymers in river water are removed by the gdm system peter varbanets et al 2011 chawla et al 2017 while the removal of biopolymers by uf membranes is expected because of their size the removal of humic compounds is supposed to be due to the biofilm acting as a secondary membrane since the molecular weight of the humic acids 1000 da is much smaller than the mwco of the uf membrane peter varbanets et al 2011 in order to confirm this hypothesis ding et al compared the removal of organics in the gdm process with the removal by a virgin membrane ding et al 2017a the results showed that the removal of several nom fractions in the gdm process was significantly higher than that by the pristine uf membrane the uf membrane rejected biopolymers by 44 47 7 while the rejections in the gdm systems were around 93 9 95 9 furthermore the uf membrane rejected humic substances by 31 2 38 1 while the rejections in the gdm systems were 48 1 51 6 since humic acids are considered to be a relatively stable end product of degradation processes their increased rejection can be attributed to the gdm fouling layer acting as a secondary membrane the increased rejection of biopolymers can be attributed to either biological activity the action of a secondary membrane or a combination of both also in case of diluted wastewater treated by the gdm system a substantial reduction of doc was observed by comparing the organic compositions of the feed and permeate with significant reduction of biopolymers from 539 to 64 74 mg l humic substances 738 55 155 mg l and building blocks 157 41 63 mg l wang et al 2017 a complete rejection of proteins was reported in the final stage of operation it is elucidated that the high removal of humic substances was attributed to retention by the fouling layer acting as a secondary membrane an improved permeate quality due to the presence of the biofilm in gdm was also observed in gdm systems operated with synthetic water spiked with organic substances dextran chomiak et al 2015 it was reported that the removal of low molecular weight dextran 1 kda progressively increased to almost 30 after a few days of operation and finally reached nearly 100 which was attributed to biological activity in the biofilm high molecular weight dextran molecules 150 and 2000 kda were initially retained due to their size but hydrolysis combined with biological degradation occurred with extending operation time 7 days as assimilable organic carbon aoc has been identified as an advanced indicator for assessment of biofilm regrowth the aoc removal efficiency by the gdm system has paid more attentions it is worth noting that the removal of aoc in the gdm system is a more complex process in a system with acetate as carbon source the presence of the biofilm on the membrane was found to increase the removal of aoc with 80 of aoc removed in the gdm system compared to 10 removed by the virgin membrane derlon et al 2014 in case of natural river water the aoc removal ranged between 60 and 80 during the first 2 months of operation with relatively stable aoc concentrations in the permeate upon longer operation the aoc concentration in the permeate increase and the removal ranged between 10 and 60 it was suggested that the decrease in aoc during longer operation times might be caused by increasing accumulation of organic matter on the membrane in combination with hydrolysis and release of low mw material which is detected as aoc in the gdm pilot system pre treating seawater more than 50 of aoc removal was also observed wu et al 2017a this increased aoc removal resulted in an improved performance of the subsequent ro system the tmp in the ro did not increase with gdm pretreatment while a steady increase was observed with a conventional uf pretreatment wu et al 2017b besides organic related parameters the removal of specific compounds has been investigated in gdm systems for example microcystins are cyanobacterial toxins as excreted substances derived from microcystis aeruginosa which can incur a problem for drinking water safety kohler et al 2014 found that the biofilm on the membrane in the gdm system could successfully reduce the amount of microcystins to below the critical threshold concentration of 1 μg l this could be related to the activity of microcystin degrading bacteria developing within the biofilm after exposure to microcystins the removal of different classes of compounds is summarized in table 6 5 implementation aspects of field and pilot gdm processes initially gdm systems are expected to be applied as decentralized drinking water treatment facility several pilot gdm systems have been reported to be installed in the areas without available drinking water facility and successfully operated with plenty of fundamental research works carried on the gdm systems the optimized optimization conditions of the gdm systems have been achieved and the gdm systems have been also scaled up for other applications case 1 a gravity driven hollow fiber ultrafiltration with periodical backwashing was designed to treat microbiological water with periodic cleaning and backwashing the system can produce 9 l h of clean water for household use the cost per liter treated is estimated at us 0 001 l clasen et al 2009 case 2 a gravity driven water treatment on a smaller scale membrane area of 6 and 11 m2 termed as water backpack intended for emergency relief such as earth quakes or tsunamis frechen et al 2011 a flux of around 5 lmh could be maintained over two months of operation without any flushing or cleaning treating surface water with turbidity values of up to 70 ntu case 3 a community scale pilot study using gdm filtration was reported by boulestreau boulestreau et al 2012 treating river water in south africa ogunjini region for decentralized drinking water production with a capacity of 5 m3 day the pilot consisted of a submerged flat sheet membrane module of 40 m2 installed in a marine container for ease of transportation the membrane tank was regularly drained on a day to week basis in order to remove debris during about 3 months of operation the turbidity of the feedwater was most of the time around 10 50 ntu but regular peaks occurred with turbidity raising up to 605 ntu it was concluded that the stable flux remained high 5 7 lmh when the turbidity remained in a reasonable range 160 ntu while extremely high peaks of turbidity 600 ntu led to a decrease in flux to about 2 4 lmh case 4 three gdm pilot systems were operated at schools in uganda during an extended period of time peter varbanets et al 2017 treating lake victoria water at different locations busime bulwande lugala the lake water was pumped with a pipe line to a storage tank which fed the gdm system and another storage tank was used for the purified water monthly maintenance included draining the gdm tank as well as shock chlorination of the clean water tank and network after almost one year of operation the flux was 2 95 lmh in bulwande and 5 2 lmh in lugala while the clean water flux of the membrane was 11 6 lmh at the applied pressure of 75 100 mbar the highest flux was achieved in busima 10 7 lmh although this system was not yet stable each system had a membrane area of 75 m2 so that the water treatment capacity of the systems was between 5 3 and 19 3 m3 per day case 5 the pilot gdm system has been used to pre treat seawater for reverse osmosis desalination wu et al 2017b a stable flux of 18 6 1 4 lmh could be maintained at a gravitational pressure of 40 mbar during an operating time of more than one year this corresponds to a total resistance of 7 7 1011 m 1 which in fact is only slightly higher than many virgin uf membranes and in fact is the lowest resistance value observed for the reported gdm systems in treating different types of water this may be associated with relatively low organic contents and the abundance of eukaryotes in raw seawater contributing to form more heterogeneous cake layers on the membranes it was shown that the gdm pretreatment had a beneficial effect in comparison to a conventional uf the tmp of the subsequent reverse osmosis system did not increase when gdm pretreated seawater was fed while a steady tmp increase of the subsequent reverse osmosis system was observed with uf pretreated seawater wu et al 2017b case 6 rainwater was treated by gdm combined with gac in a pilot study by kus et al kus et al 2013b a a hollow fiber polysulfone membrane with a pore size of 100 nm was operated in a submerged manner outside in a stable flux of 0 47 lmh was maintained during 60 days of operation 6 economic assessment of gdm processes due to gravity driven nature gdm systems are energy efficient processes in the comparison of gdm with other technologies the decreased energy consumption or complete absence of external energy has been mentioned often as an advantage indeed in household water treatment systems the system is usually operated manually so no external energy is required however in larger scale gravity driven systems for drinking water production a pumping system is required to transport the feed water up to the inlet of the system it is reported that the gdm system that was developed as an autonomous water treatment system for emergency relief had a membrane area of 11 m2 at an estimated price of 700 euro around 860 us and consumed only 0 02 0 04 kwh m3 which is substantially less than for normal mbrs frechen et al 2011 in addition in a gdm pilot plant in south africa treating river water with a capacity of 5 m3 day the energy demand consisted only of the pump energy required to transport to the inlet which amounted to 0 006 kwh m3 boulestreau et al 2012 in gravity driven systems for wastewater or greywater treatment aeration is required which increases the energy consumption a so called gravity driven mbr gdmbr consumed 0 040 kwh m3 for the treatment of grey water for comparison a low energy mbr without cleaning flushing in a moving bed biofilm membrane reactor mbbmr consumed less than 1 3 kwh m3 jabornig and favero 2013 for conventional mbrs the energy consumption is in the range of 0 3 6 1 kwh m3 with 4 9 6 1 kwh m3 reported by gil et al 2010 0 64 kwh m3 by fenu et al 2010 1 1 2 53 kwh m3 by komesli et al 2015 and 0 3 0 4 kwh m3 by van dijk et al vandijk and roncken 1997 obviously the decreased energy consumption in the gdmbr goes to the expense of flux the flux in the gdmbr was in the range of 1 2 lmh while conventional mbrs are operated at a flux of 8 25 lmh also for drinking water treatment by gdm systems reported stable flux values of 4 20 lmh are considerably smaller than those in uf plants with flushing and cleaning which are in the range of 50 100 lmh mulder 1996 baker 2012a crittenden et al 2012 it is obvious that a cost comparison between gdm and uf is dependent on case specific parameters e g local electricity tariff and labor costs and therefore a cost comparison cannot be made on a quantitative basis thus we will make a cost assessment and comparison between gdm and conventional uf on a qualitative basis the integral costs of a membrane plant are considered to be the sum the capital expenditure capex and operating expenditure opex judd 2017 capex includes all equipment land and installation services costs whereas opex is primarily determined by the chemical and energy costs membrane replacement costs labor and other items such as water supply and wastewater discharge costs whereby both opex and capex are expressed as costs per m3 of water produced this means that in order to calculate capex the investment costs are depreciated over a certain period of time comparing the costs of gdm versus conventional uf technology it should be noticed that the cost balance will depend strongly on the scale the capex is mainly determined by 1 the membrane investment costs and 2 auxiliary equipment such as pumps vessels and process control because membranes are packed in modules the investment costs increase almost linearly with the plant capacity thus the membrane investment costs for gdm are higher than for conventional uf as schematically shown in fig 3 a obviously the relative position of these lines depends on the level of stable flux in gdm and the average flux value in conventional uf on the other hand the costs for auxiliary equipment such as pumps and process control will be higher for conventional uf in contrary to the membrane costs which increase almost linearly in view of the modular concept the rule of scale applies for auxiliary equipment which means that these costs increase less than linear with scale usually exponential functions are applied to describe the costs depending on production scale with typical exponents in the order of 0 6 westney 1997 a schematic qualitative presentation of the costs of auxiliary costs as a function of production capacity is shown in fig 3b the sum of membrane and equipment costs is schematically shown in fig 3c the graphs show a break even point at which the investment costs for both processes are the same arrow in fig 3c the capex however is expressed not as investment costs but as investment costs per m3 of water produced and the result of this conversion is shown in fig 3d as mentioned above the operating costs opex are determined mainly by i chemical consumption ii energy consumption iii membrane replacement costs and iv labor costs i no chemical membrane cleaning is applied in gdm although in some cases intermittent disinfection of the feed lines or storage vessels was applied peter varbanets et al 2017 however in comparable treatment plants the chemical consumption is expected to be lower than in conventional uf ii in view of the absence of flushing and the lower tmp the energy consumption of gdm is considerably lower than for conventional uf or conventional mbr s iii the membrane replacement costs will be higher due to the higher membrane area of gdm on the other hand the membrane lifetime expectance is considerably larger than for conventional uf since gdm is operated without chemicals which is considered to be the main lifetime limiting factor of polymeric membranes baker 2012b peter varbanets et al 2017 iv since the gdm does not need supervision no skilled personnel is required the operation maintenance labor costs are therefore are expected to be lower than in conventional uf based on the assessments above a qualitative comparison of costs was made for gdm versus conventional uf on 3 different scales 1 household scale with a capacity of 20 50 l day 2 treatment for small communities with a capacity of 1 10 m3 day 3 full scale with a capacity of more than 100 m3 day the cost trends concerning both capex and opex are summarized in table 7 as already mentioned the cost balance will depend on many factors which are locally determined for example the energy price and the costs of labor will have a large impact while also the comparative levels of flux in gdm and uf are important factors thus the feasibility of gdm should be calculated for each situation specifically however the above considerations show that the niche for application is for small to mid scale plant sizes 7 perspectives for research and potential applications of gdm processes 7 1 stabilization of flux the literature describes high flux values 10 20 lmh to be associated mainly with the occurrence of higher organisms metazoans while low flux values 5 lmh seem to be associated with water sources with a high fouling potential such as greywater the question is how high flux values can be achieved for a broad range of water types and conditions the growth of metazoans in the biofilm seems to be a rather erratic process since 1 the occurrence in the feed water is dependent on the water source and seasonal conditions and 2 the growth and sustainability of these organisms in the biofilm is hard to control on basis of the existing knowledge on their ecology therefore cultivation and dosing of specific types of metazoans has been discussed as a possible measure to sustain a constant level of organisms in the system klein et al 2016 however it is questionable if this measure is economically and technically feasible at least for a small scale application this does not seem to be the case for large scale applications the implementation of such a measure is worthwhile to investigate since it could reduce the required membrane area by a factor 2 or higher in comparison to gdm without metazoan control the relatively low flux obtained in the case of greywater kunzle et al 2015 ding et al 2016b appears to be associated with the high general fouling potential of this type of water pretreatment of the feedwater by gac adsorption has been shown effective to increase the stable flux in gdm tang et al 2017 from 2 to 6 lmh this effect was associated with the removal of foulants and the improvement of growth conditions for higher organisms while the above study was carried out for river water the same technology could be studied for greywater 7 2 improvement of permeate quality as discussed the presence of a biofilm in the gdm process can result in higher rejections of a range of compounds including humic acids polysaccharides proteins aoc and microcystins although it was speculated that both straining effects the biofilm acting as a secondary membrane and biological degradation processes within the biofilm can play a role in this improved removal the exact mechanisms still remain unclear in order to obtain a better understanding of these mechanisms dedicated experiments could be designed for example using radioactively labelled compounds to trace the fate of specific compounds also it would be worthwhile to investigate the fate of other compounds in gdm as compared to conventional uf specifically the fate of organic and inorganic micropollutants should be investigated since they occur in many drinking water resources and are relevant for human health with regard to the removal of aoc it was observed that removal takes place by fresh biofilms but leaching occurs in more mature biofilms presumably due to hydrolysis and release from the biofilm itself chomiak et al 2015 in order to sustain a high aoc removal during longer operation periods it could be considered if it is possible to intermittently remove the biofilm from the membrane for example using flushing or aeration strategies 7 3 potentials of application table 7 gives a qualitative overview of different cost factors of gdm in comparison to conventional uf for different scales of application in order to make a quantification of costs a specific case study should be selected where experience is available on the process parameters for gdm and uf this means that long term optimization studies are required for both technologies a first step in this direction was made by pilot experiments with different membrane module configuration for seawater treatment wu et al 2017a but also in this case the experiments were carried out on a small scale which may not be representative for a full scale treatment plant in such studies also the required operation and maintenance for gdm if any should be studied and the membrane life time should be estimated table 7 identifies household scale water treatment systems as a clear niche for application of gdm which is also proven by the commercialization for emergency relief in the so called water backpack frechen et al 2011 application on community scale is being investigated for water kiosks at schools in uganda peter varbanets et al 2017 the benefits of the gdm technology compared to uf for this specific setting including the reduced need for operation and maintenance no moving parts and process control as well as independence from grid electricity for other settings on community scale e g for community scale rainwater treatment in industrialized countries the benefits of gdm may be less clear long term studies are required also here to provide a more quantitative basis for comparison for large scale application it remains unclear if gdm technology can ever compete with conventional uf in order to investigate this option not only long term pilot studies are needed but also a collaboration with commercial partners is required in order to make an assessment of all relevant cost factors 8 conclusions different types of water resources including river and pond water greywater sea water and diluted wastewater can be treated by ultrafiltration at a stable flux without cleaning or flushing a higher transmembrane pressures results in increased hydraulic resistance and therefore the process is mostly operated at low pressures below 0 1 bar which can be obtained by gravity less than 1 m of water head the flux stabilization in the gdm process is related to the formation of a biofouling layer a range of visualization methods and analytical techniques has been applied to characterize the biofouling layer this has revealed that different types of organisms contribute to the formation of a heterogeneous fouling layer containing with a stable hydraulic resistance the available publications show a correlation between stable flux and water composition with lower stable fluxes reported for waters with a higher content of toc in addition the composition of the microbial community composition and the content of extracellular polymeric substances eps in the fouling layer have been reported to correlate to the stable flux value the presence of the biofouling layer was found to contribute to the improvement of the water quality improving the removal of a range of compounds including humic acids biopolymers aoc and algal toxins the presence of specific types of predators was reported to result in an increase in fouling layer heterogeneity and a higher permeability thus process and membrane module configurations which allowed the proliferation of higher organisms predators lead to an increased productivity after standstill periods a flux recovery was reported by several authors this feature can be used to optimize productivity in decentralized operation which are characterized by a varying water demand in comparison to conventional uf the costs of the gdm process show a stronger correlation with treatment capacity therefore the gdm process is typically more favorable than conventional uf at low capacities in remote settings and situations where the process operators and electricity is not always available the gdm process provides additional advantages in terms of process robustness declaration of interests the authors
