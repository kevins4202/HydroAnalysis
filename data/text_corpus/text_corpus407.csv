2035,agricultural soil is the domain where biogeochemical c n turnover is affected by atmospheric and hydrologic processes playing a vital role in anthropogenic greenhouse gas ghg emissions and thus affecting global climate change ghg cycling and emissions are further complicated by the characteristics of soil structure in particular macropores i e preferential flow pathway in this study the processes of non equilibrium gas diffusion and gas exchange were implemented into an existing dual permeability flow and reactive solute transport model the model was then used in a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the suitability of the modeling approach to account for development of anaerobic hotspots with an emphasis on assessing n2o production and emissions the sensitivity analysis combined with characteristic time scale analysis suggests that the development of anaerobic hotspots is controlled by a combination of both physical and geochemical parameters time scale analysis of o2 supply and consumption indicates that the occurrence of anaerobic hotspots is determined by the balance between characteristic times of o2 diffusion through the soil profile or exchange between macropores and the soil matrix and the characteristic time of o2 consumption motivated by these findings the present model was applied to simulate ghg cycling at a field site in ontario canada featuring macroporous agricultural soil the model generally reproduced observed spatiotemporal variations in pore gas o2 and ghg concentrations and fluxes simulation results suggest that at this site gas exchange processes between regions of preferential flow and the soil matrix play an important role in controlling the spatial variation of o2 in the soil the simulations illustrate how the release of ghgs from the soil matrix into the macropores can lead to ghg emissions to the atmosphere the modeling approach presented here including dual domain flow and solute transport as well as dual domain gas transport shows promise for future studies with the aim to develop a more complete understanding of how soil structure affects complex ghg cycling in agricultural soils keywords dual permeability reactive solute and gas transport model macroporous agricultural soils greenhouse gas ghg cycling and emissions non equilibrium gas transport and exchange anaerobic hotspots data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction greenhouse gas ghg emissions related to agricultural activities contribute substantially to global climate change johnson et al 2007 oertel et al 2016 in canada total ghg emissions continue to increase they reached 7 3 gigatons of co2 equivalent gt co2 eq in 2018 with the canadian agricultural sector contributing approximately 10 of total ghgs emitted eccc 2018 agricultural soils are a source of co2 and n2o van zandvoort et al 2017 and either a sink or a source for ch4 nangia et al 2013 the production or consumption of ghgs in soils depends heavily on hydrological factors e g precipitation evapotranspiration preferential and matrix flow moisture content and a range of biogeochemical parameters e g abundance of organic c nutrient availability mineralogy which together regulate and control the nature of ghg relevant microbial activity blagodatsky and smith 2012 although major progress has been made in recent years process based understanding and prediction of the dynamics of ghg cycling in agricultural soils is still developing in part due to complex interactions between transient hydrologic processes spatially and temporally distributed biogeochemical activity both affecting ghg fate and transport smith et al 2003 vereecken et al 2016 quick et al 2019 soil structure in agricultural soils has received much attention because it can significantly affect soil hydraulic characteristics chemical speciation and biomass availability thereby influencing ghg dynamics sullivan et al 2022 in particular soil macropores have enormous capacity to regulate the nature and degree of ghg reactions and transport laudone et al 2011 keiluweit et al 2016 pioneering work by bundt et al 2001 showed that macropores identified with dye were enriched in o2 and aerobic microbes indicating that macropores can provide a favorable environment for aerobic respiration further evidence has shown that macropores determined by x ray computed microtomography exhibited higher co2 production rates e g organic c oxidation rates compared to the soil matrix kravchenko et al 2015 however not only the presence of macropores but also interactions between macropores and the soil matrix may alter ghg dynamics keiluweit et al 2016 o2 supply via diffusion into the soil matrix is often slower than its consumption via microbial respiration leading to prevailing anaerobic conditions in the soil matrix hussain et al 2019 the presence of aerobic macropores adjacent to an anaerobic soil matrix impacts biogeochemical processes and ghg cycling sihi et al 2020 for example hotspots of denitrification have been linked to diffusion constraints and the development of local anaerobic conditions in the soil matrix arah and vinten 1995 despite the growing number of detailed field studies with spatially and temporally resolved data a comprehensive understanding of the inherent complexity of ghg dynamics under the influence of macropores remains a research challenge reactive transport models rtms have been used extensively to explore the coupling of hydrologic geochemical and biological processes that determine the formation operation and evolution of complex subsurface systems e g postma and appelo 2000 steefel et al 2015 li et al 2017 jacques et al 2018 maher and mayer 2019 to investigate how soil structure affects biogeochemical fluxes and concentrations three major modeling concepts have been developed including uniform models discrete macropore models and dual continuum models uniform models assume that the macropores and soil matrix can be represented by an equivalent porous medium with averaged upscaled hydraulic and biogeochemical parameters liu et al 2016 jia et al 2022 despite such simplifications this approach can yield representative results depending on the nature of soil structure and the scale of the modeling effort discrete macropore models represent a macroporous system more realistically as they explicitly consider individual macropores and mass exchange with the matrix sidborn and neretnieks 2004 hussain et al 2019 however applications of these models are more limited at large spatial and temporal scales because of limited information on the spatial distribution of macropores and tremendous computational cost gerke 2006 dual continuum models provide an alternative approach to differentiate between macropores and the soil matrix on a larger scale with lower computational cost šimůnek and van genuchten 2008 köhne et al 2009 during the last decades dual continuum approaches have evolved seeing increased usage in ghg studies orozco lópez et al 2018 examination of the literature indicates that models with a mechanistic description of complex biogeochemical c n cycling have been developed li et al 2017 however the majority of these models neglect the process based description of non equilibrium gas transport and controlling factors e g water saturation stolk et al 2011 blagodatsky and smith 2012 tremosa et al 2020 for example stolk et al 2011 proposed a dual domain model to assess how the exchange of dissolved n species between macropores and the matrix influence the spatiotemporal dynamics of dissolved n2o while simplifying gas exchange the lack of such capabilities limits the applicability of dual continuum models for the simulation of o2 ingress the evolution of redox conditions in space and time and ghg cycling in macroporous soils as a result additional development of dual continuum approaches including non equilibrium gas transport and reaction processes is warranted the overarching objective of this study is the development and evaluation of an enhanced dual permeability flow and reactive transport model that includes gas transport and exchange between the macropores and the soil matrix with the aim to simulate ghg cycling in macroporous agricultural soils specific objectives of this study include i extension of an existing dual permeability model to include non equilibrium gas diffusion and gas exchange processes ii to evaluate the suitability of the modeling approach to simulate reactive solute and gas transport in macroporous soils with an emphasis on characterizing conditions controlling the development of anaerobic hotspots iii to evaluate the spatiotemporal dynamics of soil moisture o2 and ghg concentrations and controlling processes within a macroporous agricultural soil constrained by field observations and iv to provide a preliminary assessment of the importance of gas exchange processes between the macropores and the soil matrix on ghg emissions and net global warming potential gwp 2 model development 2 1 mathematical formulation in the dual permeability modeling concept the macropores and soil matrix are represented explicitly in the model water solute and gas transfer between the macropores and the soil matrix are also represented explicitly fig 1 variably saturated flow in both subdomains of dual domain media is described using richards equation with the assumption of incompressible fluid no hysteresis and a passive air phase richards 1931 mayer et al 2002 the flow equations for the subdomains are coupled by means of an exchange term to account for the transfer of water between the two co existing continua gerke and van genuchten 1993 the saturations and the relative permeabilities are a function of the aqueous phase pressure based on the relationships given by wösten and van genuchten 1988 the present model allows for transient flow conditions which leads to changes in phase saturations in the dual domain medium detailed information on the dual permeability flow equations can be found in the supporting information si section s1 for this study a dual permeability reactive transport model developed by javadi 2019 has been modified to account for non equilibrium gas transport and gas exchange processes in between the subdomains the present dual permeability mass balance equations for chemical component j present in the aqueous and gaseous phases written in terms of total component concentrations take the form 1 t

stoichiometric coefficient relating component j to gases l n g is the number of gaseous species and c l g is the concentration of gaseous species mol l 1 gas and is given by 6 c l g p l rt 7 p l k l g

millington 1959 the millington model for tortuosity correction was chosen for this study since i it is commonly used and accounts for the effects of both porosity and saturation which reflect the impacts of soil texture this tortuosity correction has proven useful for calculating effective diffusivity in agricultural soils e g hussain et al 2019 herbst et al 2008 and ii the millington model is able to capture the available data for gas concentrations and fluxes reasonably well indicating that the gas diffusion parameters and formulation used in the model including tortuosity correction after millington are adequate representations of the soil system nevertheless it must be acknowledged that uncertainties regarding the representativeness of the millington model for tortuosity correction increases the potential for model non uniqueness 2 2 numerical implementation and code verification the formulation presented in section 2 1 has been implemented in a modular fashion into an existing dual permeability version javadi 2019 of the reactive solute and gas transport code min3p mayer et al 2002 an overview on the numerical implementation strategies for the min3p code can be found in mayer and macquarrie 2010 to ensure correct implementation of the governing equations the code was verified against results obtained with the established hydrus 1d code šimůnek et al 2003 šimůnek and van genuchten 2008 the dual permeability flow and reactive solute transport code has been successfully verified javadi 2019 although hydrus 1d does not include a formulation for dual permeability gas transport and exchange processes šimůnek and van genuchten 2008 it can be used to verify the new implementation in min3p since the formulation for non equilibrium gas diffusion and gas exchange is mathematically equivalent to non equilibrium solute diffusion and solute exchange information on the solution domain and model parametrization for the min3p and hydrus 1d intercomparison simulations can be found in the si section s2 the results obtained with min3p and hydrus 1d are in good agreement for gas concentrations along the soil profile at selected depths see figure s1 in the si although simple in nature this code verification effectively tests the main features and capabilities of the implementation for gas transport and exchange in the dual permeability media 3 methods in this section we first describe the strategies used to investigate physical and geochemical parameters controlling the formation of anaerobic hotspots including a characteristic time scale analysis and a sensitivity analysis section 3 1 in this context we then describe the present model to simulate ghg cycling and emissions at a field site in ontario canada featuring macroporous agricultural soil section 3 2 3 1 modeling evaluation of the development of anaerobic conditions 3 1 1 characteristic time scale analysis one of the major considerations when modeling dual permeability reactive transport and exchange are the time scales characterizing the various transport and reaction processes one of the primary time scales of interest here is the time scale characteristic for the advancement of atmospheric o2 through the macropores and the soil matrix as well as o2 exchange between the two domains in order to facilitate a comparison of characteristic time scales it is useful to provide a definition of the time scales for transport exchange and reactions the characteristic time for gas diffusion in the macropores and soil matrix are given by 8 t t p l d p 2 d p g 9 t t m l d m 2 d m g where l d p and l d m are the diffusion lengths of interest in the two domains m respectively geochemical reactions in soil systems commonly include both homogeneous reactions which take place in a single phase and heterogeneous reactions which involve mass exchange between two phases thus the reaction time scales are defined separately for homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions 10 t t r 1 k k a t j m a t j m a k k a 11 t t r 1 k k m 1 s m a ϕ m t j m a s m a ϕ m t j m a k k m where k k a is the rate constant for a homogeneous reaction mol l 1 h2o s 1 and k k m is the rate constant for a heterogeneous reaction mol dm 3 porous medium s 1 due to the diverse nature of geochemical rate expressions we assume that relevant reactions are zero order and the stoichiometric coefficient of the component j is unity in reaction k note that the reaction time scales presented here are defined for the soil matrix although corresponding reaction time scales exist for the macropores as well finally a characteristic time scale for gas exchange between the macropores and soil matrix is proposed as 12 t t e x α e 2 d ex g the relationships between the time scales of physical transport and geochemical reactions can be further considered in the context of damköhler numbers damköhler and einfliisse der stromung 1936 bahr and rubin 1987 therefore we define a dimensionless number r t p r that relates the characteristic time scale of macropore gas diffusion to the rate of reaction 13 r t p r t t p t t r a second dimensionless number r t m r relates the characteristic time scale of matrix gas diffusion to reaction and is defined as 14 r t m r t t m t t r the two dimensionless numbers are in principle equivalent to damköhler s da ii comparing the characteristic time of diffusion to that of reaction however they are defined separately for the matrix and the macropores in addition a third dimensionless number r t e x r is defined relating the characteristic time scale of gas exchange to reaction 15 r t e x r t t e x t t r 3 1 2 conceptual model model set up and parameterization subsequently our model was used to characterize physical and geochemical factors controlling the development of anaerobic hotspots fig 1 the conceptual model considers atmospheric o2 penetrating into the macropores and the soil matrix potentially exchanging between the macropores and the soil matrix as well as o2 consumption in the soil matrix the model domain extends to a depth of 2 0 m represented by a 1 d vertical column discretized into 202 control volumes all simulations were performed for a time period of 180 days the model domain represents a clay loam matrix with macropores connected from surface to bottom which is representative for common macroporous agricultural soils in temperate climates hussain et al 2019 weng 2021 the saturated hydraulic conductivities were set to 5 0 10 1 m s 1 and 3 4 10 6 m s 1 representative for the macropore subdomain and a clay loam soil matrix respectively soil hydraulic function parameters were derived from the literature weng 2021 for the macropores residual saturation was set as 0 01 and the van genuchten soil hydraulic function parameters were set to α 5 64 m 1 n 2 49 and l 0 5 for the soil matrix residual water content was set as 0 08 and the van genuchten soil hydraulic function parameters were set to α 1 58 m 1 n 1 41 and l 0 5 notice that the matrix residual saturations were varied as part of the sensitivity analysis to account for a range of possible scenarios table 3 the longitudinal dispersivity was estimated as 0 1 m the free phase diffusion coefficients for aqueous and gas phases were assigned as 2 4 10 9 m2 s 1 and 2 1 10 5 m2 s 1 respectively mayer et al 2002 soil porosities were set at 0 9 and 0 4 for the macropores and soil matrix respectively for the solute gas exchange term β was set to 3 0 α e was set as 0 01 m and ω was set as 0 05 these parameters were constrained based on a complementary modeling study at the same field site weng 2021 the soil temperature was set to 25 c the simulations include 13 primary components h na ca2 co3 2 o2 aq n2 aq doc nh4 no3 no2 n2o aq ch4 aq and an immobile component representing solid phase organic carbon soc 13 secondary species h2 aq ch3cooh oh nh3 aq cach3coo ca ch3coo 2 caoh cahco3 caco3 aq naco3 nahco3 aq hco3 h2co3 aq and five gases o2 g co2 g n2o g n2 g and ch4 g aqueous speciation amongst these components is computed based on hydrolysis and complexation reactions defined in the model database which is derived from the wateq4f ball and nordstrom 1991 and minteqa2 allison et al 1991 databases equilibrium partitioning of o2 n2 and ghgs between the gas phase and the water phase was assumed all thermodynamic data for aqueous components aqueous complexes and equilibrium gas partitioning are provided in the si section s3 tables s1 s3 the biogeochemical model was developed based on the conceptual model for ghg cycling described in previous work jia et al 2022 with the goal to account for the main processes affecting ghg production and consumption also considered were calcite dissolution precipitation and ion exchange involving nh4 x na x and ca x2 additional details regarding the reaction network can be found in jia et al 2022 biogeochemical processes involving c and n reactions 1 9 table 1 were described as kinetically controlled irreversible reactions limited by the availability of substrate terminal electron acceptors and inhibitors described by michaelis menten rate expressions relevant kinetic parameters were based on previous modeling studies tables 1 and s6 however select model parameters were adjusted since the uniform model used by jia et al 2022 required the use of upscaled or averaged parameters that allowed anaerobic reactions to progress e g denitrification and methanogenesis in the presence of o2 in the current model reactions were only allowed to proceed if redox conditions were suitable providing a more process based method than the approach used by jia et al 2022 calcite dissolution and precipitation reaction 10 table 1 was modeled as a quasi equilibrium reversible reaction following previous work mayer et al 2012 an ion exchange model including the exchange between ca2 na and nh4 reactions 11 and 12 table 1 was employed based on the gaines thomas convention mayer et al 2002 all parameters for mineral dissolution precipitation reactions and ion exchange are provided in the si tables s4 s5 the initial moisture conditions for each case were established using a constant water flux of 6 93 10 9 m s 1 representing a typical average annual infiltration or recharge rate for climate in the region hussain et al 2019 applied to the upper surface of both the macropores 55 of the infiltration or recharge and matrix 45 of the infiltration or recharge until steady state flow conditions were achieved under steady state conditions interdependencies between gas transport exchange between matrix and macropores and reaction processes and their effect on the development of anaerobic conditions can be effectively illustrated whereas inclusion of transient flow conditions reveals additional effects of changes in water flux and water content on the development of anaerobic conditions in this context it is beneficial to conduct the sensitivity analysis under a steady state assumption first a constant head first type boundary condition was assigned at the base of the domain with a value of 1 0 m which corresponds to a water table located at 3 0 m below ground surface mbgs rainwater chemistry and initial pore water chemistry are provided in the si tables s9 and s10 for transport a mixed boundary condition was applied at the surface boundary while a free exit boundary condition solute leaves by advection only was applied at the bottom boundary the mixed type boundary condition is a third type boundary condition for all aqueous components specified flux in the case of infiltration however influx and outflux of gases are also allowed through diffusion in the gas phase this is achieved by extending the grid by an additional cell or a ghost cell into an atmospheric boundary layer where gas composition is assumed fixed at atmospheric levels 3 1 3 sensitivity analysis in this study a sensitivity analysis combined with a characteristic time scale analysis has been used to investigate controlling parameters for the formation of anaerobic hotspots and n2o production from parameters relating to the pore gas o2 mass balance we identified four physical and geochemical factors in the conceptual model that could reasonably be varied in a sensitivity analysis to determine a range of possible scenarios including matrix diffusion path length l d m the radius of a matrix aggregate α e matrix gas saturations s m g and the matrix o2 consumption rate constant represented by soc decomposition k s o c a mass balance analysis conducted with different o2 uptake reactions showed soc decomposition contributes most significantly to o2 uptake in our system data not shown as described in table 2 these simulations examined how gas diffusion length variations c1 to c8 gas exchange length variations c9 to c17 matrix gas saturation variations c18 to c26 and o2 consumption rate constants c27 to c35 affected the formation of anaerobic hotspots in the dual domain porous media 3 2 field site application in addition to the sensitivity and time scale analysis simulations were performed for a field experiment at an agricultural watershed in ontario canada covering the 2018 agronomic season may october sunohara et al 2015 blume et al 2022 the data set includes soil water contents soil temperature concentrations of o2 and ghgs in pore gas and ghg surface fluxes blume et al 2022 our previous modeling study indicates that at this site a uniform model was successful in reproducing long term trends in observed concentration and flux data however the model was not able to explicitly represent the characteristics of the macropores and soil matrix respectively jia et al 2022 motivated by these findings we used and evaluated the dual permeability reactive transport model developed in this work to simulate ghg uptake and emissions at the site fig 1 it should be noted that soil macropores in our model represent worm burrows generated by lumbricus terrestris soil desiccation cracks and abandoned root channels dziejowski et al 1997 hussain et al 2019 the matrix represents the majority of the soil including relatively permeable materials as well as low permeability microsites embedded within the more permeable soil matrix in addition the spatial variability in soil reactivity affecting rates of c and n cycling was considered by upscaled parameters for both preferential flow and matrix subdomains using this approach it is not possible to consider anoxic microsites or hot spots of reactivity explicitly the following description provides a summary of the site features model set up and parameterization 3 2 1 site description the study site is situated in an experimental watershed under primarily agricultural activity e g dairy related corn forage crop rotations and corn soybean cash crop rotations the crop field examined was under soybean production in 2018 and was in corn production the previous season the soils examined are of the bainsville soil series which consists of a succession of sandy and silty clay loams overlying silty to heavy clays schut and wilson 1987 with macropore features e g root and worm burrows extending to a depth of 1 0 m weng 2021 this site has a humid continental climate with large seasonal temperature differences the 30 yr mean total precipitation is about 540 mm and the 30 yr mean air temperature is around 15 8 c throughout the agronomic season may october 1981 2010 government of canada 2019 sampling was performed during a relatively dry growing season in 2018 in which the mean total seasonal precipitation was around 238 mm and the mean air temperature was 17 1 c blume et al 2022 soil water samples were collected weekly at 10 30 and 90 cm depths measurements of the soil atmosphere exchange of ghgs were carried out using soil gas chambers i e static chambers for co2 ch4 and n2o and a li cor instrument for co2 and subsurface pore gas samples at 10 30 and 90 cm depths subsurface gas concentrations were measured from stainless steel rods od 0 25 id 0 125 two slots were fitted on either side of the bottom 1 of each rod staggered ca 1 4 to 1 2 apart with respect to length axis of the rod all rods were open at the bottom with no screen a small soil cavity roughly 0 5 in length was left below the rod bottom to ensure the intake was not plugged with soil the intake portion of the rods were set at sampling depths of 10 30 and 90 cm note that the rods were installed with as much care as possible to reduce disturbance of the surrounding porous media gas samples were collected from each rod using 30 60 ml syringes equipped with luer lock fittings and placed into 12 ml exetainer vials the gas samples were analyzed on a sri instruments 8610c gas chromatograph a comprehensive description of field sampling methods can be found in blume et al 2022 3 2 2 model set up and parameterization the model domain extends to a depth of 1 m represented by a 1 d vertical column discretized into 200 control volumes yielding a discretization interval of 0 01 m for the interior control volumes and 0 005 m for the control volumes on the boundary the simulation was performed for a time period of 135 days i e agronomic season in 2018 the model domain consisted of a macroporous subdomain and a soil matrix subdomain the soil matrix subdomain is divided into five physical and chemical zones including the ap horizon bg horizons bg1 and bg2 a low permeability layer situated between the bg1 and bg2 horizon depositional layer likely of glacial origin and the cg horizon which is effectively a varied clay deposit homogeneous hydraulic parameters were assumed for the macropore subdomain for model simplification purposes macropore hydraulic properties table 3 were derived from weng 2021 macropores are highly permeable with low water retention capacity facilitating gravity flow soil hydraulic parameters for the soil matrix were estimated using the rosetta model schaap et al 2001 based on the particle size distribution of the soil matrix and measured bulk density in addition soil hydraulic parameters for the macropore matrix interface were based on the sensitivity analysis simulations the transport parameters considered a free phase diffusion coefficient of 2 4 10 9 m2 s 1 for all dissolved species while a longitudinal dispersivity of 0 1 m was used mayer et al 2002 in the gaseous phase a free phase diffusion coefficient of 2 1 10 5 m2 s 1 was considered for all gases for the biogeochemical model relevant chemical components equilibrium and kinetic reaction network and reaction expressions are consistent with the sensitivity analysis all thermodynamic and kinetic parameters are summarized in the table 1 si tables s6 s7 the initial moisture contents were established using an average annual infiltration or recharge rate for steady state flow conditions as described in section 3 1 2 given the initial condition for water content transient boundary conditions were assigned at the top of both the macropore and matrix subdomains accounting for the occurrence of precipitation and evapotranspiration during the agronomic season daily rainfall rates were derived from observed data over the agronomic season may 29 2018 oct 10 2018 from a local meteorological station blume et al 2022 evapotranspiration et was calculated in a simplified fashion jia et al 2022 and was assumed to occur over the entire surface of both the macropores 55 of et and matrix 70 of et a constant head first type boundary condition was assigned at the bottom of the domain 1 0 m depth to create hydraulic conditions consistent with water table depths at the site rainwater chemistry and initial pore water chemistry are provided in the si tables s9 and s10 for transport a mixed boundary condition was applied at the surface boundary as described above while a free exit boundary condition solute leaves by advection only was applied at the bottom boundary porosities permeabilities and free diffusion coefficients were either based on literature data or specified based on measured data see tables 3 and s11 parameters such as reaction rate constants were based on ranges reported in the literature tables 1 and s6 although literature data on rates vary widely additional constraints were used during model calibration for example the rate constants of soc decomposition and doc oxidation are typically greater than the corresponding values for anaerobic reactions e g denitrification and methanogenesis data on water solute and gas exchange parameters are limited or non existent these parameters were constrained by the range of literature data whenever available or calibrated to reproduce observed ghg fluxes and pore gas concentrations 3 3 assumptions and simplifications several assumptions and simplifications had to be made when building the conceptual and numerical models although parameters may vary spatially due to variations in structural geometry and transport properties for the macropore matrix interface e g sullivan et al 2022 information regarding the spatial variability of these properties was not available for this site evapotranspiration was assumed to occur over the entire surface without explicit consideration of root water and solute uptake processes as a function of soil depth for simplicity and because root distributions and growth dynamics are difficult to quantify in addition the present model was based on a simplified representation of biogeochemical c and n cycling the decomposition of soc was assumed to lead to the release of dissolved organic carbon doc only represented here by acetate however the release of nitrogen from dissolved organic matter was not explicitly considered this simplified approach is consistent with previous modeling studies arora et al 2016 in addition although it is well known that a range of microbial processes contribute to denitrification nitrification nitrifier denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra e g butterbach bahl et al 2013 only denitrification was considered here finally microbial consortia were assumed present in sufficient abundance to catalyze the necessary reactions for ghg production and consumption throughout the domain although substantial simplifications had to be made this approach was useful for evaluation of the capabilities and limitations of our dual permeability reactive gas and solute transport model for investigation of ghg cycling emissions and uptake in a field setting 4 results 4 1 evaluation of individual physical and geochemical parameters controlling the development of anaerobic hotspots as a first step we used our dual permeability reactive transport model with an emphasis on delineating the development of anaerobic hotspots and identifying different parameter settings in the context of ghg cycling for each scenario model sensitivity in response to variations of individual parameters fig 2 a was further evaluated by means of the difference in characteristic time scales fig 2b 2e show how variations of individual parameters and characteristic times affect simulated o2 availability and determine the existence and extent of anaerobic conditions 0 005 o2 v v from a physical transport perspective an increase in matrix diffusion path length l d m and the corresponding characteristic diffusion time t t m limits o2 ingress for l d m 1 0 m threshold value the development of anaerobic conditions occurred fig 2b increasing the radius of matrix aggregates α e results in increasing characteristic exchange time t t e x and thus less o2 transfer from the macropores to the matrix for α e 0 5 m threshold value anaerobic conditions developed below 1 m depth fig 2c in addition decreasing matrix gas saturation s m g results in an increase in the characteristic times for matrix diffusion and exchange between the subdomains t t m and t t e x thus less o2 transfer into the matrix for s m g 0 5 threshold value anaerobic conditions were limited below 1 m depth fig 2d from a chemical perspective fig 2e shows that an increase in the rate constant for soc decomposition k s o c leads to a decrease of the characteristic time for o2 consumption in the matrix t t r thus limiting o2 ingress with decreased k s o c anaerobic conditions are restricted to a depth below approximately 1 m with a threshold value of 4 0 10 9 mol l 1 bulk s 1 note also that these threshold values would change if the other parameters changed as a result the sensitivity analysis combined with characteristic time scale analysis provides a basis for how individual physical and geochemical factors control the formation of anaerobic conditions in the soil matrix although individual factors can provide a more direct cause effect interpretation individual factors are poor predictors of the biogeochemical hotspots in soil due to complexities associated with among other things process interactions gu et al 2007 heiss et al 2017 to create a more integrated interpretation not limited to individual factors the dimensionless numbers i e r t p r r t m r and r t e x r introduced above are useful to assess parameter combinations in this context further inspection of the sensitivity analysis results reveals six plausible conceptual scenarios for the development of anaerobic conditions in terms of r t p r r t m r and r t e x r table 4 for scenarios s1 s2 they represent conditions under which o2 supplied by diffusion through the macropores and exchange into the soil matrix or diffusion directly through the soil matrix was depleted by o2 consumption in the matrix anaerobic conditions developed in the macropores and soil matrix or bulk soil it should be noted that for scenarios s3 s6 o2 exchange becomes a major constraint affecting o2 availability i e longer characteristic time for gas exchange these scenarios provide a more realistic but frequently overlooked representation for conditions under which o2 supplied by exchange between the macropores and soil matrix is depleted by o2 consumption in the matrix in nature even within aerated soils anoxic conditions are often observed within aggregates or any exchange controlled environment e g keiluweit et al 2017 however it is not possible to determine which conceptual scenarios are most representative of a particular macroporous soil system without having supporting field information to assist in making such decisions nevertheless through these simulations we have obtained a base for assessing conditions under which anaerobic hotspots can develop in macroporous agricultural soils 4 2 application of the dual permeability reactive transport model for simulation of ghg cycling in macroporous agricultural soils in this section our model is used to investigate ghg cycling in macroporous agricultural soils constrained by field observations results from the sensitivity analysis indicate that there are various scenarios under which anaerobic hotspots can develop affecting ghg production and consumption providing justification for considering characteristic time scales when performing field site simulations 4 2 1 soil moisture dynamics fig 3 shows observed and simulated moisture contents at selected depths 15 30 45 and 90 cm throughout the agronomic season although the sampling procedure applied to measure moisture contents did not allow distinguishing between the contributions from the macropores and soil matrix measured bulk moisture contents adequately represent matrix moisture contents since soil volume occupied by the matrix dominates the control volume coppola et al 2012 given that the ratio of the macropore volume to bulk volume was relatively small i e 0 05 v v significant differences between the matrix moisture contents and bulk moisture contents are not expected in this context we assumed that observed moisture contents represent the matrix moisture contents consistent with field observations simulated matrix moisture contents increased with depth fig 3 with maximum moisture contents occurring near the low permeability layer fig 3c closer inspection of water saturations between the macropores and soil matrix in fig 3 indicates hotspots of matrix water saturation 0 9 v v occurred above the low permeability layer whereas the macropore water saturations remained very low i e below 0 01 v v this highlights that the presence of macropores can facilitate gas transport across the soil horizons simulated moisture contents or water saturations in macropores and the soil matrix exhibited short term temporal variations i e hot moments in response to strong rainfall events which is consistent with previous studies e g dwivedi et al 2017 and with bulk soil observations at this site 4 2 2 pore gas o2 and ghg dynamics observed and simulated variations of pore gas o2 and ghg concentrations at various soil depths 10 30 and 90 cm throughout the agronomic season are presented in fig 4 in this study it is assumed that measured pore gas concentrations are representative of pore gas composition in the macropores since soil gas is most mobile in the macropores this assumption is supported by previous experimental e g dziejowski et al 1997 and modeling e g kristensen et al 2010 studies fig 4 shows that simulated pore gas o2 concentrations in the macropore domain remained near 0 21 v v i e at close to atmospheric levels whereas the matrix o2 concentrations decreased with depth with a minimum value 0 05 v v appearing at 90 cm depth indicating that anaerobic conditions may develop in the deeper soil matrix this spatial pattern can be explained by abundant o2 supply into the upper region of the matrix from the macropores or directly into the matrix from the ground surface exceeding rates of o2 consumption however the simulations indicate that in the deeper matrix o2 consumption exceeded o2 supply the effect of anaerobic conditions on ghg production e g n2o is complex and thus ensuring matrix anaerobic volume could provide an interpretative view of ghg dynamics processes that is not readily available from field collected data grosz et al 2021 we have estimated the average matrix anaerobic volume over the growing season from the simulation results for our upscaled modeling approach we assume that the anaerobic soil volume can be estimated based on the fraction of the simulation domain with modeled pore gas o2 concentrations at or below a threshold value of 0 05 v v burgin and groffman 2012 fig 4 indicates that this threshold is reached on average over the growing season at a depth below 90 cm yielding an anaerobic soil volume of approximately 0 095 m3 0 1 m 1 m2 0 95 matrix fraction based on this estimate 9 5 of the simulated soil column can be considered anaerobic in this context it must be emphasized that the fraction would change with a different threshold value for o2 in addition anoxic microsites in the upper soil as well as aerated fractions of the lower soils are not explicitly accounted for using the upscaled dual permeability approach this estimate is highly empirical in nature but it serves to highlight the difficulties with quantifying this important measure fig 4 also suggests that the distribution patterns of pore gas o2 and co2 are highly negatively correlated co2 concentrations in the macropores were consistently low but the matrix co2 concentrations significantly increased with depth with a maximum value 0 10 v v appearing at 90 cm depth concentrations of co2 are highest in near anaerobic regions of the deeper soil matrix which can be explained by the limited solubility of co2 fig 5 suggests that simulated pore gas n2o concentrations were generally higher in the soil matrix compared to the macropores in the soil matrix pore gas n2o concentration exhibited a gradual increase with depth with the maximum values appearing at 90 cm depth maximum n2o concentrations coincide with anaerobic conditions indicating that limited o2 availability facilitates denitrification i e n2o production in the matrix this behavior characteristic of n2o production in microporous soils can be well captured by the present model previous modeling efforts with a uniform model failed to distinguish such production among macropores and soil matrix jia et al 2022 in addition spatial variations in pore gas ch4 can be seen between the macropores and soil matrix fig 5 pore gas ch4 concentration was consistently lower in the macropores than in the matrix higher concentrations were likely correlated with lower redox potential and ch4 production in the soil matrix whereas lower concentrations in the macropores can be explained by ch4 oxidation temporal variations of pore gas o2 and ghg concentrations are shown in figs 4 and 5 simulated matrix o2 and ghg concentrations showed strong short term temporal variations in response to major rainfall events in the summer season whereas concentrations in the macropores were relatively invariant during the agronomic season in accordance with pore gas concentrations the present model generally captures average long term ghg emissions co2 and n2o and uptake ch4 over the agronomic season fig 6 temporal variations in denitrification rates r9 indicate that denitrification did not occur in the macropores see also si fig s2 but occurred in the matrix observed short term n2o peak fluxes could not be captured adequately by the present model fig 6 in this context it must be acknowledged that simulated dynamics of pore gas n2o concentrations in preferential flow and matrix subdomains are not supported by field observations fig 5 which do not show substantial variations over time and are not well correlated to n2o emissions these results indicate that n2o production and consumption dynamics and their spatial distribution as simulated may not be reflective of field conditions comparing modeling results with field observations figs 5 and 6 further suggests that short lived elevated n2o emissions in response to precipitation events are dominated by production in the shallow soil 5 discussion in general the ability of our dual permeability reactive transport model to reproduce real world conditions can be attributed to the model formulation which represents reactive transport and exchange occurring in two co existing continua the present model implicitly includes i diffusion limited gas transport in both subdomains i e macropores and soil matrix and ii gas exchange between the two co existing continua which distinguishes it from most existing dual domain models in a macroporous agricultural soil anaerobic conditions tend to develop locally in generally well aerated soils which conceptually can be captured with the current formulation 5 1 reactive gas exchange control development of anaerobic conditions results from the field simulations show strong spatial variations in pore gas o2 concentrations based on the results of the sensitivity analysis the dimensionless numbers r t p r r t m r and r t e x r were used to provide insights into the development of anaerobic conditions at this site which is consistent with previous studies e g zarnetske et al 2012 briggs et al 2015 fig 7 a illustrates significant spatiotemporal variations in r t p r r t m r and r t e x r between the upper matrix and deeper matrix during the agronomic season in the upper matrix r t e x r 1 produced minimum values followed by r t p r 1 and r t m r 1 suggesting that o2 supply from gas diffusion through the macropores and gas phase o2 exchange between macropores and the soil matrix was greater than o2 consumption thus leading to aerobic conditions in the upper soil matrix in the deeper matrix r t p r 1 produced minimum values followed by r t e x r 1 and r t m r 1 which indicates that o2 supply from gas diffusion through the soil matrix and gas phase o2 exchange between the pore subdomains was slower than o2 consumption thus forming anaerobic conditions in the deeper matrix consistent with the conceptual scenario s5 table 4 further inspection of r t p r r t m r and r t e x r shows that at this site the extent of anaerobic conditions is mainly a function of r t e x r this observation suggests that at this site soil gas exchange processes between macropores and matrix caused by soil heterogeneity have a strong influence on the fate and transport of pore gas o2 and the development of anaerobic conditions previous experimental and modeling studies have demonstrated the role pore gas o2 transport limitation plays in creating anaerobic hotspots e g sexstone et al 1985 keiluweit et al 2016 2017 rohe et al 2021 for example keiluweit et al 2017 reported that transport of pore gas o2 through the soil matrix is controlled by diffusion and exchange when o2 supply i e diffusion and or exchange in the soil matrix is slower than its biological demand e g respiration o2 becomes depleted and anaerobic conditions develop in the soil matrix rohe et al 2021 also reported that anaerobic microsites can develop through limited o2 exchange between the macropores and soil matrix even though bulk measurements indicated that soils were well aerated to provide a more nuanced view of the relationship between the time scales of gas exchange between the subdomains and the time scale of reaction fig 7b shows variations in characteristic time scales of gas phase o2 exchange t t e x versus characteristic time scales of o2 consumption t t r overall characteristic time of gas phase exchange varied significantly ca 5 10 4 to 5 10 1 days compared to characteristic times of o2 consumption ca 5 10 3 to 5 10 2 day longer characteristic times of gas phase exchange t t e x were found in the deeper matrix as a result of lower matrix gas saturations the longest t t e x occurred in the low permeability layer with the lowest matrix gas saturation on the other hand longest characteristic times of o2 consumption t t r occurred in the deeper matrix due to lower rate constants of soc decomposition as a result limited o2 exchange between macropores and matrix is primarily responsible for the development of anaerobic conditions at this field site 5 2 development of anaerobic conditions controls c n dynamics our simulation results suggest that pore gas n2o concentrations differ between the macropores and the soil matrix the spatial pattern was strongly linked to denitrification occurring under conditions of lowered o2 which in our simulations occurred predominately near the base of the soil profile and in the matrix spatial variations in n2o production rates r4 indicate that the n2o production rate increased with depth fig 8 a whereas n2o production rates were relatively low throughout the macropores fig s2 in this context it must be emphasized that the current model formulation allows for denitrification in the presence of oxygen above typically accepted levels although at much reduced rates this upscaled formulation accounts for subgrid variability of redox conditions in both the matrix and preferential flow domains reflecting the presence of anoxic microsites in the soil matrix and to a lesser degree in preferential flow regions the increase in denitrification rates with depth and lower average o2 concentrations reflects the assumption that the fraction of anoxia in a soil volume increases with declining average o2 concentrations fig s3 illustrates that no3 concentrations significantly increased with time in the upper matrix 30 cm depth due to nitrification in the deeper matrix 90 cm depth however no3 concentrations remained at quasi steady state it suggests that no3 is partially reduced to no2 n2o and n2 r3 r4 and r5 while at the same time no3 produced via nitrification r1 and r2 in the upper of matrix is transported to the deeper matrix with the infiltrating water we identified a simplified dimensionless number f n defined as the ratio between nh4 and no3 concentrations shuai et al 2017 this approach allowed us to empirically evaluate whether the soil is a no3 source or sink the value of f n may affect n transformation in the soils and whether nitrification or denitrification dominates fig 8d shows that in the upper matrix conditions gradually changed from a system dominated by net nitrification f n 1 in the spring day 10 to net denitrification f n 1 in the fall day 114 whereas in the deeper soils net denitrification f n 1 persisted over the agronomic season in this system infiltration from precipitation experienced nitrification in the aerobic region of the upper soils consuming o2 and nh4 subsequently promoting denitrification under anaerobic conditions in the presence of increased no3 concentrations for deeper infiltration into anaerobic regions denitrification dominates leading to a decrease of no3 accompanied by an increase in n2o concentrations similarly spatial variations in n2o consumption rates r5 indicate higher rates in the anaerobic regions of the deeper matrix fig 8b which could be attributed to the presence of elevated n2o acting as an electron acceptor under anaerobic conditions simulated n2o consumption rates r5 were consistently lower than n2o production rates r4 allowing n2o produced to migrate towards the ground surface fig s4 in addition to enhanced denitrification in the deeper matrix the limited solubility of n2o and the presence of a water table near the base of the domain leads to elevated n2o concentrations near the base of the simulation domain considering that the dominant transport process is diffusion a continuous upward n2o gradient is required along the entire soil profile explaining why highest n2o concentrations are seen in the deeper matrix in addition denitrification can be assessed by its capacity to reduce n2o to n2 e g weier et al 1993 scheer et al 2020 as shown in the si fig s5 simulated n2o n2 n2o ratios gradually increase with depth with a maximum value at 90 cm bgs in the region where simulated n2o production was enhanced fig 8a our simulated ratios in the deeper matrix are slightly greater than in scheer et al 2020 global average value in agricultural soils 0 109 0 020 however simulated ratios in the upper soil matrix are significantly lower than observed in other studies e g stolk et al 2011 implying that the current model underestimates n2o production and or persistence in shallow soils this discrepancy in the upper soil matrix can likely be explained by the upscaled modeling approach and the o2 threshold used to define the transition to anoxia which considers shallow soils as mostly oxic providing limited opportunity for n2o production the model formulation yields most n2o production in the deeper soil matrix leading to underestimating n2o production in the shallow soil nevertheless the lack of observed n2 g data did not allow for using the n2o n2 n2o ratio to constrain the contribution of individual reactions e g n2o production or consumption in the current formulation finally the matrix has been shown to facilitate the diffusive release of pore gas n2o into the macropores fig 9 c the fluxes between the macropores and matrix increased with depth with a maximum value appearing at 90 cm depth this trend is typical for diffusion controlled n2o flux towards the macropores and n2o production in the deeper matrix correlating favorably with previous studies e g stolk et al 2011 the simulation results suggest considerable spatial variations in pore gas co2 between macropores and soil matrix leading to gas phase co2 diffusion into the macropores fig 9 further inspection of doc oxidation rates r6 shows that high rates occur in the upper matrix fig 8c which can be explained by elevated soc contents in the aerobic region data not shown in addition simulation results show that pore gas ch4 concentrations in the macropores were higher than in the soil matrix thus ch4 diffused laterally from the macropores to the soil matrix in particular in the upper soils fig 9 therefore ch4 oxidative processes are focused on the upper soils mostly removing ch4 imported from the atmosphere at low levels beyond the spatial distributions observation and simulation results show that total ghg emissions i e co2 and n2o varied over time with a significant n2o emission peak related to acute rainfall events i e hot moments which is consistent with experimental and modeling studies in various agricultural soils e g weitzman et al 2021 further inspection of pore gas ghg concentrations shows that matrix co2 and n2o concentration peaks generally occurred in response to acute rainfall events although simulated concentrations of these gases varied only slightly over the agronomic season in response to major rainfall events elevated moisture contents in the deeper matrix limited deeper matrix co2 and n2o fluxes leading to the accumulation of co2 and n2o concentrations in the deeper matrix concurrently elevated moisture contents in the deeper matrix resulted in anaerobic conditions and hot moments of n2o production and concentrations in the deeper matrix previous studies suggested that precipitation can trigger hot moments by modifying soil moisture and the redox environments e g groffman et al 2009 these results can be explained through the development of temporarily steep concentration gradients in the matrix giving rise to hot moments for co2 and n2o emissions across the ground surface and into the atmosphere nevertheless the model cannot provide a representative description of all n and c cycling processes with confidence at this time 5 3 system mass balance insights into the role of macroporous soils on ghg emissions and uptake to further investigate the relative contribution of macropores and soil matrix to total ghg emissions and uptake across the soil and atmosphere table 5 compares cumulative o2 and ghg fluxes from the macropores and soil matrix respectively our simulation results indicate that total o2 uptake was dominated by direct exchange of the soil matrix with the atmosphere i e 92 0 with relatively small contributions of the macropores i e 8 0 total co2 and n2o emissions and total ch4 uptake were dominated by direct exchange of the soil matrix with the atmosphere co2 90 8 n2o 88 4 ch4 75 7 with relatively small contributions of the macropores co2 9 2 n2o 11 6 ch4 24 3 correlating favorably with previous results e g mangalassery et al 2013 however the mass balance suggests that the contribution of the macropores to total ghg fluxes is generally higher than what would be expected based on simple volume considerations i e 5 further inspection of n2o shows that n2o emissions from the macropores originates from pore gas n2o transfer from the matrix into the macropores data not shown which is expected considering that there is little n2o produced in the well aerated macropores this highlights the importance of gas exchange processes between macropores and the soil matrix furthermore we can use a common metric known as net global warming potential gwp which is calculated as ipcc 2018 g w p c u m c o 2 c u m n 2 o 265 c u m c h 4 28 where cum x kg co2 eq ha 1 year 1 defines the cumulative amount of gas emission during the experiment for the gas in question based on the simulated cumulative ghg emissions we calculated net gwp for the macropores and soil matrix respectively although the contributions of the macropores to ghg emissions is relatively small the relative contribution of the macropores to global warming was not negligible because of its gwp 1 61 103 kg co2 eq ha 1 year 1 table 5 scaling macropore ghg emissions to the true footprint shows the significant contributions of macropore emissions to gwp 5 4 model suitability limitations and improvement in this study a dual permeability reactive solute and gas transport model was evaluated and used to simulate complex ghg cycling in macroporous agricultural soils the present simulation results generally reproduced observed long term temporal trends in surface ghg fluxes and spatial variations in moisture o2 and ghg concentrations the model also provided an opportunity to investigate ghg dynamics occurring in macroporous soils more deeply which is difficult to assess solely via field observations this analysis also revealed model limitations caused by the simplified description of the biogeochemical reaction network and the inability of the upscaled approach to effectively account for complex redox conditions in the soil profile and at the resolution of the model although simulated gas concentrations and surface fluxes show a relatively good fit to field data it must be acknowledged that the underlying model parametrization is not entirely representative of conditions in the field the current model is based on a simplified conceptualization without explicit consideration of soil organic nitrogen son dynamics and highly simplified n2o cyling and microbial dynamics observational data to constrain the model is scarce in particular when it comes to data specific to macropore and matrix subdomains leading to limited constraints on c n dynamics in the soil specifically related to the production and consumption of the various n and c species despite honoring the available constraints it must be acknowledged that the reaction network included in the model is unlikely representative of field conditions in addition most of the kinetic parameters including reaction rates as well as half saturation and inhibition constants were either assumed or calibrated adding an additional layer of uncertainty in addition the present model assumes that the soil matrix contains both relatively high permeability materials as well as disconnected anoxic microsites which are considered together in an upscaled fashion variations in reactivity are also homogenized within each subdomain in reality soil aggregates containing immobile water at high saturations may exist within the soil matrix e g šimůnek et al 2008 in this context the upscaled approach does not adequately account for contributions of anoxic microsites or sub regions of elevated reactivity to ghg dynamics for example denitrification in a well oxygenated soil matrix e g shallow soils has been attributed to anaerobic micro environments that may not be easily detected in bulk soil samples blagodatsky and smith 2012 in the current model this behavior is captured through an upscaled model parameterization which allows anaerobic processes such as denitrification to proceed if a defined o2 threshold is reached although this approach allows for simulation of n2o production and consumption processes it is not able to capture the spatial distribution of these processes in the soil profile the model predicts highest rates of n2o production near the base of the soil profile since bulk matrix o2 concentrations are the lowest in this region this is not consistent with common understanding of n2o production often occurring in the shallow soil environments future research could be directed towards a comprehensive comparison of different dual permeability conceptual models for simulation of ghg cycling in agricultural soils we believe that a model parameterization accounting for at least three co existing porosities may provide a better representation of agricultural macroporous soil especially if it comes to simulating n cycling the three porosities are i a porosity component representing macropores ii a porosity component associated with the relatively permeable and less reactive fractions of the soil matrix and iii low permeability or highly reactive microsites where anoxia prevails and where n2o production occurs throughout the soil profile despite these limitations the implementation of the conceptual model developed for macroporous agricultural soils using the dual permeability reactive gas and solute transport approach shows promise for the modeling of ghg cycling and emissions at field sites which provides a basis for future developments and refinements to yield more robust and better constrained modeling strategies 6 conclusions in this study we developed a dual permeability reactive solute and gas transport model that quantitatively evaluated the mechanisms of ghg production consumption transport exchange between macropores and matrix as well as emissions and uptake from a macroporous agricultural soil the present model focused on identifying possible scenarios under which anaerobic conditions develop initially not representing any particular field setting the model response on parameter variations has shown that characteristic diffusion lengths characteristic exchange length between matrix and macropores matrix gas saturation and the rate of o2 consumption are of high importance for controlling the development of anaerobic conditions from a perspective of characteristic time scales the development of anaerobic conditions can be determined by the ratio of the characteristic time of gas phase diffusion exchange between macropores and the soil matrix to characteristic times of o2 consumption in comparison to field observations the present model generally captures average long term behavior in moisture contents gas concentrations and fluxes observed in macroporous agricultural soils the model simulations were also useful for aiding with a process based interpretation of the spatial distribution between the macropores and matrix controlled by gas exchange processes while the average greenhouse gas emission rates co2 and n2o and uptake rates ch4 were captured well by the model over a growing season constrained by measured ghg fluxes the spatial distribution of ghg production and consumption rates with depth as well the individual contributing reactions could not be resolved with confidence at this time in addition the model was not able to capture the short term variability of fluxes specifically for n2o in response to acute precipitation events i e hot moments most likely due to the simplification of the denitrification model in the conceptual model and the lack of considering disconnected soil aggregates that contain pore water at high saturations throughout the simulation domain including the shallow organic horizon overall this study provides support for the use of dual permeability modeling approaches that account for gas transport to improve our understanding of how soil structure characteristics affect complex ghg cycling in agricultural soils however further work is required for a more process based and realistic representation of c and n cycling and the effect of local scale heterogeneities on redox conditions from a modeling perspective progress could be made by considering a multi domain modeling approach for simulating of ghg

2035,agricultural soil is the domain where biogeochemical c n turnover is affected by atmospheric and hydrologic processes playing a vital role in anthropogenic greenhouse gas ghg emissions and thus affecting global climate change ghg cycling and emissions are further complicated by the characteristics of soil structure in particular macropores i e preferential flow pathway in this study the processes of non equilibrium gas diffusion and gas exchange were implemented into an existing dual permeability flow and reactive solute transport model the model was then used in a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the suitability of the modeling approach to account for development of anaerobic hotspots with an emphasis on assessing n2o production and emissions the sensitivity analysis combined with characteristic time scale analysis suggests that the development of anaerobic hotspots is controlled by a combination of both physical and geochemical parameters time scale analysis of o2 supply and consumption indicates that the occurrence of anaerobic hotspots is determined by the balance between characteristic times of o2 diffusion through the soil profile or exchange between macropores and the soil matrix and the characteristic time of o2 consumption motivated by these findings the present model was applied to simulate ghg cycling at a field site in ontario canada featuring macroporous agricultural soil the model generally reproduced observed spatiotemporal variations in pore gas o2 and ghg concentrations and fluxes simulation results suggest that at this site gas exchange processes between regions of preferential flow and the soil matrix play an important role in controlling the spatial variation of o2 in the soil the simulations illustrate how the release of ghgs from the soil matrix into the macropores can lead to ghg emissions to the atmosphere the modeling approach presented here including dual domain flow and solute transport as well as dual domain gas transport shows promise for future studies with the aim to develop a more complete understanding of how soil structure affects complex ghg cycling in agricultural soils keywords dual permeability

emitted eccc 2018 agricultural soils are a source of co2 and n2o van zandvoort et al 2017 and either a sink or a source for ch4 nangia et al 2013 the production or consumption of ghgs in soils depends heavily on hydrological factors e g precipitation evapotranspiration preferential and matrix flow moisture content and a range of biogeochemical parameters e g abundance of organic c nutrient availability mineralogy which together regulate and control the nature of ghg relevant microbial activity blagodatsky and smith 2012 although major progress has been made in recent years process based understanding and prediction of the dynamics of ghg cycling in agricultural soils is still developing in part due to complex interactions between transient hydrologic processes spatially and temporally distributed biogeochemical activity both affecting ghg fate and transport smith et al 2003 vereecken et al 2016 quick et al 2019 soil structure in agricultural soils has received much attention because it can significantly affect soil hydraulic characteristics chemical speciation and biomass availability thereby influencing ghg dynamics sullivan et al 2022 in particular soil macropores have enormous capacity to regulate the nature and degree of ghg reactions and transport laudone et al 2011 keiluweit et al 2016 pioneering work by bundt et al 2001 showed that macropores identified with dye were enriched in o2 and aerobic microbes indicating that macropores can provide a favorable environment for aerobic respiration further evidence has shown that macropores determined by x ray computed microtomography exhibited higher co2 production rates e g organic c oxidation rates compared to the soil matrix kravchenko et al 2015 however not only the presence of macropores but also interactions between macropores and the soil matrix may alter ghg dynamics keiluweit et al 2016 o2 supply via diffusion into the soil matrix is often slower than its consumption via microbial respiration leading to prevailing anaerobic conditions in the soil matrix hussain et al 2019 the presence of aerobic macropores adjacent to an anaerobic soil matrix impacts biogeochemical processes and ghg cycling sihi et al 2020 for example hotspots of denitrification have been linked to diffusion constraints and the development of local anaerobic conditions in the soil matrix arah and vinten 1995 despite the growing number of detailed field studies with spatially and temporally resolved data a comprehensive understanding of the inherent complexity of ghg dynamics under the influence of macropores remains a research challenge reactive transport models rtms have been used extensively to explore the coupling of hydrologic geochemical and biological processes that determine the formation operation and evolution of complex subsurface systems e g postma and appelo 2000 steefel et al 2015 li et al 2017 jacques et al 2018 maher and mayer 2019 to investigate how soil structure affects biogeochemical fluxes and concentrations three major modeling concepts have been developed including uniform models discrete macropore models and dual continuum models uniform models assume that the macropores and soil matrix can be represented by an equivalent porous medium with averaged upscaled hydraulic and biogeochemical parameters liu et al 2016 jia et al 2022 despite such simplifications this approach can yield representative results depending on the nature of soil structure and the scale of the modeling effort discrete macropore models represent a macroporous system more realistically as they explicitly consider individual macropores and mass exchange with the matrix sidborn and neretnieks 2004 hussain et al 2019 however applications of these models are more limited at large spatial and temporal scales because of limited information on the spatial distribution of macropores and tremendous computational cost gerke 2006 dual continuum models provide an alternative approach to differentiate between macropores and the soil matrix on a larger scale with lower computational cost šimůnek and van genuchten 2008 köhne et al 2009 during the last decades dual continuum approaches have evolved seeing increased usage in ghg studies orozco lópez et al 2018 examination of the literature indicates that models with a mechanistic description of complex biogeochemical c n cycling have been developed li et al 2017 however the majority of these models neglect the process based description of non equilibrium gas transport and controlling factors e g water saturation stolk et al 2011 blagodatsky and smith 2012 tremosa et al 2020 for example stolk et al 2011 proposed a dual domain model to assess how the exchange of dissolved n species between macropores and the matrix influence the spatiotemporal dynamics of dissolved n2o while simplifying gas exchange the lack of such capabilities limits the applicability of dual continuum models for the simulation of o2 ingress the evolution of redox conditions in space and time and ghg cycling in macroporous soils as a result additional development of dual continuum approaches including non equilibrium gas transport and reaction processes is warranted the overarching objective of this study is the development and evaluation of an enhanced dual permeability flow and reactive transport model that includes gas transport and exchange between the macropores and the soil matrix with the aim to simulate ghg cycling in macroporous agricultural soils specific objectives of this study include i extension of an existing dual permeability model to include non equilibrium gas diffusion and gas exchange processes ii to evaluate the suitability of the modeling approach to simulate reactive solute and gas transport in macroporous soils with an emphasis on characterizing conditions controlling the development of anaerobic hotspots iii to evaluate the spatiotemporal dynamics of soil moisture o2 and ghg concentrations and controlling processes within a macroporous agricultural soil constrained by field observations and iv to provide a preliminary assessment of the importance of gas exchange processes between the macropores and the soil matrix on ghg emissions and net global warming potential gwp 2 model development 2 1 mathematical formulation in the dual permeability modeling concept the macropores and soil matrix are represented explicitly in the model water solute and gas transfer between the macropores and the soil matrix are also represented explicitly fig 1 variably saturated flow in both subdomains of dual domain media is described using richards equation with the assumption of incompressible fluid no hysteresis and a passive air phase richards 1931 mayer et al 2002 the flow equations for the subdomains are coupled by means of an exchange term to account for the transfer of water between the two co existing continua gerke and van genuchten 1993 the saturations and the relative permeabilities are a function of the aqueous phase pressure based on the relationships given by wösten and van genuchten 1988 the present model allows for transient flow conditions which leads to changes in phase saturations in the dual domain medium detailed information on the dual permeability flow equations can be found in the supporting information si section s1 for this study a dual permeability reactive transport model developed by javadi 2019 has been modified to account for non equilibrium gas transport and gas exchange processes in between the subdomains the present dual permeability mass balance equations for chemical component j present in the aqueous and gaseous phases written in terms of total component concentrations take the form 1 t

millington 1959 the millington model for tortuosity correction was chosen for this study since i it is commonly used and accounts for the effects of both porosity and saturation which reflect the impacts of soil texture this tortuosity correction has proven useful for calculating effective diffusivity in agricultural soils e g hussain et al 2019 herbst et al 2008 and ii the millington model is able to capture the available data for gas concentrations and fluxes reasonably well indicating that the gas diffusion parameters and formulation used in the model including tortuosity correction after millington are adequate representations of the soil system nevertheless it must be acknowledged that uncertainties regarding the representativeness of the millington model for tortuosity correction increases the potential for model non uniqueness 2 2 numerical implementation and code verification the formulation presented in section 2 1 has been implemented in a modular fashion into an existing dual permeability version javadi 2019 of the reactive solute and gas transport code min3p mayer et al 2002 an overview on the numerical implementation strategies for the min3p code can be found in mayer and macquarrie 2010 to ensure correct implementation of the governing equations the code was verified against results obtained with the established hydrus 1d code šimůnek et al 2003 šimůnek and van genuchten 2008 the dual permeability flow and reactive solute transport code has been successfully verified javadi 2019 although hydrus 1d does not include a formulation for dual permeability gas transport and exchange processes šimůnek and van genuchten 2008 it can be used to verify the new implementation in min3p since the formulation for non equilibrium gas diffusion and gas exchange is mathematically equivalent to non equilibrium solute diffusion and solute exchange information on the solution domain and model parametrization for the min3p and hydrus 1d intercomparison simulations can be found in the si section s2 the results obtained with min3p and hydrus 1d are in good agreement for gas concentrations along the soil profile at selected depths see figure s1 in the si although simple in nature this code verification effectively tests the main features and capabilities of the implementation for gas transport and exchange in the dual permeability media 3 methods in this section we first describe the strategies used to investigate physical and geochemical parameters controlling the formation of anaerobic hotspots including a characteristic time scale analysis and a sensitivity analysis section 3 1 in this context we then describe the present model to simulate ghg cycling and emissions at a field site in ontario canada featuring macroporous agricultural soil section 3 2 3 1 modeling evaluation of the development of anaerobic conditions 3 1 1 characteristic time scale analysis one of the major considerations when modeling dual permeability reactive transport and exchange are the time scales characterizing the various transport and reaction processes one of the primary time scales of interest here is the time scale characteristic for the advancement of atmospheric o2 through the macropores and the soil matrix as well as o2 exchange between the two domains in order to facilitate a comparison of characteristic time scales it is useful to provide a definition of the time scales for transport exchange and reactions the characteristic time for gas diffusion in the macropores and soil matrix are given by 8 t t p l d p 2 d p g 9 t t m l d m 2 d m g where l d p and l d m are the diffusion lengths of interest in the two domains m respectively geochemical reactions in soil systems commonly include both homogeneous reactions which take place in a single phase and heterogeneous reactions which involve mass exchange between two phases thus the reaction time scales are defined separately for homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions 10 t t r 1 k k a t j m a t j m a k k a 11 t t r 1 k k m 1 s m a ϕ m t j m a s m a ϕ m t j m a k k m where k k a is the rate constant for a homogeneous reaction mol l 1 h2o s 1 and k k m is the rate constant for a heterogeneous reaction mol dm 3 porous medium s 1 due to the diverse nature of geochemical rate expressions we assume that relevant reactions are zero order and the stoichiometric coefficient of the component j is unity in reaction k note that the reaction time scales presented here are defined for the soil matrix although corresponding reaction time scales exist for the macropores as well finally a characteristic time scale for gas exchange between the macropores and soil matrix is proposed as 12 t t e x α e 2 d ex g the relationships between the time scales of physical transport and geochemical reactions can be further considered in the context of damköhler numbers damköhler and einfliisse der stromung 1936 bahr and rubin 1987 therefore we define a dimensionless number r t p r that relates the characteristic time scale of macropore gas diffusion to the rate of reaction 13 r t p r t t p t t r a second dimensionless number r t m r relates the characteristic time scale of matrix gas diffusion to reaction and is defined as 14 r t m r t t m t t r the two dimensionless numbers are in principle equivalent to damköhler s da ii comparing the characteristic time of diffusion to that of reaction however they are defined separately for the matrix and the macropores in addition a third dimensionless number r t e x r is defined relating the characteristic time scale of gas exchange to reaction 15 r t e x r t t e x t t r 3 1 2 conceptual model model set up and parameterization subsequently our model was used to characterize physical and geochemical factors controlling the development of anaerobic hotspots fig 1 the conceptual model considers atmospheric o2 penetrating into the macropores and the soil matrix potentially exchanging between the macropores and the soil matrix as well as o2 consumption in the soil matrix the model domain extends to a depth of 2 0 m represented by a 1 d vertical column discretized into 202 control volumes all simulations were performed for a time period of 180 days the model domain represents a clay loam matrix with macropores connected from surface to bottom which is representative for common macroporous agricultural soils in temperate climates hussain et al 2019 weng 2021 the saturated hydraulic conductivities were set to 5 0 10 1 m s 1 and 3 4 10 6 m s 1 representative for the macropore subdomain and a clay loam soil matrix respectively soil hydraulic function parameters were derived from the literature weng 2021 for the macropores residual saturation was set as 0 01 and the van genuchten soil hydraulic function parameters were set to α 5 64 m 1 n 2 49 and l 0 5 for the soil matrix residual water content was set as 0 08 and the van genuchten soil hydraulic function parameters were set to α 1 58 m 1 n 1 41 and l 0 5 notice that the matrix residual saturations were varied as part of the sensitivity analysis to account for a range of possible scenarios table 3 the longitudinal dispersivity was estimated as 0 1 m the free phase diffusion coefficients for aqueous and gas phases were assigned as 2 4 10 9 m2 s 1 and 2 1 10 5 m2 s 1 respectively mayer et al 2002 soil porosities were set at 0 9 and 0 4 for the macropores and soil matrix respectively for the solute gas exchange term β was set to 3 0 α e was set as 0 01 m and ω was set as 0 05 these parameters were constrained based on a complementary modeling study at the same field site weng 2021 the soil temperature was set to 25 c the simulations include 13 primary components h na ca2 co3 2 o2 aq n2 aq doc nh4 no3 no2 n2o aq ch4 aq and an immobile component representing solid phase organic carbon soc 13 secondary species h2 aq ch3cooh oh nh3 aq cach3coo ca ch3coo 2 caoh cahco3 caco3 aq naco3 nahco3 aq hco3 h2co3 aq and five gases o2 g co2 g n2o g n2 g and ch4 g aqueous speciation amongst these components is computed based on hydrolysis and complexation reactions defined in the model database which is derived from the wateq4f ball and nordstrom 1991 and minteqa2 allison et al 1991 databases equilibrium partitioning of o2 n2 and ghgs between the gas phase and the water phase was assumed all thermodynamic data for aqueous components aqueous complexes and equilibrium gas partitioning are provided in the si section s3 tables s1 s3 the biogeochemical model was developed based on the conceptual model for ghg cycling described in previous work jia et al 2022 with the goal to account for the main processes affecting ghg production and consumption also considered were calcite dissolution precipitation and ion exchange involving nh4 x na x and ca x2 additional details regarding the reaction network can be found in jia et al 2022 biogeochemical processes involving c and n reactions 1 9 table 1 were described as kinetically controlled irreversible reactions limited by the availability of substrate terminal electron acceptors and inhibitors described by michaelis menten rate expressions relevant kinetic parameters were based on previous modeling studies tables 1 and s6 however select model parameters were adjusted since the uniform model used by jia et al 2022 required the use of upscaled or averaged parameters that allowed anaerobic reactions to progress e g denitrification and methanogenesis in the presence of o2 in the current model reactions were only allowed to proceed if redox conditions were suitable providing a more process based method than the approach used by jia et al 2022 calcite dissolution and precipitation reaction 10 table 1 was modeled as a quasi equilibrium reversible reaction following previous work mayer et al 2012 an ion exchange model including the exchange between ca2 na and nh4 reactions 11 and 12 table 1 was employed based on the gaines thomas convention mayer et al 2002 all parameters for mineral dissolution precipitation reactions and ion exchange are provided in the si tables s4 s5 the initial moisture conditions for each case were established using a constant water flux of 6 93 10 9 m s 1 representing a typical average annual infiltration or recharge rate for climate in the region hussain et al 2019 applied to the upper surface of both the macropores 55 of the infiltration or recharge and matrix 45 of the infiltration or recharge until steady state flow conditions were achieved under steady state conditions interdependencies between gas transport exchange between matrix and macropores and reaction processes and their effect on the development of anaerobic conditions can be effectively illustrated whereas inclusion of transient flow conditions reveals additional effects of changes in water flux and water content on the development of anaerobic conditions in this context it is beneficial to conduct the sensitivity analysis under a steady state assumption first a constant head first type boundary condition was assigned at the base of the domain with a value of 1 0 m which corresponds to a water table located at 3 0 m below ground surface mbgs rainwater chemistry and initial pore water chemistry are provided in the si tables s9 and s10 for transport a mixed boundary condition was applied at the surface boundary while a free exit boundary condition solute leaves by advection only was applied at the bottom boundary the mixed type boundary condition is a third type boundary condition for all aqueous components specified flux in the case of infiltration however influx and outflux of gases are also allowed through diffusion in the gas phase this is achieved by extending the grid by an additional cell or a ghost cell into an atmospheric boundary layer where gas composition is assumed fixed at atmospheric levels 3 1 3 sensitivity analysis in this study a sensitivity analysis combined with a characteristic time scale analysis has been used to investigate controlling parameters for the formation of anaerobic hotspots and n2o production from parameters relating to the pore gas o2 mass balance we identified four physical and geochemical factors in the conceptual model that could reasonably be varied in a sensitivity analysis to determine a range of possible scenarios including matrix diffusion path length l d m the radius of a matrix aggregate α e matrix gas saturations s m g and the matrix o2 consumption rate constant represented by soc decomposition k s o c a mass balance analysis conducted with different o2 uptake reactions showed soc decomposition contributes most significantly to o2 uptake in our system data not shown as described in table 2 these simulations examined how gas diffusion length variations c1 to c8 gas exchange length variations c9 to c17 matrix gas saturation variations c18 to c26 and o2 consumption rate constants c27 to c35 affected the formation of anaerobic hotspots in the dual domain porous media 3 2 field site application in addition to the sensitivity and time scale analysis simulations were performed for a field experiment at an agricultural watershed in ontario canada covering the 2018 agronomic season may october sunohara et al 2015 blume et al 2022 the data set includes soil water contents soil temperature concentrations of o2 and ghgs in pore gas and ghg surface fluxes blume et al 2022 our previous modeling study indicates that at this site a uniform model was successful in reproducing long term trends in observed concentration and flux data however the model was not able to explicitly represent the characteristics of the macropores and soil matrix respectively jia et al 2022 motivated by these findings we used and evaluated the dual permeability reactive transport model developed in this work to simulate ghg uptake and emissions at the site fig 1 it should be noted that soil macropores in our model represent worm burrows generated by lumbricus terrestris soil desiccation cracks and abandoned root channels dziejowski et al 1997 hussain et al 2019 the matrix represents the majority of the soil including relatively permeable materials as well as low permeability microsites embedded within the more permeable soil matrix in addition the spatial variability in soil reactivity affecting rates of c and n cycling was considered by upscaled parameters for both preferential flow and matrix subdomains using this approach it is not possible to consider anoxic microsites or hot spots of reactivity explicitly the following description provides a summary of the site features model set up and parameterization 3 2 1 site description the study site is situated in an experimental watershed under primarily agricultural activity e g dairy related corn forage crop rotations and corn soybean cash crop rotations the crop field examined was under soybean production in 2018 and was in corn production the previous season the soils examined are of the bainsville soil series which consists of a succession of sandy and silty clay loams overlying silty to heavy clays schut and wilson 1987 with macropore features e g root and worm burrows extending to a depth of 1 0 m weng 2021 this site has a humid continental climate with large seasonal temperature differences the 30 yr mean total precipitation is about 540 mm and the 30 yr mean air temperature is around 15 8 c throughout the agronomic season may october 1981 2010 government of canada 2019 sampling was performed during a relatively dry growing season in 2018 in which the mean total seasonal precipitation was around 238 mm and the mean air temperature was 17 1 c blume et al 2022 soil water samples were collected weekly at 10 30 and 90 cm depths measurements of the soil atmosphere exchange of ghgs were carried out using soil gas chambers i e static chambers for co2 ch4 and n2o and a li cor instrument for co2 and subsurface pore gas samples at 10 30 and 90 cm depths subsurface gas concentrations were measured from stainless steel rods od 0 25 id 0 125 two slots were fitted on either side of the bottom 1 of each rod staggered ca 1 4 to 1 2 apart with respect to length axis of the rod all rods were open at the bottom with no screen a small soil cavity roughly 0 5 in length was left below the rod bottom to ensure the intake was not plugged with soil the intake portion of the rods were set at sampling depths of 10 30 and 90 cm note that the rods were installed with as much care as possible to reduce disturbance of the surrounding porous media gas samples were collected from each rod using 30 60 ml syringes equipped with luer lock fittings and placed into 12 ml exetainer vials the gas samples were analyzed on a sri instruments 8610c gas chromatograph a comprehensive description of field sampling methods can be found in blume et al 2022 3 2 2 model set up and parameterization the model domain extends to a depth of 1 m represented by a 1 d vertical column discretized into 200 control volumes yielding a discretization interval of 0 01 m for the interior control volumes and 0 005 m for the control volumes on the boundary the simulation was performed for a time period of 135 days i e agronomic season in 2018 the model domain consisted of a macroporous subdomain and a soil matrix subdomain the soil matrix subdomain is divided into five physical and chemical zones including the ap horizon bg horizons bg1 and bg2 a low permeability layer situated between the bg1 and bg2 horizon depositional layer likely of glacial origin and the cg horizon which is effectively a varied clay deposit homogeneous hydraulic parameters were assumed for the macropore subdomain for model simplification purposes macropore hydraulic properties table 3 were derived from weng 2021 macropores are highly permeable with low water retention capacity facilitating gravity flow soil hydraulic parameters for the soil matrix were estimated using the rosetta model schaap et al 2001 based on the particle size distribution of the soil matrix and measured bulk density in addition soil hydraulic parameters for the macropore matrix interface were based on the sensitivity analysis simulations the transport parameters considered a free phase diffusion coefficient of 2 4 10 9 m2 s 1 for all dissolved species while a longitudinal dispersivity of 0 1 m was used mayer et al 2002 in the gaseous phase a free phase diffusion coefficient of 2 1 10 5 m2 s 1 was considered for all gases for the biogeochemical model relevant chemical components equilibrium and kinetic reaction network and reaction expressions are consistent with the sensitivity analysis all thermodynamic and kinetic parameters are summarized in the table 1 si tables s6 s7 the initial moisture contents were established using an average annual infiltration or recharge rate for steady state flow conditions as described in section 3 1 2 given the initial condition for water content transient boundary conditions were assigned at the top of both the macropore and matrix subdomains accounting for the occurrence of precipitation and evapotranspiration during the agronomic season daily rainfall rates were derived from observed data over the agronomic season may 29 2018 oct 10 2018 from a local meteorological station blume et al 2022 evapotranspiration et was calculated in a simplified fashion jia et al 2022 and was assumed to occur over the entire surface of both the macropores 55 of et and matrix 70 of et a constant head first type boundary condition was assigned at the bottom of the domain 1 0 m depth to create hydraulic conditions consistent with water table depths at the site rainwater chemistry and initial pore water chemistry are provided in the si tables s9 and s10 for transport a mixed boundary condition was applied at the surface boundary as described above while a free exit boundary condition solute leaves by advection only was applied at the bottom boundary porosities permeabilities and free diffusion coefficients were either based on literature data or specified based on measured data see tables 3 and s11 parameters such as reaction rate constants were based on ranges reported in the literature tables 1 and s6 although literature data on rates vary widely additional constraints were used during model calibration for example the rate constants of soc decomposition and doc oxidation are typically greater than the corresponding values for anaerobic reactions e g denitrification and methanogenesis data on water solute and gas exchange parameters are limited or non existent these parameters were constrained by the range of literature data whenever available or calibrated to reproduce observed ghg fluxes and pore gas concentrations 3 3 assumptions and simplifications several assumptions and simplifications had to be made when building the conceptual and numerical models although parameters may vary spatially due to variations in structural geometry and transport properties for the macropore matrix interface e g sullivan et al 2022 information regarding the spatial variability of these properties was not available for this site evapotranspiration was assumed to occur over the entire surface without explicit consideration of root water and solute uptake processes as a function of soil depth for simplicity and because root distributions and growth dynamics are difficult to quantify in addition the present model was based on a simplified representation of biogeochemical c and n cycling the decomposition of soc was assumed to lead to the release of dissolved organic carbon doc only represented here by acetate however the release of nitrogen from dissolved organic matter was not explicitly considered this simplified approach is consistent with previous modeling studies arora et al 2016 in addition although it is well known that a range of microbial processes contribute to denitrification nitrification nitrifier denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra e g butterbach bahl et al 2013 only denitrification was considered here finally microbial consortia were assumed present in sufficient abundance to catalyze the necessary reactions for ghg production and consumption throughout the domain although substantial simplifications had to be made this approach was useful for evaluation of the capabilities and limitations of our dual permeability reactive gas and solute transport model for investigation of ghg cycling emissions and uptake in a field setting 4 results 4 1 evaluation of individual physical and geochemical parameters controlling the development of anaerobic hotspots as a first step we used our dual permeability reactive transport model with an emphasis on delineating the development of anaerobic hotspots and identifying different parameter settings in the context of ghg cycling for each scenario model sensitivity in response to variations of individual parameters fig 2 a was further evaluated by means of the difference in characteristic time scales fig 2b 2e show how variations of individual parameters and characteristic times affect simulated o2 availability and determine the existence and extent of anaerobic conditions 0 005 o2 v v from a physical transport perspective an increase in matrix diffusion path length l d m and the corresponding characteristic diffusion time t t m limits o2 ingress for l d m 1 0 m threshold value the development of anaerobic conditions occurred fig 2b increasing the radius of matrix aggregates α e results in increasing characteristic exchange time t t e x and thus less o2 transfer from the macropores to the matrix for α e 0 5 m threshold value anaerobic conditions developed below 1 m depth fig 2c in addition decreasing matrix gas saturation s m g results in an increase in the characteristic times for matrix diffusion and exchange between the subdomains t t m and t t e x thus less o2 transfer into the matrix for s m g 0 5 threshold value anaerobic conditions were limited below 1 m depth fig 2d from a chemical perspective fig 2e shows that an increase in the rate constant for soc decomposition k s o c leads to a decrease of the characteristic time for o2 consumption in the matrix t t r thus limiting o2 ingress with decreased k s o c anaerobic conditions are restricted to a depth below approximately 1 m with a threshold value of 4 0 10 9 mol l 1 bulk s 1 note also that these threshold values would change if the other parameters changed as a result the sensitivity analysis combined with characteristic time scale analysis provides a basis for how individual physical and geochemical factors control the formation of anaerobic conditions in the soil matrix although individual factors can provide a more direct cause effect interpretation individual factors are poor predictors of the biogeochemical hotspots in soil due to complexities associated with among other things process interactions gu et al 2007 heiss et al 2017 to create a more integrated interpretation not limited to individual factors the dimensionless numbers i e r t p r r t m r and r t e x r introduced above are useful to assess parameter combinations in this context further inspection of the sensitivity analysis results reveals six plausible conceptual scenarios for the development of anaerobic conditions in terms of r t p r r t m r and r t e x r table 4 for scenarios s1 s2 they represent conditions under which o2 supplied by diffusion through the macropores and exchange into the soil matrix or diffusion directly through the soil matrix was depleted by o2 consumption in the matrix anaerobic conditions developed in the macropores and soil matrix or bulk soil it should be noted that for scenarios s3 s6 o2 exchange becomes a major constraint affecting o2 availability i e longer characteristic time for gas exchange these scenarios provide a more realistic but frequently overlooked representation for conditions under which o2 supplied by exchange between the macropores and soil matrix is depleted by o2 consumption in the matrix in nature even within aerated soils anoxic conditions are often observed within aggregates or any exchange controlled environment e g keiluweit et al 2017 however it is not possible to determine which conceptual scenarios are most representative of a particular macroporous soil system without having supporting field information to assist in making such decisions nevertheless through these simulations we have obtained a base for assessing conditions under which anaerobic hotspots can develop in macroporous agricultural soils 4 2 application of the dual permeability reactive transport model for simulation of ghg cycling in macroporous agricultural soils in this section our model is used to investigate ghg cycling in macroporous agricultural soils constrained by field observations results from the sensitivity analysis indicate that there are various scenarios under which anaerobic hotspots can develop affecting ghg production and consumption providing justification for considering characteristic time scales when performing field site simulations 4 2 1 soil moisture dynamics fig 3 shows observed and simulated moisture contents at selected depths 15 30 45 and 90 cm throughout the agronomic season although the sampling procedure applied to measure moisture contents did not allow distinguishing between the contributions from the macropores and soil matrix measured bulk moisture contents adequately represent matrix moisture contents since soil volume occupied by the matrix dominates the control volume coppola et al 2012 given that the ratio of the macropore volume to bulk volume was relatively small i e 0 05 v v significant differences between the matrix moisture contents and bulk moisture contents are not expected in this context we assumed that observed moisture contents represent the matrix moisture contents consistent with field observations simulated matrix moisture contents increased with depth fig 3 with maximum moisture contents occurring near the low permeability layer fig 3c closer inspection of water saturations between the macropores and soil matrix in fig 3 indicates hotspots of matrix water saturation 0 9 v v occurred above the low permeability layer whereas the macropore water saturations remained very low i e below 0 01 v v this highlights that the presence of macropores can facilitate gas transport across the soil horizons simulated moisture contents or water saturations in macropores and the soil matrix exhibited short term temporal variations i e hot moments in response to strong rainfall events which is consistent with previous studies e g dwivedi et al 2017 and with bulk soil observations at this site 4 2 2 pore gas o2 and ghg dynamics observed and simulated variations of pore gas o2 and ghg concentrations at various soil depths 10 30 and 90 cm throughout the agronomic season are presented in fig 4 in this study it is assumed that measured pore gas concentrations are representative of pore gas composition in the macropores since soil gas is most mobile in the macropores this assumption is supported by previous experimental e g dziejowski et al 1997 and modeling e g kristensen et al 2010 studies fig 4 shows that simulated pore gas o2 concentrations in the macropore domain remained near 0 21 v v i e at close to atmospheric levels whereas the matrix o2 concentrations decreased with depth with a minimum value 0 05 v v appearing at 90 cm depth indicating that anaerobic conditions may develop in the deeper soil matrix this spatial pattern can be explained by abundant o2 supply into the upper region of the matrix from the macropores or directly into the matrix from the ground surface exceeding rates of o2 consumption however the simulations indicate that in the deeper matrix o2 consumption exceeded o2 supply the effect of anaerobic conditions on ghg production e g n2o is complex and thus ensuring matrix anaerobic volume could provide an interpretative view of ghg dynamics processes that is not readily available from field collected data grosz et al 2021 we have estimated the average matrix anaerobic volume over the growing season from the simulation results for our upscaled modeling approach we assume that the anaerobic soil volume can be estimated based on the fraction of the simulation domain with modeled pore gas o2 concentrations at or below a threshold value of 0 05 v v burgin and groffman 2012 fig 4 indicates that this threshold is reached on average over the growing season at a depth below 90 cm yielding an anaerobic soil volume of approximately 0 095 m3 0 1 m 1 m2 0 95 matrix fraction based on this estimate 9 5 of the simulated soil column can be considered anaerobic in this context it must be emphasized that the fraction would change with a different threshold value for o2 in addition anoxic microsites in the upper soil as well as aerated fractions of the lower soils are not explicitly accounted for using the upscaled dual permeability approach this estimate is highly empirical in nature but it serves to highlight the difficulties with quantifying this important measure fig 4 also suggests that the distribution patterns of pore gas o2 and co2 are highly negatively correlated co2 concentrations in the macropores were consistently low but the matrix co2 concentrations significantly increased with depth with a maximum value 0 10 v v appearing at 90 cm depth concentrations of co2 are highest in near anaerobic regions of the deeper soil matrix which can be explained by the limited solubility of co2 fig 5 suggests that simulated pore gas n2o concentrations were generally higher in the soil matrix compared to the macropores in the soil matrix pore gas n2o concentration exhibited a gradual increase with depth with the maximum values appearing at 90 cm depth maximum n2o concentrations coincide with anaerobic conditions indicating that limited o2 availability facilitates denitrification i e n2o production in the matrix this behavior characteristic of n2o production in microporous soils can be well captured by the present model previous modeling efforts with a uniform model failed to distinguish such production among macropores and soil matrix jia et al 2022 in addition spatial variations in pore gas ch4 can be seen between the macropores and soil matrix fig 5 pore gas ch4 concentration was consistently lower in the macropores than in the matrix higher concentrations were likely correlated with lower redox potential and ch4 production in the soil matrix whereas lower concentrations in the macropores can be explained by ch4 oxidation temporal variations of pore gas o2 and ghg concentrations are shown in figs 4 and 5 simulated matrix o2 and ghg concentrations showed strong short term temporal variations in response to major rainfall events in the summer season whereas concentrations in the macropores were relatively invariant during the agronomic season in accordance with pore gas concentrations the present model generally captures average long term ghg emissions co2 and n2o and uptake ch4 over the agronomic season fig 6 temporal variations in denitrification rates r9 indicate that denitrification did not occur in the macropores see also si fig s2 but occurred in the matrix observed short term n2o peak fluxes could not be captured adequately by the present model fig 6 in this context it must be acknowledged that simulated dynamics of pore gas n2o concentrations in preferential flow and matrix subdomains are not supported by field observations fig 5 which do not show substantial variations over time and are not well correlated to n2o emissions these results indicate that n2o production and consumption dynamics and their spatial distribution as simulated may not be reflective of field conditions comparing modeling results with field observations figs 5 and 6 further suggests that short lived elevated n2o emissions in response to precipitation events are dominated by production in the shallow soil 5 discussion in general the ability of our dual permeability reactive transport model to reproduce real world conditions can be attributed to the model formulation which represents reactive transport and exchange occurring in two co existing continua the present model implicitly includes i diffusion limited gas transport in both subdomains i e macropores and soil matrix and ii gas exchange between the two co existing continua which distinguishes it from most existing dual domain models in a macroporous agricultural soil anaerobic conditions tend to develop locally in generally well aerated soils which conceptually can be captured with the current formulation 5 1 reactive gas exchange control development of anaerobic conditions results from the field simulations show strong spatial variations in pore gas o2 concentrations based on the results of the sensitivity analysis the dimensionless numbers r t p r r t m r and r t e x r were used to provide insights into the development of anaerobic conditions at this site which is consistent with previous studies e g zarnetske et al 2012 briggs et al 2015 fig 7 a illustrates significant spatiotemporal variations in r t p r r t m r and r t e x r between the upper matrix and deeper matrix during the agronomic season in the upper matrix r t e x r 1 produced minimum values followed by r t p r 1 and r t m r 1 suggesting that o2 supply from gas diffusion through the macropores and gas phase o2 exchange between macropores and the soil matrix was greater than o2 consumption thus leading to aerobic conditions in the upper soil matrix in the deeper matrix r t p r 1 produced minimum values followed by r t e x r 1 and r t m r 1 which indicates that o2 supply from gas diffusion through the soil matrix and gas phase o2 exchange between the pore subdomains was slower than o2 consumption thus forming anaerobic conditions in the deeper matrix consistent with the conceptual scenario s5 table 4 further inspection of r t p r r t m r and r t e x r shows that at this site the extent of anaerobic conditions is mainly a function of r t e x r this observation suggests that at this site soil gas exchange processes between macropores and matrix caused by soil heterogeneity have a strong influence on the fate and transport of pore gas o2 and the development of anaerobic conditions previous experimental and modeling studies have demonstrated the role pore gas o2 transport limitation plays in creating anaerobic hotspots e g sexstone et al 1985 keiluweit et al 2016 2017 rohe et al 2021 for example keiluweit et al 2017 reported that transport of pore gas o2 through the soil matrix is controlled by diffusion and exchange when o2 supply i e diffusion and or exchange in the soil matrix is slower than its biological demand e g respiration o2 becomes depleted and anaerobic conditions develop in the soil matrix rohe et al 2021 also reported that anaerobic microsites can develop through limited o2 exchange between the macropores and soil matrix even though bulk measurements indicated that soils were well aerated to provide a more nuanced view of the relationship between the time scales of gas exchange between the subdomains and the time scale of reaction fig 7b shows variations in characteristic time scales of gas phase o2 exchange t t e x versus characteristic time scales of o2 consumption t t r overall characteristic time of gas phase exchange varied significantly ca 5 10 4 to 5 10 1 days compared to characteristic times of o2 consumption ca 5 10 3 to 5 10 2 day longer characteristic times of gas phase exchange t t e x were found in the deeper matrix as a result of lower matrix gas saturations the longest t t e x occurred in the low permeability layer with the lowest matrix gas saturation on the other hand longest characteristic times of o2 consumption t t r occurred in the deeper matrix due to lower rate constants of soc decomposition as a result limited o2 exchange between macropores and matrix is primarily responsible for the development of anaerobic conditions at this field site 5 2 development of anaerobic conditions controls c n dynamics our simulation results suggest that pore gas n2o concentrations differ between the macropores and the soil matrix the spatial pattern was strongly linked to denitrification occurring under conditions of lowered o2 which in our simulations occurred predominately near the base of the soil profile and in the matrix spatial variations in n2o production rates r4 indicate that the n2o production rate increased with depth fig 8 a whereas n2o production rates were relatively low throughout the macropores fig s2 in this context it must be emphasized that the current model formulation allows for denitrification in the presence of oxygen above typically accepted levels although at much reduced rates this upscaled formulation accounts for subgrid variability of redox conditions in both the matrix and preferential flow domains reflecting the presence of anoxic microsites in the soil matrix and to a lesser degree in preferential flow regions the increase in denitrification rates with depth and lower average o2 concentrations reflects the assumption that the fraction of anoxia in a soil volume increases with declining average o2 concentrations fig s3 illustrates that no3 concentrations significantly increased with time in the upper matrix 30 cm depth due to nitrification in the deeper matrix 90 cm depth however no3 concentrations remained at quasi steady state it suggests that no3 is partially reduced to no2 n2o and n2 r3 r4 and r5 while at the same time no3 produced via nitrification r1 and r2 in the upper of matrix is transported to the deeper matrix with the infiltrating water we identified a simplified dimensionless number f n defined as the ratio between nh4 and no3 concentrations shuai et al 2017 this approach allowed us to empirically evaluate whether the soil is a no3 source or sink the value of f n may affect n transformation in the soils and whether nitrification or denitrification dominates fig 8d shows that in the upper matrix conditions gradually changed from a system dominated by net nitrification f n 1 in the spring day 10 to net denitrification f n 1 in the fall day 114 whereas in the deeper soils net denitrification f n 1 persisted over the agronomic season in this system infiltration from precipitation experienced nitrification in the aerobic region of the upper soils consuming o2 and nh4 subsequently promoting denitrification under anaerobic conditions in the presence of increased no3 concentrations for deeper infiltration into anaerobic regions denitrification dominates leading to a decrease of no3 accompanied by an increase in n2o concentrations similarly spatial variations in n2o consumption rates r5 indicate higher rates in the anaerobic regions of the deeper matrix fig 8b which could be attributed to the presence of elevated n2o acting as an electron acceptor under anaerobic conditions simulated n2o consumption rates r5 were consistently lower than n2o production rates r4 allowing n2o produced to migrate towards the ground surface fig s4 in addition to enhanced denitrification in the deeper matrix the limited solubility of n2o and the presence of a water table near the base of the domain leads to elevated n2o concentrations near the base of the simulation domain considering that the dominant transport process is diffusion a continuous upward n2o gradient is required along the entire soil profile explaining why highest n2o concentrations are seen in the deeper matrix in addition denitrification can be assessed by its capacity to reduce n2o to n2 e g weier et al 1993 scheer et al 2020 as shown in the si fig s5 simulated n2o n2 n2o ratios gradually increase with depth with a maximum value at 90 cm bgs in the region where simulated n2o production was enhanced fig 8a our simulated ratios in the deeper matrix are slightly greater than in scheer et al 2020 global average value in agricultural soils 0 109 0 020 however simulated ratios in the upper soil matrix are significantly lower than observed in other studies e g stolk et al 2011 implying that the current model underestimates n2o production and or persistence in shallow soils this discrepancy in the upper soil matrix can likely be explained by the upscaled modeling approach and the o2 threshold used to define the transition to anoxia which considers shallow soils as mostly oxic providing limited opportunity for n2o production the model formulation yields most n2o production in the deeper soil matrix leading to underestimating n2o production in the shallow soil nevertheless the lack of observed n2 g data did not allow for using the n2o n2 n2o ratio to constrain the contribution of individual reactions e g n2o production or consumption in the current formulation finally the matrix has been shown to facilitate the diffusive release of pore gas n2o into the macropores fig 9 c the fluxes between the macropores and matrix increased with depth with a maximum value appearing at 90 cm depth this trend is typical for diffusion controlled n2o flux towards the macropores and n2o production in the deeper matrix correlating favorably with previous studies e g stolk et al 2011 the simulation results suggest considerable spatial variations in pore gas co2 between macropores and soil matrix leading to gas phase co2 diffusion into the macropores fig 9 further inspection of doc oxidation rates r6 shows that high rates occur in the upper matrix fig 8c which can be explained by elevated soc contents in the aerobic region data not shown in addition simulation results show that pore gas ch4 concentrations in the macropores were higher than in the soil matrix thus ch4 diffused laterally from the macropores to the soil matrix in particular in the upper soils fig 9 therefore ch4 oxidative processes are focused on the upper soils mostly removing ch4 imported from the atmosphere at low levels beyond the spatial distributions observation and simulation results show that total ghg emissions i e co2 and n2o varied over time with a significant n2o emission peak related to acute rainfall events i e hot moments which is consistent with experimental and modeling studies in various agricultural soils e g weitzman et al 2021 further inspection of pore gas ghg concentrations shows that matrix co2 and n2o concentration peaks generally occurred in response to acute rainfall events although simulated concentrations of these gases varied only slightly over the agronomic season in response to major rainfall events elevated moisture contents in the deeper matrix limited deeper matrix co2 and n2o fluxes leading to the accumulation of co2 and n2o concentrations in the deeper matrix concurrently elevated moisture contents in the deeper matrix resulted in anaerobic conditions and hot moments of n2o production and concentrations in the deeper matrix previous studies suggested that precipitation can trigger hot moments by modifying soil moisture and the redox environments e g groffman et al 2009 these results can be explained through the development of temporarily steep concentration gradients in the matrix giving rise to hot moments for co2 and n2o emissions across the ground surface and into the atmosphere nevertheless the model cannot provide a representative description of all n and c cycling processes with confidence at this time 5 3 system mass balance insights into the role of macroporous soils on ghg emissions and uptake to further investigate the relative contribution of macropores and soil matrix to total ghg emissions and uptake across the soil and atmosphere table 5 compares cumulative o2 and ghg fluxes from the macropores and soil matrix respectively our simulation results indicate that total o2 uptake was dominated by direct exchange of the soil matrix with the atmosphere i e 92 0 with relatively small contributions of the macropores i e 8 0 total co2 and n2o emissions and total ch4 uptake were dominated by direct exchange of the soil matrix with the atmosphere co2 90 8 n2o 88 4 ch4 75 7 with relatively small contributions of the macropores co2 9 2 n2o 11 6 ch4 24 3 correlating favorably with previous results e g mangalassery et al 2013 however the mass balance suggests that the contribution of the macropores to total ghg fluxes is generally higher than what would be expected based on simple volume considerations i e 5 further inspection of n2o shows that n2o emissions from the macropores originates from pore gas n2o transfer from the matrix into the macropores data not shown which is expected considering that there is little n2o produced in the well aerated macropores this highlights the importance of gas exchange processes between macropores and the soil matrix furthermore we can use a common metric known as net global warming potential gwp which is calculated as ipcc 2018 g w p c u m c o 2 c u m n 2 o 265 c u m c h 4 28 where cum x kg co2 eq ha 1 year 1 defines the cumulative amount of gas emission during the experiment for the gas in question based on the simulated cumulative ghg emissions we calculated net gwp for the macropores and soil matrix respectively although the contributions of the macropores to ghg emissions is relatively small the relative contribution of the macropores to global warming was not negligible because of its gwp 1 61 103 kg co2 eq ha 1 year 1 table 5 scaling macropore ghg emissions to the true footprint shows the significant contributions of macropore emissions to gwp 5 4 model suitability limitations and improvement in this study a dual permeability reactive solute and gas transport model was evaluated and used to simulate complex ghg cycling in macroporous agricultural soils the present simulation results generally reproduced observed long term temporal trends in surface ghg fluxes and spatial variations in moisture o2 and ghg concentrations the model also provided an opportunity to investigate ghg dynamics occurring in macroporous soils more deeply which is difficult to assess solely via field observations this analysis also revealed model limitations caused by the simplified description of the biogeochemical reaction network and the inability of the upscaled approach to effectively account for complex redox conditions in the soil profile and at the resolution of the model although simulated gas concentrations and surface fluxes show a relatively good fit to field data it must be acknowledged that the underlying model parametrization is not entirely representative of conditions in the field the current model is based on a simplified conceptualization without explicit consideration of soil organic nitrogen son dynamics and highly simplified n2o cyling and microbial dynamics observational data to constrain the model is scarce in particular when it comes to data specific to macropore and matrix subdomains leading to limited constraints on c n dynamics in the soil specifically related to the production and consumption of the various n and c species despite honoring the available constraints it must be acknowledged that the reaction network included in the model is unlikely representative of field conditions in addition most of the kinetic parameters including reaction rates as well as half saturation and inhibition constants were either assumed or calibrated adding an additional layer of uncertainty in addition the present model assumes that the soil matrix contains both relatively high permeability materials as well as disconnected anoxic microsites which are considered together in an upscaled fashion variations in reactivity are also homogenized within each subdomain in reality soil aggregates containing immobile water at high saturations may exist within the soil matrix e g šimůnek et al 2008 in this context the upscaled approach does not adequately account for contributions of anoxic microsites or sub regions of elevated reactivity to ghg dynamics for example denitrification in a well oxygenated soil matrix e g shallow soils has been attributed to anaerobic micro environments that may not be easily detected in bulk soil samples blagodatsky and smith 2012 in the current model this behavior is captured through an upscaled model parameterization which allows anaerobic processes such as denitrification to proceed if a defined o2 threshold is reached although this approach allows for simulation of n2o production and consumption processes it is not able to capture the spatial distribution of these processes in the soil profile the model predicts highest rates of n2o production near the base of the soil profile since bulk matrix o2 concentrations are the lowest in this region this is not consistent with common understanding of n2o production often occurring in the shallow soil environments future research could be directed towards a comprehensive comparison of different dual permeability conceptual models for simulation of ghg cycling in agricultural soils we believe that a model parameterization accounting for at least three co existing porosities may provide a better representation of agricultural macroporous soil especially if it comes to simulating n cycling the three porosities are i a porosity component representing macropores ii a porosity component associated with the relatively permeable and less reactive fractions of the soil matrix and iii low permeability or highly reactive microsites where anoxia prevails and where n2o production occurs throughout the soil profile despite these limitations the implementation of the conceptual model developed for macroporous agricultural soils using the dual permeability reactive gas and solute transport approach shows promise for the modeling of ghg cycling and emissions at field sites which provides a basis for future developments and refinements to yield more robust and better constrained modeling strategies 6 conclusions in this study we developed a dual permeability reactive solute and gas transport model that quantitatively evaluated the mechanisms of ghg production consumption transport exchange between macropores and matrix as well as emissions and uptake from a macroporous agricultural soil the present model focused on identifying possible scenarios under which anaerobic conditions develop initially not representing any particular field setting the model response on parameter variations has shown that characteristic diffusion lengths characteristic exchange length between matrix and macropores matrix gas saturation and the rate of o2 consumption are of high importance for controlling the development of anaerobic conditions from a perspective of characteristic time scales the development of anaerobic conditions can be determined by the ratio of the characteristic time of gas phase diffusion exchange between macropores and the soil matrix to characteristic times of o2 consumption in comparison to field observations the present model generally captures average long term behavior in moisture contents gas concentrations and fluxes observed in macroporous agricultural soils the model simulations were also useful for aiding with a process based interpretation of the spatial distribution between the macropores and matrix controlled by gas exchange processes while the average greenhouse gas emission rates co2 and n2o and uptake rates ch4 were captured well by the model over a growing season constrained by measured ghg fluxes the spatial distribution of ghg production and consumption rates with depth as well the individual contributing reactions could not be resolved with confidence at this time in addition the model was not able to capture the short term variability of fluxes specifically for n2o in response to acute precipitation events i e hot moments most likely due to the simplification of the denitrification model in the conceptual model and the lack of considering disconnected soil aggregates that contain pore water at high saturations throughout the simulation domain including the shallow organic horizon overall this study provides support for the use of dual permeability modeling approaches that account for gas transport to improve our understanding of how soil structure characteristics affect complex ghg cycling in agricultural soils however further work is required for a more process based and realistic representation of c and n cycling and the effect of local scale heterogeneities on redox conditions from a modeling perspective progress could be made by considering a multi domain modeling approach for simulating of ghg

2036,due to the lack of surface water availability in yazd province groundwater has been overexploited as a key source of water supply resulting in the overexploitation of groundwater resources for agricultural activities this study employed the data of the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace grace follow on gfo satellite to determine terrestrial water storage tws and deriving groundwater storage gws variations using global land data assimilation system gldas water storage components in yazd province from 2003 to 2020 the time series results showed that the annual changes of gws are positive from 2003 to 2007 and continue negative with a decrease in precipitation significantly causing depletion of gws in the aquifers the pearson correlation coefficient is close to 0 58 between observed and grace derived gws on yearly basis and both show a decreasing gws trend the results of calculating the groundwater balance for aquifers showed that the renewable water resources have decreased from 786 to 250 million cubic meters mcm between the water year 2009 2010 and 2019 2020 this has caused the electrical conductivity ec to increase from about 8500 to 12 500 μs cm the correlation coefficient between ec and observed and grace derived gws was around 0 50 and 0 79 respectively grace derived and analytically calculated groundwater storage deficit gsd is around 2491 and 2775 mcm showing a similar downward trend these results while confirming grace derived gws point out the need to revise the analytical calculation of the groundwater balance based on the unmodified aquifer domains and the non uniform distribution of observation wells in most aquifers to reduce the difference between observed and grace derived gws anomalies keywords grace grace fo groundwater

al 2021 ali et al 2022 zhang et al 2022b nevertheless population growth and the need to increase the rate of water extraction from these vital sources for irrigation shortages of surface water sources socio economic development and climate changes have caused the rate of groundwater extraction to be higher than the rate of recharge smith et al 2016 gleeson et al 2020 ali et al 2022 amiri et al 2022a this has caused that today about one third of the world s population lives in areas under water stress de graaf et al 2019 this situation is even more severe in the middle east with its dry

recharging capacity safe yield and sustainability of aquifers in addition to anthropogenic factors vaghefi et al 2019 by predicting the climatic conditions from 2022 to 2045 showed that iran especially its arid regions will face an increase in temperature and a decrease in precipitation and as a result a decrease in the groundwater recharge rate noori et al 2021 showed that the annual extraction of nearly 5 4 km3 of groundwater in iran has caused a decrease of 10 to 100 cm with an average of 49 cm year in the groundwater level this can lead to an increase in land subsidence and a decrease in groundwater quality motagh et al 2008 herrera garcia et al 2021 fatolazadeh and goïta 2022 despite the importance of groundwater in guaranteeing human life in a considerable part of the

advantage of direct data recording this approach has limitations such as gaps in the dataset inappropriate distribution and an insufficient number of piezometers srivastava and dikshit 2022 on the other hand creating an optimal monitoring network especially in large aquifers can be very expensive therefore it is necessary to use low cost methods such as remote sensing techniques that can provide reliable information on the changes in groundwater storage taylor and alley 2001 mishra et al 2015 chawla et al 2020 since the mission of gravity recovery and climate experiment grace april

this study grace gfo satellite products have been used to determine tws and gws variations in yazd province one of the driest regions in central iran however due to the low spatial resolution of grace gfo products wang et al 2022 the spatiotemporal changes of grace gfo derived gws from 2003 to 2020 have been validated according to changes in groundwater level and hydrograph of aquifers zhong et al 2018 neves et al 2020 also considering the role of precipitation in the recharging of groundwater resources the relationship between analytically calculated and grace derived gws has been investigated in addition the change in recharging rate as well as the increase in groundwater level drop may lead to a decrease in groundwater quality the relationship between measured and grace derived gws and electrical conductivity ec of groundwater resources is also evaluated to confirm the results 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area yazd province with an area of about 74 645 km2 is located in the central plateau of iran and is the eighth largest province of iran fig 1 the average annual precipitation is about 95 mm which is about 38 of the long term average precipitation in iran 250 mm the average annual volume of precipitation in iran is about 7 billion cubic meters bcm the minimum and maximum temperatures of this province are around 23 and 48 c respectively the average annual evaporation of nearly 3300 mm causes a significant share of water resources to be unavailable due to evaporation yrwa 2022 fig 2 water resources are exploited by about 7300 water supply sources including wells 59 springs 5 and qanats 36 nearly 85 of pumped water is used for irrigation 11 for drinking and 4 for industry yrwa 2022 the average annual water level drop in the aquifers of this province is between 1 03 and 0 02 m the long term average deficit of the groundwater balance is about 243 million cubic meters mcm and this has increased in recent years reaching about 384 mcm in the water year or hydrological year 2020 2021 the investigation of the calculated balance of groundwater in this province shows that the reduction of the cumulative volume of the groundwater reservoirs of the province during the years 1976 2021 was about 9 bcm yrwa 2022 2 2 tws data from grace gfo satellite the grace gfo satellite a collaboration between the national aeronautics and space

precipitation table 1 summarizes the data used in this study 2 5 in situ groundwater level ec data trusting the results of this study and using them for water resources management depends on their validation based on in situ measurements and accuracy in the analysis neves et al 2020 in this study groundwater level changes measured in 512 piezometers and observation wells are used to compare the results with the calculations based on grace gfo satellite products these monthly changes are recorded regularly and are used to calculate the rate of water level drop determine the volume of groundwater withdrawal from the aquifer and formulate aquifer management plans it should be noted that in different aquifers these measurements were recorded in different periods however the data recorded between 2003 and 2020 have been used so that it is possible to compare the results with the calculations based on grace gfo satellite products on the other hand groundwater ec changes have also been used as a tool to validate the results in each aquifer ec is measured regularly in a monitoring network the time range and density of measurement points are generally varied according to the importance and extent of aquifers for example in aquifers such as bafgh yazd ardakan and abarkouh ec changes have been measured for 30 27 and 26 years respectively 2 6 calculation of gws using grace

value as follows gws t w s sms s w s s w e annual seasonal and monthly changes in gws evaluated concerning stresses such as precipitation in arid and semi arid areas such as this study area which lack significant and perennial surface flows it is possible to ignore sws to calculate gws yang et al 2015 deng and chen 2017 frappart and ramillien 2018 hu et al 2019 the flow process of the methodology is shown in fig 1 2 7 trend analysis of gws mann kendall mk test has been used to analyze the trend of gws anomalies this method which has been used by various researchers such as ali et al 2022a ali et al 2022b can evaluate the possibility of a monotonic increasing or decreasing trend in gws changes based on the correlation coefficient between sequences and ranks of a time series akhtar et al 2022 details of the mk method can be found in mann 1945 and kendall 1975 in linear trends the slope can be calculated by considering the weighted mean and using linear regression however this method is very sensitive to outliers therefore sen s slope estimator by considering the median of the time series can be used as an alternative method for parametric least squares regression in determining the trend of univariate time series sen s slope estimator sen 1968 was used to examine the trend of different datasets 2 8 analytically estimation of gsd it has been tried to calculate the gsd analytically and compare it with the grace gfo derived results for this purpose changes in the groundwater level have been recorded in the monitoring networks in addition the specific yield sy in aquifers has been determined using pumping tests the changes in the groundwater volume of these aquifers are obtained according to the total fluctuation of the groundwater level and multiplying it by the aquifer s area and sy since the volume of groundwater extraction is higher than the annual recharging rate this leads to the gsd and its accumulation in consecutive years 3 results and discussion 3 1 temporal variations analysis of gws the temporal changes of gws from 2003 to 2020 fig 3 show that the maximum gws was recorded in april march and may generally the gws anomaly varies between 60 15 mm recorded in may 2003 and 145 25 mm recorded in october 2018 this can be justified considering the precipitation patterns that occur mainly in winter and early spring yrwa 2022 the monthly precipitation changes show that the highest precipitation was recorded in april february and march however this pattern has a very high agreement with tws fluctuations gldas anomalies and gws fig 3 as shown in fig 3 the changes of tws gldas anomalies and gws have a very good agreement with the monthly observed precipitation changes recorded in this region although precipitation has a 2 3 months lag in recharging of gws therefore according to the significant impact of precipitation as the most important factor of aquifer recharge in this province it is expected that the calculations and interpretations based on grace derived data have acceptable accuracy gldas anomalies have a moderate positive correlation coefficient with gws 0 61 and a strong positive correlation with tws 0 81 the reduction of the correlation coefficient between gws and gldas can be seen in 2003 and especially in the last 3 years of the time series it is because of the lag between the recharge of water storage components to gws nevertheless the gldas hydrological model can be used as a reliable tool for the verification of grace results due to its high accuracy wang et al 2022 yang and chen 2015 3 2 seasonal variations analysis of gws according to the water year october september as well as the wet and dry months in this region gws changes have been evaluated in two dry periods april september and wet periods october march fig 4 like monthly and annual trends in this case gws values are positive in first five years of the study period and then gws values are negative until the end of this period the results show that in the first 5 years the distribution of precipitation in the last months of the winter and especially spring has increased groundwater storage considering the high thickness of the unsaturated zone in most aquifers for example up to 120 m in the yazd ardakan aquifer which is the largest aquifer in this province these changes can be due to a delay of about 3 4 months between the occurrence of precipitation and recharge to groundwater in addition despite the dry climate of this region part of the precipitation in winter is in the form of snowfall from 2007 onwards the negative changes in gws are very significant so it continues until the end of the study period the increase in groundwater extraction along with the decrease in precipitation has caused the depletion of aquifers this reduction trend is observed at different rates in the unit hydrograph of aquifers supplementary fig s1 3 3 annual variations analysis of gws the annual changes of gws show that in the first five years from 2003 to 2007 the value of gws is positive fig 5 the highest amount about 309 73 mm was recorded in 2005 on the other hand the decreasing trend starts after 2007 and the largest decrease in gws 1029 91 mm for 2020 indicates a significant discharge of the aquifer in this year it should be noted that the increase in gws in 2017 is due to a missing gap in the measurements the results show that without considering the missing gap in the dataset from july 2017 to may 2018 the net depletion of groundwater in this area was about 7065 mm therefore the annual average net loss is around 372 mm it should be noted that based on the annual changes in precipitation in this area fig 5 it is expected that there would be an increase in the depletion of groundwater in the missing gap section because a decrease in precipitation has been recorded in the three years from 2016 to 2018 this means that with any delay time between precipitation and groundwater recharge gws will decrease 3 4 comparison of grace derived gws with in situ measurements after examining the trend of gws changes it has been tried to compare grace derived gws with in situ measurements as shown in fig 6 a grid of pixels with monitoring wells is selected for this comparison after evaluating the measured dataset of the groundwater level in each of the aquifers october 2009 to the end of 2020 was considered to compare the results it should be noted that the largest number of piezometers and observational wells are located in important aquifers such as yazd ardakan bafqh abarkouh and aghda with areas of approximately 2620 1460 930 and 920 km2 respectively therefore it was expected that the comparison results in pixels related to these aquifers would be more accurate the evaluation of the monthly time series of grace derived and observed gws for the validation stage shows that similar patterns can be seen in some months at the beginning of the considered period fig 7 however according to the uncertainty range drawn based on the standard deviation of the grace derived gws dataset for many months the calculated and observed groundwater level changes are close to each other nevertheless the correlation coefficients determined based on all months of these time series show that the highest correlation coefficient 0 27 is provided by spearman s method which of course is a weak correlation table 2 it should be noted that the gap in the grace derived gws dataset can be one of the reasons for reducing the correlation of these coefficients table 2 furthermore it is reasonable that grace gws exhibits high frequency variations grace based estimates of gws changes are noisy because of the influence of a range of factors e g 1 the inherent leakage errors of grace data 2 the errors introduced by data post processing 3 the insufficient consideration of non gws components in the separation of grace derived total water storage changes besides grace monitors regional scaled gws changes while wells observe gws changes at the point scales they are inconsistent in measurement scales and observed variables the trends of seasonal time series of grace derived and observed gws also do not show the same pattern despite the expected fluctuations due to precipitation and aquifer recharging or increasing extraction from aquifers fig 8 the results show that in recent years the difference between these datasets is increasing and although both observed and grace derived gws datasets have a downward trend the calculated sen s slope shows that the trend of grace derived gws with test z 2 74 and significance level of α 0 01 decreases with a steeper slope on the other hand despite the increase in gws value in the rainy seasons of recent years the trend of the observed gws data is also downward with test z 0 31 and a significance level of α 0 01 this has caused that like the trend of monthly changes the correlation of seasonal trends is also weak table 2 annual observed and grace derived gws fig 9 a has a higher correlation compared to monthly and seasonal time series the results show that these time series have a pearson correlation coefficient close to 0 58 table 2 if the peak created in grace derived gws in 2017 and also the role of data gaps in the first months of 2018 red dot line are not considered their correlation coefficient would increase as shown in fig 9a both observed and grace derived time series show negative gws anomalies the results of calculating the groundwater balance for the aquifers located in this region show that the renewable water resources in this province have decreased from 786 to 250 mcm between the water year 2009 2010 and 2019 2020 yrwa 2021a in addition the parameters considered to calculate the observed gws also play a significant role in the difference with the grace derived gws dataset evaluations show that the domain of aquifers as one of these important parameters in calculating the groundwater balance has not been updated for several years in some cases it can be seen that there are observation wells outside the current extent of the aquifer therefore this can cause errors in calculations especially in groundwater storage in addition the non uniform distribution of observation wells in some aquifers leads to an incorrect generalization of the groundwater level to large areas without monitoring networks considering the role of groundwater level in gws calculation this can be a source of error on the other hand specific yield sy is one of the most important parameters that along with the groundwater level has a significant role in estimating gws based on observational data technical reports show that despite many methods including laboratory such as simple saturation and drainage correlation with particle size and centrifuge moisture equivalent cme johnson et al 1963 robson 1993 and field methods such as field saturation and drainage sampling after lowering of the water table recharge method and pumping method to estimate sy maliva 2016 khadri and moharir 2016 lv et al 2021 amiri et al 2022b the pumping test method has been used in all aquifers although this method has been used by various researchers nevertheless if the aquifers are heterogeneous and anisotropic the number and distribution of pumping tests must be carefully determined to obtain accurate results otherwise the results will not be generalizable to other places investigations show that one of the most important limitations for the numerical modeling of aquifers in this region is the lack of access to the hydrodynamic parameters of the aquifer this has caused the uncertainty of the results to be mentioned in various reports in fig 9b the monthly average of the observed and grace derived gws dataset is presented the results show that the pattern of grace derived gws changes is more consistent with meteorological conditions i e rainy and dry months this pattern has been observed in some studies such as akhtar et al 2022 ali et al 2023 changes in salinity can be suitable indices for determining and validating the process of storage changes and groundwater fluctuations the results show that between 2009 and 2021 the electrical conductivity ec increased from about 8500 to 12 500 μs cm fig 10 to calculate the representative ec of each year the sum of the weighted seasonal values of ec in each aquifer was used the weight of each measurement is based on the ratio of the area of each aquifer to the total area of 26 aquifers in the study area the correlation coefficient between ec and observed gws is around 0 50 which indicates a negative correlation on the other hand regardless of the missing data gap ec and grace derived gws show a strong negative correlation r 0 79 this means that old high density water may be pumped as the groundwater level decreases and reaches higher depths on the other hand thaw et al 2022 showed that excessive pumping of groundwater can transport polluted modern surface and groundwaters to greater depths and increase their pollution and salinity therefore it seems that despite the location of some parts of the selected pixels in areas without water sources such as mountains and deserts and also the lack of identification of these sources by field studies and analytical numerical methods this strong negative correlation coefficient can verify the results obtained based on the grace data an increase of nearly 47 in ec has led to a decrease in the quality of groundwater for many uses therefore it is impossible to use it in some areas without desalination on the other hand the poor quality and significant drop in groundwater level have caused the cost of using these groundwater resources to increase on the other hand the decrease in water quality due to a factor such as climate change or overexploitation of groundwater can lead to the occurrence of some diseases and increase treatment costs mousavi et al 2020 meanwhile the study of 206 groundwater samples collected in yazd province in 2018 showed that 33 and 18 of the samples in wet and dry seasons respectively are not suitable for children to drink amiri et al 2021b today a significant part of drinking water in some cities especially yazd the capital of this province is supplied from nearby catchment basins amiri et al 2021a amiri et al 2021b 3 5 spatio temporal changes analysis of tws and gws changes in tws show that from 2003 to 2007 water sources have favorable conditions supplementary fig s2 meanwhile from 2007 onwards tws gradually decreases in the southern parts the largest spatial decrease was recorded in the southern region of the yazd in 2016 which can be justified considering the annual changes in precipitation fig 9a the changes in gws also have the same trend as tws so after the first few years with a relatively good situation in terms of groundwater storage gws has experienced a sharper decline since 2008 supplementary fig s3 likewise the southern and eastern aquifers have experienced the greatest decrease in gws of course it should be noted that some of the most important aquifers in this region have faced a smaller decrease in gws in some years due to their convenient geographical location and the possibility of natural recharging through precipitation events on the plains or the surrounding mountains yrwa 2021b the evaluation of tws distribution from 2003 to 2020 shows that its value decreases from north to south in other words these changes directly affect the value of gws and it was expected that a similar trend would be observed for it based on this the highest values of tws are seen in aquifers such as aghda rigzarrin and siahkouh and the lowest values are seen in southern aquifers such as chahak shahriari marvast herat and bahadoran fig 11 a on the other hand the amount of tws increases from east to west in this case eastern aquifers such as bafgh and bahabad have lower tws values compared to western aquifers such as abarghu dehshir and ernan dahaj these changes can be justified according to the precipitation pattern yrwa 2021b as well as the topography of the region the tws trend is in good agreement with the gws fig 11b this is not far from expected considering the strong positive correlation coefficient of around 0 97 of these time series the climate reports show that the average maximum and minimum temperatures have increased by 1 to 2 5 c respectively in the last 50 years at the same time the rate of evaporation has increased by about 3 mm year ashraf vaghef et al 2019 also predicted the future climatic conditions of iran especially in the central arid regions and showed that dry periods are expected to be longer and intermittent heavy rainfalls will lead to an increase in the probability of floods in addition except for some mountainous areas the average long term annual precipitation in most parts of this region is less than 150 mm yrwa 2021b this is consistent with mansouri daneshvar et al 2019 who believe that climate change due to greenhouse gas emissions caused by the production of oil gas and rapid urbanization will increase the temperature and reduce rainfall by nearly 35 however the decrease in gws and tws can be mainly due to the overexploitation of groundwater for various purposes especially agriculture and the lack of significant surface water resources in this region amiri et al 2021b showed that from 2006 to 2018 the extraction of groundwater for drinking experienced a 250 increase this is due to the increase in population the development of cities and villages as well as the necessity of supplying part of the water needs of the agricultural and industrial sectors however scanlon et al 2023 also recently showed that climate variability causes some changes in water storage but human interventions particularly overexploitation of groundwater for irrigation have a more important role similar results were reported by nouri et al 2021 and indicated that groundwater decline due to overexploitation of groundwater and increasing salinity are documented in almost all aquifers 3 6 trend analysis of gws the results show that the annual minimum maximum and average gws estimated from 2003 to 2020 based on sen s slope method are about 972 59 mm 182 64 mm and 404 88 mm respectively these trends are significant at α 0 001 level in addition the value of test z is equal to 4 17 mm which shows a downward trend fig 12 the absolute value of test statistic z is compared to the standard normal cumulative distribution to define if there is a trend or not to the selected level α of significance a positive negative value of z indicates an upward downward trend it should be noted that the trend of tws with test z equal to 4 24 mm and a significance level of α 0 001 has the same changes as gws however the general trend of gldas values decreases with a lower slope test z 2 88 mm significance level of α 0 01 the reported groundwater storage deficit gsd in the study period shows the same downward trend but its rate is smaller than gws which was discussed above see fig 5 according to sen s slope estimator the minimum maximum and average of gsd trend with a significance level of α 0 1 are about 0 27 20 and 0 23 bcm from 2003 to 2020 respectively therefore regardless of various natural such as changing climatic and hydrological components and anthropogenic such as increasing groundwater extraction changes the groundwater balance is negative it should be noted that gws changes were based on grace satellite measurements from all regions but changes in groundwater balance deficit were done analytically only for aquifers see the next section depletion of aquifers regardless of the rates determined by measurements or calculated values based on grace data has led to the deterioration of groundwater quality and also the occurrence of land subsidence in some areas for example mirzadeh et al 2021 showed that in some parts of the yazd ardakan aquifer the rate of subsidence caused by groundwater depletion between 2003 and 2020 was even up to 15 cm year 3 7 estimation of gsd the changes in the aquifer storage were evaluated between october 2009 and december 2020 the evaluation of groundwater storage changes based on the water level records shows that the gsd is around 2775 mcm fig 13 this is relatively consistent with the water balance calculation report approximately 3050 mcm until october 2021 yrwa 2022 the difference between the calculated values in this study and the 3050 mcm reported by the yazd regional water company is due to not considering the changes caused by the 6 months of april to october 2021 on the other hand the grace derived gsd was calculated by multiplying gws anomaly by 0 28 aquifers area grace net area 11865 km2 42530 km2 the results show that the grace derived gsd is around 2228 mcm fig 13 it should be noted that if the average grace derived gsd of the same period before and after the missing gap in the dataset from july 2017 to may 2018 approximately 265 mcm is added to it the gsd will increase to about 2491 mcm one of the most important reasons for the difference between the groundwater storage deficit calculated based on in situ measurements and the grace dataset is the lack of a standard groundwater level monitoring network this has caused the calculation of the water balance in these aquifers and subsequently the gsd in yazd province to be uncertain it should be noted that the area of aquifers announced by yazd regional water company was used to calculate the grace derived gsd however it seems that in many cases the aquifer domains should be determined again according to the distribution of pumping wells and piezometers because in some cases they are outside the aquifer boundary another reason for the difference between the calculations is the sy values the inadequacy and non uniform distribution of pumping tests in some aquifers cause the estimated sy to have high uncertainty 4 conclusion the results show that the annual changes of gws are positive from 2003 to 2007 and after that it has decreased significantly so that it continues almost until the end of the study period the increase in groundwater extraction along with the decrease in precipitation has caused the depletion of aquifers the southern and eastern aquifers in the yazd region have experienced the greatest decrease in gws the minimum maximum and average gws estimated based on sen s slope method which represents the general trend of the annual data are about 972 59 182 64 and 404 88 mm respectively the results of the analytically calculated gsd in this period show the same downward trend but its rate is smaller than gws the minimum maximum and average of this data set are about 0 27 20 and 0 23 bcm respectively therefore regardless of various natural changes and anthropogenic the balance of groundwater resources is negative and this has led to a sharp decrease in groundwater reserves the annual observed and calculated gws anomalies have a pearson correlation coefficient close to 0 58 which is higher than the coefficients obtained for monthly and seasonal time series both observed and grace derived gws show negative anomalies the results of calculating the groundwater balance for the aquifers show that the renewable water resources have decreased from 786 to 250 mcm between the water year 2009 2010 and 2019 2020 the results show that between 2009 and 2021 ec increased from about 8500 to 12 500 μs cm the correlation coefficient between ec and observed gws is around 0 50 which indicates the average negative correlation of these two trends on the other hand the correlation coefficient between ec and grace derived gws shows a strong negative correlation r 0 79 without considering the years 2017 and 2021 due to the data gap this means that old high density water may be pumped as the groundwater level decreases and reaches higher depths evaluations show that the domain of aquifers has not been updated for several years in addition the non uniform distribution of piezometers and observation wells in some aquifers leads to a difference between observed and grace derived gws anomalies credit authorship contribution statement vahab amiri conceptualization

2036,due to the lack of surface water availability in yazd province groundwater has been overexploited as a key source of water supply resulting in the overexploitation of groundwater resources for agricultural activities this study employed the data of the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace grace follow on gfo satellite to determine terrestrial water storage tws and deriving groundwater storage gws variations using global land data assimilation system gldas water storage components in yazd province from 2003 to 2020 the time series results showed that the annual changes of gws are positive from 2003 to 2007 and continue negative with a decrease in precipitation significantly causing depletion of gws in the aquifers the pearson correlation coefficient is close to 0 58 between observed and grace derived gws on yearly basis and both show a decreasing gws trend the results of calculating the groundwater balance for aquifers showed that the renewable water resources have decreased from 786 to 250 million cubic meters mcm between the water year 2009 2010 and 2019 2020 this has caused the electrical conductivity ec to increase from about 8500 to 12 500 μs cm the correlation coefficient between ec and observed and grace derived gws was around 0 50 and 0 79 respectively grace derived and analytically calculated groundwater storage deficit gsd is around 2491 and 2775 mcm showing a similar downward trend these results while confirming grace derived gws point out the need to revise the analytical calculation of the groundwater balance based on the unmodified aquifer domains and the non uniform distribution of observation wells in most aquifers to reduce the difference between observed and grace derived gws anomalies keywords grace grace fo groundwater storage groundwater depletion salinity yazd province data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the lives of about half of the world s people depend on groundwater reserves han et al 2021 groundwater as the largest source of freshwater supplies about 36 and 40 42 of the water needed in the drinking and agricultural sectors around the world respectively ashraf et al 2021 ali et al 2022 zhang et al 2022b nevertheless population growth and the need to increase the rate of water extraction from these vital sources for irrigation shortages of surface water sources socio economic development and climate changes have caused the rate of groundwater extraction to be higher than the rate of recharge smith et al 2016 gleeson et al 2020 ali et al 2022 amiri et al 2022a this has caused that today about one third of the world s population lives in areas under water stress de graaf et al 2019 this situation is even more severe in the middle east with its dry climate nearly 85 of water resources in the middle east region are consumed in the agricultural sector joodaki et al 2014 iran is one of the countries in the middle east region with limited water resources which has faced many problems in this regard in recent years ashraf et al 2021 showed that in almost 77 of iran s land area groundwater pumping and depletion occur at a rate higher than the recharging capacity safe yield and sustainability of aquifers in addition to anthropogenic factors vaghefi et al 2019 by predicting the climatic conditions from 2022 to 2045 showed that iran especially its arid regions will face an increase in temperature and a decrease in precipitation and as a result a decrease in the groundwater recharge rate noori et al 2021 showed that the annual extraction of nearly 5 4 km3 of groundwater in iran has caused a decrease of 10 to 100 cm with an average of 49 cm year in the groundwater level this can lead to an increase in land subsidence and a decrease in groundwater quality motagh et al 2008 herrera garcia et al 2021 fatolazadeh and goïta 2022 despite the importance of groundwater in guaranteeing human life in a considerable part of the world sufficient attention has not been paid to groundwater management famiglietti and rodell 2013 by monitoring groundwater storage and providing a sustainable management plan which has become one of the major global concerns today long et al 2020 amiri et al 2021c saemian et al 2022 it is possible to achieve a relative balance between the water supply and demand wu et al 2019 wang et al 2022 ahamed et al 2022 today changes in the groundwater level and storage of aquifers are recorded using a monitoring network consisting of piezometers and observation wells despite the significant advantage of direct data recording this approach has limitations such as gaps in the dataset inappropriate distribution and an insufficient number of piezometers srivastava and dikshit 2022 on the other hand creating an optimal monitoring network especially in large aquifers can be very expensive therefore it is necessary to use low cost methods such as remote sensing techniques that can provide reliable information on the changes in groundwater storage taylor and alley 2001 mishra et al 2015 chawla et al 2020 since the mission of gravity recovery and climate experiment grace april 2002 june 2017 and grace follow on gfo june 2018 present satellites have been started arshad et al 2022 valuable information on the changes in total water storage tws with global coverage every 30 days has been provided to researchers tapley et al 2019 landerer et al 2020 zhang et al 2022a these satellites can determine changes in the gravity field and directly provide mass redistribution and changes in the volume of water resources including soil moisture water from snow and ice and groundwater on large scales castellazzi et al 2018 chen et al 2019 mehrnegar et al 2021 the information on

2006 swenson et al 2008 nagale et al 2022 studies one of the most important and practical capabilities of the data collected by grace gfo satellites is the calculation of groundwater storage gws so

2022 have used this data to study groundwater balance despite the great importance of identifying groundwater resources and preparing a sustainable management plan in iran with critical conditions in water resources few studies have focused on the estimation of groundwater resources variations based on remote sensing methods e g forootan et al 2014 2017 fatolazadeh et al 2016 khaki et al 2018 in this study grace gfo satellite products have been used to determine tws and gws variations in yazd province one of the driest regions in central iran however due to the low spatial resolution of grace gfo products wang et al 2022 the spatiotemporal changes of grace gfo derived gws from 2003 to 2020 have been validated according to changes in groundwater level and hydrograph of aquifers zhong et al 2018 neves et al 2020 also considering the role of precipitation in the recharging of groundwater resources the relationship between analytically calculated and grace derived gws has been investigated in addition the change in recharging rate as well as the increase in groundwater level drop may lead to a decrease in groundwater quality the relationship between measured and grace derived gws and electrical conductivity ec of groundwater resources is also evaluated to confirm the results 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area yazd province with an area of about 74 645 km2 is located in the central plateau of iran and is the eighth largest province of iran fig 1 the average annual precipitation is about 95 mm which is about 38 of the long term average precipitation in iran 250 mm the average annual volume of precipitation in iran is about 7 billion cubic meters bcm the minimum and maximum temperatures of this province are around 23 and 48 c respectively the average annual evaporation of nearly 3300 mm causes a significant share of water resources to be unavailable due to evaporation yrwa 2022 fig 2 water resources are exploited by about 7300 water supply sources including wells 59 springs 5 and qanats 36 nearly 85 of pumped water is used for irrigation 11 for drinking and 4 for industry yrwa 2022 the average annual water level drop in the aquifers of this province is between 1 03 and 0 02 m the long term average deficit of the groundwater balance is about 243 million cubic meters mcm and this has increased in recent years reaching about 384 mcm in the water year or hydrological year 2020 2021 the investigation of the calculated balance of groundwater in this province shows that the reduction of the cumulative volume of the groundwater reservoirs of the province during the years 1976 2021 was about 9 bcm yrwa 2022 2 2 tws data from grace gfo satellite the grace gfo satellite a collaboration between the national aeronautics and space

storage changes has four models including mosaic variable infiltration capacity vic community land model clm and noah due to the high accuracy of the gldas hydrological model it can be used for the

results with the calculations based on grace gfo satellite products these monthly changes are recorded regularly and are used to calculate the rate of water level drop determine the volume of groundwater withdrawal from the aquifer and formulate aquifer management plans it should be noted that in different aquifers these measurements were recorded in different periods however the data recorded between 2003 and 2020 have been used so that it is possible to compare the results with the calculations based on grace gfo satellite products on the other hand groundwater ec changes have also been used as a tool to validate the results in each aquifer ec is measured regularly in a monitoring network the time range and density of measurement points are generally varied according to the importance and extent of aquifers for example in aquifers such as bafgh yazd ardakan and abarkouh ec changes have been measured for 30 27 and 26 years respectively 2 6 calculation of gws using grace and gldas data in this study grace gfo satellite capability is used to estimate gws changes the main component for these calculations is the tws data received from grace gfo in addition soil moisture storage sms surface water storage sws and snow water equivalent swe anomalies were also obtained from the global land data assimilation system gldas fang et al 2009 beaudoing and rodell 2019 the value of tws as an important hydrological component is calculated as follows tws g w s s m s s w s s w e the anomalies recorded by gldas are subtracted from the tws value which finally provides the gws value as follows gws t w s sms s w s s w e annual seasonal and monthly changes in gws evaluated concerning stresses such as precipitation in arid and semi arid areas such as this study area which lack significant and perennial surface flows it is possible to ignore sws to calculate gws yang et al 2015 deng and chen 2017 frappart and ramillien 2018 hu et al 2019 the flow process of the methodology is shown in fig 1 2 7 trend analysis of gws mann kendall mk test has been used to analyze the trend of gws anomalies this method which has been used by various researchers such as ali et al 2022a ali et al 2022b can evaluate the possibility of a monotonic increasing or decreasing trend in gws changes based on the correlation coefficient between sequences and ranks of a time series akhtar et al 2022 details of the mk method can be found in mann 1945 and kendall 1975 in linear trends the slope can be calculated by considering the weighted mean and using linear regression however this method is very sensitive to outliers therefore sen s slope estimator by considering the median of the time series can be used as an alternative method for parametric least squares regression in determining the trend of univariate time series sen s slope estimator sen 1968 was used to examine the trend of different datasets 2 8 analytically estimation of gsd it has been tried to calculate the gsd analytically and compare it with the grace gfo derived results for this purpose changes in the groundwater level have been recorded in the monitoring networks in addition the specific yield sy in aquifers has been determined using pumping tests the changes in the groundwater volume of these aquifers are obtained according to the total fluctuation of the groundwater level and multiplying it by the aquifer s area and sy since the volume of groundwater extraction is higher than the annual recharging rate this leads to the gsd and its accumulation in consecutive years 3 results and discussion 3 1 temporal variations analysis of gws the temporal changes of gws from 2003 to 2020 fig 3 show that the maximum gws was recorded in april march and may generally the gws anomaly varies between 60 15 mm recorded in may 2003 and 145 25 mm recorded in october 2018 this can be justified considering the precipitation patterns that occur mainly in winter and early spring yrwa 2022 the monthly precipitation changes show that the highest precipitation was recorded in april february and march however this pattern has a very high agreement with tws fluctuations gldas anomalies and gws fig 3 as shown in fig 3 the changes of tws gldas anomalies and gws have a very good agreement with the monthly observed precipitation changes recorded in this region although precipitation has a 2 3 months lag in recharging of gws therefore according to the significant impact of precipitation as the most important factor of aquifer recharge in this province it is expected that the calculations and interpretations based on grace derived data have acceptable accuracy gldas anomalies have a moderate positive correlation coefficient with gws 0 61 and a strong positive correlation with tws 0 81 the reduction of the correlation coefficient between gws and gldas can be seen in 2003 and especially in the last 3 years of the time series it is because of the lag between the recharge of water storage components to gws nevertheless the gldas hydrological model can be used as a reliable tool for the verification of grace results due to its high accuracy wang et al 2022 yang and chen 2015 3 2 seasonal variations analysis of gws according to the water year october september as well as the wet and dry months in this region gws changes have been evaluated in two dry periods april september and wet periods october march fig 4 like monthly and annual trends in this case gws values are positive in first five years of the study period and then gws values are negative until the end of this period the results show that in the first 5 years the distribution of precipitation in the last months of the winter and especially spring has increased groundwater storage considering the high thickness of the unsaturated zone in most aquifers for example up to 120 m in the yazd ardakan aquifer which is the largest aquifer in this province these changes can be due to a delay of about 3 4 months between the occurrence of precipitation and recharge to groundwater in addition despite the dry climate of this region part of the precipitation in winter is in the form of snowfall from 2007 onwards the negative changes in gws are very significant so it continues until the end of the study period the increase in groundwater extraction along with the decrease in precipitation has caused the depletion of aquifers this reduction trend is observed at different rates in the unit hydrograph of aquifers supplementary fig s1 3 3 annual variations analysis of gws the annual changes of gws show that in the first five years from 2003 to 2007 the value of gws is positive fig 5 the highest amount about 309 73 mm was recorded in 2005 on the other hand the decreasing trend starts after 2007 and the largest decrease in gws 1029 91 mm for 2020 indicates a significant discharge of the aquifer in this year it should be noted that the increase in gws in 2017 is due to a missing gap in the measurements the results show that without considering the missing gap in the dataset from july 2017 to may 2018 the net depletion of groundwater in this area was about 7065 mm therefore the annual average net loss is around 372 mm it should be noted that based on the annual changes in precipitation in this area fig 5 it is expected that there would be an increase in the depletion of groundwater in the missing gap section because a decrease in precipitation has been recorded in the three years from 2016 to 2018 this means that with any delay time between precipitation and groundwater recharge gws will decrease 3 4 comparison of grace derived gws with in situ measurements after examining the trend of gws changes it has been tried to compare grace derived gws with in situ measurements as shown in fig 6 a grid of pixels with monitoring wells is selected for this comparison after evaluating the measured dataset of the groundwater level in each of the aquifers october 2009 to the end of 2020 was considered to compare the results it should be noted that the largest number of piezometers and observational wells are located in important aquifers such as yazd ardakan bafqh abarkouh and aghda with areas of approximately 2620 1460 930 and 920 km2 respectively therefore it was expected that the comparison results in pixels related to these aquifers would be more accurate the evaluation of the monthly time series of grace derived and observed gws for the validation stage shows that similar patterns can be seen in some months at the beginning of the considered period fig 7 however according to the uncertainty range drawn based on the standard deviation of the grace derived gws dataset for many months the calculated and observed groundwater level changes are close to each other nevertheless the correlation coefficients determined based on all months of these time series show that the highest correlation coefficient 0 27 is provided by spearman s method which of course is a weak correlation table 2 it should be noted that the gap in the grace derived gws dataset can be one of the reasons for reducing the correlation of these coefficients table 2 furthermore it is reasonable that grace gws exhibits high frequency variations grace based estimates of gws changes are noisy because of the influence of a range of factors e g 1 the inherent leakage errors of grace data 2 the errors introduced by data post processing 3 the insufficient consideration of non gws components in the separation of grace derived total water storage changes besides grace monitors regional scaled gws changes while wells observe gws changes at the point scales they are inconsistent in measurement scales and observed variables the trends of seasonal time series of grace derived and observed gws also do not show the same pattern despite the expected fluctuations due to precipitation and aquifer recharging or increasing extraction from aquifers fig 8 the results show that in recent years the difference between these datasets is increasing and although both observed and grace derived gws datasets have a downward trend the calculated sen s slope shows that the trend of grace derived gws with test z 2 74 and significance level of α 0 01 decreases with a steeper slope on the other hand despite the increase in gws value in the rainy seasons of recent years the trend of the observed gws data is also downward with test z 0 31 and a significance level of α 0 01 this has caused that like the trend of monthly changes the correlation of seasonal trends is also weak table 2 annual observed and grace derived gws fig 9 a has a higher correlation compared to monthly and seasonal time series the results show that these time series have a pearson correlation coefficient close to 0 58 table 2 if the peak created in grace derived gws in 2017 and also the role of data gaps in the first months of 2018 red dot line are not considered their correlation coefficient would increase as shown in fig 9a both observed and grace derived time series show negative gws anomalies the results of calculating the groundwater balance for the aquifers located in this region show that the renewable water resources in this province have decreased from 786 to 250 mcm between the water year 2009 2010 and 2019 2020 yrwa 2021a in addition the parameters considered to calculate the observed gws also play a significant role in the difference with the grace derived gws dataset evaluations show that the domain of aquifers as one of these important parameters in calculating the groundwater balance has not been updated for several years in some cases it can be seen that there are observation wells outside the current extent of the aquifer therefore this can cause errors in calculations especially in groundwater storage in addition the non uniform distribution of observation wells in some aquifers leads to an incorrect generalization of the groundwater level to large areas without monitoring networks considering the role of groundwater level in gws calculation this can be a source of error on the other hand specific yield sy is one of the most important parameters that along with the groundwater level has a significant role in estimating gws based on observational data technical reports show that despite many methods including laboratory such as simple saturation and drainage correlation with particle size and centrifuge moisture equivalent cme johnson et al 1963 robson 1993 and field methods such as field saturation and drainage sampling after lowering of the water table recharge method and pumping method to estimate sy maliva 2016 khadri and moharir 2016 lv et al 2021 amiri et al 2022b the pumping test method has been used in all aquifers although this method has been used by various researchers nevertheless if the aquifers are heterogeneous and anisotropic the number and distribution of pumping tests must be carefully determined to obtain accurate results otherwise the results will not be generalizable to other places investigations show that one of the most important limitations for the numerical modeling of aquifers in this region is the lack of access to the hydrodynamic parameters of the aquifer this has caused the uncertainty of the results to be mentioned in various reports in fig 9b the monthly average of the observed and grace derived gws dataset is presented the results show that the pattern of grace derived gws changes is more consistent with meteorological conditions i e rainy and dry months this pattern has been observed in some studies such as akhtar et al 2022 ali et al 2023 changes in salinity can be suitable indices for determining and validating the process of storage changes and groundwater fluctuations the results show that between 2009 and 2021 the electrical conductivity ec increased from about 8500 to 12 500 μs cm fig 10 to calculate the representative ec of each year the sum of the weighted seasonal values of ec in each aquifer was used the weight of each measurement is based on the ratio of the area of each aquifer to the total area of 26 aquifers in the study area the correlation coefficient between ec and observed gws is around 0 50 which indicates a negative correlation on the other hand regardless of the missing data gap ec and grace derived gws show a strong negative correlation r 0 79 this means that old high density water may be pumped as the groundwater level decreases and reaches higher depths on the other hand thaw et al 2022 showed that excessive pumping of groundwater can transport polluted modern surface and groundwaters to greater depths and increase their pollution and salinity therefore it seems that despite the location of some parts of the selected pixels in areas without water sources such as mountains and deserts and also the lack of identification of these sources by field studies and analytical numerical methods this strong negative correlation coefficient can verify the results obtained based on the grace data an increase of nearly 47 in ec has led to a decrease in the quality of groundwater for many uses therefore it is impossible to use it in some areas without desalination on the other hand the poor quality and significant drop in groundwater level have caused the cost of using these groundwater resources to increase on the other hand the decrease in water quality due to a factor such as climate change or overexploitation of groundwater can lead to the occurrence of some diseases and increase treatment costs mousavi et al 2020 meanwhile the study of 206 groundwater samples collected in yazd province in 2018 showed that 33 and 18 of the samples in wet and dry seasons respectively are not suitable for children to drink amiri et al 2021b today a significant part of drinking water in some cities especially yazd the capital of this province is supplied from nearby catchment basins amiri et al 2021a amiri et al 2021b 3 5 spatio temporal changes analysis of tws and gws changes in tws show that from 2003 to 2007 water sources have favorable conditions supplementary fig s2 meanwhile from 2007 onwards tws gradually decreases in the southern parts the largest spatial decrease was recorded in the southern region of the yazd in 2016 which can be justified considering the annual changes in precipitation fig 9a the changes in gws also have the same trend as tws so after the first few years with a relatively good situation in terms of groundwater storage gws has experienced a sharper decline since 2008 supplementary fig s3 likewise the southern and eastern aquifers have experienced the greatest decrease in gws of course it should be noted that some of the most important aquifers in this region have faced a smaller decrease in gws in some years due to their convenient geographical location and the possibility of natural recharging through precipitation events on the plains or the surrounding mountains yrwa 2021b the evaluation of tws distribution from 2003 to 2020 shows that its value decreases from north to south in other words these changes directly affect the value of gws and it was expected that a similar trend would be observed for it based on this the highest values of tws are seen in aquifers such as aghda rigzarrin and siahkouh and the lowest values are seen in southern aquifers such as chahak shahriari marvast herat and bahadoran fig 11 a on the other hand the amount of tws increases from east to west in this case eastern aquifers such as bafgh and bahabad have lower tws values compared to western aquifers such as abarghu dehshir and ernan dahaj these changes can be justified according to the precipitation pattern yrwa 2021b as well as the topography of the region the tws trend is in good agreement with the gws fig 11b this is not far from expected considering the strong positive correlation coefficient of around 0 97 of these time series the climate reports show that the average maximum and minimum temperatures have increased by 1 to 2 5 c respectively in the last 50 years at the same time the rate of evaporation has increased by about 3 mm year ashraf vaghef et al 2019 also predicted the future climatic conditions of iran especially in the central arid regions and showed that dry periods are expected to be longer and intermittent heavy rainfalls will lead to an increase in the probability of floods in addition except for some mountainous areas the average long term annual precipitation in most parts of this region is less than 150 mm yrwa 2021b this is consistent with mansouri daneshvar et al 2019 who believe that climate change due to greenhouse gas emissions caused by the production of oil gas and rapid urbanization will increase the temperature and reduce rainfall by nearly 35 however the decrease in gws and tws can be mainly due to the overexploitation of groundwater for various purposes especially agriculture and the lack of significant surface water resources in this region amiri et al 2021b showed that from 2006 to 2018 the extraction of groundwater for drinking experienced a 250 increase this is due to the increase in population the development of cities and villages as well as the necessity of supplying part of the water needs of the agricultural and industrial sectors however scanlon et al 2023 also recently showed that climate variability causes some changes in water storage but human interventions particularly overexploitation of groundwater for irrigation have a more important role similar results were reported by nouri et al 2021 and indicated that groundwater decline due to overexploitation of groundwater and increasing salinity are documented in almost all aquifers 3 6 trend analysis of gws the results show that the annual minimum maximum and average gws estimated from 2003 to 2020 based on sen s slope method are about 972 59 mm 182 64 mm and 404 88 mm respectively these trends are significant at α 0 001 level in addition the value of test z is equal to 4 17 mm which shows a downward trend fig 12 the absolute value of test statistic z is compared to the standard normal cumulative distribution to define if there is a trend or not to the selected level α of significance a positive negative value of z indicates an upward downward trend it should be noted that the trend of tws with test z equal to 4 24 mm and a significance level of α 0 001 has the same changes as gws however the general trend of gldas values decreases with a lower slope test z 2 88 mm significance level of α 0 01 the reported groundwater storage deficit gsd in the study period shows the same downward trend but its rate is smaller than gws which was discussed above see fig 5 according to sen s slope estimator the minimum maximum and average of gsd trend with a significance level of α 0 1 are about 0 27 20 and 0 23 bcm from 2003 to 2020 respectively therefore regardless of various natural such as changing climatic and hydrological components and anthropogenic such as increasing groundwater extraction changes the groundwater balance is negative it should be noted that gws changes were based on grace satellite measurements from all regions but changes in groundwater balance deficit were done analytically only for aquifers see the next section depletion of aquifers regardless of the rates determined by measurements or calculated values based on grace data has led to the deterioration of groundwater quality and also the occurrence of land subsidence in some areas for example mirzadeh et al 2021 showed that in some parts of the yazd ardakan aquifer the rate of subsidence caused by groundwater depletion between 2003 and 2020 was even up to 15 cm year 3 7 estimation of gsd the changes in the aquifer storage were evaluated between october 2009 and december 2020 the evaluation of groundwater storage changes based on the water level records shows that the gsd is around 2775 mcm fig 13 this is relatively consistent with the water balance calculation report approximately 3050 mcm until october 2021 yrwa 2022 the difference between the calculated values in this study and the 3050 mcm reported by the yazd regional water company is due to not considering the changes caused by the 6 months of april to october 2021 on the other hand the grace derived gsd was calculated by multiplying gws anomaly by 0 28 aquifers area grace net area 11865 km2 42530 km2 the results show that the grace derived gsd is around 2228 mcm fig 13 it should be noted that if the average grace derived gsd of the same period before and after the missing gap in the dataset from july 2017 to may 2018 approximately 265 mcm is added to it the gsd will increase to about 2491 mcm one of the most important reasons for the difference between the groundwater storage deficit calculated based on in situ measurements and the grace dataset is the lack of a standard groundwater level monitoring network this has caused the calculation of the water balance in these aquifers and subsequently the gsd in yazd province to be uncertain it should be noted that the area of aquifers announced by yazd regional water company was used to calculate the grace derived gsd however it seems that in many cases the aquifer domains should be determined again according to the distribution of pumping wells and piezometers because in some cases they are outside the aquifer boundary another reason for the difference between the calculations is the sy values the inadequacy and non uniform distribution of pumping tests in some aquifers cause the estimated sy to have high uncertainty 4 conclusion the results show that the annual changes of gws are positive from 2003 to 2007 and after that it has decreased significantly so that it continues almost until the end of the study period the increase in groundwater extraction along with the decrease in precipitation has caused the depletion of aquifers the southern and eastern aquifers in the yazd region have experienced the greatest decrease in gws the minimum maximum and average gws estimated based on sen s slope method which represents the general trend of the annual data are about 972 59 182 64 and 404 88 mm respectively the results of the analytically calculated gsd in this period show the same downward trend but its rate is smaller than gws the minimum maximum and average of this data set are about 0 27 20 and 0 23 bcm respectively therefore regardless of various natural changes and anthropogenic the balance of groundwater resources is negative and this has led to a sharp decrease in groundwater reserves the annual observed and calculated gws anomalies have a pearson correlation coefficient close to 0 58 which is higher than the coefficients obtained for monthly and seasonal time series both observed and grace derived gws show negative anomalies the results of calculating the groundwater balance for the aquifers show that the renewable water resources have decreased from 786 to 250 mcm between the water year 2009 2010 and 2019 2020 the results show that between 2009 and 2021 ec increased from about 8500 to 12 500 μs cm the correlation coefficient between ec and observed gws is around 0 50 which indicates the average negative correlation of these two trends on the other hand the correlation coefficient between ec and grace derived gws shows a strong negative correlation r 0 79 without considering the years 2017 and 2021 due to the data gap this means that old high density water may be pumped as the groundwater level decreases and reaches higher depths evaluations show that the domain of aquifers has not been updated for several years in addition the non uniform distribution of piezometers and observation wells in some aquifers leads to a difference between observed and grace derived gws anomalies credit authorship contribution statement vahab amiri conceptualization

2037,the physical process of man made earthen dams breaching has many aspects that are still poorly understood and under investigation in this context dam breach simplified physically based models are very valuable as they provide quick and accurate solutions that have an application value although the phenomenon is not yet fully clarified at a theoretical level this work intends to evaluate the validity and the mutual interaction of the suggested assumptions regarding the following key aspects for a simplified modelling 1 the geometry of the breach cross section 2 the characteristics of the water flow through the breach 3 the breach erosion law 4 the morphology of the reservoir the main findings of this study in relation to the outlined key aspects are the following 1 the breach geometry assumed of triangular trapezoidal shape plays an important role in the computation of the outflow hydrograph but in this work a dimensionless analysis was performed from which it was found that there is a low sensitivity region identified by medium values of a dimensionless parameter which characterizes the dam reservoir system 2 the water flow through the breach can be considered in a critical state with convincing results in terms of numerical reconstruction of the entire discharge hydrographs 3 the breach erosion law can be related to the mean shear stress of the water flow by means of a parameter that needs to be calibrated in this regard the calibration has been performed choosing a number of historical cases falling in the low sensitivity region identified in point 1 so that the results of the calibration were not affected by the shape assumed for the breach 4 the morphology of the reservoir affects the evolution of the dam breaching process and therefore the shape of the calculated hydrograph thus it must be taken into consideration by introducing a level volume curve into the calculation keywords dam breach earthen dams dam failure flood risk assessment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the mapping of flood prone areas due to dam failures is particularly complex in the case of the breaching of earthen dams since the physical phenomenon consists of a progressive failure induced by the interaction between water and embankment the opening of the breach is an extremely complicated process right from the initial stage which can be different depending on the triggering cause of the failure and the characteristics of the dam body in the case of dam breaching induced by overtopping the first phase can be characterized by an irregular headcutting process in which a backward erosion takes place and the headcut migrates upstream see hanson et al 2005 wang bowles 2007 walder et al 2015 zhong et al 2019 the overtopping failure process of embankment or landslide dams characterized by a low compaction degree and non cohesive materials is different from the compacted or cohesive dams since in the first phase a progressive surface erosion takes place instead of the headcutting see zhang et al 2021 zhong et al 2021 on the other hand when the breaching is induced by piping the first phase is characterized by an internal seepage erosion process see zhang et al 2022 that produces an internal hole which enlarges until the part of the dam body above it collapses resulting in an open breach johnson illes 1976 chen et al 2019 these initial phases described up to now are followed by a further complicated development of the breach whose shape is variable in time and space and can also undergo sudden enlargements due to the collapse of portions of the breach sides morris hassan 2009 the physical mathematical description of all these aspects is a difficult undertaking given that some of these aspects are still not fully clarified at a theoretical level and anyway they require knowledge of several parameters that are difficult to determine however as it is known research in the field of engineering has the task of providing solutions that have an application value even in matters not yet fully clarified at a theoretical level for example for the purpose of assessing the safety conditions of the territories downstream of the dams zhou et al 2015 abdedou et al 2020 ge et al 2022 in this context there is a need for calculation models able to provide a realistic prediction of the outflow hydrograph from a breached dam necessary for the mapping of flood prone areas several models are available in the literature for the prediction of the outflow hydrograph from a breached dam they are usually classified depending on the degree of simplification used for the description of the breach enlargement process a recent state of the art review was presented by zhong et al 2021 who addressed different aspects regarding the breaching of both embankment and landslide dams i e documented failure cases laboratory and field experiments empirically and physically based models models that simulate the hydrograph like the emptying of a reservoir through a weir in which the bottom of the breach is lowered with a pre set linear or non linear downcutting rate are called parametric models e g fread harbaugh 1973 singh snorrason 1984 walder o connor 1997 a review of these methods is presented by wahl 2004 this kind of model needs some empirical equations to estimate the required parameters as a function of the geometric characteristics of the dam the hydraulic head into the reservoir or the stored volume of water for instance xu and zhang 2009 proposed regression equations to calculate breach parameters through a multiparameter non linear approach and wang et al 2020 formulated an empirical equation that relates the breach height to the water depth above the breach some of the empirical equations available in the literature provide estimates of the peak discharge due to dam breach e g pierce et al 2010 duricic et al 2013 de lorenzo macchione 2014 froehlich 2016 among the most recent works rong et al 2020 carried out a multifactor regression analysis finding regression equations that allow to calculate the peak outflow discharge the average breach width and height as functions of the water volume and depth above the breach bottom instead models that express the breach enlargement as a function of the characteristics of the water flow like shear stress or velocity are called physically based fread 1988 macchione 2008 many of them are based on the 2d shallow water equations and unsteady flow over an erodible bed froehlich 2002 wang bowles 2006 faeh 2007 cao et al 2011 su et al 2020 among the most recent works cao neilsen 2021 proposed a dam breach model based on the material point method to simulate soil and water interaction the detailed physically based models use the most accurate hydraulic description of the water flow through the breach and the erosion process however they use a complex mathematical formulation with a lot of physical parameters in the context of flood emergency management detailed modelling is not suitable while simplified physically based models are much more valuable they usually have a simpler approach because they adopt simple equations for breach erosion law and sometimes explicitly consider the sudden mass failures from breach sides mohamed et al 2002 or the headcut formation and migration see morris et al 2009 temple et al 2006 zhu et al 2006 wu 2013 zhong et al 2019 except for a few models that consider the suspended load transport from near clear water into the reservoir to turbid water downstream of the dam see visser 1998 wang et al 2006 wu 2013 most of the simplified models use equilibrium sediment transport formulas zhong et al 2021 in case of breaching induced by piping the simplified physically based models available in the literature consider that an initial pipe in the dam body enlarges with time due to the seepage erosion the difference between these model is the shape of the pipe cross section fread 1988 mohamed et al 2002 morris et al 2009 wu 2013 chen et al 2019 however as already mentioned after an initial phase in which the seepage erosion occurs the dam body collapses and the overtopping flow becomes dominant zhong et al 2021 for this reason the simulation of failures triggered by piping can also be performed by considering the formation of an initial surface breach due to the collapse of the dam body macchione 2008 this work intends to contribute to the definition of a reasonable schematization of the following key physical aspects to be included in the simplified physically based modelling aimed at a realistic prediction of the discharge hydrographs generated by the hypothetical failure of man made earthen dams 1 the geometry of the breach cross section 2 the characteristics of the water flow through the breach 3 the relation between the water flow through the breach and the breach erosion 4 the morphology of the reservoir in light of the above the following section is entirely dedicated to simplified models of which in addition to clarifying the key aspects and proposing reasonable assumptions the state of the art will be further explored afterwards a critical analysis of the key aspects outlined above will be carried out in particular the problem of their mutual interaction will be addressed and finally the validity of the assumptions made regarding the key aspects will be assessed 2 key aspects in simplified modelling of man made earthen dams breaching regarding the key aspects mentioned in the previous section that must be carefully considered in the simplified physically based modelling of man made earthen dams breaching this work is based on the following schematization proposed by macchione 2008 and macchione rino 2008 2 1 geometry of the breach cross section a pre assigned geometry of triangular trapezoidal shape is assumed for the breach cross section this assumption is supported by the observations of final breach shapes of real dam failures for which unfortunately there is no clear evidence of the shape assumed by the breach during its enlargement asce ewri 2011 observations of real cases johnson illes 1976 macdonald langridge monopolis 1984 macchione 2008 have shown that for failures due to overtopping an approximately triangular cut is created at a weak point on the crest of the embankment this breach deepens and widens until it reaches the base of the dam from this moment on the breach widens further until the reservoir is empty as regards the failures due to piping the same authors have highlighted that the internal erosion of the embankment causes a hole which widens until the part of the dam body above it collapses in this way an open breach is formed from this moment on the shape and development are similar to those described for overtopping this development mechanism is well documented in the teton dam piping failure case idaho usa see independent panel to review cause of teton dam failure 1976 experimental investigations such as that carried out by chinnarasri et al 2004 on embankment dams made by different combination of sandy and clayey materials have shown that the breach shape was initially rectangular and then oval triangular to trapezoidal as the breaching progresses coleman et al 2002 carried out experimental investigations on non cohesive homogeneous embankments subject to overtopping showing that the breach cross section has a parabolic shape during the erosion process some models also consider the parabolic shape see for instance peter et al 2018 or a semielliptical breach geometry walsh et al 2021 however pickert et al 2011 who carried out laboratory experiments on homogeneous non cohesive embankments subject to overtopping have observed that the shape of the breach during erosion cannot be categorized in none of the shapes typical of dam breaching therefore still today it is not possible to clearly establish which most likely best represents the breach during the enlargement process and in any case the triangular trapezoidal section is a good approximation of the parabolic one with the advantage of a simpler geometric schematization the trapezoidal shape was also adopted by wu 2013 2 2 characteristics of the water flow through the breach the simulation of the first phase of the erosion process the headcutting in the case of overtopping or the opening of a tunnel in the case of piping can be omitted in a simplified model aimed at calculating the discharge hydrograph outflowing from the breach since the flow discharges that outflow in this phase are relatively low the subsequent phase that is the breach enlargement is the most important process to be simulated since it produces the highest outflow discharges during this phase the water flow through the breach can be considered in a critical state at a certain control section this assumption originally proposed by macchione 1986 1989 2008 was also made by other authors walder and o connor 1997 begam et al 2018 peter et al 2018 zhou et al 2020 hung et al 2021 similarly based on the experimental findings of walder et al 2015 walsh et al 2021 adopted the breach crest as the control section with a froude number equal to 0 74 since the critical state takes place slightly downstream of the breach crest location 2 3 relation between the water flow through the breach and the breach erosion as mentioned above also for this aspect the phenomenon is very complex an artificial earthen dam is made up of loose materials that are artificially compacted sometime with zones characterized by different mechanical and hydraulic properties such as for example the central clay core and the other lateral zones with different values of cohesion grain size and porosity simulating the erosion mechanism through a hydraulic model over erodible bed which is already a complex operation in natural conditions would be even more difficult for this kind of artificial embankments furthermore as already mentioned the breach enlargement takes place not only due to the hydrodynamic action of the water flow but also due to sudden mass collapses from the breach sides also in this regard the objective of a simplified model is to adopt a simple erosion law which is nonetheless able to describe adequately the evolution of the outflows from the breach and hopefully the enlargement of the breach over time in macchione 2008 at each time step the breach enlargement is described with a mass conservation equation for the dam material assuming that the material carried by the flow is removed from the whole development of the breach sides and not just from the erodible wetted perimeter the model calculates the entire mass carried away by the flow as a function of the flow transport capacity in this way the model takes into account in a sort of time averaged way both the erosion due to the flow shear stress on the breach sides and the enlargement of the breach due to the partial collapse of portions of the breach sides falling inside of the breach de lorenzo macchione 2013 the volumetric sediment load per unit length of erodible wetted perimeter can be expressed as a function of the mean shear stress raised to 3 2 as in the meyer peter and mueller formula if neglecting the critical shear stress through a proportionality coefficient included into the calibration parameter of the model macchione 1986 1989 2008 it is noteworthy that with a single value of the calibration parameter this approach allowed to obtain excellent results for the simulation of 12 historical dam failure events with observed peak flows covering three orders of magnitude macchione 2008 further confirmations of the validity of the erosion law adopted for the model can be found in de lorenzo macchione 2011 for the simulations of the erosion of small laboratory dams the results appeared satisfactory also for the calculated final breach widths which are an index of the goodness of the approach to correctly simulate the breach enlargement process these results show that this synthetic approach has proved capable of realistically simulating the hydraulic process thus without the need for an explicit description of all the aspects involved such as partial collapse of portions of the breach side migration of the headcut etc therefore this approach on the one hand overcomes the overly simplified schematization based on the assumption of an arithmetic enlargement of the breach assigned a priori to a triangular or inverted trapezoid shaped breach parametric approach on the other hand it avoids the complications of a direct modelling of the collapses of the breach sides the shear stress based erosion law described above originally proposed by macchione 1986 1989 2008 has then been widely used in the literature both for the study of the erosion of embankment dams see e g wu 2013 and for landslide dams see e g chen et al 2015 for instance wu 2013 zhong et al 2018 and chen et al 2022 related the soil erosion rate to the difference between the effective shear stress and the critical value through a coefficient of erodibility estimated using empirical equations this approach is called linear erosion model but other types of models have been formulated such as power law hyperbolic or arctangent models which have one or more parameters e g chen et al 2015 wang et al 2022 other formulations were proposed for instance by peter et al 2018 who calculated the volumetric sediment load as a function of flow velocity and hydraulic radius and by hung et al 2021 who expressed the sediment transport rate by means of the discharge through the breach and the breach channel gradient however a common feature of these approaches is to relate the enlargement of the breach to the hydrodynamic characteristics of the water flow that is the main aspect in which the physically based nature of these models resides for a more complete examination of the erosion models used in the dam breach see zhong et al 2021 2 4 morphology of the reservoir the morphology of the reservoir can be easily and accurately taken into account by means of a storage water level curve of the power law type macchione 1986 1989 2008 it has been demonstrated that the morphology of the reservoir plays an important role on the shape and peak of the outflow hydrograph see also macchione rino 2008 de lorenzo macchione 2014 macchione de lorenzo et al 2016 this will be also demonstrated in this paper see sections 4 2 and 4 3 therefore it is recommended to take into account the morphology of the reservoir in future proposals for empirical formulas or dam breach models even simplified ones 3 numerical model 3 1 original model the simplified physically based model proposed by macchione 2008 was used in this study this numerical model is based on two differential equations which are solved numerically providing the entire discharge outflow hydrograph and also the time development of the breach cross section details about the equations can be found in the original papers macchione 2008 macchione rino 2008 the software for the application of the original numerical model is available in the appendix of macchione costabile et al 2016 interpolating the numerical results of the model easy to use equations have been provided that predict not only the peak discharge but the whole outflow hydrograph furthermore a formula has been proposed de lorenzo macchione 2014 which interpolates the peak outflows provided by the dimensionless numerical model this formula provided more accurate results than other literature formulas see the comparison carried out by wang et al 2018 this model showed satisfactory performance for the reconstruction of real cases see macchione 2008 macchione costabile et al 2016 and laboratory tests de lorenzo macchione 2011 moreover the model was included in the basement software a freeware simulation tool for hydro and morphodynamic modelling see vanzo et al 2021 for calculating the dam breach discharge hydrograph other authors have been inspired by this model for the analysis of the dam breach problem see for example singh 1996 peter et al 2018 the model is applicable to artificial earthen dams which are either homogeneous dams of cohesive material or zoned dams with an internal core of cohesive material and lateral zones of non cohesive material the geometric characteristics of the dam body corresponding to inputs of the model are the height z m the crest width w c and the average embankment slope s s u s d 2 where s u and s d are the upstream and downstream slopes respectively and indicate the horizontal vertical ratio see fig 1 a in the model a triangular breach is assumed during the formation stage fig 1 b that is until the breach bottom reaches the base of the dam then the breach is trapezoidal and only lateral erosion occurs fig 1 d during the enlargement of the breach the angle β between the breach sides and the vertical direction is assumed constant and tan β corresponds to a parameter of the model the emptying of the reservoir is described by a mass conservation equation applied to the volume w w t stored in the reservoir 1 dw dt q where q q t is the outflow discharge over time which is computed assuming critical flow at a certain control section of the breach h c is the critical water depth above the breach as shown in fig 1 b 1 c and 1 d the morphology of the reservoir is taken into account by introducing the storage water level curve 2 w z w 0 z α 0 the volume stored in the reservoir is a function of the water level z z t where w 0 and α 0 are two parameters that can be obtained by a stage storage table or by known values of the lake volume and lake area at a given stage macchione 1986 1989 2008 macchione de lorenzo et al 2016 the equations that describe the emptying of the reservoir are coupled with two equations for the breach enlargement process the deepening and the widening of the breach are functions of the unitary solid discharge which is computed as a function of the average shear stress exerted by the water flow the general equation for breach enlargement is macchione 2008 3 d a b dt c l q s where a b a b t is the area of the breach cross section c c t is the erodible wetted perimeter l l t is the average length of the breach in the direction of the flow and q s q s t is the solid discharge per unit width the breach enlargement can be described as a function of the level y y t of the breach bottom above the natural ground 4 dy dt d a b dy 1 c l q s where d a b d y c and l can be expressed as functions of z and y see macchione 2008 as already mentioned the solid discharge per unit width is computed as a function of the average bed shear stress τ τ t 5 q s k 0 τ 3 2 k 0 γ r s 3 2 where γ is the water specific weight r r t is the hydraulic radius of the flow control section s s t is the friction slope expressed through the strickler equation macchione 2008 and k 0 is a proportionality coefficient included in the calibration parameter v e the latter parameter has the dimension of a velocity and is a proportionality coefficient which appears in the equations that describe the breach enlargement that is 6 dy dt v e f y t z t z m s w c tan β where f is a function of y t z t z m s w c and tan β for the sake of brevity the complete expression of this function is not reported here but it can be found in the original paper macchione 2008 however it is worth recalling here that the parameter v e affects the breach enlargement rate as shown in eq 6 a value for this parameter has been obtained through calibration carried out for earthfill dams in particular for this kind of dams v e 0 07 m s has been obtained macchione 2008 the model is able to simulate both overtopping and piping induced dam failures in both cases the initial condition is given by a triangular breach whose bottom is at an initial height y t 0 slightly lower than the initial water level z t 0 in the reservoir 3 2 modified breach shape schematization for the purposes of this study a geometric variant was tested consisting in assuming the trapezoidal shape for the breach cross section already in the formation stage fig 1 c this assumption is supported by some experimental investigations for instance zhang et al 2009 carried out some tests on large experimental dams built with cohesive soils from which they observed that the breach in the first phase has the shape of an inverted trapezoid under this assumption eq 3 becomes 7 d a b dt a b y dy dt a b b db dt c l q s where b b t is the breach width at the base and db d t is the breach widening rate without a physically based criterion which could allow for the description of the actual distribution of the shear stress on the whole breach cross section and the contribution to the enlargement by the sudden block failures an assumption must be made for breach widening rate db d t in this stage for instance the rate of lateral breach enlargement was assumed equal to that of vertical erosion by xue et al 2021 and was considered to vary along the depth by wang et al 2022 here the widening rate has been assumed proportional to the deepening rate dy d t 8 db dt r dy dt the higher the proportionality coefficient r the greater the erosion on the breach sides at the expense of that on the bottom if r 0 the breach shape is triangular considering the infinitesimal enlargement taken normal to breach side d e n and that on the bottom dy the following breach shape parameter can be defined 9 λ d e n dy δ e n δ y the erosion is uniform on the whole breach if λ 1 so r can be expressed as a function of λ as follows 10 r 2 λ cos β tan β if λ is set to sin β that is the minimum value no breach bottom widening occurs and the shape of the breach remains triangular until the bottom reaches the base of the dam fig 1 b until now very little information is available for assigning a suitable value to λ in the present analysis the maximum value of λ used is 1 fig 1 c 3 3 dimensionless formulation a systematic analysis can be carried out using the non dimensional formulation of the adopted dam breach model in this formulation based on the approach proposed by macchione rino 2008 the dimensionless parameter g is given by 11 g v e w m g z m 7 2 where g is the acceleration due to gravity and w m is the volume of stored water when the water level in the reservoir is equal to z m fig 1 a it is useful to recall here that g can be expressed as the ratio between v e and v w macchione rino 2008 12 g v e v w the parameters v e and v w are multiplicative coefficients that affect the breach enlargement rate and the reservoir emptying rate respectively macchione rino 2008 hence low values of g are associated with fast draining reservoirs in these cases the formation stage is quite important because a large part of the impounded volume flows out while the bottom of the breach has still to reach the base of the dam for very low values of g the emptying of the reservoir may even be partial as the decrease rate in the water level is larger than the one of breach bottom and the erosion stops during the triangular phase thereby leaving a residual impounded volume on the other hand high values of g indicate a high erosion rate in comparison with the draining rate in these cases the emptying of the reservoir is always complete and the formation stage has usually a limited importance as it concerns only the early stage of the whole erosion process in the real world the range 10 2 g 104 has been found as typical for earthfill dams assuming v e 0 07 m s to perform a sensitivity analysis of the computed hydrograph to the breach shape depending on the dimensionless parameter g reference is made to the following dimensionless quantities z z z m y y z m h c h c z m w c w c z m b b z m t t v e z m q q g 1 2 z m 5 2 w w z m 3 where b b t is the average width of the breach 4 sensitivity analysis to breach shape depending on dimensionless parameter g in the following sections the sensitivity analysis was carried out assuming the worst hypothesis of failure for predictive purposes i e failure due to overtopping which is simulated by the model by setting z t 0 z m 4 1 influence of λ parameter in order to carry out a sensitivity analysis to λ parameter throughout several orders of magnitude of g the values g 0 2 2 20 200 were assumed the influence of the λ parameter on the computation of the outflow hydrograph was evaluated by comparing the results obtained assuming λ sin β triangular shape and λ 1 trapezoidal shape the values tan β 0 2 α 0 2 5 s 2 5 and w c 0 were assumed in the calculations fig 2 shows the temporal evolution of the dimensionless variables q z and y during the formation stage i e for y 0 for the assumed values of g for g 200 the outflow hydrographs given by λ sin β and λ 1 are almost the same although some differences can be seen in the very early stages also the water levels at the end of the formation stage are almost the same therefore the variation of the breach shape has a poor influence on the whole dam breach process for g 200 even though the height of the breach bottom decreases much faster for λ sin β the differences are slightly more evident for g 20 for λ 1 the formation stage takes a large part of the rising limb of the outflow hydrograph conversely the vertical erosion is much faster for λ sin β however the shape variation has still a poor influence on the peak discharge and the falling limb is almost the same in both cases in addition the decrease in water level is almost the same for both cases big differences arise for g 2 the peak discharge for λ 1 is much higher than the one obtained for λ sin β since the breach width grows faster and therefore a large amount of water is released however the decrease in bottom height is slower and consequently the discharge increases less quickly for λ 1 as soon as the breach bottom reaches the non erodible ground the erodible wetted perimeter suddenly decreases and as a result the outflow discharge stops increasing due to the reduced d a b d t rate as given by eq 3 and starts decreasing due to the same reason the last case considered is g 0 2 in this case the stored volume is not enough to complete erosion for λ 1 due to this relatively limited volume the drop in the water level is so fast that the dam cannot be eroded down to the base and the erosion process stops before the stored volume is completely released in this case the peak discharge is larger for λ sin β because assuming λ sin β the formation stage is fast enough to be completed the last two cases indicate that for low values of g the formation stage is very important and that the shape of the breach has a large influence on the outflow hydrograph in the following section the range of g values in which the geometry of the breach has little influence on the calculation will be investigated more in detail knowing this specific range of g values would be of great importance in the predictive phase in order to identify the real cases for which there is no need to pay particular attention to the value of the breach shape parameters furthermore the identification of this low sensitivity range would allow for the identification of the historical dam breach cases that can be used for the calibration of the erosion parameter without the calibration result being influenced by the breach shape assumed 4 2 influence of tan β parameter the influence of changes in breach geometry on the computed outflow hydrograph was also evaluated through a sensitivity analysis to tan β parameter the analysis was done by setting different values of tan β and evaluating the following quantities a dimensionless peak flow discharge q p b dimensionless water volume released up to the peak w p with respect to dimensionless total released volume of water w ratio indicative of the hydrograph shape c dimensionless total released volume of water w with respect to dimensionless initial impounded volume of water w m the values λ sin β α 0 1 2 3 4 s 2 5 and w c 0 were assumed in order to illustrate the results the minimum value of tan β was taken as reference and the relative difference of q p and w p w with respect to the reference configuration was plotted over the entire range of the possible values of g see fig 3 a and 3 b respectively in the region of high g values with the same g the peak flow discharge increases as tan β increases see fig 3 a after all if the range of variability of tan β is maintained between 0 2 and 1 5 the variability of q p is not so high in this region as it reaches at most increments of about 30 for very high g values g 104 conversely in the region of low g values the peak flow discharge decreases as tan β increases and the maximum variability of q p occurs between tan β 0 2 and tan β 1 however the variability of the peak flow discharge in this region is much higher than in the region of medium high g values fig 3 b show that for g 102 approximately the percentage of water volume released up to the peak is constant as tan β varies since the relative difference of the w p w ratio with respect to the reference configuration converges to zero moreover for an assigned value of g 0 5 approximately and for tan β ranging from 0 5 to 2 the percentage of water volume released up to the peak is greater the smaller the value of tan β finally fig 3 c illustrate the w w m ratio as a function of g for each assumed value of tan β it can be observed that for values of g 1 the reservoir can only partially emptied if tan β 0 2 is chosen in particular the w w m ratio gets smaller as tan β increases in addition the smaller the value of α 0 the greater this effect is note that the emptying ratio can go down to about 20 if α 0 1 and tan β 2 is chosen on the other hand if α 0 4 a minimum emptying ratio of about 65 is given by tan β 2 the dependence on the α 0 value is a confirmation of the influence of the morphological characteristics of the reservoir on the computation of the outflow hydrograph macchione rino 2008 macchione de lorenzo et al 2016 4 3 classification of dam reservoir systems based on the influence of breach geometry from the sensitivity analysis carried out in sections 4 1 and 4 2 it can be concluded that the dam reservoir systems can be divided in three zones based mainly on the value of the dimensionless parameter g there is a central zone given by medium values of g in which the characteristics of the outflow hydrograph and in particular the peak discharge can be considered almost independent of the breach shape parameters below this zone i e for low values of g the computed outflow hydrograph is strongly influenced by the geometric schematization of the breach cross section with variations in peak discharge up to about 85 in absolute value for g 10 2 the last zone includes the dam reservoir systems characterized by high values of g for which the assumed breach shape parameters have a certain influence on the hydrograph computation but the sensitivity is not comparable to that of the previous zone low g values since the maximum variation in peak discharge is about 30 for g 104 and in addition the influence is exerted only on the peak discharge in this g region to identify the range of values of g that defines the central zone a maximum variation of 20 between the peak discharges given by tan β 0 2 and tan β 1 5 was assumed the attention was focused on q p to define the g zones as the peak discharge is more sensitive to the shape parameter than the other indicators considered as illustrated in fig 3 since the hydrograph computation is also influenced by the parameter α 0 a certain interval was identified for each value of α 0 considered in the previous section table 1 illustrates the low sensitivity range of g for each value of α 0 considered the low sensitivity g regions thus identified are obviously valid for the combination of values assumed for the other involved parameters λ s and w c however for the purposes of this study these ranges can be taken as an indicative reference 4 4 example of technical application to specific case studies as an example of technical application of the results obtained in the previous sub sections two real dam reservoir systems were selected one falling within the low sensitivity ranges illustrated in table 1 and one outside them the selected case studies are the nocelle and castagnara dams both located in the calabria region italy the geometric and topographical characteristics of these real dam reservoir systems are shown in table 2 also the values of the dimensionless parameter g calculated assuming v e 0 07 m s are illustrated in table 2 it can be noted that the nocelle dam reservoir system falls within the low sensitivity range of g while the castagnara case study is characterized by a very low g value thus a strong influence of the breach shape scenario on the calculated outflow hydrograph is expected for the castagnara dam in order to demonstrate this four different breach shape scenarios given by the possible combinations of the values tan β 0 2 1 5 and λ sin β 1 were considered and the respective dam breach hydrographs were calculated fig 4 shows the computed outflow hydrographs for the selected dams calculated assuming the value v e 0 07 m s according to the breach shape scenarios taking the time of peak as the reference instant to create the plots as it can be observed the hypothetical outflow hydrographs calculated for the nocelle dam have only small differences while the ones associated with the hypothetical breaching of the castagnara dam are very different each other table 3 shows the values of the peak flow discharge q p the released water volume w the released water volume up to the peak w p and the w p w ratio furthermore scenario 1 was taken as reference to calculate the relative difference of q p and w p w given by the other scenarios confirming the results of the dimensionless analysis carried out in the previous sub sections the variations in the peak discharge with respect to the reference scenario remain below 20 with a maximum of 13 for the nocelle dam characterized by g 32 5 while they even reach 83 in absolute value in the case of the castagnara dam characterized by g 0 11 furthermore it should be noted that the other indicators regarding the released volumes also confirm the results of the sensitivity analysis carried out in section 4 2 5 calibration of v e through historical cases with low sensitivity to breach shape the modelling approach adopted here undergoes the combined influence of the assumptions regarding both the geometry of the breach cross section and the calibration parameter included in the enlargement law of the breach in particular the choice of the breach shape scenario may affect the numerical value of v e unless for the calibration of v e an analysis is carried out in a zone of the phenomenon in which the influence of breach geometry is low about this the dimensionless analysis carried out in the previous section was able to identify the morphological characteristics collected in the dimensionless parameter g of the dam reservoir systems for which the geometry of the breach cross section does not influence much the extent of the peak discharge and the shape of the outflow hydrograph these results provide a criterion for the selection of historical cases which could be numerically reconstructed without a significant influence of the assumed breach geometry on the calculations based on the results obtained the criterion is therefore to choose historical dam breach cases characterized by values of g that fall within the ranges illustrated in table 1 thus through the analysis of this kind of dam reservoir systems it is possible to investigate exclusively the value of the parameter v e that governs the enlargement rate of the breach cross section in light of the above a small subset of the failure events concerning earthfill dams available in the literature has been selected the dams in the database are both homogeneous and zoned and not endowed of masonry walls and similar rigid structures table 4 shows the geometric characteristics of the selected dam reservoir systems as well as the initial conditions of the corresponding failure events where z 0 is the initial water level with respect to the dam base taken from the database compiled by wahl 1998 and y 0 is the initial height of the breach bottom with respect to the dam base assumed equal to 0 8 z 0 macchione 2008 most of the dams considered were subject to piping failure failure mode p while only two were breached due to overtopping failure mode o all these failure events have been already used for the calibration of the model by macchione 2008 afterwards an accurate search has been carried out to further improve the data concerning each record of the database de lorenzo macchione 2014 in particular for some failure events it was possible to retrieve data about the reservoir depth volume curve and about the dam dimensions however for some cases average values were assumed for the remaining still unknown geometric parameters as for the α 0 coefficient the average value of 2 5 was assumed based on the study carried out by macchione de lorenzo et al 2016 who analyzed 97 reservoirs and found that the average values of α 0 fall between 2 and 3 in addition table 4 shows the estimated peak discharge q p o b s and the observed final breach width b avg o b s for the preliminary calculation of g the constant value of 0 07 m s was assumed for v e see table 4 as it can be seen the value of g falls within the ranges illustrated in table 1 for all the selected cases therefore they fall in the zone of dam reservoir systems for which the breach geometry does not influence much the calculation of the peak discharge however it should be considered that most of the selected cases concern piping failure in these cases the reservoir was not completely full at the beginning of the failure event furthermore some dams have crest width that is a significant rate of the height by contrast the graphs of fig 3 were created assuming overtopping failure and a null crest width these differences can cause a discrepancy between the predicted sensitivity to the shape parameters and the effective one specifically for the dam reservoir systems whose g value is close to the threshold values between the three zones mentioned in the previous section although the historical cases selected fall into the g region of low sensitivity to the assumed breach shape for the avoidance of doubt the analysis was carried out considering different breach shape scenarios given by tan β 0 2 1 and λ sin β 1 the value of v e that gives computed peak discharge q p c o m equal to the observed one q p o b s has been identified for each scenario and for each failure event selected next for each breach shape scenario the average value of the calibration parameter v e a v g has been calculated and then used to simulate the same failure events finally the performance of each scenario has been assessed through the errors on both the peak discharge q p and the average breach width b avg the errors were computed as 13 e x x com x obs x obs in addition the average m e x and the standard deviation s e x of the errors as well as the average of the absolute values of the errors m e x have been estimated the results are shown in table 5 assuming tan β 0 2 and λ sin β 0 196 the average of the v e values computed by calibration is 0 0697 m s first row of table 5 shows the m e x m e x and s e x values obtained regarding peak discharge and average breach width using v e a v g 0 0697 m s with a higher value for λ λ 1 the breach becomes trapezoidal soon after the start and the average value of v e becomes slightly smaller assuming tan β 1 it can be noted that both with λ sin β 0 707 and λ 1 the m e x m e x and s e x values on both the peak flow discharge and the average breach width do not vary much as λ varies it can be noted that for all the breach shape scenarios considered here the mean of the average values of the calibration parameter is 0 069 m s 0 07 m s therefore this analysis confirmed the validity of the v e value proposed by macchione 2008 fig 5 illustrates the outflow hydrographs calculated for the selected dams considering all the analyzed breach shape scenarios and using the value v e 0 07 m s the time of peak was taken as the reference instant to create the plots it can be seen that the peak flow discharges corresponding to the different breach shape scenarios are almost the same except for the cases of apishapa a and fred burr c for which the difference is more evident in fact among the selected cases these latter dams are characterized by the values of g closest to the extreme values of table 1 which are not so strict due to the reasons outlined above furthermore in fig 5 the horizontal dotted lines represent the observed peak discharge 6 adequacy assessment of the hydraulic schematization through experimental hydrographs reconstruction the sensitivity analysis performed in section 4 highlighted the influence of the breach geometry not only on the peak discharge but also on the shape of the outflow hydrograph depending on the geometric and topographical characteristics of the dam reservoir system indeed the shape of the outflow hydrograph is obviously strictly influenced by the spatio temporal development of the breach which in turn depends on the water flow through it therefore if a calculation model is able to reproduce the shape of an observed hydrograph it follows that it is based on adequate hydraulic assumptions hence it would be necessary to validate the dam breach model not only with reference to the peak flows but also to the entire outflow hydrograph unfortunately there are no records of hydrographs resulting from breaching of real dams on the other hand there is an accurate and extensive laboratory investigation performed by walder et al 2015 on experimental dams for which the discharge hydrographs recorded during the experiments are available walder et al 2015 performed 13 experiments on overtopping failure of homogeneous dams at the usgs united states geological survey the flume in which the dams were built is rectangular in shape and has a width of 2 m and an average slope of 2 4 all the dams were built at the same location with a toe to toe distance of 3 5 m and with an embankment slope of 30 for both the upstream and downstream sides therefore the lower the height of the dam z m the greater the crest width w c due to the 2 4 slope of the basal surface the downstream height of the dam h d exceeds the upstream height h u of 0 15 m the latter was considered as the reference one z m h u because below the upstream toe of the dam the reservoir no longer contributes to the release of water volume as it is already emptied moreover the reservoir level volume curve was expressed as a power law eq 2 with coefficients α 0 1 6089 and w 0 17 036 m3 α 0 obtained by interpolating the experimental points z w provided experiment 7 of walder et al 2015 was excluded from the analysis as the dam had a layer of gravel and pebbles the remaining experiments can be divided into five groups based on the geometric characteristics i e z m and w c of the experimental dams table 6 table 6 also shows the values of g computed for each of the experimental groups assuming v e 0 07 m s given the previously demonstrated validity of this value all the values of g fall in the high sensitivity zone therefore these experimental dams fall in the group of dam reservoir systems for which the computed hydrograph is strongly influenced by the geometric schematization of the breach cross section thus the numerical reconstruction of these experimental hydrographs allows not only for an evaluation of the adequacy of the hydraulic assumptions of the model but also for the identification of the most suitable values of the breach shape parameters and at the same time of the calibration parameter even though the most suitable value of the latter was already identified in the previous section here it was decided to investigate again its optimal value in order to have a further confirmation 6 1 criteria adopted for the experimental hydrographs reconstruction the analysis was carried out considering the average experimental hydrograph for each group and assuming the time of peak t p as the reference instant t 0 first of all the model was applied considering the values of the parameters suggested by macchione 2008 and de lorenzo macchione 2014 as regards tan β the extreme values of the statistically observed variability range are 0 2 and 2 macchione 2008 in particular tan β 0 2 was suggested for small values of g as in the case of the experiments analyzed here since it provides the highest peak flow discharges and therefore leads to the most conservative solution however preliminary calculations have shown that the application of the model to the tests examined here using tan β 0 2 and v e 0 07 m s provides much higher flow discharges than the maximum recorded values therefore these two values have never been used simultaneously in the present analysis but were tested separately in other words setting this reference value for one of the two parameters the value of the other one was searched so as to obtain a peak discharge equal to the observed one then the simultaneous variability of the two parameters was considered searching for the couple v e tan β that would guarantee the best adaptation of the computed hydrograph to the experimental one what has been said so far has been carried out both for the case of triangular breach shape during the formation stage λ sin β and for the particular case of breach sides enlargement rate equal to breach bottom deepening rate i e λ 1 finally the variability of the λ parameter was also considered more in detail the analysis was carried out by considering the following optimization options 1 research of the v e value which gives computed peak flow discharge equal to the observed one keeping tan β 0 2 and λ sin β 2 research of the tan β value which gives computed peak flow discharge equal to the observed one keeping v e 0 07 m s and λ sin β 3 research of the optimal couple v e tan β keeping λ sin β both the parameters v e and tan β were optimized by setting for tan β values from 0 2 to 2 with steps of 0 1 and calculating for each of them the corresponding value of v e which gives computed peak flow discharge equal to the observed one then for each pair of parameters the average relative error on the discharge hydrograph was calculated as follows 14 error 1 n i 1 n q com i q obs i q obs i where n is the number of points of the experimental hydrographs in which the computed flow discharge q com or the observed flow discharge q obs are equal to at least 30 of the peak flow discharge the optimal couple v e tan β is the one that provides the minimum average relative error 4 research of the v e value which gives computed peak flow discharge equal to the observed one keeping tan β 0 2 and λ 1 5 research of the tan β value which gives computed peak flow discharge equal to the observed one keeping v e 0 07 m s and λ 1 6 research of the optimal couple v e tan β keeping λ 1 the optimization procedure is the same as that explained for option 3 7 research of the optimal triad v e tan β λ in addition to setting values for tan β values for the λ parameter were also set from sin β to 1 5 with steps of 0 1 and then by considering all possible combinations of tan β and λ the corresponding value of v e which gives computed peak flow discharge equal to the observed one was found the optimal solution is given by the triad of parameters which provides the minimum average relative error calculated through eq 14 for the calculation of the average error through eq 14 it was chosen to consider the flow discharges higher than 30 of the peak one since a model with technical purposes should correctly reproduce the highest discharges rather than the small discharges produced in the initial and final phases of the erosion process 6 2 values of the model parameters obtained through the experimental hydrographs reconstruction the results obtained are summarized in tables 7 9 which illustrate the values of the model parameters and the average relative errors on the hydrographs obtained for each option analyzed and for each experimental group table 7 for options 1 3 table 8 for options 4 6 and table 9 for option 7 tables 7 9 also show the average values weighted on the number of experiments in each group of the parameters and of the errors of each calibration option table 7 illustrates the results obtained keeping the constraint λ sin β options 1 3 among the options 1 3 it can be observed that option 3 obviously gives the best result since it allows for the calibration of both the other parameters tan β and v e precisely in order to minimize the average relative error however even the hydrographs calculated with constraint v e 0 07 m s option 2 gives a rather limited error in addition the weighted average of v e obtained with option 3 provides a value very close to 0 07 m s this means that the value proposed by macchione 2008 for the v e parameter continues to have a positive response with the experimental results on the other hand keeping the constraint tan β 0 2 option 1 the value of the parameter v e that gives a peak discharge equal to the experimental one has to be much lower than in the other solutions table 8 shows the results obtained keeping the constraint λ 1 options 4 6 it can be noted that for the options 4 6 the errors do not differ much from those related to options 1 3 that is assuming λ sin β compare tables 7 and 8 table 9 illustrates the results obtained considering also the variability of the λ parameter option 7 the optimal solution coincides precisely with that of option 3 λ sin β for experimental groups 1 2 and 3 and that of option 6 λ 1 for group 4 finally for group 5 the optimal solution is given by λ 0 7 in any case table 9 shows that on average tan β 1 15 and λ 0 801 note that the average value of λ obtained from the overall optimization option 7 does not differ much from the average of the sin β values therefore table 9 seems to suggest that the best performance of the model is provided by λ sin β fig 6 illustrates the average experimental hydrograph and the computed ones a the temporal evolution of y and z b as well as the relative errors and the respective average values c for experimental group 1 it can be noted that assuming λ 1 options 4 6 the breach bottom never reaches the dam base since the model always gives y 0 conversely assuming λ sin β options 1 3 y tends to 0 before the erosive process runs out moreover by observing the discharge hydrographs it can be noted that the model is not able to simulate well the initial part of the rising limb this is because the erosive process that occurs in the first phase is the most complex from a phenomenological point of view as much of the water infiltrates the dam body the adopted calculation model is not able to simulate the infiltration while it is aimed at calculating the flow discharges when the very first phase of the phenomenon is already exhausted nevertheless this initial phase produces very small flow discharges compared to the peak one therefore the charge of simulating this phase can be omitted in a model with technical purposes this justifies the choice of calculating the errors considering only the flow discharges equal to at least 30 of the peak that said all the computed discharge hydrographs seem to have a good overall adaptation to the corresponding experimental one 6 3 discussion on the adequacy of the hydraulic schematization and general indications the results obtained through the numerical reconstruction of the laboratory experiments conducted by walder et al 2015 showed that the adopted model allows for an adequate simulation not only of the peak discharge but also of the entire dam breach hydrograph the analysis of the experimental cases was performed by varying the two shape parameters tan β and λ and the erosion parameter v e in order to obtain computed peak discharge equal to the observed one as already mentioned assuming λ sin β leads to better results than assuming λ 1 given that the optimal solution v e tan β λ gives for λ values practically coinciding with sin β in most experimental cases see table 9 to get some indications on the plausible values of the other two parameters v e and tan β attention could be restricted to the experimental group number 1 in fact it includes the largest number of experiments which moreover have been carried out on experimental dams having rather realistic proportions in terms of w c z m ratio 0 43 unlike the dams of the other experiments from 1 03 to 4 07 see table 6 indeed note that the values of the w c z m ratios for the group of real dams reported in table 4 section 5 range between 0 13 and 1 37 with an average value of 0 44 and a standard deviation of 0 37 as regards the v e parameter the values computed for group 1 by following the optimization procedures 3 6 and 7 practically coincide with 0 07 m s see tables 7 9 therefore this analysis again confirms the validity of the value v e 0 07 m s originally proposed for the model adopted here macchione 2008 not only for the real dams as illustrated in section 5 but also for the experimental dams as illustrated in this section and previous applications of this model see for instance de lorenzo macchione 2011 as for the tan β shape parameter it is considered appropriate to discard the value 0 2 since the hydrographs calculated by imposing this constraint options 1 and 4 show the greatest errors among all the solutions analyzed still focusing on the results of group 1 it can be noted that among the remaining options 2 3 5 6 7 the value of tan β is always very close to 1 2 7 conclusions studying the key aspects related to the simplified physically based approach for modelling a dam breach event was the target of this work it was pointed out that four main aspects need to be carefully considered in the modelling for it to be physically based 1 the geometry of the breach cross section that in this study was assumed of triangular trapezoidal shape through the parameters tan β and λ 2 the characteristics of the water flow through the breach that can be considered in a critical state 3 the relation between the water flow and the breach sides erosion that in this study was modelled by expressing the solid discharge as a function of the mean shear stress through a calibration parameter v e 4 the morphology of the reservoir that can be introduced in the calculation through a reservoir storage water level curve of the power law type the problem of mutual influence between geometric and erosion parameters in simplified modelling was addressed through the dimensionless analysis carried out in section 4 which showed that there is a zone of the phenomenon in which the dam breach hydrograph is very little influenced by the breach shape scenario specifically this zone is defined by medium values of the dimensionless parameter g defined by eq 11 outside the low sensitivity ranges illustrated in table 1 the calculated outflow hydrograph is affected by the assumption on the breach shape parameters with variations in the peak discharge up to 85 for the lowest values of g and in any case higher than 20 in absolute value furthermore the dimensionless analysis demonstrated that the morphology of the reservoir plays an important role on the shape and peak of the outflow hydrograph therefore it must be taken into consideration by introducing a level volume curve into the calculation this dimensionless analysis of the phenomenon allowed for the identification of the real dam breach cases for which the computed outflow hydrograph is almost independent of the geometry of the breach see table 4 and fig 5 for this reason these historical cases of dam failure have been used for the calibration of the v e erosion parameter see section 5 with the awareness that the value resulting from the calibration was not influenced by the geometry of the breach assumed the results of the analysis confirmed the validity of the value originally proposed by macchione 2008 for the calibration parameter i e v e 0 07 m s for earthfill dams afterwards in order to assess the adequateness of the shape of the computed hydrograph reference was made to the experimental investigation carried out by walder et al 2015 indeed the selected experimental cases fall in the zone of high sensitivity of the computed hydrograph to the breach shape parameters i e low g values based on the result of the analysis λ sin β showed overall the best performance the ability of the simplified model adopted to reproduce the shape of observed hydrographs demonstrated the validity of the assumptions of critical state for the water flow through the breach and of shear stress based erosion law for the breach enlargement in conclusion the research results presented in this paper can be useful both for research purposes and for technical applications from a research point of view indications can be drawn to identify the geometric characteristics of the physical models of the dam reservoir systems to build in the laboratory depending on the aspects to be investigated from a technical point of view the results illustrated here provide criteria for knowing if a specific case study characterized by a certain value of the dimensionless parameter g requires or not the analysis of different breach shape scenarios for the purposes of the flood risk assessment of the valley areas credit authorship contribution statement

2037,the physical process of man made earthen dams breaching has many aspects that are still poorly understood and under investigation in this context dam breach simplified physically based models are very valuable as they provide quick and accurate solutions that have an application value although the phenomenon is not yet fully clarified at a theoretical level this work intends to evaluate the validity and the mutual interaction of the suggested assumptions regarding the following key aspects for a simplified modelling 1 the geometry of the breach cross section 2 the characteristics of the water flow through the breach 3 the breach erosion law 4 the morphology of the reservoir the main findings of this study in relation to the outlined key aspects are the following 1 the breach geometry assumed of triangular trapezoidal shape plays an important role in the computation of the outflow hydrograph but in this work a dimensionless analysis was performed from which it was found that there is a low sensitivity region identified by medium values of a dimensionless parameter which characterizes the dam reservoir system 2 the water flow through the breach can be considered in a critical state with convincing results in terms of numerical reconstruction of the entire discharge hydrographs 3 the breach erosion law can be related to the mean shear stress of the water flow by means of a parameter that needs to be calibrated in this regard the calibration has been performed choosing a number of historical cases falling in the low sensitivity region identified in point 1 so that the results of the calibration were not affected by the shape assumed for the breach 4 the morphology of the reservoir affects the evolution of the dam breaching process and therefore the shape of the calculated hydrograph thus it must be taken into consideration by introducing a level volume curve into the calculation keywords dam breach earthen dams dam failure flood risk assessment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the mapping of flood prone areas due to dam failures is particularly complex in the case of the breaching of earthen dams since the physical phenomenon consists of a progressive failure induced by the interaction between water and embankment the opening of the breach is an extremely complicated process right from the initial stage which can be different depending on the triggering cause of the failure and the characteristics of the dam body in the case of dam breaching induced by overtopping the first phase can be characterized by an irregular headcutting process in which a backward erosion takes place and the headcut migrates upstream see hanson et al 2005 wang bowles 2007 walder et al 2015 zhong et al 2019 the overtopping failure process of embankment or landslide dams characterized by a low compaction degree and non cohesive materials is different from the compacted or cohesive dams since in the first phase a progressive surface erosion takes place instead of the headcutting see zhang et al 2021 zhong et al 2021 on the other hand when the breaching is induced by piping the first phase is characterized by an internal seepage erosion process see zhang et al 2022 that produces an internal hole which enlarges until the part of the dam body above it collapses resulting in an open breach johnson illes 1976 chen et al 2019 these initial phases described up to now are followed by a further complicated development of the breach whose shape is variable in time and space and can also undergo sudden enlargements due to the collapse of portions of the breach sides morris hassan 2009 the physical mathematical description of all these aspects is a difficult undertaking given that some of these aspects are still not fully clarified at a theoretical level and anyway they require knowledge of several parameters that are difficult to determine however as it is known research in the field of engineering has the task of providing solutions that have an application value even in matters not yet fully clarified at a theoretical level for example for the purpose of assessing the safety conditions of the territories downstream of the dams zhou et al 2015 abdedou et al 2020 ge et al 2022 in this context there is a need for calculation models able to provide a realistic prediction of the outflow hydrograph from a breached dam necessary for the mapping of flood prone areas several models are available in the literature for the prediction of the outflow hydrograph from a breached dam they are usually classified depending on the degree of simplification used for the description of the breach enlargement process a recent state of the art review was presented by zhong et al 2021 who addressed different aspects regarding the breaching of both embankment and landslide dams i e documented failure cases laboratory and field experiments empirically and physically based models models that simulate the hydrograph like the emptying of a reservoir through a weir in which the bottom of the breach is lowered with a pre set linear or non linear downcutting rate are called parametric models e g fread harbaugh 1973 singh snorrason 1984 walder o connor 1997 a review of these methods is presented by wahl 2004 this kind of model needs some empirical equations to estimate the required parameters as a function of the geometric characteristics of the dam the hydraulic head into the reservoir or the stored volume of water for instance xu and zhang 2009 proposed regression equations to calculate breach parameters through a multiparameter non linear approach and wang et al 2020 formulated an empirical equation that relates the breach height to the water depth above the breach some of the empirical equations available in the literature provide estimates of the peak discharge due to dam breach e g pierce et al 2010 duricic et al 2013 de lorenzo macchione 2014 froehlich 2016 among the most recent works rong et al 2020 carried out a multifactor regression analysis finding regression equations that allow to calculate the peak outflow discharge the average breach width and height as functions of the water volume and depth above the breach bottom instead models that express the breach enlargement as a function of the characteristics of the water flow like shear stress or velocity are called physically based fread 1988 macchione 2008 many of them are based on the 2d shallow water equations and unsteady flow over an erodible bed froehlich 2002 wang bowles 2006 faeh 2007 cao et al 2011 su et al 2020 among the most recent works cao neilsen 2021 proposed a dam breach model based on the material point method to simulate soil and water interaction the detailed physically based models use the most accurate hydraulic description of the water flow through the breach and the erosion process however they use a complex mathematical formulation with a lot of physical parameters in the context of flood emergency management detailed modelling is not suitable while simplified physically based models are much more valuable they usually have a simpler approach because they adopt simple equations for breach erosion law and sometimes explicitly consider the sudden mass failures from breach sides mohamed et al 2002 or the headcut formation and migration see morris et al 2009 temple et al 2006 zhu et al 2006 wu 2013 zhong et al 2019 except for a few models that consider the suspended load transport from near clear water into the reservoir to turbid water downstream of the dam see visser 1998 wang et al 2006 wu 2013 most of the simplified models use equilibrium sediment transport formulas zhong et al 2021 in case of breaching induced by piping the simplified physically based models available in the literature consider that an initial pipe in the dam body enlarges with time due to the seepage erosion the difference between these model is the shape of the pipe cross section fread 1988 mohamed et al 2002 morris et al 2009 wu 2013 chen et al 2019 however as already mentioned after an initial phase in which the seepage erosion occurs the dam body collapses and the overtopping flow becomes dominant zhong et al 2021 for this reason the simulation of failures triggered by piping can also be performed by considering the formation of an initial surface breach due to the collapse of the dam body macchione 2008 this work intends to contribute to the definition of a reasonable schematization of the following key physical aspects to be included in the simplified physically based modelling aimed at a realistic prediction of the discharge hydrographs generated by the hypothetical failure of man made earthen dams 1 the geometry of the breach cross section 2 the characteristics of the water flow through the breach 3 the relation between the water flow through the breach and the breach erosion 4 the morphology of the reservoir in light of the above the following section is entirely dedicated to simplified models of which in addition to clarifying the key aspects and proposing reasonable assumptions the state of the art will be further explored afterwards a critical analysis of the key aspects outlined above will be carried out in particular the problem of their mutual interaction will be addressed and finally the validity of the assumptions made regarding the key aspects will be assessed 2 key aspects in simplified modelling of man made earthen dams breaching regarding the key aspects mentioned in the previous section that must be carefully considered in the simplified physically based modelling of man made earthen dams breaching this work is based on the following schematization proposed by macchione 2008 and macchione rino 2008 2 1 geometry of the breach cross section a pre assigned geometry of triangular trapezoidal shape is assumed for the breach cross section this assumption is supported by the observations of final breach shapes of real dam failures for which unfortunately there is no clear evidence of the shape assumed by the breach during its enlargement asce ewri 2011 observations of real cases johnson illes 1976 macdonald langridge monopolis 1984 macchione 2008 have shown that for failures due to overtopping an approximately triangular cut is created at a weak point on the crest of the embankment this breach deepens and widens until it reaches the base of the dam from this moment on the breach widens further until the reservoir is empty as regards the failures due to piping the same authors have highlighted that the internal erosion of the embankment causes a hole which widens until the part of the dam body above it collapses in this way an open breach is formed from this moment on the shape and development are similar to those described for overtopping this development mechanism is well documented in the teton dam piping failure case idaho usa see independent panel to review cause of teton dam failure 1976 experimental investigations such as that carried out by chinnarasri et al 2004 on embankment dams made by different combination of sandy and clayey materials have shown that the breach shape was initially rectangular and then oval triangular to trapezoidal as the breaching progresses coleman et al 2002 carried out experimental investigations on non cohesive homogeneous embankments subject to overtopping showing that the breach cross section has a parabolic shape during the erosion process some models also consider the parabolic shape see for instance peter et al 2018 or a semielliptical breach geometry walsh et al 2021 however pickert et al 2011 who carried out laboratory experiments on homogeneous non cohesive embankments subject to overtopping have observed that the shape of the breach during erosion cannot be categorized in none of the shapes typical of dam breaching therefore still today it is not possible to clearly establish which most likely best represents the breach during the enlargement process and in any case the triangular trapezoidal section is a good approximation of the parabolic one with the advantage of a simpler geometric schematization the trapezoidal shape was also adopted by wu 2013 2 2 characteristics of the water flow through the breach the simulation of the first phase of the erosion process the headcutting in the case of overtopping or the opening of a tunnel in the case of piping can be omitted in a simplified model aimed at calculating the discharge hydrograph outflowing from the breach since the flow discharges that outflow in this phase are relatively low the subsequent phase that is the breach enlargement is the most important process to be simulated since it produces the highest outflow discharges during this phase the water flow through the breach can be considered in a critical state at a certain control section this assumption originally proposed by macchione 1986 1989 2008 was also made by other authors walder and o connor 1997 begam et al 2018 peter et al 2018 zhou et al 2020 hung et al 2021 similarly based on the experimental findings of walder et al 2015 walsh et al 2021 adopted the breach crest as the control section with a froude number equal to 0 74 since the critical state takes place slightly downstream of the breach crest location 2 3 relation between the water flow through the breach and the breach erosion as mentioned above also for this aspect the phenomenon is very complex an artificial earthen dam is made up of loose materials that are artificially compacted sometime with zones characterized by different mechanical and hydraulic properties such as for example the central clay core and the other lateral zones with different values of cohesion grain size and porosity simulating the erosion mechanism through a hydraulic model over erodible bed which is already a complex operation in natural conditions would be even more difficult for this kind of artificial embankments furthermore as already mentioned the breach enlargement takes place not only due to the hydrodynamic action of the water flow but also due to sudden mass collapses from the breach sides also in this regard the objective of a simplified model is to adopt a simple erosion law which is nonetheless able to describe adequately the evolution of the outflows from the breach and hopefully the enlargement of the breach over time in macchione 2008 at each time step the breach enlargement is described with a mass conservation equation for the dam material assuming that the material carried by the flow is removed from the whole development of the breach sides and not just from the erodible wetted perimeter the model calculates the entire mass carried away by the flow as a function of the flow transport capacity in this way the model takes into account in a sort of time averaged way both the erosion due to the flow shear stress on the breach sides and the enlargement of the breach due to the partial collapse of portions of the breach sides falling inside of the breach de lorenzo macchione 2013 the volumetric sediment load per unit length of erodible wetted perimeter can be expressed as a function of the mean shear stress raised to 3 2 as in the meyer peter and mueller formula if neglecting the critical shear stress through a proportionality coefficient included into the calibration parameter of the model macchione 1986 1989 2008 it is noteworthy that with a single value of the calibration parameter this approach allowed to obtain excellent results for the simulation of 12 historical dam failure events with observed peak flows covering three orders of magnitude macchione 2008 further confirmations of the validity of the erosion law adopted for the model can be found in de lorenzo macchione 2011 for the simulations of the erosion of small laboratory dams the results appeared satisfactory also for the calculated final breach widths which are an index of the goodness of the approach to correctly simulate the breach enlargement process these results show that this synthetic approach has proved capable of realistically simulating the hydraulic process thus without the need for an explicit description of all the aspects involved such as partial collapse of portions of the breach side migration of the headcut etc therefore this approach on the one hand overcomes the overly simplified schematization based on the assumption of an arithmetic enlargement of the breach assigned a priori to a triangular or inverted trapezoid shaped breach parametric approach on the other hand it avoids the complications of a direct modelling of the collapses of the breach sides the shear stress based erosion law described above originally proposed by macchione 1986 1989 2008 has then been widely used in the literature both for the study of the erosion of embankment dams see e g wu 2013 and for landslide dams see e g chen et al 2015 for instance wu 2013 zhong et al 2018 and chen et al 2022 related the soil erosion rate to the difference between the effective shear stress and the critical value through a coefficient of erodibility estimated using empirical equations this approach is called linear erosion model but other types of models have been formulated such as power law hyperbolic or arctangent models which have one or more parameters e g chen et al 2015 wang et al 2022 other formulations were proposed for instance by peter et al 2018 who calculated the volumetric sediment load as a function of flow velocity and hydraulic radius and by hung et al 2021 who expressed the sediment transport rate by means of the discharge through the breach and the breach channel gradient however a common feature of these approaches is to relate the enlargement of the breach to the hydrodynamic characteristics of the water flow that is the main aspect in which the physically based nature of these models resides for a more complete examination of the erosion models used in the dam breach see zhong et al 2021 2 4 morphology of the reservoir the morphology of the reservoir can be easily and accurately taken into account by means of a storage water level curve of the power law type macchione 1986 1989 2008 it has been demonstrated that the morphology of the reservoir plays an important role on the shape and peak of the outflow hydrograph see also macchione rino 2008 de lorenzo macchione 2014 macchione de lorenzo et al 2016 this will be also demonstrated in this paper see sections 4 2 and 4 3 therefore it is recommended to take into account the morphology of the reservoir in future proposals for empirical formulas or dam breach models even simplified ones 3 numerical model 3 1 original model the simplified physically based model proposed by macchione 2008 was used in this study this numerical model is based on two differential equations which are solved numerically providing the entire discharge outflow hydrograph and also the time development of the breach cross section details about the equations can be found in the original papers macchione 2008 macchione rino 2008 the software for the application of the original numerical model is available in the appendix of macchione costabile et al 2016 interpolating the numerical results of the model easy to use equations have been provided that predict not only the peak discharge but the whole outflow hydrograph furthermore a formula has been proposed de lorenzo macchione 2014 which interpolates the peak outflows provided by the dimensionless numerical model this formula provided more accurate results than other literature formulas see the comparison carried out by wang et al 2018 this model showed satisfactory performance for the reconstruction of real cases see macchione 2008 macchione costabile et al 2016 and laboratory tests de lorenzo macchione 2011 moreover the model was included in the basement software a freeware simulation tool for hydro and morphodynamic modelling see vanzo et al 2021 for calculating the dam breach discharge hydrograph other authors have been inspired by this model for the analysis of the dam breach problem see for example singh 1996 peter et al 2018 the model is applicable to artificial earthen dams which are either homogeneous dams of cohesive material or zoned dams with an internal core of cohesive material and lateral zones of non cohesive material the geometric characteristics of the dam body corresponding to inputs of the model are the height z m the crest width w c and the average embankment slope s s u s d 2 where s u and s d are the upstream and downstream slopes respectively and indicate the horizontal vertical ratio see fig 1 a in the model a triangular breach is assumed during the formation stage fig 1 b that is until the breach bottom reaches the base of the dam then the breach is trapezoidal and only lateral erosion occurs fig 1 d during the enlargement of the breach the angle β between the breach sides and the vertical direction is assumed constant and tan β corresponds to a parameter of the model the emptying of the reservoir is described by a mass conservation equation applied to the volume w w t stored in the reservoir 1 dw dt q where q q t is the outflow discharge over time which is computed assuming critical flow at a certain control section of the breach h c is the critical water depth above the breach as shown in fig 1 b 1 c and 1 d the morphology of the reservoir is taken into account by introducing the storage water level curve 2 w z w 0 z α 0 the volume stored in the reservoir is a function of the water level z z t where w 0 and α 0 are two parameters that can be obtained by a stage storage table or by known values of the lake volume and lake area at a given stage macchione 1986 1989 2008 macchione de lorenzo et al 2016 the equations that describe the emptying of the reservoir are coupled with two equations for the breach enlargement process the deepening and the widening of the breach are functions of the unitary solid discharge which is computed as a function of the average shear stress exerted by the water flow the general equation for breach enlargement is macchione 2008 3 d a b dt c l q s where a b a b t is the area of the breach cross section c c t is the erodible wetted perimeter l l t is the average length of the breach in the direction of the flow and q s q s t is the solid discharge per unit width the breach enlargement can be described as a function of the level y y t of the breach bottom above the natural ground 4 dy dt d a b dy 1 c l q s where d a b d y c and l can be expressed as functions of z and y see macchione 2008 as already mentioned the solid discharge per unit width is computed as a function of the average bed shear stress τ τ t 5 q s k 0 τ 3 2 k 0 γ r s 3 2 where γ is the water specific weight r r t is the hydraulic radius of the flow control section s s t is the friction slope expressed through the strickler equation macchione 2008 and k 0 is a proportionality coefficient included in the calibration parameter v e the latter parameter has the dimension of a velocity and is a proportionality coefficient which appears in the equations that describe the breach enlargement that is 6 dy dt v e f y t z t z m s w c tan β where f is a function of y t z t z m s w c and tan β for the sake of brevity the complete expression of this function is not reported here but it can be found in the original paper macchione 2008 however it is worth recalling here that the parameter v e affects the breach enlargement rate as shown in eq 6 a value for this parameter has been obtained through calibration carried out for earthfill dams in particular for this kind of dams v e 0 07 m s has been obtained macchione 2008 the model is able to simulate both overtopping and piping induced dam failures in both cases the initial condition is given by a triangular breach whose bottom is at an initial height y t 0 slightly lower than the initial water level z t 0 in the reservoir 3 2 modified breach shape schematization for the purposes of this study a geometric variant was tested consisting in assuming the trapezoidal shape for the breach cross section already in the formation stage fig 1 c this assumption is supported by some experimental investigations for instance zhang et al 2009 carried out some tests on large experimental dams built with cohesive soils from which they observed that the breach in the first phase has the shape of an inverted trapezoid under this assumption eq 3 becomes 7 d a b dt a b y dy dt a b b db dt c l q s where b b t is the breach width at the base and db d t is the breach widening rate without a physically based criterion which could allow for the description of the actual distribution of the shear stress on the whole breach cross section and the contribution to the enlargement by the sudden block failures an assumption must be made for breach widening rate db d t in this stage for instance the rate of lateral breach enlargement was assumed equal to that of vertical erosion by xue et al 2021 and was considered to vary along the depth by wang et al 2022 here the widening rate has been assumed proportional to the deepening rate dy d t 8 db dt r dy dt the higher the proportionality coefficient r the greater the erosion on the breach sides at the expense of that on the bottom if r 0 the breach shape is triangular considering the infinitesimal enlargement taken normal to breach side d e n and that on the bottom dy the following breach shape parameter can be defined 9 λ d e n dy δ e n δ y the erosion is uniform on the whole breach if λ 1 so r can be expressed as a function of λ as follows 10 r 2 λ cos β tan β if λ is set to sin β that is the minimum value no breach bottom widening occurs and the shape of the breach remains triangular until the bottom reaches the base of the dam fig 1 b until now very little information is available for assigning a suitable value to λ in the present analysis the maximum value of λ used is 1 fig 1 c 3 3 dimensionless formulation a systematic analysis can be carried out using the non dimensional formulation of the adopted dam breach model in this formulation based on the approach proposed by macchione rino 2008 the dimensionless parameter g is given by 11 g v e w m g z m 7 2 where g is the acceleration due to gravity and w m is the volume of stored water when the water level in the reservoir is equal to z m fig 1 a it is useful to recall here that g can be expressed as the ratio between v e and v w macchione rino 2008 12 g v e v w the parameters v e and v w are multiplicative coefficients that affect the breach enlargement rate and the reservoir emptying rate respectively macchione rino 2008 hence low values of g are associated with fast draining reservoirs in these cases the formation stage is quite important because a large part of the impounded volume flows out while the bottom of the breach has still to reach the base of the dam for very low values of g the emptying of the reservoir may even be partial as the decrease rate in the water level is larger than the one of breach bottom and the erosion stops during the triangular phase thereby leaving a residual impounded volume on the other hand high values of g indicate a high erosion rate in comparison with the draining rate in these cases the emptying of the reservoir is always complete and the formation stage has usually a limited importance as it concerns only the early stage of the whole erosion process in the real world the range 10 2 g 104 has been found as typical for earthfill dams assuming v e 0 07 m s to perform a sensitivity analysis of the computed hydrograph to the breach shape depending on the dimensionless parameter g reference is made to the following dimensionless quantities z z z m y y z m h c h c z m w c w c z m b b z m t t v e z m q q g 1 2 z m 5 2 w w z m 3 where b b t is the average width of the breach 4 sensitivity analysis to breach shape depending on dimensionless parameter g in the following sections the sensitivity analysis was carried out assuming the worst hypothesis of failure for predictive purposes i e failure due to overtopping which is simulated by the model by setting z t 0 z m 4 1 influence of λ parameter in order to carry out a sensitivity analysis to λ parameter throughout several orders of magnitude of g the values g 0 2 2 20 200 were assumed the influence of the λ parameter on the computation of the outflow hydrograph was evaluated by comparing the results obtained assuming λ sin β triangular shape and λ 1 trapezoidal shape the values tan β 0 2 α 0 2 5 s 2 5 and w c 0 were assumed in the calculations fig 2 shows the temporal evolution of the dimensionless variables q z and y during the formation stage i e for y 0 for the assumed values of g for g 200 the outflow hydrographs given by λ sin β and λ 1 are almost the same although some differences can be seen in the very early stages also the water levels at the end of the formation stage are almost the same therefore the variation of the breach shape has a poor influence on the whole dam breach process for g 200 even though the height of the breach bottom decreases much faster for λ sin β the differences are slightly more evident for g 20 for λ 1 the formation stage takes a large part of the rising limb of the outflow hydrograph conversely the vertical erosion is much faster for λ sin β however the shape variation has still a poor influence on the peak discharge and the falling limb is almost the same in both cases in addition the decrease in water level is almost the same for both cases big differences arise for g 2 the peak discharge for λ 1 is much higher than the one obtained for λ sin β since the breach width grows faster and therefore a large amount of water is released however the decrease in bottom height is slower and consequently the discharge increases less quickly for λ 1 as soon as the breach bottom reaches the non erodible ground the erodible wetted perimeter suddenly decreases and as a result the outflow discharge stops increasing due to the reduced d a b d t rate as given by eq 3 and starts decreasing due to the same reason the last case considered is g 0 2 in this case the stored volume is not enough to complete erosion for λ 1 due to this relatively limited volume the drop in the water level is so fast that the dam cannot be eroded down to the base and the erosion process stops before the stored volume is completely released in this case the peak discharge is larger for λ sin β because assuming λ sin β the formation stage is fast enough to be completed the last two cases indicate that for low values of g the formation stage is very important and that the shape of the breach has a large influence on the outflow hydrograph in the following section the range of g values in which the geometry of the breach has little influence on the calculation will be investigated more in detail knowing this specific range of g values would be of great importance in the predictive phase in order to identify the real cases for which there is no need to pay particular attention to the value of the breach shape parameters furthermore the identification of this low sensitivity range would allow for the identification of the historical dam breach cases that can be used for the calibration of the erosion parameter without the calibration result being influenced by the breach shape assumed 4 2 influence of tan β parameter the influence of changes in breach geometry on the computed outflow hydrograph was also evaluated through a sensitivity analysis to tan β parameter the analysis was done by setting different values of tan β and evaluating the following quantities a dimensionless peak flow discharge q p b dimensionless water volume released up to the peak w p with respect to dimensionless total released volume of water w ratio indicative of the hydrograph shape c dimensionless total released volume of water w with respect to dimensionless initial impounded volume of water w m the values λ sin β α 0 1 2 3 4 s 2 5 and w c 0 were assumed in order to illustrate the results the minimum value of tan β was taken as reference and the relative difference of q p and w p w with respect to the reference configuration was plotted over the entire range of the possible values of g see fig 3 a and 3 b respectively in the region of high g values with the same g the peak flow discharge increases as tan β increases see fig 3 a after all if the range of variability of tan β is maintained between 0 2 and 1 5 the variability of q p is not so high in this region as it reaches at most increments of about 30 for very high g values g 104 conversely in the region of low g values the peak flow discharge decreases as tan β increases and the maximum variability of q p occurs between tan β 0 2 and tan β 1 however the variability of the peak flow discharge in this region is much higher than in the region of medium high g values fig 3 b show that for g 102 approximately the percentage of water volume released up to the peak is constant as tan β varies since the relative difference of the w p w ratio with respect to the reference configuration converges to zero moreover for an assigned value of g 0 5 approximately and for tan β ranging from 0 5 to 2 the percentage of water volume released up to the peak is greater the smaller the value of tan β finally fig 3 c illustrate the w w m ratio as a function of g for each assumed value of tan β it can be observed that for values of g 1 the reservoir can only partially emptied if tan β 0 2 is chosen in particular the w w m ratio gets smaller as tan β increases in addition the smaller the value of α 0 the greater this effect is note that the emptying ratio can go down to about 20 if α 0 1 and tan β 2 is chosen on the other hand if α 0 4 a minimum emptying ratio of about 65 is given by tan β 2 the dependence on the α 0 value is a confirmation of the influence of the morphological characteristics of the reservoir on the computation of the outflow hydrograph macchione rino 2008 macchione de lorenzo et al 2016 4 3 classification of dam reservoir systems based on the influence of breach geometry from the sensitivity analysis carried out in sections 4 1 and 4 2 it can be concluded that the dam reservoir systems can be divided in three zones based mainly on the value of the dimensionless parameter g there is a central zone given by medium values of g in which the characteristics of the outflow hydrograph and in particular the peak discharge can be considered almost independent of the breach shape parameters below this zone i e for low values of g the computed outflow hydrograph is strongly influenced by the geometric schematization of the breach cross section with variations in peak discharge up to about 85 in absolute value for g 10 2 the last zone includes the dam reservoir systems characterized by high values of g for which the assumed breach shape parameters have a certain influence on the hydrograph computation but the sensitivity is not comparable to that of the previous zone low g values since the maximum variation in peak discharge is about 30 for g 104 and in addition the influence is exerted only on the peak discharge in this g region to identify the range of values of g that defines the central zone a maximum variation of 20 between the peak discharges given by tan β 0 2 and tan β 1 5 was assumed the attention was focused on q p to define the g zones as the peak discharge is more sensitive to the shape parameter than the other indicators considered as illustrated in fig 3 since the hydrograph computation is also influenced by the parameter α 0 a certain interval was identified for each value of α 0 considered in the previous section table 1 illustrates the low sensitivity range of g for each value of α 0 considered the low sensitivity g regions thus identified are obviously valid for the combination of values assumed for the other involved parameters λ s and w c however for the purposes of this study these ranges can be taken as an indicative reference 4 4 example of technical application to specific case studies as an example of technical application of the results obtained in the previous sub sections two real dam reservoir systems were selected one falling within the low sensitivity ranges illustrated in table 1 and one outside them the selected case studies are the nocelle and castagnara dams both located in the calabria region italy the geometric and topographical characteristics of these real dam reservoir systems are shown in table 2 also the values of the dimensionless parameter g calculated assuming v e 0 07 m s are illustrated in table 2 it can be noted that the nocelle dam reservoir system falls within the low sensitivity range of g while the castagnara case study is characterized by a very low g value thus a strong influence of the breach shape scenario on the calculated outflow hydrograph is expected for the castagnara dam in order to demonstrate this four different breach shape scenarios given by the possible combinations of the values tan β 0 2 1 5 and λ sin β 1 were considered and the respective dam breach hydrographs were calculated fig 4 shows the computed outflow hydrographs for the selected dams calculated assuming the value v e 0 07 m s according to the breach shape scenarios taking the time of peak as the reference instant to create the plots as it can be observed the hypothetical outflow hydrographs calculated for the nocelle dam have only small differences while the ones associated with the hypothetical breaching of the castagnara dam are very different each other table 3 shows the values of the peak flow discharge q p the released water volume w the released water volume up to the peak w p and the w p w ratio furthermore scenario 1 was taken as reference to calculate the relative difference of q p and w p w given by the other scenarios confirming the results of the dimensionless analysis carried out in the previous sub sections the variations in the peak discharge with respect to the reference scenario remain below 20 with a maximum of 13 for the nocelle dam characterized by g 32 5 while they even reach 83 in absolute value in the case of the castagnara dam characterized by g 0 11 furthermore it should be noted that the other indicators regarding the released volumes also confirm the results of the sensitivity analysis carried out in section 4 2 5 calibration of v e through historical cases with low sensitivity to breach shape the modelling approach adopted here undergoes the combined influence of the assumptions regarding both the geometry of the breach cross section and the calibration parameter included in the enlargement law of the breach in particular the choice of the breach shape scenario may affect the numerical value of v e unless for the calibration of v e an analysis is carried out in a zone of the phenomenon in which the influence of breach geometry is low about this the dimensionless analysis carried out in the previous section was able to identify the morphological characteristics collected in the dimensionless parameter g of the dam reservoir systems for which the geometry of the breach cross section does not influence much the extent of the peak discharge and the shape of the outflow hydrograph these results provide a criterion for the selection of historical cases which could be numerically reconstructed without a significant influence of the assumed breach geometry on the calculations based on the results obtained the criterion is therefore to choose historical dam breach cases characterized by values of g that fall within the ranges illustrated in table 1 thus through the analysis of this kind of dam reservoir systems it is possible to investigate exclusively the value of the parameter v e that governs the enlargement rate of the breach cross section in light of the above a small subset of the failure events concerning earthfill dams available in the literature has been selected the dams in the database are both homogeneous and zoned and not endowed of masonry walls and similar rigid structures table 4 shows the geometric characteristics of the selected dam reservoir systems as well as the initial conditions of the corresponding failure events where z 0 is the initial water level with respect to the dam base taken from the database compiled by wahl 1998 and y 0 is the initial height of the breach bottom with respect to the dam base assumed equal to 0 8 z 0 macchione 2008 most of the dams considered were subject to piping failure failure mode p while only two were breached due to overtopping failure mode o all these failure events have been already used for the calibration of the model by macchione 2008 afterwards an accurate search has been carried out to further improve the data concerning each record of the database de lorenzo macchione 2014 in particular for some failure events it was possible to retrieve data about the reservoir depth volume curve and about the dam dimensions however for some cases average values were assumed for the remaining still unknown geometric parameters as for the α 0 coefficient the average value of 2 5 was assumed based on the study carried out by macchione de lorenzo et al 2016 who analyzed 97 reservoirs and found that the average values of α 0 fall between 2 and 3 in addition table 4 shows the estimated peak discharge q p o b s and the observed final breach width b avg o b s for the preliminary calculation of g the constant value of 0 07 m s was assumed for v e see table 4 as it can be seen the value of g falls within the ranges illustrated in table 1 for all the selected cases therefore they fall in the zone of dam reservoir systems for which the breach geometry does not influence much the calculation of the peak discharge however it should be considered that most of the selected cases concern piping failure in these cases the reservoir was not completely full at the beginning of the failure event furthermore some dams have crest width that is a significant rate of the height by contrast the graphs of fig 3 were created assuming overtopping failure and a null crest width these differences can cause a discrepancy between the predicted sensitivity to the shape parameters and the effective one specifically for the dam reservoir systems whose g value is close to the threshold values between the three zones mentioned in the previous section although the historical cases selected fall into the g region of low sensitivity to the assumed breach shape for the avoidance of doubt the analysis was carried out considering different breach shape scenarios given by tan β 0 2 1 and λ sin β 1 the value of v e that gives computed peak discharge q p c o m equal to the observed one q p o b s has been identified for each scenario and for each failure event selected next for each breach shape scenario the average value of the calibration parameter v e a v g has been calculated and then used to simulate the same failure events finally the performance of each scenario has been assessed through the errors on both the peak discharge q p and the average breach width b avg the errors were computed as 13 e x x com x obs x obs in addition the average m e x and the standard deviation s e x of the errors as well as the average of the absolute values of the errors m e x have been estimated the results are shown in table 5 assuming tan β 0 2 and λ sin β 0 196 the average of the v e values computed by calibration is 0 0697 m s first row of table 5 shows the m e x m e x and s e x values obtained regarding peak discharge and average breach width using v e a v g 0 0697 m s with a higher value for λ λ 1 the breach becomes trapezoidal soon after the start and the average value of v e becomes slightly smaller assuming tan β 1 it can be noted that both with λ sin β 0 707 and λ 1 the m e x m e x and s e x values on both the peak flow discharge and the average breach width do not vary much as λ varies it can be noted that for all the breach shape scenarios considered here the mean of the average values of the calibration parameter is 0 069 m s 0 07 m s therefore this analysis confirmed the validity of the v e value proposed by macchione 2008 fig 5 illustrates the outflow hydrographs calculated for the selected dams considering all the analyzed breach shape scenarios and using the value v e 0 07 m s the time of peak was taken as the reference instant to create the plots it can be seen that the peak flow discharges corresponding to the different breach shape scenarios are almost the same except for the cases of apishapa a and fred burr c for which the difference is more evident in fact among the selected cases these latter dams are characterized by the values of g closest to the extreme values of table 1 which are not so strict due to the reasons outlined above furthermore in fig 5 the horizontal dotted lines represent the observed peak discharge 6 adequacy assessment of the hydraulic schematization through experimental hydrographs reconstruction the sensitivity analysis performed in section 4 highlighted the influence of the breach geometry not only on the peak discharge but also on the shape of the outflow hydrograph depending on the geometric and topographical characteristics of the dam reservoir system indeed the shape of the outflow hydrograph is obviously strictly influenced by the spatio temporal development of the breach which in turn depends on the water flow through it therefore if a calculation model is able to reproduce the shape of an observed hydrograph it follows that it is based on adequate hydraulic assumptions hence it would be necessary to validate the dam breach model not only with reference to the peak flows but also to the entire outflow hydrograph unfortunately there are no records of hydrographs resulting from breaching of real dams on the other hand there is an accurate and extensive laboratory investigation performed by walder et al 2015 on experimental dams for which the discharge hydrographs recorded during the experiments are available walder et al 2015 performed 13 experiments on overtopping failure of homogeneous dams at the usgs united states geological survey the flume in which the dams were built is rectangular in shape and has a width of 2 m and an average slope of 2 4 all the dams were built at the same location with a toe to toe distance of 3 5 m and with an embankment slope of 30 for both the upstream and downstream sides therefore the lower the height of the dam z m the greater the crest width w c due to the 2 4 slope of the basal surface the downstream height of the dam h d exceeds the upstream height h u of 0 15 m the latter was considered as the reference one z m h u because below the upstream toe of the dam the reservoir no longer contributes to the release of water volume as it is already emptied moreover the reservoir level volume curve was expressed as a power law eq 2 with coefficients α 0 1 6089 and w 0 17 036 m3 α 0 obtained by interpolating the experimental points z w provided experiment 7 of walder et al 2015 was excluded from the analysis as the dam had a layer of gravel and pebbles the remaining experiments can be divided into five groups based on the geometric characteristics i e z m and w c of the experimental dams table 6 table 6 also shows the values of g computed for each of the experimental groups assuming v e 0 07 m s given the previously demonstrated validity of this value all the values of g fall in the high sensitivity zone therefore these experimental dams fall in the group of dam reservoir systems for which the computed hydrograph is strongly influenced by the geometric schematization of the breach cross section thus the numerical reconstruction of these experimental hydrographs allows not only for an evaluation of the adequacy of the hydraulic assumptions of the model but also for the identification of the most suitable values of the breach shape parameters and at the same time of the calibration parameter even though the most suitable value of the latter was already identified in the previous section here it was decided to investigate again its optimal value in order to have a further confirmation 6 1 criteria adopted for the experimental hydrographs reconstruction the analysis was carried out considering the average experimental hydrograph for each group and assuming the time of peak t p as the reference instant t 0 first of all the model was applied considering the values of the parameters suggested by macchione 2008 and de lorenzo macchione 2014 as regards tan β the extreme values of the statistically observed variability range are 0 2 and 2 macchione 2008 in particular tan β 0 2 was suggested for small values of g as in the case of the experiments analyzed here since it provides the highest peak flow discharges and therefore leads to the most conservative solution however preliminary calculations have shown that the application of the model to the tests examined here using tan β 0 2 and v e 0 07 m s provides much higher flow discharges than the maximum recorded values therefore these two values have never been used simultaneously in the present analysis but were tested separately in other words setting this reference value for one of the two parameters the value of the other one was searched so as to obtain a peak discharge equal to the observed one then the simultaneous variability of the two parameters was considered searching for the couple v e tan β that would guarantee the best adaptation of the computed hydrograph to the experimental one what has been said so far has been carried out both for the case of triangular breach shape during the formation stage λ sin β and for the particular case of breach sides enlargement rate equal to breach bottom deepening rate i e λ 1 finally the variability of the λ parameter was also considered more in detail the analysis was carried out by considering the following optimization options 1 research of the v e value which gives computed peak flow discharge equal to the observed one keeping tan β 0 2 and λ sin β 2 research of the tan β value which gives computed peak flow discharge equal to the observed one keeping v e 0 07 m s and λ sin β 3 research of the optimal couple v e tan β keeping λ sin β both the parameters v e and tan β were optimized by setting for tan β values from 0 2 to 2 with steps of 0 1 and calculating for each of them the corresponding value of v e which gives computed peak flow discharge equal to the observed one then for each pair of parameters the average relative error on the discharge hydrograph was calculated as follows 14 error 1 n i 1 n q com i q obs i q obs i where n is the number of points of the experimental hydrographs in which the computed flow discharge q com or the observed flow discharge q obs are equal to at least 30 of the peak flow discharge the optimal couple v e tan β is the one that provides the minimum average relative error 4 research of the v e value which gives computed peak flow discharge equal to the observed one keeping tan β 0 2 and λ 1 5 research of the tan β value which gives computed peak flow discharge equal to the observed one keeping v e 0 07 m s and λ 1 6 research of the optimal couple v e tan β keeping λ 1 the optimization procedure is the same as that explained for option 3 7 research of the optimal triad v e tan β λ in addition to setting values for tan β values for the λ parameter were also set from sin β to 1 5 with steps of 0 1 and then by considering all possible combinations of tan β and λ the corresponding value of v e which gives computed peak flow discharge equal to the observed one was found the optimal solution is given by the triad of parameters which provides the minimum average relative error calculated through eq 14 for the calculation of the average error through eq 14 it was chosen to consider the flow discharges higher than 30 of the peak one since a model with technical purposes should correctly reproduce the highest discharges rather than the small discharges produced in the initial and final phases of the erosion process 6 2 values of the model parameters obtained through the experimental hydrographs reconstruction the results obtained are summarized in tables 7 9 which illustrate the values of the model parameters and the average relative errors on the hydrographs obtained for each option analyzed and for each experimental group table 7 for options 1 3 table 8 for options 4 6 and table 9 for option 7 tables 7 9 also show the average values weighted on the number of experiments in each group of the parameters and of the errors of each calibration option table 7 illustrates the results obtained keeping the constraint λ sin β options 1 3 among the options 1 3 it can be observed that option 3 obviously gives the best result since it allows for the calibration of both the other parameters tan β and v e precisely in order to minimize the average relative error however even the hydrographs calculated with constraint v e 0 07 m s option 2 gives a rather limited error in addition the weighted average of v e obtained with option 3 provides a value very close to 0 07 m s this means that the value proposed by macchione 2008 for the v e parameter continues to have a positive response with the experimental results on the other hand keeping the constraint tan β 0 2 option 1 the value of the parameter v e that gives a peak discharge equal to the experimental one has to be much lower than in the other solutions table 8 shows the results obtained keeping the constraint λ 1 options 4 6 it can be noted that for the options 4 6 the errors do not differ much from those related to options 1 3 that is assuming λ sin β compare tables 7 and 8 table 9 illustrates the results obtained considering also the variability of the λ parameter option 7 the optimal solution coincides precisely with that of option 3 λ sin β for experimental groups 1 2 and 3 and that of option 6 λ 1 for group 4 finally for group 5 the optimal solution is given by λ 0 7 in any case table 9 shows that on average tan β 1 15 and λ 0 801 note that the average value of λ obtained from the overall optimization option 7 does not differ much from the average of the sin β values therefore table 9 seems to suggest that the best performance of the model is provided by λ sin β fig 6 illustrates the average experimental hydrograph and the computed ones a the temporal evolution of y and z b as well as the relative errors and the respective average values c for experimental group 1 it can be noted that assuming λ 1 options 4 6 the breach bottom never reaches the dam base since the model always gives y 0 conversely assuming λ sin β options 1 3 y tends to 0 before the erosive process runs out moreover by observing the discharge hydrographs it can be noted that the model is not able to simulate well the initial part of the rising limb this is because the erosive process that occurs in the first phase is the most complex from a phenomenological point of view as much of the water infiltrates the dam body the adopted calculation model is not able to simulate the infiltration while it is aimed at calculating the flow discharges when the very first phase of the phenomenon is already exhausted nevertheless this initial phase produces very small flow discharges compared to the peak one therefore the charge of simulating this phase can be omitted in a model with technical purposes this justifies the choice of calculating the errors considering only the flow discharges equal to at least 30 of the peak that said all the computed discharge hydrographs seem to have a good overall adaptation to the corresponding experimental one 6 3 discussion on the adequacy of the hydraulic schematization and general indications the results obtained through the numerical reconstruction of the laboratory experiments conducted by walder et al 2015 showed that the adopted model allows for an adequate simulation not only of the peak discharge but also of the entire dam breach hydrograph the analysis of the experimental cases was performed by varying the two shape parameters tan β and λ and the erosion parameter v e in order to obtain computed peak discharge equal to the observed one as already mentioned assuming λ sin β leads to better results than assuming λ 1 given that the optimal solution v e tan β λ gives for λ values practically coinciding with sin β in most experimental cases see table 9 to get some indications on the plausible values of the other two parameters v e and tan β attention could be restricted to the experimental group number 1 in fact it includes the largest number of experiments which moreover have been carried out on experimental dams having rather realistic proportions in terms of w c z m ratio 0 43 unlike the dams of the other experiments from 1 03 to 4 07 see table 6 indeed note that the values of the w c z m ratios for the group of real dams reported in table 4 section 5 range between 0 13 and 1 37 with an average value of 0 44 and a standard deviation of 0 37 as regards the v e parameter the values computed for group 1 by following the optimization procedures 3 6 and 7 practically coincide with 0 07 m s see tables 7 9 therefore this analysis again confirms the validity of the value v e 0 07 m s originally proposed for the model adopted here macchione 2008 not only for the real dams as illustrated in section 5 but also for the experimental dams as illustrated in this section and previous applications of this model see for instance de lorenzo macchione 2011 as for the tan β shape parameter it is considered appropriate to discard the value 0 2 since the hydrographs calculated by imposing this constraint options 1 and 4 show the greatest errors among all the solutions analyzed still focusing on the results of group 1 it can be noted that among the remaining options 2 3 5 6 7 the value of tan β is always very close to 1 2 7 conclusions studying the key aspects related to the simplified physically based approach for modelling a dam breach event was the target of this work it was pointed out that four main aspects need to be carefully considered in the modelling for it to be physically based 1 the geometry of the breach cross section that in this study was assumed of triangular trapezoidal shape through the parameters tan β and λ 2 the characteristics of the water flow through the breach that can be considered in a critical state 3 the relation between the water flow and the breach sides erosion that in this study was modelled by expressing the solid discharge as a function of the mean shear stress through a calibration parameter v e 4 the morphology of the reservoir that can be introduced in the calculation through a reservoir storage water level curve of the power law type the problem of mutual influence between geometric and erosion parameters in simplified modelling was addressed through the dimensionless analysis carried out in section 4 which showed that there is a zone of the phenomenon in which the dam breach hydrograph is very little influenced by the breach shape scenario specifically this zone is defined by medium values of the dimensionless parameter g defined by eq 11 outside the low sensitivity ranges illustrated in table 1 the calculated outflow hydrograph is affected by the assumption on the breach shape parameters with variations in the peak discharge up to 85 for the lowest values of g and in any case higher than 20 in absolute value furthermore the dimensionless analysis demonstrated that the morphology of the reservoir plays an important role on the shape and peak of the outflow hydrograph therefore it must be taken into consideration by introducing a level volume curve into the calculation this dimensionless analysis of the phenomenon allowed for the identification of the real dam breach cases for which the computed outflow hydrograph is almost independent of the geometry of the breach see table 4 and fig 5 for this reason these historical cases of dam failure have been used for the calibration of the v e erosion parameter see section 5 with the awareness that the value resulting from the calibration was not influenced by the geometry of the breach assumed the results of the analysis confirmed the validity of the value originally proposed by macchione 2008 for the calibration parameter i e v e 0 07 m s for earthfill dams afterwards in order to assess the adequateness of the shape of the computed hydrograph reference was made to the experimental investigation carried out by walder et al 2015 indeed the selected experimental cases fall in the zone of high sensitivity of the computed hydrograph to the breach shape parameters i e low g values based on the result of the analysis λ sin β showed overall the best performance the ability of the simplified model adopted to reproduce the shape of observed hydrographs demonstrated the validity of the assumptions of critical state for the water flow through the breach and of shear stress based erosion law for the breach enlargement in conclusion the research results presented in this paper can be useful both for research purposes and for

2038,quantifying the relationship between flood control and hydropower generation in reservoir operation optimization is challenged by both institutional barriers and ill posedness different stakeholders fit within hierarchical institutional structures and parameter equifinality may exist compared to the assumption of centralized decision making and only one optimal solution used in previous studies this paper investigated the effects of ill posedness on the competitive cooperative relationship between flood control and hydropower generation within a hierarchical gaming process based on the ill posed bilevel programming model for the three gorges reservoir pre impoundment problem this study revealed that the ranges of potential flood risk and hydropower generation i e competition space between two objectives could be narrowed with the increased minimum of hydropower generation and increased minimal occupancy rate of flood control storage importantly different from the as one falls another rises relationship implied by pareto front solutions cooperation of the water conservation department with the flood control department namely selecting a refill rule curve in favor of flood safety could reduce the flood control risk without sacrificing power generation benefits furthermore a higher cooperation degree would decrease the efficiency loss related to hydropower generation without changing potential flood risk keywords reservoir optimization operation reservoir pre impoundment problem ill posed bilevel programming cooperation potential institutional gap data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction a primary goal of operating multi purpose reservoirs is to maximize water conservation benefits while maintaining flood control security to achieve carbon neutrality the potential role of hydropower has been highlighted for balancing the instability of other renewable energy such as wind and photovoltaic power ming et al 2018 therefore coordinating the competitive relationship between flood control and hydropower generation is essential for reservoir optimization operation as well as water energy nexus competition between flood control and hydropower generation could be widely observed from real reservoir operations resulting in inefficient loss of water and hydropower for example the sichuan province in southwest china suffered more than 10 billion kwh loss of hydropower generation from pre releasing water from reservoirs to alleviate flood risk during the flood seasons in 2013 nea 2015 the competitive relationship between flood control and hydropower generation has been widely investigated in literature particularly for reservoir impoundment operations precautionary releases from reservoirs in response to the high possibility of large future floods could lead to hydropower shortage because of insufficient subsequent inflows for meeting water conservation demands it is especially the case when climate change and direct human activities have induced significant changes of seasonal streamflow xin et al 2019 conversely setting higher flood limited water levels flwls and pre filling the reservoir would provide relatively large storage for hydropower generation during the non flood season but increase flood risk during impoundment in the near future generally most previous studies used the so called multi objective programming mop method to quantify the competition relationship between flood risk and hydropower generation in pre impoundment he et al 2022 li et al 2014 liu et al 2017 or during the dry season wu et al 2021 with non inferior solution points in the pareto optimal set such a competitive relationship has also been termed a trade off relationship between flood control security and water conservation benefits the mop modeling framework presumes a centralized decision making structure i e only one decision maker with the assumption of perfect coordination and complete information exchange among different stakeholders can determine the operation rules for multiple purpose reservoir operation however multiple departments or sectors are usually involved in the decision making process for the multi purpose operation rule determination since the decision for achieving one purpose is often made by one corresponding department multiple purposes could be classified into flood control and water conservation purposes and the decisions for achieving these two objectives are usually made by separate departments in most countries such as china csc 2018 mwr 2012 a hierarchical decision making framework has widely been applied to set different decision priorities for flood control and water conservation within this framework flood control security is prescribed with the highest priority and the water conservation department must be subordinated to the flood control department for reservoir impoundment the water conservation department would determine the plans for refilling and hydropower generation according to the flwls given by the flood control department centralized decision making models such as mop have difficulties providing practical solutions for the multiple decision makers with a hierarchical managerial structure due to the asymmetrical decision making priorities incompleteness of information exchange and competition or cooperation relationship among different departments therefore a deviation between actual reservoir operation performance and the optimal performance indicated by pareto solutions can be derived safari et al 2014 shafiee jood et al 2018 xu et al 2016 and such deviation has been defined as the loss of optimality in the decision process of a stackelberg game shafiee jood et al 2018 the so called stackelberg game first developed by von stackelberg in economics scherer 1996 has been introduced to specify the hierarchical competition relationship as a special type of stackelberg game bilevel programming with only one leader and one follower has been used for water allocation darbandsari et al 2020 hu et al 2016 liu et al 2017 water energy environment conflict cheng et al 2016 moazeni et al 2020 zhang and vesselinov 2016 and inter basin reservoirs coordination operation problems guo et al 2012 li et al 2021 qin et al 2020 zhu et al 2017 particularly only one numerical analysis of the hierarchical decision structure between flood control and hydropower generation has been conducted for reservoir impoundment cases wang et al 2020a wang et al 2020b by optimizing the flwls and refill rule curve with a bilevel programming model the index of institutional gap ig was defined and used to explain the optimality loss resulting from the hierarchical competition hadamard first defined a well posed problem that satisfies three conditions the existence uniqueness and stability of solutions hadamard 1923 on the contrary if one of the three conditions is not satisfied it is termed an ill posed problem the ill posed characteristic of reservoir optimization operation problems mainly comes from two aspects one is the instability caused by disturbing factors such as uncertainty of runoff or climate change the other is the characteristic of the multiple optimal solutions due to non linearity non convexness or non smoothness of the objective functions or constraints horne et al 2016 rani and moreira 2010 singh 2012 zeng et al 2021 which has been proved in hydropower generation operation liu et al 2012 liu et al 2011a liu et al 2011b such non uniqueness of the optimal solution can be related to the parameter equifinality problem in hydrological modeling beven 2006 kelleher et al 2017 schmidt et al 2020 schumacher et al 2018 the discussion on the ill posed issue in reservoir optimization operation models focuses on the effects on the centralized decision making process for the hierarchical decision making process of reservoir impoundment for example given the flwls set by the flood control department the water conservation department could choose multiple refilling plans for maximizing hydropower generation meantime equivalent refilling plans may lead to different levels of flood risk for example a slow in the beginning speeding up later strategy could alleviate flood risk compared to a fast in the beginning slowing down later strategy when facing a high likelihood of large floods in the post flood season under this condition the water conservation department could decide whether to choose a refill plan that is favorable for flood control hence multi purpose reservoir operation is not merely a trade off problem but could also involve cooperation between flood control and hydropower generation the cooperation potential can be defined to quantify the extent of decreasing flood control risk while maintaining the same quantity of hydropower generation such a relationship differs from the commonly used as one falls another rises relationship implied by pareto solutions according to our knowledge this paper might be the first to investigate the effects of ill posedness on the cooperative relationship between flood control and hydropower generation within a hierarchical modeling framework the main goal of this study is to 1 provide a modeling framework to derive the competitive cooperative relationship between flood control and water conservation departments 2 quantify the gap between the competitive relationship specified by the conventional models and the actual gaming process with the ill posed characteristic and 3 explore the cooperation potential between flood control and hydropower generation the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 proposes an evaluation framework of the cooperation potential between flood control and hydropower generation based on ill posed bilevel programming modeling for reservoir impoundment operation in terms of the extended index of ig section 3 employs the reservoir pre impoundment problem of the three gorges reservoir tgr as a case study section 4 analyzes the results and discusses how hierarchical gaming with the characteristic of non unique optimal solutions would influence the competition space and cooperation potential between flood control and hydropower generation conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 evaluation framework of cooperation potential in rpp for reservoir pre impoundment problems rpp the timing of reservoir refilling and the progress of impoundment need to be specified to balance flood risk and water conservation benefits e g hydropower production given the flood control rules determined by the upper level flood control department the water conservation department might explore multiple refill rule curves to achieve the same hydropower production this leads to a specific cooperation competition relationship between reservoir flood control and hydropower generation within the hierarchical gaming framework the preference for cooperation by the water conservation department e g by selecting a refill rule curve in favor of flood control security determines the achievement of the upper level objective as well as the overall performance of reservoir operation this paper proposes a framework to evaluate the cooperation potential between flood control and hydropower generation fig 1 it is based on the quantitative analysis of the difference in flood control risk which is solved by ill posed bilevel programming models iblp models for rpp with different cooperation degrees first the upper and lower boundaries of the cooperation space are determined by the optimistic and pessimistic iblp model solutions for rpp optimistic and pessimistic iblp model solutions could be specified when the refill rule curve chosen by the water conservation department is wholly beneficial or non beneficial for the flood control objective respectively the deviation of the flood control objective between the optimistic and pessimistic iblp models is defined as the extent of the cooperation potential since the boundedness of the deviation between optimistic and pessimistic objective values has been proved by loridan and morgan 1996 and molodtsov 1976 the boundary of the cooperation space is known to exist second the partial cooperation iblp model solutions for rpp implies how reservoir operation rule setting and the objective values vary under different cooperation degrees between the water conservation and the flood control department 2 2 ill posed bilevel programming model for rpp in bilevel programming if there is only one optimal solution of the lower level model for any given decision of the upper level model then the problem is termed a well posed bilevel programming problem if the optimal solution set of the lower level is a non single point set to at least one upper level decision then the problem is an ill posed bilevel programming problem kochetov et al 2016 zemkoho 2016 a general ill posed bilevel programming problem can be formulated as follows 1 min x f x y s t x x g x 0 y ψ x ψ x is the solution set of the lower level min y f x y s t g x y 0 where x r n and y r m are decision variables of the upper and lower levels respectively f and f are objective functions of the upper and lower levels respectively g and g are constraints of the upper and lower levels respectively basic definitions of a general bilevel programming model bard 2010 also apply to ill posed bilevel programming the optimal solution of the problem is restricted to the inducible region or feasible region which consists of the intersection of the constraints domain and rational reaction set of the lower level to the decision given by the upper level please refer to our previous work for detailed definitions of the feasible region constraint domain and rational reaction set of the lower level wang et al 2020a wang et al 2020b in the rpp a bilevel programming model is developed to simulate the hierarchical decision structure between the flood control and water conservation department with conflicting objectives for reservoirs serving both flood control and water conservation purposes the department responsible for flood control is typically set as the leader i e super ordinate decision maker at the upper level due to the high importance of dam safety and downstream security in contrast the department seeking water conservation benefits such as a hydroelectric company is defined as the follower i e sub ordinate decision maker at the lower level correspondingly the flood control department would determine the flood control rules including the controlled water levels and the corresponding water discharge to reduce the flood risk with the consideration of the reaction of the water conservation department the water conservation department then determines the refill rule curve i e the target water level of reservoir impoundment to maximize water conservation benefits such as hydropower generation since hydropower production maximization is a non convex programming problem the optimal refill rule curve corresponding to the maximum benefit of water conservation could be non unique hence the model for rpp could be an ill posed bilevel programming model iblp model the objectives decision variables and constraints of the upper level and lower level models are described below 2 2 1 upper level flood control operation the flood control department generally focuses on minimizing flood risk minimizing the potential flood risk pr f is set as the upper level objective in the bilevel programming model in this paper pr f is defined as the average occupancy rate of reservoir storage for flood control during floods which can be calculated as 2 min f p r f 1 s k 1 s v k peak v flood where v k peak represents the reservoir storage when the flood peak water level is reached during the k th flood v flood is the total reserved storage for flood control s stands for the number of flood occurrences during the pre impoundment period to provide the decision variables of the upper level the flood control rule which describes the controlled water levels and the corresponding water discharge is widely employed in practice the controlled water levels include flwls and the compensating flood control water levels cfwls lying between the flwl and the normal storage water level nswl cfwls are used to specify the storage to conserve water for downstream flood prevention when the reservoir storage lies below the cfwl the discharge should be controlled at a certain level to alleviate the downstream site s flood risk unlike the traditional method of preserving fixed reservoir storage for flood control at different operation periods this bilevel model optimizes the controlled water levels and the corresponding discharges at multiple periods the upper level decision variable is given as x x 1 x 2 x i where x i z i q i represents the flwls cfwls and the corresponding controlled discharges employed in the i th time interval during the post flood period for the constraints of the upper level model the flwls and cfwls should lie between the dead water level dwl and nswl of the reservoir 3 dwl z 1 x 1 z 2 x 2 z i x i nswl furthermore the reservoir operation under the given flood control rules should obey the following constraints 1 water balance equation 4 v i j 1 v i j q in i j q out i j δ t where δ t is the operational time step such as one day period v i j and v i j 1 are the reservoir storage volume at the beginning and end of a day q in i j and q out i j are the reservoir inflow and outflow on j th day of the i th year among which q out i j would be determined based on the current storage v i j and the inflow q in i j according to both the flood control rule x z q and the refill rule curve y 2 reservoir storage volumes limitation 5 v min v i j v max where v min is the minimum reservoir storage volume and v max is the maximum storage volume 3 basic flood control security 6 r f 0 where r f represents the probability of the reservoir water level exceeding the highest safe water level during the flood season li et al 2014 4 reservoir release limitations 7 q min q out i j min q safe q cap where q min is the minimum required water discharge q safe is the water discharge corresponding to the controlled water level q cap stands for the maximum discharge capability 5 limitation of hydropower output p i j 8 p min p i j p max where p min and p max represent the firm and maximum output of the hydropower station respectively 6 restriction on daily change rate of the water level z 9 δ z δ z max 10 δ z δ z max where δ z and δ z are decrease and increase of the daily water level respectively δ z max and δ z max represent the maximum allowable decrease and increase of the daily water level respectively 2 2 2 lower level water conservation operation the lower level decision maker i e the water conservation department could operate the reservoir for multiple purposes this study mainly focuses on hydropower generation during the refill period and the non flood season in this paper the operation rules are optimized with long series of historical daily inflow data to calculate the annual average output e avg the lower level objective function is defined as 11 max f e avg 1 n i 1 n j 1 m k q i j h i j where k is the hydropower output coefficient q i j is the outflow and h i j is the water head of the reservoir on the j th day of the i th year n is the number of years and m is the number of time steps days during the operational horizon in addition the pre impoundment of the reservoir is proposed and the starting date is advanced to the later period of the flood season the refill rule curve is controlled by several target water levels at the end of each time interval y y 1 y 2 y i while the refill rule curve is set to rise steadily between every two target water levels in practice the refill rule curve is suggested to range between the flwl and nswl of the reservoir 12 flwl y 1 y 2 y i nswl note that the constraints presented in equations 4 10 are also applicable to the lower level model 2 3 iblp model with cooperation degree combining the upper and lower level together the iblp model for rpp is formulated as 13 min x f p r f 1 s k 1 s v k peak v flood s t flwl z 1 x 1 z 2 x 2 z i x i nswl y arg max y f e avg 1 n i 1 n j 1 m k q i j h i j s t flwl y 1 y 2 y i nswl v i j 1 v i j q in i j q out i j δ t v min v i j v max r f 0 q out i j q safe q out i j q cap p min p i j p max δ z δ z max δ z δ z max in this model the rational reaction set of the lower level ψ x arg max y f x y y y x is a non single point set implying that given the flood control rules the water conservation department can choose multiple optimal refill rule curves to achieve the same amount of maximum hydropower production under this condition the choice of the water conservation department would affect the operational performance of the upper level the water conservation department may choose a refill rule curve that is favorable to reduce flood risk or increase the risk therefore the flood control department at the upper level needs to make a judgment upon the selection tendency of the water conservation department such selection tendency can be interpreted as the water conservation department s cooperation degree with the flood control department from this perspective three approaches are proposed for solving the iblp model for rpp 2 3 1 optimistic approach the flood control department at the upper level believes that the selection tendency of the water conservation department at the lower level is fully cooperative that is if there are multiple optimal solutions for the lower level the water conservation department would always choose the refill rule curve which is beneficial to reduce flood risk for the upper level it is termed the optimistic scenario of bilevel programming dempe 2002 the optimistic iblp model for rpp can be established as follows taking the minimum occupancy rate over y at the upper level 14 min x min y f p r f 1 s k 1 s v k peak v flood s t flwl z 1 x 1 z 2 x 2 nswl y arg max y f e avg 1 n i 1 n j 1 m k q i j h i j s t flwl y 1 y 2 nswl v i j 1 v i j q in i j q out i j δ t v min v i j v max r f 0 q out i j q safe q out i j q cap p min p i j p max δ z δ z max δ z δ z max due to the complex structure of the iblp model the decision variables of the upper and lower level models i e flood control rules and refill rule curve are both simplified as two dimensional decision variables to reduce the computational burden using a 15 day operation time step the upper level variable x consists of two controlled water levels in the first and second half of the pre impounding month the lower level variable y consists of two target water levels on the 15th and 30th day of the pre impounding month and the refill rule curve is set to rise steadily between the above two levels 2 3 2 pessimistic approach the flood control department at the upper level believes that the selection tendency of the water conservation department at the lower level is fully uncooperative that is the water conservation department would always choose the refill rule curve which is detrimental to the flood controlling objective of the upper level model it is termed the pessimistic scenario of bilevel programming dempe 2002 the pessimistic iblp model for rpp can be formulated as follows taking the maximum occupancy rate over y 15 min x max y f p r f 1 s k 1 s v k peak v flood s t flwl z 1 x 1 z 2 x 2 nswl y arg max y f e avg 1 n i 1 n j 1 m k q i

of the optimal solutions of the optimistic and pessimistic models under the hypothesis that the lower level rational reaction set is a non empty compact set and the inducible region satisfies the lower semi continuity condition 2 3 3 partial cooperation approach the optimistic and pessimistic iblp models are defined based on the assumption of full cooperation or non cooperation of the follower denoting two extreme cases of practical problems in practice the willingness of the water conservation department to select a refilling plan in favor of flood safety is not necessarily at the extremes of full or none but lies between them in other words the lower level decision maker might partially cooperate with the upper level aboussoror and loridan 2001 cao and leung 2002 accordingly a partial cooperation iblp model for rpp is proposed as follows 16 min x x f c β inf y ψ x f x y 1 β sup y ψ x f x y f p r f 1 s k 1 s v k peak v flood s t flwl z 1 x 1 z 2 x 2 nswl y arg max y f e avg 1 n i 1 n j 1 m k q i j h i j s t flwl y 1 y 2 nswl v i j 1 v i j q in i j q out i j δ t v min v i j v max r f 0 q out i j q safe q out i j q cap p min p i j p max δ z δ z max δ z δ z max in the above model the upper level objective is set as the partial cooperative objective f c 0 β 1 is a given coefficient which is the predefined cooperation degree between the follower and the leader β represents the probability that the water conservation department would choose the refill rule curve most beneficial to flood control from the optimal solution set conversely 1 β is the probability of selecting the refill rule curve most detrimental to the flood control purpose inf f x y is the upper level objective value when the refill rule curve y is most beneficial to flood control and selected from the rational reaction set ψ x sup f x y is the upper level objective value when the refill rule curve detrimental to flood control is selected in this paper the partial cooperation iblp model for rpp has been set with different values of β in order to analyze the influence of different cooperation degrees on the reservoir operation it can be seen that the optimistic and pessimistic iblp models are two special cases of the partial cooperation iblp model with β 1 and β 0 respectively it has been mathematically proven that the upper level objective value of the partial cooperation model ranges between the values of the optimistic and pessimistic solutions jia et al 2016 17 v opt min x x β inf y ψ x f x y 1 β sup y ψ x f x y v pes v opt min x x inf y ψ x f x y v pes min x x sup y ψ x f x y 2 3 4 optimization method bilevel programming is known to be non convex and strongly np hard different metaheuristics have been applied to bilevel optimization problems such as neural network hu et al 2010 and particle swarm optimization pso zhang et al 2013 zhang et al 2012 to solve the iblp model for rpp a simulation optimization framework based on the mse pso algorithm jiang et al 2007 is proposed which provides practical tools for bilevel programming problems the basic principle of the framework is to apply mse pso iteratively to approximate the optimal solution for both the upper and lower levels at the same time the simulation model of reservoir operation is embedded to evaluate the performance of proposed schemes as shown in fig 2 the solution procedures of the optimistic and pessimistic iblp model for rpp are given as follows step 1 generate randomly a set of initial particles of the upper level decision variable x and transmit it to the lower level step 2 according to each x i particle optimize the maximum power generation value f x i that can be obtained under the given flood control rule through combination of mse pso algorithm and reservoir operation simulation step 3 based on the optimistic or the pessimistic model among all the refill rule curves which satisfy the condition f x i y f x i select y i opt which leads to the lowest flood risk optimistic model or y i pes which leads to the highest flood risk pessimistic model and feed it back to the upper level step 4 calculate and evaluate the realization of the flood control objective by different candidate schemes x i y i using reservoir operation simulation update the decision variable x using mse pso algorithm and transmit the updated set of x particles to the lower level step 5 repeat steps 2 4 until the pre set stopping condition is met and then output the flood control rules x and refill rule curve y as the optimal solution for the partial cooperation iblp model the solution procedure is different from the optimistic and pessimistic models in steps 3 and 4 fig 2 in step 3 both y i opt and y i pes are selected and returned to the upper level then in step 4 the optimistic value v o and the pessimistic value v p of the flood control objective are calculated using x i y i opt and x i y i pes respectively the partial cooperative objective f c is evaluated according to v o v p and the predefined cooperation degree β the decision variable x is then updated using mse pso algorithm and transmitted to the lower level model 2 4 extended evaluation of ig in our previous study wang et al 2020a wang et al 2020b an index ig institutional gap was defined to quantify the deviation of the assumed centralized decision making from the practical hierarchical gaming between flood control and hydropower generation in reservoir optimization operation considering the cooperation potential between flood control and hydropower generation under the ill posed condition the index ig can be improved and expressed as 18 ig δ f i δ f i f β f i par f β f i par where β 0 1 represents the cooperation degree of the lower level water conservation department with the upper level flood control department f β and f β are the optimal values of flood control and power generation objectives respectively solved by the iblp model for rpp with given β f i par and f i par are the values of flood control and power generation objectives respectively corresponding to the i th point on the pareto front obtained by the mop model the choice of the i th point is related to the preference setting of the mop model a further index l i g is defined in this study to evaluate the pareto efficiency loss resulting from the hierarchical gaming process and the ill posed characteristic of reservoir operation problems it is calculated as the ig value related to hydropower generation ig f when the iblp model solution is compared to a mop model solution with an equal value of flood control objective 19 l i g f β f k par if f β f k par in eq 19 a negative value of l i g indicates that the iblp model solutions can only achieve a relatively low overall benefit compared to the pareto optimal solutions that is pareto efficiency loss occurs due to the hierarchical decision making process the loss of optimality could be defined by comparing the deviation of performance between the bilevel model and the single level mop model shafiee jood et al 2018 l i g is an extension of such a definition to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the effects of hierarchical decision structure with the ill posed characteristic on the optimal performance of reservoir operation not only the cooperation degree of the water conservation department with the flood control department but also different preference settings of the mop model solution can be explicitly denoted from the index l i g 3 case study 3 1 pre impoundment problem of tgr the three gorges reservoir tgr i e the world s largest multi purpose hydro junction is a key project in the water resources management of the yangtze river fig 3 with a flood storage capacity of 22 15 billion m3 the tgr can effectively control floods from the upstream of the yangtze river which significantly reduces the flood risk downstream in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river where the most populous and economically developed plain area of china is located in particular it has been practically proven to strengthen watershed protection for the jingjiang river reach and the dongting lake areas which suffered from frequent and disastrous flood damages in the past nakayama and shankman 2013 xia et al 2016 meanwhile the tgr has a firm output of 4990 mw with a total of 18200 mw of installed hydropower capacity up to 2018 the annual generated power of the tgr has exceeded 100 billion kilowatt hours kwh ctg 2018 generally a hydrological year could be divided into two operation periods for the tgr cwrc 2012 flood season from mid june to late september non flood season which includes the refill period october and the water drawdown period from november to 9th june in the next year according to the original design cwrc 1997 the tgr operation focuses on flood control throughout the flood season maintaining the water level at its flwl of 145 m till the end of september at the beginning of october the reservoir refilling procedure would be started and the water level would be gradually raised up to the nswl of 175 m the observed data indicates that more than 8000 m3 s discharge should be retained per day on average in october to fill up the reservoir in the last two decades hydrological regime changes and constructions of upstream cascade reservoirs have significantly decreased the inflow of the tgr during the non flood season resulting in the difficulty of achieving full storage as well as intensified water use conflicts in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river zheng 2016 for example starting from 28th september 2008 the refilling progress of the tgr was hindered in october because a drought occurred in the xiangjiang river area and the tgr had to increase water discharge to alleviate the water shortage in the lower reaches as a result the water level of the tgr only arrived at 172 6 m at the end of refilling on 6th november which was 2 5 m below the nswl it is therefore necessary to improve the original tgr operation rules for an effective reservoir impoundment numerous studies used mop modeling to optimize the tgr operation scheme for pre impoundment during post flood periods li et al 2014 x liu et al 2011a liu et al 2011b in practice the tgr has gone into the stage of experimental pre impoundment since 2010 nevertheless there is still a gap between the research results and practical operation schemes for the tgr pre impoundment particularly researchers proposed that reservoir refilling should start from 1st september and the water level should reach 160 m on 30th september but for the past several years the tgr started refilling on 10th september and the water level normally ranged from 162 m to 165 m on 30th september for example as the real operation data of the year 2020 shows fig 4 despite the occurrence of large floods in july and august the maximum reservoir water level was still lower than 165 m by the end of the flood season leaving a certain margin for safety 3 2 hierarchical decision structure of tgr operation early refilling of the tgr involves two decision makers and can be formulated by the leader follower decision making structure fig 5 as the leader the general commands of flood control and drought relief of china and of the yangtze river regarded as a single entity in this study the gcfd sets flood control standards and determines flood control rules to reduce the potential flood risk of the tgr dam and the downstream areas as the follower the china three gorges corporation ctgc directly makes plans for hydropower generation and reservoir impoundment the ctgc also needs to consider the benefits and losses of other departments such as the changjiang waterway bureau and china s state grid for simplification the bilevel modeling of the tgr operation mainly focuses on the relationship between the gcfd and ctgc 3 2 1 flood control rules the originally designed operation rule of the tgr would preserve all reservoir storage above the fixed flwl for flood control at the jingjiang river reach jingjiang compensating flood control which is described as follows cwrc 1997 1 in principle the tgr water level should be kept at the flwl of 145 m during the whole flood season i e releasing the same amount of water as its inflow 2 when the water level is above 145 m the discharge of the tgr should be controlled so that the water level at the shashi hydrological station should not exceed 44 5 m if the corresponding return period of the seasonal design inflow is 100 year or smaller or the water level of the tgr is lower than 171 m 3 the discharge of the tgr should be controlled so that the water level at the shashi hydrological station should not exceed 45 m if the corresponding return period of the seasonal design inflow lies between 100 year and 1000 year or the water level of the tgr lies between 171 m and 175 m in 2009 the ministry of water resources of china revised the tgr operation rule so as to divide part of the reservoir storage for flood control compensation at the chenglingji hydrological station to reduce flood risk of the dongting lake area chenglingji compensating flood control mwr 2009 the division curve of this part of storage i e the cfwl is currently set at 155 m leaving 5 65 billion m3 storage for flood capacity compensation accordingly the operation rule of the tgr has been revised as follows 1 in principle the tgr water level should be kept at 145 m during the whole flood season i e releasing the same amount of water as its inflow 2 when the water level ranges between 145 m and 155 m the discharge of the tgr should be controlled so that the water level at the chenglingji hydrological station does not exceed 34 4 m if the corresponding return period of the seasonal design inflow is less than or equal to 100 year 3 when the water level is above 155 m the discharge of the tgr should be controlled so that the water level at the shashi hydrological station does not exceed 44 5 m if the corresponding return period of the seasonal design inflow lies between 100 year and 1000 year therefore there is an increasing need for the tgr to regulate smaller inflows as well as reduce the flood risk of the lower reach during the post flood period this study mainly seeks to improve the current fixed cfwl by optimizing a set of multistage cfwls as the decision variable of the gcfd which is represented by a set of two lines in the first and second half months of september i e x x 1 x 2 according to operation experiences and findings of related studies li et al 2014 mwr 2009 zheng 2016 the tgr s controlled discharge for the jingjiang compensating flood control and chenglingji compensating flood control are proposed as 55000 m3 s and 42000 m3 s respectively the corresponding controlled water discharges are therefore not considered as decision variables of the upper level model 3 2 2 refill rules originally the refilling procedure of the tgr is given as follows at the end of the flood season the water level is gradually raised from the flwl of 145 m to the nswl of 175 m in october a refill rule curve would provide a guideline for the progress of impoundment as stated in the tgr operation rules enacted by the changjiang water resources commission in 2012 the refilling starts on 10th september and the water level can be raised to 165 m at the end of september cwrc 2012 during the early refilling in the post flood season the operation of the tgr should transfer from impoundment to flood control pattern when a flood is forecasted in the near future in this study the starting date of impoundment is further advanced to 1st september so as to verify the effectiveness of an earlier pre impoundment strategy the initial water level of the refill rule curve is 145 m on 1st september and the ending target water level of the refill rule curve is set as 175 m on 31st october between 145 m and 175 m the refill rule curve is controlled by two target water levels on 15th september and 30th september respectively i e y y 1 y 2 the curve rises evenly between the controlled water levels optimizing these two decision variables could improve the commonly used linear refilling progress to reflect whether the water conservation department employs fast or slow refilling progress i e risk seeking or risk averse zeng et al 2021 during the pre impoundment period 3 3 input data and constraints overview simulation and calculation of the case study are based on the 131 year from 1882 to 2012 historical daily inflow series of the tgr the minimum water discharge q min is 10 000 m3 s and 8000 m3 s for the tgr in september and october respectively the maximum allowable increase of the daily water level δ z max for impoundment of the tgr is 3 m the decrease of the daily water level δ z max should not exceed 2 m during floods and 0 6 m in the non flood season these settings mainly serve the demands for navigation ecological water use downstream and bank stability cwrc 2012 mwr 2009 4 results and discussion 4 1 hierarchical competition between flood control and hydropower generation 4 1 1 operation performance according to the optimization results both the optimistic and pessimistic iblp models can derive the same annual average of hydropower generation in september and the subsequent non flood season from 1st october to 9th june in the next year i e 62 27 billion kwh per year meanwhile the average occupancy rate of reservoir storage for flood control is 0 20 and 0 25 in the optimistic and pessimistic cases respectively note that the basic flood control security see eq 6 is guaranteed under both two models the feasible regions of iblp models and the mop model for rpp of the tgr are illustrated in fig 6 given a flood control rule i e cfwls within the constraint domain the water conservation department can use the optimistic and pessimistic approaches as defined in section 2 3 to determine the refill rule curve respectively following that a series of cfwls and refill rule curves are derived as sets of feasible solutions forming the feasible regions of the optimistic iblp model orange line and pessimistic iblp model blue line respectively the feasible region of the mop model consists of all sets of cfwls and refill rule curves considering the constraint conditions the lower envelope curve of this feasible region is the pareto front curve of the mop model black dashed line as can be seen the feasible regions of iblp models are only a subset of that from the mop model with the feasible points densely lying over the right lower area above the pareto front curve in the feasible region of the mop model the hydropower generation decreases from 63 0 to 60 5 billion kwh as the preference i e weighting factor for flood control increases in contrast the lowest feasible value of hydropower generation from iblp models is 62 27 billion kwh similarly the minimum feasible value of the average occupancy rate of reservoir storage is raised from 0 09 to 0 2 in the optimistic and 0 25 in the pessimistic scenarios respectively further the feasible region of the pessimistic iblp model lies toward the right part implying that when the ctgc selects a fully non cooperative refilling plan for the gcfd the potential flood risk will approach a relatively high value analysis of ig quantifies the deviation between the ill posed bilevel decision making and the centralized modeling framework in fig 6 five feasible solutions on the pareto front curve corresponding to different preference settings of the mop model are chosen to conduct such analysis points m and n represent the two exceptional cases when the centralized decision maker only focuses on minimizing the potential flood risk and maximizing the hydropower generation respectively at point a the mop model solution results in the same hydropower generation as the iblp model solutions at point b the mop model solution specifies the same value of potential flood risk as the pessimistic iblp model solution fig 7 shows the effects of the preference setting of the mop model on ig values from the optimistic and pessimistic iblp models m k a b and n represent the ig values related to points m k a b and n in fig 6 respectively for the optimistic solution in the segment from the left end m to point a on the pareto front curve the underestimation of the mop model in both potential flood risk and power generation increases as more weight is given to the flood control objective for example at point k the average occupancy rate of flood control storage and hydropower generation are underestimated by 0 07 and 0 74 billion kwh respectively i e i g k δ f k δ f k 0 07 0 74 meantime the largest underestimation occurs at point m with i g m δ f m δ f m 0 11 1 51 where the determination of the refill rule is fully considered with flood safety point a almost overlaps with the optimistic solution point o and the ig values approach zero comparatively in the segment from point a to the right end n of the pareto front curve both the potential flood risk and hydropower production of mop model solutions are smaller than those from the optimistic model and the deviation increases as high preference is given to the hydropower generation objective for the pessimistic solution ig values in terms of hydropower generation are equal to those of the optimistic solution but larger ig values of flood control are derived these results indicate that in the segment between points a and b on the pareto front curve the mop model solution could result in relatively low potential flood risk and a relatively large hydropower generation compared to the pessimistic solution therefore the competition space between flood control and hydropower generation is smaller within an ill posed bilevel decision making framework compared to the results from the centralized model as discussed in the former study wang et al 2020a wang et al 2020b the above implication results from the autonomy of the water conservation department ctgc in this case since the ctgc makes its own decision after the gcfd the refill rule curve could affect the achievement of the gcfd s objective in terms of flood risk prevention the gcfd thus has to take into account the reactions of the ctgc and hence reduce its own decision space in contrast the mop model does not consider such a non perfect cooperative interaction between the two departments that is the mop model tends to ignore the autonomous decision preference of the water conservation department such that the selected upper level solution would likely not be paired with the selected lower level solution in practice resulting in underestimating the potential flood risk as well as hydropower generation 4 1 2 operation schemes as shown in fig 6 the pareto operation schemes determined by the centralized model may not be a feasible choice for the ill posed bilevel decision making process for example point k on the pareto front curve fig 6 corresponds to the cfwls of 155 m for optimistic and pessimistic iblp model solutions point o and p the cfwls are also optimized as 155 m but the refill rule curves are different from those of point k as shown in fig 8 the optimistic model s target water level on 15th september is 149 43 m 7 8 m lower than that of the pessimistic model the target water level on 30th september of the optimistic model is 171 12 m 8 4 m higher than that of the pessimistic model that is in the case of full cooperation the ctgc would adopt a fast in the beginning slowing down later impoundment strategy which is advantageous for reducing the flood risk in the early period of the post flood season in the case of complete non cooperation the ctgc would adopt a slow in the beginning speeding up later impoundment strategy which is detrimental to the flood control objective in comparison with the target water level at 145 m on 15th september and 164 45 m on 30th september the impoundment progress of point k is significantly more conservative than the optimistic and pessimistic solutions correspondingly the average occupancy rate of reservoir storage for flood control of iblp model solutions is higher than that of the mop model f k 0 13 while the hydropower generation is larger than that of the mop model f k 61 53 fig 9 compares the simulated reservoir impoundment process with the operation rules derived from the mop model and iblp models for rpp of the tgr in two inflow scenarios of 1984 and 1998 the flooding process in 1984 was characterized by high inflow at the beginning of september and low inflow in october which could take advantage of pre impoundment it can be seen that the impoundment of both optimistic and pessimistic models starts from the beginning of september with the initial water level at the flwl of 145 m compared to the optimistic solution the pessimistic solution shows a relatively fast rate of impoundment in the first half of september and a relatively slow rate in the latter half of september the water level of the optimistic model is higher than that of the pessimistic model from 15th september operation rules determined from both models suggest the target water level of 175 m of tgr at the end of october the impounding progress of the mop model solution however only starts in the latter half of september and the water level is raised at a slower rate on average than that of the optimistic solution according to the historical data of 1998 the water level of the tgr reached 155 m on 1st september due to large scale floods in early september the reservoir transits to the flood control operation pattern and the water level is higher than the target water level of impoundment both the impoundment process from the optimistic and pessimistic models have been delayed and started not earlier than 10th september in the pessimistic case tgr begins to raise the water level from mid september while the impoundment begins around 20th september in the optimistic case in the late ten days of september the refilling rate specified from the optimistic model would be high with the water level gradually exceeding that of the pessimistic model achieving the target water level of 175 m earlier in late october the tgr has to increase the amount of water release in the optimistic case since the storage is almost complete again the impoundment of the mop model solution begins later than iblp models it is worth noting that the cfwls optimized by the two iblp models are identically equal to the low limit of the cfwls i e 155 m prescribed by the regulation it can be explained by the hierarchical gaming characteristics of reservoir operation since the flood control department is given the leading position the results of iblp models would tend to search the flood control rule with low risk that is the cfwls in cooperative and non cooperative situations would be lowered down to 155 m 4 2 cooperativeness and potential to enhance operation benefit 4 2 1 cooperation potential in fig 10 the optimistic solution point o is very close to the pareto front curve while the pessimistic solution point p is on the right hand side of point o with a significant distance from the pareto front curve as expected this indicates that a hierarchical decision making problem leads to pareto efficiency loss compared to a mop model especially when the non cooperative interactions between the flood control and water conservation departments are taken into account specifically in this case the difference in the average occupancy rate of reservoir storage for flood control between the two solutions is 0 05 this result implies that if the ctgc transitions from the refill rule curve detrimental to flood control to the curve beneficial to flood control the tgr would reduce the potential flood risk as measured by occupancy rate by 20 since both these refill rule curves would lead to a hydropower generation of 62 27 billion kwh the potential reduction of flood risk depends on whether ctgc is willing to select the refilling plan in favor of the gcfd following that such potential of improving flood control security without sacrificing hydropower production can be defined as the cooperation potential c p between flood control and water conservation departments in rpp 4 2 2 influence of cooperation degrees table 1 lists the operation performance of the tgr when the optimistic pessimistic and partial cooperation iblp models are applied as can be seen all three models have obtained the same annual average hydropower generation in september and the subsequent non flood season nevertheless there are significant differences in the potential flood risk in the case of complete non cooperation of the ctgc with the gcfd the pessimistic solution leads to the largest average occupancy rate of reservoir storage for flood control while in the case of full cooperation the optimistic solution leads to the lowest occupancy rate of reservoir storage for flood control in addition the optimistic solution results in relatively high performance compared to the pessimistic solution in terms of the annual average water level at the end of impounding period and reservoir full storage rate the potential flood risk optimized by partial cooperative iblp models with different cooperation degrees lies between the optimistic and pessimistic solutions indicating that in partial cooperative situations the ctgc has considered both the flood control security as well as the water conservation benefits further as the cooperation degree between the ctgc and gcfd varies from 0 to 1 the average occupancy rate of reservoir storage for flood control ranges from the pessimistic solution to the optimistic solution value illustrated in fig 10 solution points of the partial cooperation model lie between the optimistic and pessimistic solution points and would approach the pareto front with an increasing cooperation degree the solution point e with f e par 0 21 f e par 62 32 on the pareto front curve is used to evaluate the pareto efficiency loss l i g in fig 11 ig values in terms of hydropower generation are almost identical among different models i e 0 095 billion kwh on the other hand as expected the ig value related to the flood control objective is the largest when the cgtc is completely uncooperative with the gcfd as the degree of cooperation increases ig f gradually decreases and reaches its minimum under the full cooperation scenario taking point c with β 0 3 for example the ig f e value of this solution is 0 021 which lies between the value of the optimistic solution 0 013 and the pessimistic solution 0 036 at the same time compared with the pessimistic situation of non cooperation cooperation between the cgtc and gcfd can reduce the pareto efficiency loss caused by the hierarchical competitive gaming between flood control and water conservation for reservoir optimization operation especially when the cgtc fully cooperates with the gcfd the optimistic solution point lies nearly on the pareto front and the pareto efficiency loss in this case is almost zero when the partial cooperation model is given with different cooperation degrees 0 β 1 β 2 β 5 1 l i g decreases with increasing cooperation degrees it can thus be concluded that when the water conservation department at the lower level is more willing to cooperate with the flood control department the reservoir operation of pre impoundment would be more efficient and there would be less deviation of flood control security from the ideal centralized decision making therefore it is beneficial to promote cooperation between the water conservation and flood control department especially when the rpp is anyway ill posed such cooperation could be largely facilitated by changes to the institutional structure in terms of how the reservoir operation rules are determined i e the flood control department specifies rules with more consideration of feedback from the water conservation department public reports show that china s ministry of water resources or watershed management commissions will regularly hold reservoir operation decision consultations and technical review conferences for large and medium reservoir operations such as the tgr this would provide a potential negotiation platform for coordinating the flood control and water conservation sectors it is thus necessary and possible for further study to design an efficient information exchange and cooperation mechanism to coordinate the existing institutional structure 4 3 causes of cooperation potential non uniqueness of optimal refill rule curve the non linearity of the lower level objective function eq 11 leads to the effect of equivalence of multiple refill rule curves with respect to hydropower generation as shown in fig 12 when the cfwls during the tgr pre impoundment period x are set high 164 m medium 159 m or low 155 m the ctgc can search multiple refill rule curves leading to the same annual average hydropower generation in september and the non flood season not considering all the reservoir operation constraints as the target hydropower production increases the contour accumulates to a smaller range indicating that the effect of equivalence becomes less significant moreover fig 12 shows that such an effect applies to wet years p 12 5 flat years 37 5 p 62 5 and dry years p 87 5 basically the target water level on 30th september y 2 decreases with increasing the target water level on 15th september y 1 implying that two types of impoundment strategies could specify the same hydropower generation one strategy is fast in the beginning slowing down later and the other is slow in the beginning speeding up later it is noteworthy though that in wet years y 1 and y 2 increase simultaneously while the hydropower generation remains constant the year 1886 is selected as a typical wet year p 12 5 for further analysis of the simulated reservoir operation process when the cfwls are set as 155 0 m two points y 161 26 167 85 and y 169 89 170 40 relate to the same annual average hydropower generation 77 48 billion kwh however the impounding progress of y is faster than y during the whole period as can be seen from fig 13 the difference between the two storage schemes is mainly in the impoundment period from september to october in the first half of september 1886 the impounding scheme y generated more hydropower than y because of lower water levels and larger discharge at the end of september due to the occurrence of a large flood the tgr had to transition from pre impoundment to flood control operation pattern and water release was significantly increased in this situation the impounding scheme y results in a relatively high hydropower generation because of the high water head on the other hand when taking the reservoir operation constraints into account the feasible optimum of refill rule curves with respect to hydropower generation would fall on a lower contour which makes non uniqueness of the optimum more significant as fig 14 shows given the cfwls set as 159 m multiple points on the contour corresponding to 62 76 billion kwh power production are both feasible and optimal under the tgr operation constraints eq 4 10 thus it can be concluded that the non linear characteristic of the hydropower generation objective function the constraints and chosen operation patterns in practical reservoir operation together have led to the ill posedness of the problem differences in performance could also come from the optimization algorithm not finding the optimum care with selection of the optimization algorithm and the size of the effect found suggest this is a minor factor in this case 4 4 limitations and future work the findings of this study have to be seen in light of some limitations to the generalization of the modeling framework which could be addressed in future research first the study proposed a bilevel modeling framework with one leader and one follower the upper and lower level decision makers pursue a single objective i e flood control and hydropower generation while other purposes of reservoir operation such as navigation and ecological release are regarded as constraints in practice however decision making of multi purpose reservoirs involves multiple departments with conflicting purposes including industrial and agricultural water supply navigation and environmental water uses interactions between stakeholders at each managerial level need to be considered in reservoir optimization operation problems yao et al 2020 in many cases flood control security objectives of the dam the upstream and the downstream areas may differ in priority and are thus on different decision levels moreover multi reservoir systems can have an equal or unequal distribution of operation rights among parallel and cascade reservoirs therefore the iblp model in this study is still limited to specific scenarios and cannot fully address the complex institutional relationships in reservoir system operation problems based on recent progress in model research the iblp model framework could be further expanded to multi objective bilevel programming deb and sinha 2010 saini and kailey 2022 zhang et al 2013 multi level programming models fakhry et al 2022 han et al 2015 lu et al 2016 and multi leader multi follower game basilico et al 2020 goshu and kassa 2022 lu et al 2022 zhou et al 2018 second the study presumes a stackelberg game in which the leader has complete information on possible reactions and the selection preference of the follower and the follower knows perfectly which choice is beneficial for the leader nevertheless incomplete information exchange or information asymmetry between the flood control and water conservation departments often applies in real case such information barriers would cause even more efficiency loss in the hierarchical gaming process with local optimal solutions le cadre et al 2019 zeng et al 2019 furthermore the uncertainty in decisions causes the problem to be stochastic and equilibrium programming heidari et al 2020 wang et al 2020a in this regard new strategies need to be introduced to reach the equilibrium state of the stackelberg game such as contract design chernonog 2021 xiong et al 2021 repeated games alcantara jiménez and clempner 2020 and hierarchical reinforcement learning method cao et al 2022 finally the study mainly focused on the non uniqueness of optimal solutions for the lower level objective i e hydropower generation accordingly the discussion in this paper is more inclined toward the willingness of the follower water conservation department to cooperate with the leader flood control department in fact considering the minimization of potential flood risk through optimizing the cfwls and the refill rule curve is a non convex programming problem non unique optimal solutions could also apply to the upper level objective under this circumstance among the multiple operation rule setting solutions which can achieve the lowest flood risk the flood control department could choose the ones favorable to hydropower generation in turn it can be used as an incentive for the water conservation department to motivate their cooperative decision making investigation into the ill posedness of both levels would be an essential part of further work since it provides a necessary basis for developing a two way cooperation mechanism in reservoir operation again building such a cooperation mechanism involves a re examination of current decision structures in which reservoir operation rules are formulated 5 conclusion the present research aimed to gain insight into the competitive cooperative relationship between flood control and hydropower generation in reservoir operations with a hierarchical decision structure taking the tgr pre impoundment problem as an example this study illustrated the characteristic of non unique optimal refill rule curves with respect to hydropower generation the results indicate that not only a competitive but also cooperative relationship exists between the flood control and water conservation department since the water conservation department can choose whether to set a refill rule curve in favor of flood control security following the bilevel modeling framework with the ill posed characteristic this study demonstrated that due to the non uniqueness characteristic of the hierarchical gaming process the competitive cooperative relationship between flood control and hydropower generation would deviate from the trade off relationship from the mop model in the case of the tgr pre impoundment problem competition space between flood control and hydropower generation was narrowed with the lower bound of feasible hydropower generation increasing from 60 5 to 62 27 billion kwh and the minimum feasible value of potential flood risk increasing from 0 09 to 0 2 0 25 meanwhile the cooperation of the ctgc with the gcfd i e choosing a refill rule curve advantageous to flood safety had the potential to reduce the average occupancy rate of reservoir storage for flood control during floods by 20 furthermore as the cooperation degree increased the efficiency loss related to hydropower generation given the same potential flood risk would decrease from 0 342 billion kwh to nearly zero specifically pareto optimality could be nearly achieved in the optimistic situation i e the choice of the water conservation department was very nearly fully cooperative therefore it is crucial to strengthen the cooperative relationship between flood control and hydropower generation to improve the comprehensive performance of reservoir operation future work can focus on developing cooperation and coordination mechanisms between flood control and water conservation departments moreover understanding the effects of seasonal inflow distribution characteristics on the cooperation potential is worthy of further investigation credit authorship contribution statement xin wang conceptualization methodology software

2038,quantifying the relationship between flood control and hydropower generation in reservoir operation optimization is challenged by both institutional barriers and ill posedness different stakeholders fit within hierarchical institutional structures and parameter equifinality may exist compared to the assumption of centralized decision making and only one optimal solution used in previous studies this paper investigated the effects of ill posedness on the competitive cooperative relationship between flood control and hydropower generation within a hierarchical gaming process based on the ill posed bilevel programming model for the three gorges reservoir pre impoundment problem this study revealed that the ranges of potential flood risk and hydropower generation i e competition space between two objectives could be narrowed with the increased minimum of hydropower generation and increased minimal occupancy rate of flood control storage importantly different from the as one falls another rises relationship implied by pareto front solutions cooperation of the water conservation department with the flood control department namely selecting a refill rule curve in favor of flood safety could reduce the flood control risk without sacrificing power generation benefits furthermore a higher cooperation degree would decrease the efficiency loss related to hydropower generation without changing potential flood risk keywords reservoir optimization operation reservoir pre impoundment problem ill posed bilevel programming cooperation potential institutional gap data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction a primary goal of operating multi purpose reservoirs is to maximize water conservation benefits while maintaining flood control security to achieve carbon neutrality the potential role of hydropower has been highlighted for balancing the instability of other renewable energy such as wind and photovoltaic power ming et al 2018 therefore coordinating the competitive relationship between flood control and hydropower generation is essential for reservoir optimization operation as well as water energy nexus competition between flood control and hydropower generation could be widely observed from real reservoir operations resulting in inefficient loss of water and hydropower for example the sichuan province in southwest china suffered more than 10 billion kwh loss of hydropower generation from pre releasing water from reservoirs to alleviate flood risk during the flood seasons in 2013 nea 2015 the competitive relationship between flood control and hydropower generation has been widely investigated in literature particularly for reservoir impoundment operations precautionary releases from reservoirs in response to the high possibility of large future floods could lead to hydropower shortage because of insufficient subsequent inflows for meeting water conservation demands it is especially the case when climate change and direct human activities have induced significant changes of seasonal streamflow xin et al 2019 conversely setting higher flood limited water levels flwls and pre filling the reservoir would provide relatively large storage for hydropower generation during the non flood season but increase flood risk during impoundment in the near future generally most previous studies used the so called multi objective programming mop method to quantify the competition relationship between flood risk and hydropower generation in pre impoundment he et al 2022 li et al 2014 liu et al 2017 or during the dry season wu et al 2021 with non inferior solution points in the pareto optimal set such a competitive relationship has also been termed a trade off relationship between flood control security and water conservation benefits the mop modeling framework presumes a centralized decision making structure i e only one decision maker with the assumption of perfect coordination and complete information exchange among different stakeholders can determine the operation rules for multiple purpose reservoir operation however multiple departments or sectors are usually involved in the decision making process for the multi purpose operation rule determination since the decision for achieving one purpose is often made by one corresponding department multiple purposes could be classified into flood control and water conservation purposes and the decisions for achieving these two objectives are usually made by separate departments in most countries such as china csc 2018 mwr 2012 a hierarchical decision making framework has widely been applied to set different decision priorities for flood control and water conservation within this framework flood control security is prescribed with the highest priority and the water conservation department must be subordinated to the flood control department for reservoir impoundment the water conservation department would determine the plans for refilling and hydropower generation according to the flwls given by the flood control department centralized decision making models such as mop have difficulties providing practical solutions for the multiple decision makers with a hierarchical managerial structure due to the asymmetrical decision making priorities incompleteness of information exchange and competition or cooperation relationship among different departments therefore a deviation between actual reservoir operation performance and the optimal performance indicated by pareto solutions can be derived safari et al 2014 shafiee jood et al 2018 xu et al 2016 and such deviation has been defined as the loss of optimality in the decision process of a stackelberg game shafiee jood et al 2018 the so called stackelberg game first developed by von stackelberg in economics scherer 1996 has been introduced to specify the hierarchical competition relationship as a special type of stackelberg game bilevel programming with only one leader and one follower has been used for water allocation darbandsari et al 2020 hu et al 2016 liu et al 2017 water energy environment conflict cheng et al 2016 moazeni et al 2020 zhang and vesselinov 2016 and inter basin reservoirs coordination operation problems guo et al 2012 li et al 2021 qin et al 2020 zhu et al 2017 particularly only one numerical analysis of the hierarchical decision structure between flood control and hydropower generation has been conducted for reservoir impoundment cases wang et al 2020a wang et al 2020b by optimizing the flwls and refill rule curve with a bilevel programming model the index of institutional gap ig was defined and used to explain the optimality loss resulting from the hierarchical competition hadamard first defined a well posed problem that satisfies three conditions the existence uniqueness and stability of solutions hadamard 1923 on the contrary if one of the three conditions is not satisfied it is termed an ill posed problem the ill posed characteristic of reservoir optimization operation problems mainly comes from two aspects one is the instability caused by disturbing factors such as uncertainty of runoff or climate change the other is the characteristic of the multiple optimal solutions due to non linearity non convexness or non smoothness of the objective functions or constraints horne et al 2016 rani and moreira 2010 singh 2012 zeng et al 2021 which has been proved in hydropower generation operation liu et al 2012 liu et al 2011a liu et al 2011b such non uniqueness of the optimal solution can be related to the parameter equifinality problem in hydrological modeling beven 2006 kelleher et al 2017 schmidt et al 2020 schumacher et al 2018 the discussion on the ill posed issue in reservoir optimization operation models focuses on the effects on the centralized decision making process for the hierarchical decision making process of reservoir impoundment for example given the flwls set by the flood control department the water conservation department could choose multiple refilling plans for maximizing hydropower generation meantime equivalent refilling plans may lead to different levels of flood risk for example a slow in the beginning speeding up later strategy could alleviate flood risk compared to a fast in the beginning slowing down later strategy when facing a high likelihood of large floods in the post flood season under this condition the water conservation department could decide whether to choose a refill plan that is favorable for flood control hence multi purpose reservoir operation is not merely a trade off problem but could also involve cooperation between flood control and hydropower generation the cooperation potential can be defined to quantify the extent of decreasing flood control risk while maintaining the same quantity of hydropower generation such a relationship differs from the commonly used as one falls another rises relationship implied by pareto solutions according to our knowledge this paper might be the first to investigate the effects of ill posedness on the cooperative relationship between flood control and hydropower generation within a hierarchical modeling framework the main goal of this study is to 1 provide a modeling framework to derive the competitive cooperative relationship between flood control and water conservation departments 2 quantify the gap between the competitive relationship specified by the conventional models and the actual gaming process with the ill posed characteristic and 3 explore the cooperation potential between flood control and hydropower generation the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 proposes an evaluation framework of the cooperation potential between flood control and hydropower generation based on ill posed bilevel programming modeling for reservoir impoundment operation in terms of the extended index of ig section 3 employs the reservoir pre impoundment problem of the three gorges reservoir tgr as a case study section 4 analyzes the results and discusses how hierarchical gaming with the characteristic of non unique optimal solutions would influence the competition space and cooperation potential between flood control and hydropower generation conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 evaluation framework of cooperation potential in rpp for reservoir pre impoundment problems rpp the timing of reservoir refilling and the progress of impoundment need to be specified to balance flood risk and water conservation benefits e g hydropower production given the flood control rules determined by the upper level flood control department the water conservation department might explore multiple refill rule curves to achieve the same hydropower production this leads to a specific cooperation competition relationship between reservoir flood control and hydropower generation within the hierarchical gaming framework the preference for cooperation by the water conservation department e g by selecting a refill rule curve in favor of flood control security determines the achievement of the upper level objective as well as the overall performance of reservoir operation this paper proposes a framework to evaluate the cooperation potential between flood control and hydropower generation fig 1 it is based on the quantitative analysis of the difference in flood control risk which is solved by ill posed bilevel programming models iblp models for rpp with different cooperation degrees first the upper and lower boundaries of the cooperation space are determined by the optimistic and pessimistic iblp model solutions for rpp optimistic and pessimistic iblp model solutions could be specified when the refill rule curve chosen by the water conservation department is wholly beneficial or non beneficial for the flood control objective respectively the deviation of the flood control objective between the optimistic and pessimistic iblp models is defined as the extent of the cooperation potential since the boundedness of the deviation between optimistic and pessimistic objective values has been proved by loridan and morgan 1996 and molodtsov 1976 the boundary of the cooperation space is known to exist second the partial cooperation iblp model solutions for rpp implies how reservoir operation rule setting and the objective values vary under different cooperation degrees between the water conservation and the flood control department 2 2 ill posed bilevel programming model for rpp in bilevel programming if there is only one optimal solution of the lower level model for any given decision of the upper level model then the problem is termed a well posed bilevel programming problem if the optimal solution set of the lower level is a non single point set to at least one upper level decision then the problem is an ill posed bilevel programming problem kochetov et al 2016 zemkoho 2016 a general ill posed bilevel programming problem can be formulated as follows 1 min x f x y s t x x g x 0 y ψ x ψ x is the solution set of the lower level min y f x y s t g x y 0 where x r n and y r m are decision variables of the upper and lower levels respectively f and f are objective functions of the upper and lower levels respectively g and g are constraints of the upper and lower levels respectively basic definitions of a general bilevel programming model bard 2010 also apply to ill posed bilevel programming the optimal solution of the problem is restricted to the inducible region or feasible region which consists of the intersection of the constraints domain and rational reaction set of the lower level to the decision given by the upper level please refer to our previous work for detailed definitions of the feasible region constraint domain and rational reaction set of the lower level wang et al 2020a wang et al 2020b in the rpp a bilevel programming model is developed to simulate the hierarchical decision structure between the flood control and water conservation department with conflicting objectives for reservoirs serving both flood control and water conservation purposes the department responsible for flood control is typically set as the leader i e super ordinate decision maker at the upper level due to the high importance of dam safety and downstream security in contrast the department seeking water conservation benefits such as a hydroelectric company is defined as the follower i e sub ordinate decision maker at the lower level correspondingly the flood control department would determine the flood control rules including the controlled water levels and the corresponding water discharge to reduce the flood risk with the consideration of the reaction of the water conservation department the water conservation department then determines the refill rule curve i e the target water level of reservoir impoundment to maximize water conservation benefits such as hydropower generation since hydropower production maximization is a non convex programming problem the optimal refill rule curve corresponding to the maximum benefit of water conservation could be non unique hence the model for rpp could be an ill posed bilevel programming model iblp model the objectives decision variables and constraints of the upper level and lower level models are described below 2 2 1 upper level flood control operation the flood control department generally focuses on minimizing flood risk minimizing the potential flood risk pr f is set as the upper level objective in the bilevel programming model in this paper pr f is defined as the average occupancy rate of reservoir storage for flood control during floods which can be calculated as 2 min f p r f 1 s k 1 s v k peak v flood where v k peak represents the reservoir storage when the flood peak water level is reached during the k th flood v flood is the total reserved storage for flood control s stands for the number of flood occurrences during the pre impoundment period to provide the decision variables of the upper level the flood control rule which describes the controlled water levels and the corresponding water discharge is widely employed in practice the controlled water levels include flwls and the compensating flood control water levels cfwls lying between the flwl and the normal storage water level nswl cfwls are used to specify the storage to conserve water for downstream flood prevention when the reservoir storage lies below the cfwl the discharge should be controlled at a certain level to alleviate the downstream site s flood risk unlike the traditional method of preserving fixed reservoir storage for flood control at different operation periods this bilevel model optimizes the controlled water levels and the corresponding discharges at multiple periods the upper level decision variable is given as x x 1 x 2 x i where x i z i q i represents the flwls cfwls and the corresponding controlled discharges employed in the i th time interval during the post flood period for the constraints of the upper level model the flwls and cfwls should lie between the dead water level dwl and nswl of the reservoir 3 dwl z 1 x 1 z 2 x 2 z i x i nswl furthermore the reservoir operation under the given flood control rules should obey the following constraints 1 water balance equation 4 v i j 1 v i j q in i j q out i j δ t where δ t is the operational time step such as one day period v i j and v i j 1 are the reservoir storage volume at the beginning and end of a day q in i j and q out i j are the reservoir inflow and outflow on j th day of the i th year among which q out i j would be determined based on the current storage v i j and the inflow q in i j according to both the flood control rule x z q and the refill rule curve y 2 reservoir storage volumes limitation 5 v min v i j v max where v min is the minimum reservoir storage volume and v max is the maximum storage volume 3 basic flood control security 6 r f 0 where r f represents the probability of the reservoir water level exceeding the highest safe water level during the flood season li et al 2014 4 reservoir release limitations 7 q min q out i j min q safe q cap where q min is the minimum required water discharge q safe is the water discharge corresponding to the controlled water level q cap stands for the maximum discharge capability 5 limitation of hydropower output p i j 8 p min p i j p max where p min and p max represent the firm and maximum output of the hydropower station respectively 6 restriction on daily change rate of the water level z 9 δ z δ z max 10 δ z δ z max where δ z and δ z are decrease and increase of the daily water level respectively δ z max and δ z max represent the maximum allowable decrease and increase of the daily water level respectively 2 2 2 lower level water conservation operation the lower level decision maker i e the water conservation department could operate the reservoir for multiple purposes this study mainly focuses on hydropower generation during the refill period and the non flood season in this paper the operation rules are optimized with long series of historical daily inflow data to calculate the annual average output e avg the lower level objective function is defined as 11 max f e avg 1 n i 1 n j 1 m k q i j h i j where k is the hydropower output coefficient q i j is the outflow and h i j is the water head of the reservoir on the j th day of the i th year n is the number of years and m is the number of time steps days during the operational horizon in addition the pre impoundment of the reservoir is proposed and the starting date is advanced to the later period of the flood season the refill rule curve is controlled by several target water levels at the end of each time interval y y 1 y 2 y i while the refill rule curve is set to rise steadily between every two target water levels in practice the refill rule curve is suggested to range between the flwl and nswl of the reservoir 12 flwl y 1 y 2 y i nswl note that the constraints presented in equations 4 10 are also applicable to the lower level model 2 3 iblp model with cooperation degree combining the upper and lower level together the iblp model for rpp is formulated as 13 min x f p r f 1 s k 1 s v k peak v flood s t flwl z 1 x 1 z 2 x 2 z i x i nswl y arg max y f e avg 1 n i 1 n j 1 m k q i j h i j s t flwl y 1 y 2 y i nswl v i j 1 v i j q in i j q out i j δ t v min v i j v max r f 0 q out i j q safe q out i j q cap p min p i j p max δ z δ z max δ z δ z max in this model the rational reaction set of the lower level ψ x arg max y f x y y y x is a non single point set implying that given the flood control rules the water conservation department can choose multiple optimal refill rule curves to achieve the same amount of maximum hydropower production under this condition the choice of the water conservation department would affect the operational performance of the upper level the water conservation department may choose a refill rule curve that is favorable to reduce flood risk or increase the risk therefore the flood control department at the upper level needs to make a judgment upon the selection tendency of the water conservation department such selection tendency can be interpreted as the water conservation department s cooperation degree with the flood control department from this perspective three approaches are proposed for solving the iblp model for rpp 2 3 1 optimistic approach the flood control department at the upper level believes that the selection tendency of the water conservation department at the lower level is fully cooperative that is if there are multiple optimal solutions for the lower level the water conservation department would always choose the refill rule curve which is beneficial to reduce flood risk for the upper level it is termed the optimistic scenario of bilevel programming dempe 2002 the optimistic iblp model for rpp can be established as follows taking the minimum occupancy rate over y at the upper level 14 min x min y f p r f 1 s k 1 s v k peak v flood s t flwl z 1 x 1 z 2 x 2 nswl y arg max y f e avg 1 n i 1 n j 1 m k q i j h i j s t flwl y 1 y 2 nswl v i j 1 v i j q in i j q out i j δ t v min v i j v max r f 0 q out i j q safe q out i j q cap p min p i j p max δ z δ z max δ z δ z max due to the complex structure of the iblp model the decision variables of the upper and lower level models i e flood control rules and refill rule curve are both simplified as two dimensional decision variables to reduce the computational burden using a 15 day operation time step the upper level variable x consists of two controlled water levels in the first and second half of the pre impounding month the lower level variable y consists of two target water levels on the 15th and 30th day of the pre impounding month and the refill rule curve is set to rise steadily between the above two levels 2 3 2 pessimistic approach the flood control department at the upper level believes that the selection tendency of the water conservation department at the lower level is fully uncooperative that is the water conservation department would always choose the refill rule curve which is detrimental to the flood controlling objective of the upper level model it is termed the pessimistic scenario of bilevel programming dempe 2002 the pessimistic iblp model for rpp can be formulated as follows taking the maximum occupancy rate over y 15 min x max y f p r f 1 s k 1 s v k peak v flood s t flwl z 1 x 1 z 2 x 2 nswl y arg max y f e avg 1 n i 1 n j 1 m k q i

of the optimal solutions of the optimistic and pessimistic models under the hypothesis that the lower level rational reaction set is a non empty compact set and the inducible region satisfies the lower semi continuity condition 2 3 3 partial cooperation approach the optimistic and pessimistic iblp models are defined based on the assumption of full cooperation or non cooperation of the follower denoting two extreme cases of practical problems in practice the willingness of the water conservation department to select a refilling plan in favor of flood safety is not necessarily at the extremes of full or none but lies between them in other words the lower level decision maker might partially cooperate with the upper level aboussoror and loridan 2001 cao and leung 2002 accordingly a partial cooperation iblp model for rpp is proposed as follows 16 min x x f c β inf y ψ x f x y 1 β sup y ψ x f x y f p r f 1 s k 1 s v k peak v flood s t flwl z 1 x 1 z 2 x 2 nswl y arg max y f e avg 1 n i 1 n j 1 m k q i j h i j s t flwl y 1 y 2 nswl v i j 1 v i j q in i j q out i j δ t v min v i j v max r f 0 q out i j q safe q out i j q cap p min p i j p max δ z δ z max δ z δ z max in the above model the upper level objective is set as the partial cooperative objective f c 0 β 1 is a given coefficient which is the predefined cooperation degree between the follower and the leader β represents the probability that the water conservation department would choose the refill rule curve most beneficial to flood control from the optimal solution set conversely 1 β is the probability of selecting the refill rule curve most detrimental to the flood control purpose inf f x y is the upper level objective value when the refill rule curve y is most beneficial to flood control and selected from the rational reaction set ψ x sup f x y is the upper level objective value when the refill rule curve detrimental to flood control is selected in this paper the partial cooperation iblp model for rpp has been set with different values of β in order to analyze the influence of different cooperation degrees on the reservoir operation it can be seen that the optimistic and pessimistic iblp models are two special cases of the partial cooperation iblp model with β 1 and β 0 respectively it has been mathematically proven that the upper level objective value of the partial cooperation model ranges between the values of the optimistic and pessimistic solutions jia et al 2016 17 v opt min x x β inf y ψ x f x y 1 β sup y ψ x f x y v pes v opt min x x inf y ψ x f x y v pes min x x sup y ψ x f x y 2 3 4 optimization method bilevel programming is known to be non convex and strongly np hard different metaheuristics have been applied to bilevel optimization problems such as neural network hu et al 2010 and particle swarm optimization pso zhang et al 2013 zhang et al 2012 to solve the iblp model for rpp a simulation optimization framework based on the mse pso algorithm jiang et al 2007 is proposed which provides practical tools for bilevel programming problems the basic principle of the framework is to apply mse pso iteratively to approximate the optimal solution for both the upper and lower levels at the same time the simulation model of reservoir operation is embedded to evaluate the performance of proposed schemes as shown in fig 2 the solution procedures of the optimistic and pessimistic iblp model for rpp are given as follows step 1 generate randomly a set of initial particles of the upper level decision variable x and transmit it to the lower level step 2 according to each x i particle optimize the maximum power generation value f x i that can be obtained under the given flood control rule through combination of mse pso algorithm and reservoir operation simulation step 3 based on the optimistic or the pessimistic model among all the refill rule curves which satisfy the condition f x i y f x i select y i opt which leads to the lowest flood risk optimistic model or y i pes which leads to the highest flood risk pessimistic model and feed it back to the upper level step 4 calculate and evaluate the realization of the flood control objective by different candidate schemes x i y i using reservoir operation simulation update the decision variable x using mse pso algorithm and transmit the updated set of x particles to the lower level step 5 repeat steps 2 4 until the pre set stopping condition is met and then output the flood control rules x and refill rule curve y as the optimal solution for the partial cooperation iblp model the solution procedure is different from the optimistic and pessimistic models in steps 3 and 4 fig 2 in step 3 both y i opt and y i pes are selected and returned to the upper level then in step 4 the optimistic value v o and the pessimistic value v p of the flood control objective are calculated using x i y i opt and x i y i pes respectively the partial cooperative objective f c is evaluated according to v o v p and the predefined cooperation degree β the decision variable x is then updated using mse pso algorithm and transmitted to the lower level model 2 4 extended evaluation of ig in our previous study wang et al 2020a wang et al 2020b an index ig institutional gap was defined to quantify the deviation of the assumed centralized decision making from the practical hierarchical gaming between flood control and hydropower generation in reservoir optimization operation considering the cooperation potential between flood control and hydropower generation under the ill posed condition the index ig can be improved and expressed as 18 ig δ f i δ f i f β f i par f β f i par where β 0 1 represents the cooperation degree of the lower level water conservation department with the upper level flood control department f β and f β are the optimal values of flood control and power generation objectives respectively solved by the iblp model for rpp with given β f i par and f i par are the values of flood control and power generation objectives respectively corresponding to the i th point on the pareto front obtained by the mop model the choice of the i th point is related to the preference setting of the mop model a further index l i g is defined in this study to evaluate the pareto efficiency loss resulting from the hierarchical gaming process and the ill posed characteristic of reservoir operation problems it is calculated as the ig value related to hydropower generation ig f when the iblp model solution is compared to a mop model solution with an equal value of flood control objective 19 l i g f β f k par if f β f k par in eq 19 a negative value of l i g indicates that the iblp model solutions can only achieve a relatively low overall benefit compared to the pareto optimal solutions that is pareto efficiency loss occurs due to the hierarchical decision making process the loss of optimality could be defined by comparing the deviation of performance between the bilevel model and the single level mop model shafiee jood et al 2018 l i g is an extension of such a definition to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the effects of hierarchical decision structure with the ill posed characteristic on the optimal performance of reservoir operation not only the cooperation degree of the water conservation department with the flood control department but also different preference settings of the mop model solution can be explicitly denoted from the index l i g 3 case study 3 1 pre impoundment problem of tgr the three gorges reservoir tgr i e the world s largest multi purpose hydro junction is a key project in the water resources management of the yangtze river fig 3 with a flood storage capacity of 22 15 billion m3 the tgr can effectively control floods from the upstream of the yangtze river which significantly reduces the flood risk downstream in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river where the most populous and economically developed plain area of china is located in particular it has been practically proven to strengthen watershed protection for the jingjiang river reach and the dongting lake areas which suffered from frequent and disastrous flood damages in the past nakayama and shankman 2013 xia et al 2016 meanwhile the tgr has a firm output of 4990 mw with a total of 18200 mw of installed hydropower capacity up to 2018 the annual generated power of the tgr has exceeded 100 billion kilowatt hours kwh ctg 2018 generally a hydrological year could be divided into two operation periods for the tgr cwrc 2012 flood season from mid june to late september non flood season which includes the refill period october and the water drawdown period from november to 9th june in the next year according to the original design cwrc 1997 the tgr operation focuses on flood control throughout the flood season maintaining the water level at its flwl of 145 m till the end of september at the beginning of october the reservoir refilling procedure would be started and the water level would be gradually raised up to the nswl of 175 m the observed data indicates that more than 8000 m3 s discharge should be retained per day on average in october to fill up the reservoir in the last two decades hydrological regime changes and constructions of upstream cascade reservoirs have significantly decreased the inflow of the tgr during the non flood season resulting in the difficulty of achieving full storage as well as intensified water use conflicts in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river zheng 2016 for example starting from 28th september 2008 the refilling progress of the tgr was hindered in october because a drought occurred in the xiangjiang river area and the tgr had to increase water discharge to alleviate the water shortage in the lower reaches as a result the water level of the tgr only arrived at 172 6 m at the end of refilling on 6th november which was 2 5 m below the nswl it is therefore necessary to improve the original tgr operation rules for an effective reservoir impoundment numerous studies used mop modeling to optimize the tgr operation scheme for pre impoundment during post flood periods li et al 2014 x liu et al 2011a liu et al 2011b in practice the tgr has gone into the stage of experimental pre impoundment since 2010 nevertheless there is still a gap between the research results and practical operation schemes for the tgr pre impoundment particularly researchers proposed that reservoir refilling should start from 1st september and the water level should reach 160 m on 30th september but for the past several years the tgr started refilling on 10th september and the water level normally ranged from 162 m to 165 m on 30th september for example as the real operation data of the year 2020 shows fig 4 despite the occurrence of large floods in july and august the maximum reservoir water level was still lower than 165 m by the end of the flood season leaving a certain margin for safety 3 2 hierarchical decision structure of tgr operation early refilling of the tgr involves two decision makers and can be formulated by the leader follower decision making structure fig 5 as the leader the general commands of flood control and drought relief of china and of the yangtze river regarded as a single entity in this study the gcfd sets flood control standards and determines flood control rules to reduce the potential flood risk of the tgr dam and the downstream areas as the follower the china three gorges corporation ctgc directly makes plans for hydropower generation and reservoir impoundment the ctgc also needs to consider the benefits and losses of other departments such as the changjiang waterway bureau and china s state grid for simplification the bilevel modeling of the tgr operation mainly focuses on the relationship between the gcfd and ctgc 3 2 1 flood control rules the originally designed operation rule of the tgr would preserve all reservoir storage above the fixed flwl for flood control at the jingjiang river reach jingjiang compensating flood control which is described as follows cwrc 1997 1 in principle the tgr water level should be kept at the flwl of 145 m during the whole flood season i e releasing the same amount of water as its inflow 2 when the water level is above 145 m the discharge of the tgr should be controlled so that the water level at the shashi hydrological station should not exceed 44 5 m if the corresponding return period of the seasonal design inflow is 100 year or smaller or the water level of the tgr is lower than 171 m 3 the discharge of the tgr should be controlled so that the water level at the shashi hydrological station should not exceed 45 m if the corresponding return period of the seasonal design inflow lies between 100 year and 1000 year or the water level of the tgr lies between 171 m and 175 m in 2009 the ministry of water resources of china revised the tgr operation rule so as to divide part of the reservoir storage for flood control compensation at the chenglingji hydrological station to reduce flood risk of the dongting lake area chenglingji compensating flood control mwr 2009 the division curve of this part of storage i e the cfwl is currently set at 155 m leaving 5 65 billion m3 storage for flood capacity compensation accordingly the operation rule of the tgr has been revised as follows 1 in principle the tgr water level should be kept at 145 m during the whole flood season i e releasing the same amount of water as its inflow 2 when the water level ranges between 145 m and 155 m the discharge of the tgr should be controlled so that the water level at the chenglingji hydrological station does not exceed 34 4 m if the corresponding return period of the seasonal design inflow is less than or equal to 100 year 3 when the water level is above 155 m the discharge of the tgr should be controlled so that the water level at the shashi hydrological station does not exceed 44 5 m if the corresponding return period of the seasonal design inflow lies between 100 year and 1000 year therefore there is an increasing need for the tgr to regulate smaller inflows as well as reduce the flood risk of the lower reach during the post flood period this study mainly seeks to improve the current fixed cfwl by optimizing a set of multistage cfwls as the decision variable of the gcfd which is represented by a set of two lines in the first and second half months of september i e x x 1 x 2 according to operation experiences and findings of related studies li et al 2014 mwr 2009 zheng 2016 the tgr s controlled discharge for the jingjiang compensating flood control and chenglingji compensating flood control are proposed as 55000 m3 s and 42000 m3 s respectively the corresponding controlled water discharges are therefore not considered as decision variables of the upper level model 3 2 2 refill rules originally the refilling procedure of the tgr is given as follows at the end of the flood season the water level is gradually raised from the flwl of 145 m to the nswl of 175 m in october a refill rule curve would provide a guideline for the progress of impoundment as stated in the tgr operation rules enacted by the changjiang water resources commission in 2012 the refilling starts on 10th september and the water level can be raised to 165 m at the end of september cwrc 2012 during the early refilling in the post flood season the operation of the tgr should transfer from impoundment to flood control pattern when a flood is forecasted in the near future in this study the starting date of impoundment is further advanced to 1st september so as to verify the effectiveness of an earlier pre impoundment strategy the initial water level of the refill rule curve is 145 m on 1st september and the ending target water level of the refill rule curve is set as 175 m on 31st october between 145 m and 175 m the refill rule curve is controlled by two target water levels on 15th september and 30th september respectively i e y y 1 y 2 the curve rises evenly between the controlled water levels optimizing these two decision variables could improve the commonly used linear refilling progress to reflect whether the water conservation department employs fast or slow refilling progress i e risk seeking or risk averse zeng et al 2021 during the pre impoundment period 3 3 input data and constraints overview simulation and calculation of the case study are based on the 131 year from 1882 to 2012 historical daily inflow series of the tgr the minimum water discharge q min is 10 000 m3 s and 8000 m3 s for the tgr in september and october respectively the maximum allowable increase of the daily water level δ z max for impoundment of the tgr is 3 m the decrease of the daily water level δ z max should not exceed 2 m during floods and 0 6 m in the non flood season these settings mainly serve the demands for navigation ecological water use downstream and bank stability cwrc 2012 mwr 2009 4 results and discussion 4 1 hierarchical competition between flood control and hydropower generation 4 1 1 operation performance according to the optimization results both the optimistic and pessimistic iblp models can derive the same annual average of hydropower generation in september and the subsequent non flood season from 1st october to 9th june in the next year i e 62 27 billion kwh per year meanwhile the average occupancy rate of reservoir storage for flood control is 0 20 and 0 25 in the optimistic and pessimistic cases respectively note that the basic flood control security see eq 6 is guaranteed under both two models the feasible regions of iblp models and the mop model for rpp of the tgr are illustrated in fig 6 given a flood control rule i e cfwls within the constraint domain the water conservation department can use the optimistic and pessimistic approaches as defined in section 2 3 to determine the refill rule curve respectively following that a series of cfwls and refill rule curves are derived as sets of feasible solutions forming the feasible regions of the optimistic iblp model orange line and pessimistic iblp model blue line respectively the feasible region of the mop model consists of all sets of cfwls and refill rule curves considering the constraint conditions the lower envelope curve of this feasible region is the pareto front curve of the mop model black dashed line as can be seen the feasible regions of iblp models are only a subset of that from the mop model with the feasible points densely lying over the right lower area above the pareto front curve in the feasible region of the mop model the hydropower generation decreases from 63 0 to 60 5 billion kwh as the preference i e weighting factor for flood control increases in contrast the lowest feasible value of hydropower generation from iblp models is 62 27 billion kwh similarly the minimum feasible value of the average occupancy rate of reservoir storage is raised from 0 09 to 0 2 in the optimistic and 0 25 in the pessimistic scenarios respectively further the feasible region of the pessimistic iblp model lies toward the right part implying that when the ctgc selects a fully non cooperative refilling plan for the gcfd the potential flood risk will approach a relatively high value analysis of ig quantifies the deviation between the ill posed bilevel decision making and the centralized modeling framework in fig 6 five feasible solutions on the pareto front curve corresponding to different preference settings of the mop model are chosen to conduct such analysis points m and n represent the two exceptional cases when the centralized decision maker only focuses on minimizing the potential flood risk and maximizing the hydropower generation respectively at point a the mop model solution results in the same hydropower generation as the iblp model solutions at point b the mop model solution specifies the same value of potential flood risk as the pessimistic iblp model solution fig 7 shows the effects of the preference setting of the mop model on ig values from the optimistic and pessimistic iblp models m k a b and n represent the ig values related to points m k a b and n in fig 6 respectively for the optimistic solution in the segment from the left end m to point a on the pareto front curve the underestimation of the mop model in both potential flood risk and power generation increases as more weight is given to the flood control objective for example at point k the average occupancy rate of flood control storage and hydropower generation are underestimated by 0 07 and 0 74 billion kwh respectively i e i g k δ f k δ f k 0 07 0 74 meantime the largest underestimation occurs at point m with i g m δ f m δ f m 0 11 1 51 where the determination of the refill rule is fully considered with flood safety point a almost overlaps with the optimistic solution point o and the ig values approach zero comparatively in the segment from point a to the right end n of the pareto front curve both the potential flood risk and hydropower production of mop model solutions are smaller than those from the optimistic model and the deviation increases as high preference is given to the hydropower generation objective for the pessimistic solution ig values in terms of hydropower generation are equal to those of the optimistic solution but larger ig values of flood control are derived these results indicate that in the segment between points a and b on the pareto front curve the mop model solution could result in relatively low potential flood risk and a relatively large hydropower generation compared to the pessimistic solution therefore the competition space between flood control and hydropower generation is smaller within an ill posed bilevel decision making framework compared to the results from the centralized model as discussed in the former study wang et al 2020a wang et al 2020b the above implication results from the autonomy of the water conservation department ctgc in this case since the ctgc makes its own decision after the gcfd the refill rule curve could affect the achievement of the gcfd s objective in terms of flood risk prevention the gcfd thus has to take into account the reactions of the ctgc and hence reduce its own decision space in contrast the mop model does not consider such a non perfect cooperative interaction between the two departments that is the mop model tends to ignore the autonomous decision preference of the water conservation department such that the selected upper level solution would likely not be paired with the selected lower level solution in practice resulting in underestimating the potential flood risk as well as hydropower generation 4 1 2 operation schemes as shown in fig 6 the pareto operation schemes determined by the centralized model may not be a feasible choice for the ill posed bilevel decision making process for example point k on the pareto front curve fig 6 corresponds to the cfwls of 155 m for optimistic and pessimistic iblp model solutions point o and p the cfwls are also optimized as 155 m but the refill rule curves are different from those of point k as shown in fig 8 the optimistic model s target water level on 15th september is 149 43 m 7 8 m lower than that of the pessimistic model the target water level on 30th september of the optimistic model is 171 12 m 8 4 m higher than that of the pessimistic model that is in the case of full cooperation the ctgc would adopt a fast in the beginning slowing down later impoundment strategy which is advantageous for reducing the flood risk in the early period of the post flood season in the case of complete non cooperation the ctgc would adopt a slow in the beginning speeding up later impoundment strategy which is detrimental to the flood control objective in comparison with the target water level at 145 m on 15th september and 164 45 m on 30th september the impoundment progress of point k is significantly more conservative than the optimistic and pessimistic solutions correspondingly the average occupancy rate of reservoir storage for flood control of iblp model solutions is higher than that of the mop model f k 0 13 while the hydropower generation is larger than that of the mop model f k 61 53 fig 9 compares the simulated reservoir impoundment process with the operation rules derived from the mop model and iblp models for rpp of the tgr in two inflow scenarios of 1984 and 1998 the flooding process in 1984 was characterized by high inflow at the beginning of september and low inflow in october which could take advantage of pre impoundment it can be seen that the impoundment of both optimistic and pessimistic models starts from the beginning of september with the initial water level at the flwl of 145 m compared to the optimistic solution the pessimistic solution shows a relatively fast rate of impoundment in the first half of september and a relatively slow rate in the latter half of september the water level of the optimistic model is higher than that of the pessimistic model from 15th september operation rules determined from both models suggest the target water level of 175 m of tgr at the end of october the impounding progress of the mop model solution however only starts in the latter half of september and the water level is raised at a slower rate on average than that of the optimistic solution according to the historical data of 1998 the water level of the tgr reached 155 m on 1st september due to large scale floods in early september the reservoir transits to the flood control operation pattern and the water level is higher than the target water level of impoundment both the impoundment process from the optimistic and pessimistic models have been delayed and started not earlier than 10th september in the pessimistic case tgr begins to raise the water level from mid september while the impoundment begins around 20th september in the optimistic case in the late ten days of september the refilling rate specified from the optimistic model would be high with the water level gradually exceeding that of the pessimistic model achieving the target water level of 175 m earlier in late october the tgr has to increase the amount of water release in the optimistic case since the storage is almost complete again the impoundment of the mop model solution begins later than iblp models it is worth noting that the cfwls optimized by the two iblp models are identically equal to the low limit of the cfwls i e 155 m prescribed by the regulation it can be explained by the hierarchical gaming characteristics of reservoir operation since the flood control department is given the leading position the results of iblp models would tend to search the flood control rule with low risk that is the cfwls in cooperative and non cooperative situations would be lowered down to 155 m 4 2 cooperativeness and potential to enhance operation benefit 4 2 1 cooperation potential in fig 10 the optimistic solution point o is very close to the pareto front curve while the pessimistic solution point p is on the right hand side of point o with a significant distance from the pareto front curve as expected this indicates that a hierarchical decision making problem leads to pareto efficiency loss compared to a mop model especially when the non cooperative interactions between the flood control and water conservation departments are taken into account specifically in this case the difference in the average occupancy rate of reservoir storage for flood control between the two solutions is 0 05 this result implies that if the ctgc transitions from the refill rule curve detrimental to flood control to the curve beneficial to flood control the tgr would reduce the potential flood risk as measured by occupancy rate by 20 since both these refill rule curves would lead to a hydropower generation of 62 27 billion kwh the potential reduction of flood risk depends on whether ctgc is willing to select the refilling plan in favor of the gcfd following that such potential of improving flood control security without sacrificing hydropower production can be defined as the cooperation potential c p between flood control and water conservation departments in rpp 4 2 2 influence of cooperation degrees table 1 lists the operation performance of the tgr when the optimistic pessimistic and partial cooperation iblp models are applied as can be seen all three models have obtained the same annual average hydropower generation in september and the subsequent non flood season nevertheless there are significant differences in the potential flood risk in the case of complete non cooperation of the ctgc with the gcfd the pessimistic solution leads to the largest average occupancy rate of reservoir storage for flood control while in the case of full cooperation the optimistic solution leads to the lowest occupancy rate of reservoir storage for flood control in addition the optimistic solution results in relatively high performance compared to the pessimistic solution in terms of the annual average water level at the end of impounding period and reservoir full storage rate the potential flood risk optimized by partial cooperative iblp models with different cooperation degrees lies between the optimistic and pessimistic solutions indicating that in partial cooperative situations the ctgc has considered both the flood control security as well as the water conservation benefits further as the cooperation degree between the ctgc and gcfd varies from 0 to 1 the average occupancy rate of reservoir storage for flood control ranges from the pessimistic solution to the optimistic solution value illustrated in fig 10 solution points of the partial cooperation model lie between the optimistic and pessimistic solution points and would approach the pareto front with an increasing cooperation degree the solution point e with f e par 0 21 f e par 62 32 on the pareto front curve is used to evaluate the pareto efficiency loss l i g in fig 11 ig values in terms of hydropower generation are almost identical among different models i e 0 095 billion kwh on the other hand as expected the ig value related to the flood control objective is the largest when the cgtc is completely uncooperative with the gcfd as the degree of cooperation increases ig f gradually decreases and reaches its minimum under the full cooperation scenario taking point c with β 0 3 for example the ig f e value of this solution is 0 021 which lies between the value of the optimistic solution 0 013 and the pessimistic solution 0 036 at the same time compared with the pessimistic situation of non cooperation cooperation between the cgtc and gcfd can reduce the pareto efficiency loss caused by the hierarchical competitive gaming between flood control and water conservation for reservoir optimization operation especially when the cgtc fully cooperates with the gcfd the optimistic solution point lies nearly on the pareto front and the pareto efficiency loss in this case is almost zero when the partial cooperation model is given with different cooperation degrees 0 β 1 β 2 β 5 1 l i g decreases with increasing cooperation degrees it can thus be concluded that when the water conservation department at the lower level is more willing to cooperate with the flood control department the reservoir operation of pre impoundment would be more efficient and there would be less deviation of flood control security from the ideal centralized decision making therefore it is beneficial to promote cooperation between the water conservation and flood control department especially when the rpp is anyway ill posed such cooperation could be largely facilitated by changes to the institutional structure in terms of how the reservoir operation rules are determined i e the flood control department specifies rules with more consideration of feedback from the water conservation department public reports show that china s ministry of water resources or watershed management commissions will regularly hold reservoir operation decision consultations and technical review conferences for large and medium reservoir operations such as the tgr this would provide a potential negotiation platform for coordinating the flood control and water conservation sectors it is thus necessary and possible for further study to design an efficient information exchange and cooperation mechanism to coordinate the existing institutional structure 4 3 causes of cooperation potential non uniqueness of optimal refill rule curve the non linearity of the lower level objective function eq 11 leads to the effect of equivalence of multiple refill rule curves with respect to hydropower generation as shown in fig 12 when the cfwls during the tgr pre impoundment period x are set high 164 m medium 159 m or low 155 m the ctgc can search multiple refill rule curves leading to the same annual average hydropower generation in september and the non flood season not considering all the reservoir operation constraints as the target hydropower production increases the contour accumulates to a smaller range indicating that the effect of equivalence becomes less significant moreover fig 12 shows that such an effect applies to wet years p 12 5 flat years 37 5 p 62 5 and dry years p 87 5 basically the target water level on 30th september y 2 decreases with increasing the target water level on 15th september y 1 implying that two types of impoundment strategies could specify the same hydropower generation one strategy is fast in the beginning slowing down later and the other is slow in the beginning speeding up later it is noteworthy though that in wet years y 1 and y 2 increase simultaneously while the hydropower generation remains constant the year 1886 is selected as a typical wet year p 12 5 for further analysis of the simulated reservoir operation process when the cfwls are set as 155 0 m two points y 161 26 167 85 and y 169 89 170 40 relate to the same annual average hydropower generation 77 48 billion kwh however the impounding progress of y is faster than y during the whole period as can be seen from fig 13 the difference between the two storage schemes is mainly in the impoundment period from september to october in the first half of september 1886 the impounding scheme y generated more hydropower than y because of lower water levels and larger discharge at the end of september due to the occurrence of a large flood the tgr had to transition from pre impoundment to flood control operation pattern and water release was significantly increased in this situation the impounding scheme y results in a relatively high hydropower generation because of the high water head on the other hand when taking the reservoir operation constraints into account the feasible optimum of refill rule curves with respect to hydropower generation would fall on a lower contour which makes non uniqueness of the optimum more significant as fig 14 shows given the cfwls set as 159 m multiple points on the contour corresponding to 62 76 billion kwh power production are both feasible and optimal under the tgr operation constraints eq 4 10 thus it can be concluded that the non linear characteristic of the hydropower generation objective function the constraints and chosen operation patterns in practical reservoir operation together have led to the ill posedness of the problem differences in performance could also come from the optimization algorithm not finding the optimum care with selection of the optimization algorithm and the size of the effect found suggest this is a minor factor in this case 4 4 limitations and future work the findings of this study have to be seen in light of some limitations to the generalization of the modeling framework which could be addressed in future research first the study proposed a bilevel modeling framework with one leader and one follower the upper and lower level decision makers pursue a single objective i e flood control and hydropower generation while other purposes of reservoir operation such as navigation and ecological release are regarded as constraints in practice however decision making of multi purpose reservoirs involves multiple departments with conflicting purposes including industrial and agricultural water supply navigation and environmental water uses interactions between stakeholders at each managerial level need to be considered in reservoir optimization operation problems yao et al 2020 in many cases flood control security objectives of the dam the upstream and the downstream areas may differ in priority and are thus on different decision levels moreover multi reservoir systems can have an equal or unequal distribution of operation rights among parallel and cascade reservoirs therefore the iblp model in this study is still limited to specific scenarios and cannot fully address the complex institutional relationships in reservoir system operation problems based on recent progress in model research the iblp model framework could be further expanded to multi objective bilevel programming deb and sinha 2010 saini and kailey 2022 zhang et al 2013 multi level programming models fakhry et al 2022 han et al 2015 lu et al 2016 and multi leader multi follower game basilico et al 2020 goshu and kassa 2022 lu et al 2022 zhou et al 2018 second the study presumes a stackelberg game in which the leader has complete information on possible reactions and the selection preference of the follower and the follower knows perfectly which choice is beneficial for the leader nevertheless incomplete information exchange or information asymmetry between the flood control and water conservation departments often applies in real case such information barriers would cause even more efficiency loss in the hierarchical gaming process with local optimal solutions le cadre et al 2019 zeng et al 2019 furthermore the uncertainty in decisions causes the problem to be stochastic and equilibrium programming heidari et al 2020 wang et al 2020a in this regard new strategies need to be introduced to reach the equilibrium state of the stackelberg game such as contract design chernonog 2021 xiong et al 2021 repeated games alcantara jiménez and clempner 2020 and hierarchical reinforcement learning method cao et al 2022 finally the study mainly focused on the non uniqueness of optimal solutions for the lower level objective i e hydropower generation accordingly the discussion in this paper is more inclined toward the willingness of the follower water conservation department to cooperate with the leader flood control department in fact considering the minimization of potential flood risk through optimizing the cfwls and the refill rule curve is a non convex programming problem non unique optimal solutions could also apply to the upper level objective under this circumstance among the multiple operation rule setting solutions which can achieve the lowest flood risk the flood control department could choose the ones favorable to hydropower generation in turn it can be used as an incentive for the water conservation department to motivate their cooperative decision making investigation into the ill posedness of both levels would be an essential part of further work since it provides a necessary basis for developing a two way cooperation mechanism in reservoir operation again building such a cooperation mechanism involves a re examination of current decision structures in which reservoir operation rules are formulated 5 conclusion the present research aimed to gain insight into the competitive cooperative relationship between flood control and hydropower generation in reservoir operations with a hierarchical decision structure taking the tgr pre impoundment problem as an example this study illustrated the characteristic of non unique optimal refill rule curves with respect to hydropower generation the results indicate that not only a competitive but also cooperative relationship exists between the flood control and water conservation department since the water conservation department can choose whether to set a refill rule curve in favor of flood control security following the bilevel modeling framework with the ill posed characteristic this study demonstrated that due to the non uniqueness characteristic of the hierarchical gaming process the competitive cooperative relationship between flood control and hydropower generation would deviate from the trade off relationship from the mop model in the case of the tgr pre impoundment problem competition space between flood control and hydropower generation was narrowed with the lower bound of feasible hydropower generation increasing from 60 5 to 62 27 billion kwh and the minimum feasible value of potential flood risk increasing from 0 09 to 0 2 0 25 meanwhile the cooperation of the ctgc with the gcfd i e choosing a refill rule curve advantageous to flood safety had the potential to reduce the average occupancy rate of reservoir storage for flood control during floods by 20 furthermore as the cooperation degree increased the efficiency loss related to hydropower generation given the same potential flood risk would decrease from 0 342 billion kwh to nearly zero specifically pareto optimality could be nearly achieved in the optimistic situation i e the choice of the water conservation department was very nearly fully cooperative therefore it is crucial to strengthen the cooperative relationship between flood control and hydropower generation to improve the comprehensive performance of reservoir operation future work can focus on developing cooperation and coordination mechanisms between flood control and water conservation departments moreover understanding the effects of seasonal inflow distribution characteristics on the cooperation potential is worthy of further investigation credit authorship contribution statement xin wang conceptualization methodology software

2039,an operational global hydrological model dhi ghm has been developed that provides historical real time 10 day and seasonal forecast simulations at the global scale dhi ghm is comprised of a distributed gridded rainfall runoff model with a spatial resolution of 0 1 and an agile kinematic routing model that moves water between model grid cells and sub catchments and in the river system model output includes gridded hydrological variables such as soil moisture content and different runoff components and discharge at more than 1 million river points globally dhi ghm uses a novel parameterization scheme where global data products of land surface physical characteristics are used to establish relations with model parameters and thus dhi ghm does not rely on local discharge data for model calibration multiple forcing datasets were tested and the combination of era5 precipitation and priestley taylor potential evaporation yielded the overall best results with a median kge of 0 51 and average water balance error of 0 78 based on data from 1667 discharge stations worldwide the model results and the operational system are particularly relevant for organizations with national regional or global scope who need information on large areas at once and for data scarce areas or projects without resources for local scale models keywords data scarce areas global hydrological model global parameterization operational system real time forecasting ungauged catchment modelling data availability all data sources have been exhaustively described in the article 1 introduction global hydrological models ghms provide a comprehensive view of the earth s hydrological system by incorporating global climate datasets rainfall runoff modelling and water routing components at the global scale sood and smakhtin 2015 telteu et al 2021 ghms are increasingly valuable in the context of the global water system alcamo et al 2008 which is comprised of the connection between the global hydrological system and human systems of economics and institutions as worldwide issues such as climate change and globalization become increasingly important water managers need the global picture in

sustainable development goals sdgs un general assembly 2015 sdg 6 clean water and sanitation cannot be addressed in isolation as water resources and water quality decisions are inextricably linked to

as the water food energy nexus holistic optimization using the nexus framework yields different results than when each sector is considered independently payet burin et al 2021 ghms are especially valuable for countries areas or projects that do not have resources or capacity for building a basin scale model for this type of evaluation paul et al 2021 data requirements and limited data collection in these areas are a barrier to modeling and the recent abundance of satellite data that has encouraged ghm development render ghms beneficial to these regions tang et al 2009 the first ghm was developed in 1989 by vorosmarty vörösmarty et al 1989 it consists of a water balance model wbm linked with a water transport model wtm the wbm calculated soil moisture evapotranspiration and surface runoff at the grid level and the wtm routed the generated discharge using a linear reservoir model in the three decades since various types of global models have been developed to answer specific research questions including global land use models used by the climate community dynamic global vegetation models used by the vegetation community and ghms used by the hydrology community some notable land surface and dynamic vegetation models include global water availability assessment gwava meigh et al 1999 lund potsdam jena managed land lpjml bondeau et al 2007 interactions between soil biosphere and atmosphere total runoff integrating pathways isba trip alkama et al 2010 and hydrology tiled ecmwf scheme for surface exchanges over land htessel balsamo et al 2009 some notable

2010 ghms are typically descriptive in nature and are constructed with the aim of providing information relevant for a specific research question rather than explicitly for decision making applications sood and smakhtin 2015 telteu et al 2021 they typically include many processes and parameters rely on observed data for calibration of gauged catchments and regionalization methods for parameter determination in ungauged catchments require large amounts of computational resources and provide historical simulations and static information we have developed a ghm referred to as dhi ghm in the following where the model setup and parameterization are determined based on globally available datasets the dhi ghm model setup presented here is uncalibrated and thus the model does not rely on local data sources for calibration dhi ghm functions as an operational service to provide historical real time 10 day and seasonal forecast simulations at the global scale more complex models do not always yield better results than simple models orth et al 2015 and the tradeoff between simulation time and resolution is a consideration for operational modelling applications however the modelling concept applied in dhi ghm achieves short simulations times at resolutions and complexity comparable to other ghms and allows for frequent forecast updates the model is agile and can produce real time and short term forecasted simulations in less than one hour the limiting factor for the temporal resolution is the update frequency of forcing datasets the global spatial coverage of the model also allows for its use in areas where data and resource scarcity prevent development of local models kauffeldt et al 2013 paul et al 2021 such models are important for water resource management planning in the face of climate change dhi ghm integrates historical real time and forecasted discharge data to provide insights for these data scarce areas 2 material and methods 2 1 model structure dhi ghm spans the globe from 80 n and 60 s the model domain is divided into a series of tiles and cells between 80 n and 60 s there are 574 tiles of 10 10 that each contain a maximum of 10 000 cells of 0 1 0 1 fig 1 those cells where the cell center is not located on an ocean contain modelling elements there are thus just over 1 5 million cells included in dhi ghm the boundaries of dhi ghm are 80 n and 60 s greenland antarctica and land surfaces from 80 n to 90 n are not included in the model glaciology is not a component of dhi ghm though melt from glaciers is included in the snow storage module the model domain thus covers 97 6 of the earth s landmass excluding greenland and antarctica and 99 99 of the earth s total population center for international earth science information network ciesin and columbia university 2018 the modelling elements that comprise dhi ghm are depicted in the conceptual model in fig 2 the input datasets to the model setup are both climate datasets used to force the model and spatial datasets used to describe catchment characteristics for model parameterization rainfall temperature and potential evaporation are input into the model as gridded data and distributed rainfall runoff models compute gridded runoff time series based on this input river discharge at the hydrological catchment level is then computed by the river routing model based on the runoff time series and further is routed to the sea both the gridded rainfall runoff models and hydrological catchments yield valuable hydrologically relevant output datasets dark blue box fig 2 the rainfall runoff modelling elements light green box fig 1 are computed over grids and the river routing elements dark green box fig 1 are computed over hydrological catchments routing is performed at three levels 1 within the grids to move runoff to the grid edge 2 within a hydrological basin to move the runoff from the grid edge to the outlet of the hydrological catchment and 3 from one catchment to the next downstream 2 2 data there are various global datasets that provide the foundation to the development and operation of dhi ghm grouped by use these fall into three categories spatial landmass data used to determine catchment characteristics meteorological data used in model forcing and observed data used for model performance evaluation the ability of the model to produce accurate valuable outputs is dependent on the quality and reliability of the input data and deliberate care was taken when selecting data to inform the model 2 2 1 spatial landmass data the catchment characteristics in dhi ghm are described by the combination of topographical hydrological and geographical datasets the physical delineation of catchments and rivers used in the model were sourced from the world wildlife fund hydrosheds products catchments are sourced from the hydrobasins lakes from the hydrolakes and rivers from the global rivers classification gloric datasets lehner and grill

the entire globe the hydrobasins sub basin breakdown includes basins greater than 100 km2 and uses the pfafstetter coding system up to level 12 pfafstetter 1989 verdin and verdin 1999 it is this finest level that is used in dhi ghm dhi ghm includes 1 017 093 basins of which the average size is approximately 100 200 km2 the hydrolakes dataset consists of polygons depicting the shoreline and providing geometric attributes of all global lakes with a surface area of 0 1 km2 or greater messager et al 2016 each lake is co registered to a sub basin of the hydrobasins dataset lakes and reservoirs from the hydrolakes dataset with an area greater than 10 km2 and on a main river channel are included in dhi ghm this yields a total of 15 052 lakes included in the model the gloric dataset consists of polylines that include integrated climate and biogeochemical classifications for each river reach 35 850 612 km of river are included in the model where the average length of a river reach is 4 2 km average discharge for river reaches in each hydrobasins sub basin a catchment characteristic used during river routing was also sourced from this dataset the increased availability and quality of global remote sensing datasets is integral to the advancement of dhi ghm sood and smakhtin 2015 the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis land cover products mcd12q1 006 and

from five year to monthly time steps water use types include irrigation livestock domestic electricity generation mining and manufacturing at present irrigation use is included in dhi ghm 2 2 2 meteorological data precipitation temperature and potential evaporation datasets are required inputs to dhi ghm recent historic current and forecasts of each of these three types of data are required

current conditions forecasts in 15 min time steps up to 7 days in the future and forecasts in 1 h time steps from 7 to 15 days in the future for the entire globe currently the hourly 10 day period is used for short medium range forecasting though this can be modified to other period lengths precipitation and temperature ensemble forecasts for 9 months in the future are sourced from the ncep ncar reanalysis 1 dataset for seasonal forecast simulations kalnay et al 1996 the forecasts are archived once daily for future discharge forecast simulation analysis recent historical precipitation data

the previous simulation s first timestep based on the ibm weather company forecasts ibm 2018a additionally the ibm weather company current state product is used during dhi ghm operation ibm 2018b the current state product provides real time information for precipitation and temperature for two time steps two hours prior to the current time at the same spatiotemporal resolution as the ibm weather company forecasts to inform the current state for seasonal forecasts which are simulated every other day the gpm imerg late dataset from nasa is used huffman et al 2019 the gpm late product provides precipitation data at with a minimum latency of 12 h this dataset is combined with the historical precipitation dataset as new daily data is available and is used as input to seasonal forecast simulations because of the domain of the gpm dataset dhi ghm seasonal forecasts span 80 n and 60 s various forcing datasets were used during evaluation of dhi ghm model performance evaluation was carried out at a daily timestep for the period 2001 2009 and historical time series from this period were used in the assessment multiple time series were assessed during the historical evaluation and the forcing datasets with the best global performance were selected for use in dhi ghm operational system these historical datasets selected for use are described here and the other evaluated data are described in the supplementary material precipitation and temperature data used during model evaluation are sourced from the copernicus european centre for medium range weather forecasts reanalysis 5th generation era5 dataset hersbach et al 2018 this dataset gives global coverage of many environmental variables at a 0 25 0 25 resolution from 1979 to approximately 5 days from the present day the potential evaporation data used is a priestley taylor potential evaporation dataset calculated via the methods described in mcmahon et al 2013 the priestley taylor formula is as seen in equation 1 1 e

version of the penman monteith model where the vapor pressure deficit and vapor pressure resistance are combined into the empirical constant αp priestley and taylor 1972 αp was selected based on the methods described by shuttleworth 1993a and varies spatially based on ecological zones described by the fao forest resources assessment program fao 2001 a value of 1 74 was selected for the following zones subtropical desert subtropical dry forest temperate desert temperate steppe except north america tropical desert tropical dry forest tropical moist forest and tropical shrubland a value of 1 1 was selected for tropical forests due to the humid conditions a value of 1 5 was assigned to temperate zones and 1 26 was assigned to all remaining zones a time series for the parameter δ was calculated for the daily mean temperature in each grid cell mcmahon et al 2013 the daily mean temperature was calculated from the daily maximum and minimum 2 m temperature at 6 hr timesteps from the

and temporally constant value of 2 54 mj m 2 d 1 for λ was selected as this is the latent heat of vaporization for water at 20 c mcmahon et al 2013 g was assumed to be zero shuttleworth 1993b the priestley taylor equation is valid up to latitude 65 n values from the terraclimate dataset abatzoglou et al 2018 are used from 65 n to 80 n averages for each day from 2000 to 2021 are used during forecasting the yearly average priestley taylor potential evaporation is depicted in fig s14 2 2 3 observed river discharge data evaluation of dhi ghm performance is founded on comparisons to observed river discharge the global runoff data centre grdc operated under the auspices of the wmo maintains a database of river discharge time series the global runoff data centre 2021 grdc data from approximately 1200 stations with catchment areas greater than 5000 km2 were used during evaluation the gdrc has compiled information about each station including its catchment area river discharge data is generally collected and maintained by national governments and research institutions and discharge data from the following countries national databases supplement the grdc dataset australia austria bangladesh brazil denmark ethiopia france germany switzerland and the united states note that the average river discharge in each hydrobasins sub basin a parameter used in river routing is a catchment characteristic sourced from the gloric database ouellet dallaire et al 2019 it is not directly based on observed values in the dhi ghm model setup 2 3 distributed rainfall runoff models the hydrological model element of the dhi ghm is comprised of distributed gridded rainfall runoff models specifically the nedbør afstrømnings model nam asger nielsen and hansen 1973 dhi a s 2022 that span the model domain the model domain from 80 n to 60 s is divided into a series of tiles and cells fig 1 cells are approximately 11x11 km at the equator and slightly smaller toward the poles and each cell situated over landmass contains a nam the earth s landmass between 80 n and 60 s thus spans 321 tiles and corresponds to 1 516 836 nam cells in dhi ghm the nam describes the rainfall runoff process by continuously accounting for the water content in four different yet interrelated storage compartments 1 snow storage 2 surface storage 3 lower root zone storage and 4 groundwater storage these four storage compartments are represented as the boxes in fig 3 of the fifteen parameters in the nam nine are most important to describe how water moves through between the storage compartments these nine parameters are listed in table 1 in traditional nam parameter estimation the nine nam parameters of primary importance are calibrated for a specific catchment against observed discharge time series data for that catchment autocalibration methods are typically used to minimize root mean square error between the simulated and observed discharge madsen 2000 and can only be applied to catchments where observed time series are available for global model calibration using autocalibration methods the parameters of relatively few catchments with observations are transferred to ungauged areas by regionalization dhi has used an a priori physical estimation approach for nam parameters to avoid parameter bias toward a specific forcing dataset and to make optimal use of global datasets which are not easily included in a traditional calibration process the nine relevant nam parameters are related to the physical characteristics of a catchment where the parameters are estimated based on physical catchment characteristics and evaluated against rivers around the globe where observed datasets exist dhi ghm as presented here is an uncalibrated model the nam parameters are determined from the globally available spatial landmass datasets described above and thereby also cover ungauged areas the distributed rainfall runoff models produce relevant hydrological time series datasets at the gridded 0 1 0 1 resolution and hourly or daily timestep these include runoff overland flow interflow baseflow snow coverage actual evaporation and soil moisture 2 3 1 root zone storage maximum lmax and surface zone storage maximum umax the maximum root zone storage lmax is the maximum soil water available for evapotranspiration it is estimated using global gridded datasets including modis land cover carroll et al 2017 friedl and sulla menashe 2019 and depth to bedrock shangguan et al 2017 root depth is estimated based on the type of land cover yang et al 2016 where for example forests are described by a root depth of 1800 mm shrubland by 800 mm and urban environments by 600 mm all root depth classifications are included in table s1 if bedrock depth is less than the root zone depth this depth is used instead lmax is calculated by multiplying the root zone depth by the available soil water the distribution of lmax spans from 0 01 mm to 372 mm with the largest values found in wet climates and the lowest values found in dry climates fig s4 the maximum water content in the surface storage umax is the water content in the interception storage in surface depression storages and in the uppermost few centimeters of the soil this is estimated as 10 of lmax 2 3 2 overland flow runoff coefficient co and threshold value for overland flow to the overland flow runoff coefficient co determines the distribution of excess rainfall between overland flow and infiltration co is determined by a relationship to the permanent wilting point of the soil which is the minimum soil moisture where plants do not experience wilting defined by hihydrosoil v2 0 as soil moisture at 16 times greater than atmospheric pressure simons et al 2020 as the wilting point increases co also increases fig s1 when soil can retain more water unavailable for uptake by vegetation it is more likely that rainfall results in overland flow in the nam co varies between 0 3 and 0 95 for the globe fig s5 overland flow is only generated if the relative moisture content in the root zone storage is larger than the threshold value for overland flow to a lower to therefore means less soil moisture is required before overland flow is allowed in the model the wilting point s inverse correlation to to mirrors its positive correlation to co fig s1 the greater the soil s capacity to hold residual water unavailable for uptake by vegetation the more easily that rainfall will result in overland flow in the nam to varies between 0 5 and 0 8 for the globe fig s6 2 3 3 threshold value for recharge tg recharge to the groundwater storage is only generated if the relative moisture content in the lower zone storage is larger than the threshold value for recharge tg global determination of tg is based on a linear relationship with the drainable porosity fig s2 drainable porosity is calculated by subtracting the field capacity from the saturated soil moisture content field capacity is defined by hihydrosoil v2 0 as the amount of soil moisture or water content held in the soil after excess water has drained away and the rate of downward movement has decreased simons et al 2020 when tg is zero recharge to the groundwater occurs regardless of the soil moisture content this is the case when the drainable porosity and hence infiltration capacity is high such as in sandy soils a larger pore space is filled and emptied by gravity and recharge to the groundwater is expected to occur at any soil moisture level as the drainable porosity decreases the amount of soil moisture required before recharge to the groundwater storage occurs increases and tg increases the relationship is based on the soil water characteristics for hydrological applications defined by saxton and rawls 2006 the value for tg varies between 0 and 0 98 for the globe fig s7 2 3 4 threshold value for interflow ti interflow is only generated if the relative moisture content in the lower zone storage is larger than the threshold value for interflow ti ti like tg is dependent on drainable porosity but the relationship is inverse to that of tg fig s3 high drainable porosity indicates that water is less likely to move as interflow and corresponds to a higher ti as the drainable porosity decreases the likelihood for interflow to occur increases and the ti decreases the value for ti varies between 0 02 and 1 00 for the globe fig s8 2 3 5 time constant for overland flow and interflow routing cr the time constants ck1 and ck2 denoted cr as a pair describe routing of overland flow and interflow through two linear reservoirs in series as is typical in nam ck1 is set equal to ck2 such that the same value describes both parameters madsen et al 2002 global estimation for cr is based on the us natural resources conservation service curve number nrcs cn method natural resources conservation service nrcs 1986 to determine direct runoff from a rainfall event based on land cover type and the ncrs hydrologic soil group hsg a curve number can be assigned to the globe s land surface there are four relevant soil types for the curve number method which are categorized by high moderate slow and very slow infiltration rates curve numbers for fair soil quality for each of the sixteen modis land cover types carroll et al 2017 friedl and sulla menashe 2019 and four hsgs were determined for the globe by zeng et al 2017 fig s11 determination of the cr using the curve number method is based on the time of concentration dhi a s 2022 natural resources conservation service nrcs 1986 the time of concentration is the time for runoff to travel from the hydraulically most distant point of a watershed to a point of interest in dhi ghm the point of interest is the outlet of the grid cell and the time of concentration is effectively cr the time for runoff to travel the length of the grid cell the time of concentration tc is described as 2 t c t l 0 6 where the lag time tl is the time between the center of the rainfall event and the runoff peak tl is described by 3 t l 32 8 10 3 l 0 8 1000 n avg 9 0 7 1900 y 0 5 where l km is the hydraulic length of the grid cell navg is the average curve number of the grid cell area and y is the average grid cell slope the hydraulic length of each grid cell is the square root of the portion of the 0 1 0 1 cell that includes land for most grid cells this is around 9 km the slope is calculated for each grid cell from the nasa srtm nasa jpl 2013 the value for tc and thus for cr varies from nearly 0 to 2500 hrs for the globe fig s9 2 3 6 baseflow time constant cb and time constant for interflow from the surface storage ci baseflow from the groundwater storage is generated using a linear reservoir model with time constant cb this is estimated globally using the total watershed runoff conceptual model developed by vogel and kroll 1992 the baseflow time constant is described by 4 c b e π 2 k s d 2 f α where k m hr 1 is the saturated hydraulic conductivity s the slope of the land surface d m 1 the drainage density of the basin f the drainage porosity of the soil and α a correction factor based on the aquifer to land area ratio saturated hydraulic conductivity is estimated using the wilting point and field capacity based on the soil water characteristics established by saxton and rawls 2006 drainage porosity is calculated as the soil saturation minus the field capacity leenaars et al 2015 it is assumed that all areas have groundwater and the land to aquifer area correction factor α is only applied to areas of a grid cell that contain large lakes or ocean the model developed by vogel and kroll 1992 is only valid for horizontal water tables in mountainous regions with sloped bedrock cbis calculated using the method presented in zecharias and brutsaert 1988 the time constant of groundwater flow for a sloped groundwater table is given by 5 c b f b 2 2 k p d cos 2 θ b sin θ where f is the drainable porosity b m is the horizontal aquifer length k m hr 1 is the hydraulic conductivity d m is the depth from the ground surface to the impermeable layer θ is the slope of the impermeable layer and p is a constant arising during linearization that is set to 1 drainable porosity and hydraulic conductivity were calculated as described above the value for cbvaries from 0 to 15 000 hrs with a skew toward the shorter time constants figure s10 the time constant for interflow from surface storage ci was set to half the value of the time constant for baseflow cb 2 4 kinematic routing model the speed and agility of the routing element of dhi ghm is one of its greatest strengths it is this ghm s routing method that allows for sub daily real time simulation and short range forecasting in over 1 000 000 basins in the globe routing of water in the model can be conceptualized in three steps fig 4 first water is routed as runoff within each cell using that cell s nam next runoff is routed kinematically between cells within each hydrobasins catchment lehner and grill 2013 in this second step the water is routed to that catchment s outlet the location where the river crosses the delineation of the catchment polygon lastly the water is routed kinematically between catchments from one sub basin to the next sub basin downstream kinematic river routing is modeled based on the manning formula for open channel flow manning 1891 6 v m r 2 3 s where v ms 1 is the cross sectional average velocity m m1 3s 1 is the manning coefficient r m is the hydraulic radius and s is the channel slope the slope of the river within each sub basin is calculated from the strm dem jarvis et al 2008 as the difference between the average elevation and minimum elevation within each catchment a manning coefficient of 15 is applied throughout dhi ghm to all basins the river routing and routing calculated in nam are separated mathematically in the model but in actuality these two processes are linked there is thus a connection between the nam parameter cr and the manning coefficient and the manning coefficient can be changed individually for each basin which allows for further refinement of the model if we assume a 1 10 triangular cross section in the river channel we can approximate the hydraulic radius as 7 r a 2 10 where a m2 is the cross sectional area of the river because the cross sectional river area is equal to the discharge divided by the velocity and the average river discharge is known the manning formula can be rewritten to solve for the average velocity of the water through the channel equation 8 8 v avg 0 4 q avg 0 25 m s 0 75 this allows for simulation of flow without explicit information as to the channel cross sectional area the velocity at a timestep can then be calculated from the discharge at that timestep which is produced by the rainfall runoff model and information from the previous timestep equation 9 9 v v avg q q avg 0 4 2 5 additional modelling elements 2 5 1 snow storage a degree day snow model that is distributed by altitude accounts for variation of meteorological variables with altitude in the distributed rainfall runoff models water is modeled as retained in snow in elevation zones which is particularly relevant within mountainous hydrological catchments this allows for accumulation of snow and variation of precipitation and temperature in grid cells with large elevation variation elevations zones are 200 m in height most of the modeled domain is designated as having only one zone and mountainous regions with high topographic variation can have up to sixteen zones fig 5 each elevation zone contains its own rainfall runoff model snow is allowed to build up to a certain threshold within a zone and continuous build up above the threshold is transferred to lower elevation zones the conceptual diagram in fig 6 shows a grid cell with two additional snow storage zones when snow storage in the higher zones is full excess snow moves into the next lower zone the snow physics included in the model is kept relatively simple and each elevation zone is modeled to have a snow water storage of 7 judson and doesken 2000 runoff can occur from all three zones simultaneously and the combined runoff from all elevation zones is routed in the nam grid cell and further by the kinematic routing model 2 5 2 retention in lakes in the kinematic routing model flow through lakes or reservoirs along major rivers is retarded by accounting for water retention in the lake reservoir using a linear reservoir model 10 c k bd q avg where ck s is the time constant b m2 is the active lake or reservoir area d m is the average active depth of the water body and qavg m3s 1 the average discharge of the river lakes are assumed to have an average active depth of 0 5 m and reservoirs an average active depth of 1 m the effect of retention in a lake is applied to the outlet of the sub basin containing the lake the retardation affects a proportion of the discharge equal to the proportion of the lake area to the catchment area lakes or reservoirs that span more than one catchment are applied to the outlet of the most downstream catchment there is an option for increased evaporation to be applied to lake surfaces for further model refinement 2 5 3 water use because the global water cycle is inextricably linked to human activity it is imperative that global hydrological modelling activities include water withdrawals sood and smakhtin 2015 van beek et al 2011 water use irrigation is included in the dhi ghm kinematic routing model using withdrawal data huang et al 2018 applied at hydrobasins level 6 catchments lehner and grill 2013 which are approximately 10 000 km2 in size water withdrawn from a catchment is stored at that catchment s outlet water is used during dry growing periods and stored during the remainder of the year with a maximum storage capacity of one month at each catchment outlet after the storage is full the water is routed through and the storage can be emptied each month irrigated water is modeled as a sink because water applied to fields generally evaporates rather than entering back into the rainfall runoff model as overland flow or interflow there is an option for groundwater abstraction to be included in the model in the irrigation component though this is not included at the model s current stage of development likewise explicit regulation on waterways is not included river routing accounts only for natural flow with the monthly irrigation modelling component at each catchment outlet 2 6 model performance evaluation as the dhi ghm presented here has undergone neither calibration nor validation the modelling concept was instead subjected to a performance evaluation process where the goodness of fit of simulated discharge produced using varied forcing datasets was compared to observed discharge by this evaluation global and regional scale confirmation of dhi ghm have been conducted to test the goodness of the model oreskes et al 1994 and ensure it yields the best overall results using available datasets observed time series of daily discharge for 1667 flow stations for the period 2001 2009 were compared to their corresponding model simulation results two methods were used to evaluate dhi ghm performance at these locations one is the water balance error wbe in which the average annual volume of water simulated is compared to the average annual volume of water observed a wbe of 0 indicates a perfect fit the second metric is the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 which in addition to accounting for volume also accounts for flow variability and dynamics qi et al 2022 the kge is defined as 11 e 1 r 1 2 q avg s i m q avg o b s 1 2 c v s i m c v o b s 1 2 where r is the linear correlation between observations and simulations q avg s i m and q avg o b s m3s 1 are the mean simulated and mean observed discharge respectively and c v s i m and c v o b s are the coefficients of variation of the simulated and observed discharge respectively the optimal value for kge is one indicating perfect agreement between simulated and observed discharge time series unlike other performance metrics used in hydrology like the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse kge has no inherent lower threshold for the nse metric zero is the case of no correlation between simulations and observations and zero is then sometimes used as a lower bound for kge out of convenience however the case of no correlation in kge where r 0 in equation 11 yields 0 41 knoben et al 2019 presentation of kge results thus spans from 0 41 to 1 with values below the lower threshold investigated independently in section 4 1 the kge results are also evaluated against upper and lower benchmarks seibert et al 2018 the lower benchmark values were produced globally with all observation stations by executing dhi ghm with the same historical forcing dataset but with default nam parameter values table s2 and omission of lake and reservoir routing the upper benchmark values are produced in six river basins elbe loire oder rhein seine vistula using 213 observation stations by execution of a regional calibration procedure the open source hyperparameter optimization framework optuna akiba et al 2019 was used to perform multi objective optimization of kge in each basin the routine included weighting by upland area for each observation station within the basin by a factor of area0 25 in the kinematic routing model the optimal manning coefficient was determined for each basin and applied to all sub catchments at the gridded level the potential evaporation priestley taylor αp and the nine nam parameter relations table 1 were adjusted where a calibration factor was applied to all grid cells in the basin the co ti to and tg relationships to wilting point and drainable porosity are defined by two parameters each figures s1 s2 and s3 in total 15 parameters were adjusted during basin level calibration 3 results 3 1 model output dhi ghm produces both gridded and sub basin level simulation results the distributed rainfall runoff model element produces gridded hydrological data including runoff overland flow interflow baseflow snow coverage actual evaporation and soil moisture the data is available at 0 1 0 1 resolution for the globe from 60 s to 80 n real time and short to medium range forecast outputs are calculated hourly at hourly timesteps seasonal forecast outputs are calculated every other day at daily time steps fig 7 shows runoff simulation results produced using the era5 precipitation and priestley taylor potential evaporation datasets as part of the historical simulation operation of dhi ghm these results are representative of what is produced and available at each time step discharge model outputs are also produced for each sub basin fig s15 shows example historical discharge model results for the nile basin from 2000 to 2021 produced using the era5 precipitation and priestley taylor potential evaporation forcing datasets hersbach et al 2018 mcmahon et al 2013 priestley and taylor 1972 both gridded and sub basin scale model results are available operationally through an api key and through a web application to provide data users access to hydrological data of global regional or national interest 3 2 model performance because it has been shown previously with the watergap model that the dominating source of model uncertainty in ghms stems from the input data palmer et al 2008 preliminary model simulations were conducted to select the best performing forcing datasets the era5 precipitation dataset and priestley taylor potential evaporation datasets were selected for use in dhi ghm operational system because these datasets best cover the model domain and yield the overall best results see supplementary material for details the tested period for model performance evaluation is 9 years from 2001 to 2009 with a warm up period of two years from 1999 to 2001 this period was chosen to be consistent with comparisons available from the isimip study frieler et al 2017 gosling et al 2019 which is discussed in section 4 2 the model evaluation is completed using the observed data points shown in fig s12 and covers 86 of the world s largest basins all of those with long daily observed time series available fig s13 the overall performance of the modelled daily discharge using era5 precipitation and priestley taylor potential evaporation forcing datasets is displayed in fig 8 as a histogram of kge for the 1667 stations evaluated 14 of the observed stations resulted in a kge below the threshold of 0 41 and more than half 55 resulted in a kge between 0 4 and 0 8 of the observed stations that resulted in kges 0 41 the average kge is 0 49 the median kge of all observations is 0 51 the wbe of the model is visualized in a scatter plot found in fig 9 for the 1435 observed discharge points where the kge is above the threshold 0 41 each point on the plots in fig 9 corresponds to an observed discharge station fig 9 shows that most observed stations especially those with larger flow are on or near the parity line stations with a smaller average flow are in general further from 0 wbe a difference of 1 m3s 1 is negligible when the average flow is very large but significant when the flow is very small the model demonstrates little bias as the points appear scattered relatively symmetrically around the parity line evaluation of the model performance on the global and continental scales is relevant to assessing the model s usefulness in various applications and assessing the parameter estimation scheme a continental analysis of the model performance using the era5 precipitation and priestley taylor potential evaporation forcing datasets is displayed in table 2 and fig 10 dhi ghm produces higher kge values in asia europe and north america kges of 0 52 0 55 and 0 49 respectively moderate kge values in south america kge of 0 41 and lower kge values in africa and australia kges of 0 22 and 0 20 respectively out of the 1667 stations evaluated 72 of them are located in europe and north america due to this the median kge for the world 0 51 is closer to the median kges found in europe and north america rather than those in africa and australia geographical trends can be further examined in the continental plots fig 10 arid areas in the rocky mountains in north america the iberian peninsula in europe sub saharan africa and central australia away from the coasts show kges less than zero europe and asia both present with fewer than 20 of kges below 0 41 the highest kge values 0 8 kge 1 are mostly located in western and northern europe and throughout north america excepting the mountainous west 4 discussion 4 1 dhi ghm performance from table 2 and fig 10 it is evident that there is a geographical distribution pattern of dhi ghm performance with higher kge values in temperate areas in north america and europe and lower kge values in dry areas in africa australia and the rocky mountains in north america a total of 232 stations out of the 1667 stations analyzed 14 yielded kge values below the threshold of 0 41 these stations were further investigated to determine the correlation between aridity and water use to the performance of dhi ghm the average aridity index value defined as the ratio of precipitation to potential evapotranspiration of the upland catchment area of the station was calculated based on values determined by zomer et al 2022 water use was investigated in two ways irrigation and reservoir storage capacity huang et al 2018 messager et al 2016 if the magnitude of the irrigation amount in the catchment was more than half of the observed flow it was determined to be heavily impacted by irrigation activity if the magnitude of the reservoir storage capacity summed for the catchment was greater than half of the observed flow it was determined to be heavily impacted by regulation in this case all reservoirs not just those over 10 km2 in area were considered table 3 shows the results of this analysis of the 232 poorly performing stations 54 had upland catchment area with an average aridity index of less than 0 5 20 of the poorly performing stations had an upland catchment area with an irrigation magnitude greater than half that of the observed flow in the catchment 38 of the poorly performing stations had a reservoir storage magnitude greater than half the that of the observed flow in the catchment in all 62 of the poorly performing catchments exhibited one or more of the three characteristics conversely only 12 of catchments with kge above the threshold of 0 41 had an aridity index less than 0 5 2 had an irrigation magnitude greater than half that of the observed flow and 7 had a reservoir storage magnitude greater than half that of the observed flow this indicates that arid areas most impacted by water use should be areas of focus for calibration activities and further model development this outcome is not unusual compared to other global hydrological modelling studies cold polar not antarctica and dry australia and africa regions were found to perform less well in the water and global change watch study that compared ghm performance voss et al 2008 the earth2observe study investigated how much uncertainty in run off simulated by land surface models is due to the model itself and how much is due to uncertainty in the forcing datasets marthews et al 2020 it was found that only in areas of low precipitation did the model uncertainties match or exceed the uncertainty inherent in the forcing datasets in areas with average to high precipitation model uncertainty stemmed mostly from uncertainties in the precipitation datasets water balance comparisons fig 9 show that dhi ghm is relatively unbiased which could be a benefit of the physical parameter estimation approach as it avoids compensation by local forcing biases lower model performance in drier places may stem from the models inability to capture augmented flows as low flows are particularly sensitive to human management veldkamp et al 2018 dhi ghm models natural flow with an irrigation component and in dry areas where natural flow is drastically disrupted such as the in the rocky mountains in north america the model performs less well a study comparing the routing schemes of ghms also determined that it is important to also consider water withdrawal for other sectors e g domestic industrial and flow alteration by structures and floodplains zhao et al 2017 comparison of the catchment specific kge results to those of the upper and lower benchmarks are presented in fig 11 where panel a displays the global analysis and panel b a regional analysis of six river basins that include an upper benchmark the global median kge is 0 51 for dhi ghm and 0 45 for the lower benchmark the regional median kge is 0 53 for the lower benchmark 0 64 for dhi ghm and 0 67 for the upper benchmark the gain in performance of dhi ghm over the lower benchmark is apparent in both the regional and global analyses there is an increase in performance from the applied regional calibration in the six basins included in the upper benchmark analysis though it is less than the increase in performance of dhi ghm fig 11 in both the regional and global analyses there is a change in the shape of the distribution at kge 0 40 where after this point the gap between the benchmarks and dhi ghm begins to decrease this indicates that the value added through dhi ghm s nam parameter estimation method has a larger effect on results below 0 4 fig 10 shows that many catchments with kge results in this range are located in africa asia and australia continents with data scarce areas where hydrological modelling applications could be informed by dhi ghm 4 2 dhi ghm and other global models performance and setup the inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project isimip provides a framework for consistently projecting the impacts from climate change across sectors and scales frieler et al 2017 gosling et al 2019 isimip consists of various simulation rounds where the simulated data from protocol 2a which focuses on regional and global water among other sectors are publicly available at the time of writing gosling et al 2019 various ghms have produced discharge simulations using the isimip2a protocol including the h08 hanasaki et al 2008a 2008b pcr globwb sutanudjaja et al 2018 van beek and bierkens 2008 and watergap2 2c muller schmied et al 2016 dhi ghm was run using the global soil wetness project 3 gswp3 forcing data dirmeyer et al 2006 lange and büchner 2020 as per the isimip2a protocol for comparison to these three models displayed for the amazon river obidos linigrafo in fig 12 comparisons for the mississippi and danube rivers are included in figures s23 and s24 simulated results visualized here include present day management pressoc of the three isimip studies watergap 2 2c fits best with kge of 0 847 h08 and pcr globwb fit less well with kges 0 51 and 0 47 respectively dhi ghm produces a kge of 0 53 with gswp3 and a kge of 0 854 with era5 and priestley taylor dhi ghm era5 and watergap 2 2c can reproduce well the timing and water balance of the observed discharge time series h08 can produce the timing but not the amplitude of the peaks pcr globwb can produce a more appropriate magnitude but the timing is poorly matched watergap 2 2c is a calibrated model and corrections are made for yearly water balance muller schmied et al 2016 the h08 and pcr globwb models used in isimip2a were not calibrated hanasaki et al 2008a 2008b van beek and bierkens 2008 in the h08 model as little correction was done as possible and some model parameters were tuned based on climatic zones and for specific river basins hanasaki et al 2008a it is of note that a correction to the gswp3 forcing data as described in hirabayashi et al 2008 was applied to the watergap 2 2c model run this correction increases snowfall and precipitation and was not applied to gwsp3 input data to produce the dhi ghm simulation results with this forcing dataset the same correction for elevation for temperature that was applied to the era5 temperature input data was also applied to the gswp3 temperature input data this correction alone appears to be insufficient fig s22 displays how peaks appear too early in the hydrograph indicating that snowmelt occurs too early in addition to the lack of water in the system as muller schmied et al 2016 also note uncertainty in global forcings propagates throughout to uncertainty in the simulation results and this could describe the poorer performance of dhi ghm with the gswp3 forcing data compared to the era5 application of the correction factor could increase the compatibility of comparison of dhi ghm with the isimip model results in the most recently published version of watergap 2 2d müller schmied et al 2021 259 of the 1319 analyzed stations yield an nse below zero corresponding to 80 above the no correlation threshold dhi ghm shows 232 out of 1667 analyzed stations with a kge below 0 41 corresponding to 86 of stations above the threshold watergap 2 2d gives an overall median kge of 0 61 the dhi ghm overall median is 0 51 and the median of stations with a kge above the threshold is 0 56 while these results are not entirely dissimilar the details of the analysis differ watergap 2 2d is analyzed using monthly streamflow whereas dhi ghm is analyzed using discharge time series with daily timesteps many of the basins analyzed in watergap 2 2d are calibrated and or corrected for water balance whereas no calibration is conducted in dhi ghm in the current study in its setup dhi ghm is like other ghms in that it includes the same foundational elements a precipitation partitioning model and a discharge routing model ghms are distinguished by which hydrological cycle elements are considered and at which spatial and temporal resolution distinctive modelling elements include reservoirs irrigation crops vegetation snow soil layers groundwater paul et al 2021 sood and smakhtin 2015 telteu et al 2021 the spatial and temporal resolution of the dhi ghm operational model is on par with the finest resolution land balance models and ghms gwava spatial resolution 0 1 meigh et al 1999 isba computational temporal resolution 20 min and trip temporal resolution 1 hr alkama et al 2010 furthermore dhi ghm achieves these resolutions with a runtime of less than one hour for the entire globe this becomes even more remarkable when it is considered that the model includes reservoir irrigation groundwater and snow modelling elements as well as 2 distinct soil layers and consideration for 16 land use types for a full comparison of dhi ghm technical features against those of other ghms as reviewed by sood and smakhtin 2015 and against wwh arheimer et al 2020 and glofas alfieri et al 2013 see table s4 other models that provide discharge forecasts are the operational wwh and the glofas operational system which combines the htessel and lisflood models alfieri et al 2013 arheimer et al 2020 harrigan et al 2020 wwh is calibrated in a step wise method where individual gauged catchments that represent a particular hydrological process are automatically calibrated against observed data for that process eleven processes are selected for calibration and the calibrated parameters from gauged catchments are then applied to ungauged catchments that share the same physical characteristics arheimer et al 2020 htessel used to determine runoff in glofas uses field derived parameter values that are applied to catchments with similar characteristics as well as values from literature results are assessed by comparison to grdc monthly and annual runoff products balsamo et al 2009 in lisflood the routing element of the glofas operational system the majority of the 34 model parameters can be determined a priori directly from literature existing datasets and satellite products the remaining parameters are calibrated against observed data and regionalized to ungauged catchments van der knijff et al 2010 dhi ghm is distinct in its parameterization scheme where global data products are used to establish physical based relationships with model parameters such that calibration against discharge measurements and regionalization of model parameters is not a necessity the operational wwh provides 10 day forecasts of streamflow presented as a return period indicator at a daily timestep and at a catchment resolution of 1000 km2 the operational glofas provides forecasts from 1 to 15 days at 18 km resolution and from 16 to 30 days at 36 km resolution forecasts are provided at daily timesteps updated either daily or twice weekly in comparison dhi ghm provides 10 day forecasts at hourly timesteps updated hourly at 10 km2 spatial resolution and at the catchment scale it is this hourly resolution and truly real time analysis that can warn of extreme events which is ever more relevant with the earth s rapidly changing climate wwh provides 7 month seasonal operational forecasts of river flow actual evapotranspiration surface runoff and soil water content as a monthly mean updated monthly the glofas operational system produces 16 week seasonal forecasts at daily timesteps updated monthly the weekly averages for the glofas seasonal forecasts are used to determine unusually high and low flows dhi ghm operational system produces 9 month seasonal ensemble forecasts at daily timesteps which are updated every other day this longer forecast at a finer resolution can prove useful as climate change becomes increasingly more important to water resources management decisions 4 3 dhi ghm application dhi ghm has been used to assess water resource availability especially with regards to the impacts of climate change in ten counties in northern kenya murray et al 2022 discharge and run off observations are nearly nonexistent in this region and dhi ghm was essential to completing the assessment based on historical time series simulations from the model water availability from the present to 2050 was then forecasted using climate change factors derived from the cordex africa regional climate model with the representative concentration pathway 4 5 scenario giorgi et al 2009 based on the projected water availability and water demand it is recommended that decision makers address water storage during wet months and review planned irrigation expansion in areas forecast to experience future water deficit the application of dhi ghm is valuable for climate change mitigation planning and decision making especially for areas without the resources for local monitoring or detailed basin scale models dhi ghm proved to be useful for organizations such as the united nations environmental programme unep and the global partnership on marine litter gpml that require a current and forecasted global overview of the earth s hydrology to discern its effect on environmental and societal issues one such issue is plastic pollution it is estimated that approximately 80 of plastic in the sea originates from land based sources lebreton et al 2018 li et al 2016 and thus information of when and where river discharge transports plastic litter is essential for strategy development and planning of intervention activities to combat plastic pollution in the environment the unep dhi centre has developed a model based on dhi ghm that simulates plastic pollution load in the global river network this riverine transport model is the engine behind the gpml s risk and warning system for macroplastic litter which provides 9 month seasonal forecasts at daily timesteps updated every other day for 870 000 simulation points around the globe accessible via the gpml s digital platform gpml unep dhi centre 2022 these forecasts are publicly available for use in action planning which is especially relevant in light of united national environment assembly fifth session resolution end plastic pollution towards an international legally binding instrument united nations environment assembly unea 2022 4 4 possible directions for future development possible next steps for further development of dhi ghm include expanded performance evaluation efforts with catchments of less than 1000 km2 and inclusion of lakes less than 10 km2 there is also scope for improvement of the potential evaporation forcing dataset by fine tuning of the priestley taylor empirical constant αp via calibration regional calibration of the nam model parameterizations is also a way to improve the model performance and the utility of the dhi ghm operational system evaluation of model uncertainty and parameter sensitivity is growing increasingly possible for global models and investigation of parameter sensitivity both within dhi ghm and as compared to other ghms for example through the isimip study could be particularly insightful frieler et al 2017 gosling et al 2019 reinecke et al 2021 reinecke et al 2019 the application of machine learning to ghms has also been demonstrated which could help in further defining uncertain parameters and uncertain model processes such as the complex water use regimes in arid areas kraft et al 2022 evaluation of hydrological forecast performance requires both observed discharge and meteorological forecast time series from the same period and meteorological forecasts are archived during dhi ghm operation currently few discharge time series are available in real time as discharge time series become available for the same period as the archived forecasts evaluation of dhi ghm forecast skill by for example the persistence criterion metric kitanidis and bras 1980 will become possible this would increase trust in the model as well as guide model development for example hydrological model forecast performance can be improved by data assimilation hydrological observations such as basin runoff and river discharge measurements are not available in real time at the global scale however soil moisture and water level measurements gathered by remote sensing are readily available babaeian et al 2019 soil moisture measured by satellites can be assimilated in the nam to improve forecast performance and water level measurement is especially appealing for updating larger lakes the hydroweb water levels of rivers and lakes product consists of long time series 1992 present 1 5 days delay for 124 of the world s large lakes and 11 336 measurement points on rivers bercher 2008 rosmorduc and vayre 2021 water level predictions are valuable to water managers in order to control for flood events and model development to include water level forecasting could be supported by altimetry derived datasets schneider et al 2018 increased spatial resolution of ghms with catchment delineation of as fine as 1 km2 has been cited as the ideal way forward for monitoring water availability bierkens et al 2015 wood et al 2011 however increased model spatial resolution that is not accompanied by increased resolution and decreased epistemic uncertainty in global forcing data may only increase the model uncertainty beven 2019 indeed the coarse spatial resolution of ghms cannot compete with traditional basin scale models in answer to this the dhi ghm modelling framework has been adapted for the country of denmark dhi s danish hydrological model or dhi dhm and local forcing data from the danish meteorological institute denmark is covered by 301 catchments in dhi ghm routing scheme and by 48 885 in dhi dhm routing scheme and local municipalities can better relate to discharge and water level simulations at this scale for decision making applications beven 2019 even if suitable forcing data were available the development of such refined catchment delineation for the whole world is limiting to global application at this scale as dhi dhm completes a real time and forecasting run in less than 5 min this resolution could theoretically be applied to larger areas with the current level of development and available computation resources within a not unreasonable amount of time regions of the globe may be able to be simulated in less than an hour as new forecasts are available while global simulation would no longer be in real time without additional development 5 conclusions dhi ghm is comprised of two components distributed grid based rainfall runoff models and a catchment based kinematic routing model the kinematic routing model is unique in its quick execution which is founded on the relationship between the actual and average discharge in the catchment the application of the nam in the rainfall runoff modelling component is based on a priori parameterization entirely from globally available datasets it does not rely on local data sources for calibration dhi ghm has produced long term historical time series and is executed as an operational system where real time simulations and 10 day and 9 month forecasts are produced real time and short term forecasts are produced each hour and seasonal forecasts are produced every other day the development of dhi ghm demonstrates that a relatively high resolution ghm can produce reasonable results for much of the world s river network also compared to other established ghms multiple forcing datasets were evaluated for operational use it was determined that the era5 and priestley taylor forcing datasets perform best when compared against 1667 discharge observation points over a historical 9 year period dhi ghm performs better in temperate and wetter areas and less well in arid and cold regions where two thirds of all poorly performing performance evaluation stations are impacted by one or more of the factors aridity withdrawal or regulation more focus should be dedicated to incorporating human effects on the hydrological cycle to address this common shortcoming of ghms credit authorship

2039,an operational global hydrological model dhi ghm has been developed that provides historical real time 10 day and seasonal forecast simulations at the global scale dhi ghm is comprised of a distributed gridded rainfall runoff model with a spatial resolution of 0 1 and an agile kinematic routing model that moves water between model grid cells and sub catchments and in the river system model output includes gridded hydrological variables such as soil moisture content and different runoff components and discharge at more than 1 million river points globally dhi ghm uses a novel parameterization scheme where global data products of land surface physical characteristics are used to establish relations with model parameters and thus dhi ghm does not rely on local discharge data for model calibration multiple forcing datasets were tested and the combination of era5 precipitation and priestley taylor potential evaporation yielded the overall best results with a median kge of 0 51 and average water balance error of 0 78 based on data from 1667 discharge stations worldwide the model results and the operational system are particularly relevant for organizations with national regional or global scope who need information on large areas at once and for data scarce areas or projects without resources for local scale models keywords data scarce areas global hydrological model global parameterization operational system real time forecasting ungauged catchment modelling data availability all data sources have been exhaustively described in the article 1 introduction global hydrological models ghms provide a comprehensive view of the earth s hydrological system by incorporating global climate datasets rainfall runoff modelling and water routing components at the global scale sood and smakhtin 2015 telteu et al 2021 ghms are increasingly valuable in the context of the global water system alcamo et al 2008 which is comprised of the connection between the global hydrological system and human systems of economics and institutions as worldwide issues such as climate change and globalization become increasingly important water managers need the global picture in mind when making decisions for how to best manage water resources sood and smakhtin 2015 a holistic viewpoint is essential also from the perspective of decision makers trying to reach the un s 17 sustainable development goals sdgs un general assembly 2015 sdg 6 clean water and sanitation cannot be addressed in isolation as water resources and water quality decisions are inextricably linked to other sdgs such as those related to energy climate action life below water and food security optimization of water resources management in conjunction with the energy and agricultural sectors is known as the water food energy nexus holistic optimization using the nexus framework yields different results than when each sector is considered independently payet burin et al 2021 ghms are especially valuable for countries areas or projects that do not have resources or capacity for building a basin scale model for this type of evaluation paul et al 2021 data requirements and limited data collection in these areas are a barrier to modeling and the recent abundance of satellite data that has encouraged ghm development render ghms beneficial to these regions tang et al 2009 the first ghm was developed in 1989 by vorosmarty vörösmarty et al 1989 it consists of a water balance model wbm linked with a water transport model wtm the wbm calculated soil moisture evapotranspiration and surface runoff at the grid level and the wtm routed the generated discharge using a linear reservoir model in the three decades since various types of global models have been developed to answer specific research questions including global land use models used by the climate community dynamic global vegetation models used by the vegetation community and ghms used by the hydrology community some notable land surface and dynamic vegetation models include global water availability assessment gwava meigh et al 1999 lund potsdam jena managed land lpjml bondeau et al 2007 interactions between soil biosphere and atmosphere total runoff integrating pathways isba trip alkama et al 2010 and hydrology tiled ecmwf scheme for surface exchanges over land htessel balsamo et al 2009 some notable codes that can be applied at the global scale as ghms include the hanasaki et al 2008 model h08 hanasaki et al 2008a 2008b pcraster global water balance pcr globwb sutanudjaja et al 2018 van beek and bierkens 2008 water global assessment and prognosis watergap alcamo et al 2003 variable infiltration capacity vic nijssen et al 2001 and lisflood van der knijff et al 2010 two ghms of note that provide operational global forecasts are the world wide hype wwh arheimer et al 2020 and the global flood awareness system glofas alfieri et al 2013 wwh is the global application of the hydrological predictions for the environment hype model arheimer et al 2020 lindström et al 2010 and glofas is a combination of a htessel and lisflood alfieri et al 2013 balsamo et al 2009 van der knijff et al 2010 ghms are typically descriptive in nature and are constructed with the aim of providing information relevant for a specific research question rather than explicitly for decision making applications sood and smakhtin 2015 telteu et al 2021 they typically include many processes and parameters rely on observed data for calibration of gauged catchments and regionalization methods for parameter determination in ungauged catchments require large amounts of computational resources and provide historical simulations and static information we have developed a ghm referred to as dhi ghm in the following where the model setup and parameterization are determined based on globally available datasets the dhi ghm model setup presented here is uncalibrated and thus the model does not rely on local data sources for calibration dhi ghm functions as an operational service to provide historical real time 10 day and seasonal forecast simulations at the global scale more complex models do not always yield better results than simple models orth et al 2015 and the tradeoff between simulation time and resolution is a consideration for operational modelling applications however the modelling concept applied in dhi ghm achieves short simulations times at resolutions and complexity comparable to other ghms and allows for frequent forecast updates the model is agile and can produce real time and short term forecasted simulations in less than one hour the limiting factor for the temporal resolution is the update frequency of forcing datasets the global spatial coverage of the model also allows for its use in areas where data and resource scarcity prevent development of local models kauffeldt et al 2013 paul et al 2021 such models are important for water resource management planning in the face of climate change dhi ghm integrates historical real time and forecasted discharge data to provide insights for these data scarce areas 2 material and methods 2 1 model structure dhi ghm spans the globe from 80 n and 60 s the model domain is divided into a series of tiles and cells between 80 n and 60 s there are 574 tiles of 10 10 that each contain a maximum of 10 000 cells of 0 1 0 1 fig 1 those cells where the cell center is not located on an ocean contain modelling elements there are thus just over 1 5 million cells included in dhi ghm the boundaries of dhi ghm are 80 n and 60 s greenland antarctica and land surfaces from 80 n to 90 n are not included in the model glaciology is not a component of dhi ghm though melt from glaciers is included in the snow storage module the model domain thus covers 97 6 of the earth s landmass excluding greenland and antarctica and 99 99 of the earth s total population center for international earth science information network ciesin and columbia university 2018 the modelling elements that comprise dhi ghm are depicted in the conceptual model in fig 2 the input datasets to the model setup are both climate datasets used to force the model and spatial datasets used to describe catchment characteristics for model parameterization rainfall temperature and potential evaporation are input into the model as gridded data and distributed rainfall runoff models compute gridded runoff time series based on this input river discharge at the hydrological catchment level is then computed by the river routing model based on the runoff time series and further is routed to the sea both the gridded rainfall runoff models and hydrological catchments yield valuable hydrologically relevant output datasets dark blue box fig 2 the rainfall runoff modelling elements light green box fig 1 are computed over grids and the river routing elements dark green box fig 1 are computed over hydrological catchments routing is performed at three levels 1 within the grids to move runoff to the grid edge 2 within a hydrological basin to move the runoff from the grid edge to the outlet of the hydrological catchment and 3 from one catchment to the next downstream 2 2 data there are various global datasets that provide the foundation to the development and operation of dhi ghm grouped by use these fall into three categories spatial landmass data used to determine catchment characteristics meteorological data used in model forcing and observed data used for model performance evaluation the ability of the model to produce accurate valuable outputs is dependent on the quality and reliability of the input data and deliberate care was taken when selecting data to inform the model 2 2 1 spatial landmass data the catchment characteristics in dhi ghm are described by the combination of topographical hydrological and geographical datasets the physical delineation of catchments and rivers used in the model were sourced from the world wildlife fund hydrosheds products catchments are sourced from the hydrobasins lakes from the hydrolakes and rivers from the global rivers classification gloric datasets lehner and grill 2013 messager et al 2016 ouellet dallaire et al 2019 each developed from the hydrosheds elevation database the hydrobasins dataset consists of polygon layers of watershed boundaries with coverage over the entire globe the hydrobasins sub basin breakdown includes basins greater than 100 km2 and uses the pfafstetter coding system up to level 12 pfafstetter 1989 verdin and verdin 1999 it is this finest level that is used in dhi ghm dhi ghm includes 1 017 093 basins of which the average size is approximately 100 200 km2 the hydrolakes dataset consists of polygons depicting the shoreline and providing geometric attributes of all global lakes with a surface area of 0 1 km2 or greater messager et al 2016 each lake is co registered to a sub basin of the hydrobasins dataset lakes and reservoirs from the hydrolakes dataset with an area greater than 10 km2 and on a main river channel are included in dhi ghm this yields a total of 15 052 lakes included in the model the gloric dataset consists of polylines that include integrated climate and biogeochemical classifications for each river reach 35 850 612 km of river are included in the model where the average length of a river reach is 4 2 km average discharge for river reaches in each hydrobasins sub basin a catchment characteristic used during river routing was also sourced from this dataset the increased availability and quality of global remote sensing datasets is integral to the advancement of dhi ghm sood and smakhtin 2015 the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis land cover products mcd12q1 006 and mod44w 006 were used to obtain land cover types and masks carroll et al 2017 friedl and sulla menashe 2019 the annual international geosphere biosphere programme igbp classification from 2017 at a resolution of 500 m also referred to as type 1 land cover was used in dhi ghm elevation data were sourced from the void filled 90 m strm digital elevation database v4 1 produced by the consultative group for international agricultural research consortium for spatial information cgiar csi jarvis et al 2008 this dem product has 3 arc second dem for the globe with finer resolution provided by auxiliary dems where available and with a 30 s global dem used for void filling river reach elevations were further updated with merit hydro 3 arc second resolution raster river network hydrography maps yamazaki et al 2019 inland waterbody geography at 30 m resolution was sourced from global forest cover change water cover 2000 dataset townshend 2016 depth to bedrock developed by the land atmosphere interaction research group at sun yat sen university was used at a resolution of 30 s 1 km shangguan et al 2017 soil groups from the hysogs250m dataset were used ross et al 2018 wilting point field capacity and soil saturation datasets were sourced from the hihydrosoil v2 0 data layers simons et al 2020 water withdrawal time series from huang et al 2018 were used as input for irrigation and water use modelling in huang et al 2018 withdrawal datasets from fao aquastat and the usgs were spatially downscaled from the country resolution to a 0 5 grid and temporally downscaled from five year to monthly time steps water use types include irrigation livestock domestic electricity generation mining and manufacturing at present irrigation use is included in dhi ghm 2 2 2 meteorological data precipitation temperature and potential evaporation datasets are required inputs to dhi ghm recent historic current and forecasts of each of these three types of data are required for real time and forecasting operation precipitation and temperature forecasts for model operation are sourced from the ibm weather company database ibm 2018a this 4 km resolution dataset provides current conditions forecasts in 15 min time steps up to 7 days in the future and forecasts in 1 h time steps from 7 to 15 days in the future for the entire globe currently the hourly 10 day period is used for short medium range forecasting though this can be modified to other period lengths precipitation and temperature ensemble forecasts for 9 months in the future are sourced from the ncep ncar reanalysis 1 dataset for seasonal forecast simulations kalnay et al 1996 the forecasts are archived once daily for future discharge forecast simulation analysis recent historical precipitation data are used to determine the current starting conditions for forecast simulations for real time and short term forecasts which are simulated each hour the current hydrological conditions are sourced from the previous simulation s first timestep based on the ibm weather company forecasts ibm 2018a additionally the ibm weather company current state product is used during dhi ghm operation ibm 2018b the current state product provides real time information for precipitation and temperature for two time steps two hours prior to the current time at the same spatiotemporal resolution as the ibm weather company forecasts to inform the current state for seasonal forecasts which are simulated every other day the gpm imerg late dataset from nasa is used huffman et al 2019 the gpm late product provides precipitation data at with a minimum latency of 12 h this dataset is combined with the historical precipitation dataset as new daily data is available and is used as input to seasonal forecast simulations because of the domain of the gpm dataset dhi ghm seasonal forecasts span 80 n and 60 s various forcing datasets were used during evaluation of dhi ghm model performance evaluation was carried out at a daily timestep for the period 2001 2009 and historical time series from this period were used in the assessment multiple time series were assessed during the historical evaluation and the forcing datasets with the best global performance were selected for use in dhi ghm operational system these historical datasets selected for use are described here and the other evaluated data are described in the supplementary material precipitation and temperature data used during model evaluation are sourced from the copernicus european centre for medium range weather forecasts reanalysis 5th generation era5 dataset hersbach et al 2018 this dataset gives global coverage of many environmental variables at a 0 25 0 25 resolution from 1979 to approximately 5 days from the present day the potential evaporation data used is a priestley taylor potential evaporation dataset calculated via the methods described in mcmahon et al 2013 the priestley taylor formula is as seen in equation 1 1 e p α p δ δ γ r n λ g λ where ep mm d 1 is the priestley taylor evaporation αp is the priestley taylor constant δ kpa c 1 is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure temperature curve γ kpa c 1 is the psychrometric constant rn mj m 2 d 1 is net radiation λ mj m 3 is the latent heat of vaporization and g mj m 2 d 1 is the soil heat flux density the priestley taylor evaporation model is a simplified version of the penman monteith model where the vapor pressure deficit and vapor pressure resistance are combined into the empirical constant αp priestley and taylor 1972 αp was selected based on the methods described by shuttleworth 1993a and varies spatially based on ecological zones described by the fao forest resources assessment program fao 2001 a value of 1 74 was selected for the following zones subtropical desert subtropical dry forest temperate desert temperate steppe except north america tropical desert tropical dry forest tropical moist forest and tropical shrubland a value of 1 1 was selected for tropical forests due to the humid conditions a value of 1 5 was assigned to temperate zones and 1 26 was assigned to all remaining zones a time series for the parameter δ was calculated for the daily mean temperature in each grid cell mcmahon et al 2013 the daily mean temperature was calculated from the daily maximum and minimum 2 m temperature at 6 hr timesteps from the era5 0 25 product hersbach et al 2018 a temporally constant value for γ was selected for each grid cell based on elevation from the gmted2010 earth resources observation and science eros center 2011 a time series for rn was calculated for each grid cell based on the dewpoint temperature and incoming solar radiation mcmahon et al 2013 the dewpoint temperature used was sourced from the 2 m dewpoint at 3 hr timesteps from the era5 0 25 product and the incoming solar radiation on the 24 hr accumulated daily downward surface solar radiation from the era5 0 25 product hersbach et al 2018 a spatially and temporally constant value of 2 54 mj m 2 d 1 for λ was selected as this is the latent heat of vaporization for water at 20 c mcmahon et al 2013 g was assumed to be zero shuttleworth 1993b the priestley taylor equation is valid up to latitude 65 n values from the terraclimate dataset abatzoglou et al 2018 are used from 65 n to 80 n averages for each day from 2000 to 2021 are used during forecasting the yearly average priestley taylor potential evaporation is depicted in fig s14 2 2 3 observed river discharge data evaluation of dhi ghm performance is founded on comparisons to observed river discharge the global runoff data centre grdc operated under the auspices of the wmo maintains a database of river discharge time series the global runoff data centre 2021 grdc data from approximately 1200 stations with catchment areas greater than 5000 km2 were used during evaluation the gdrc has compiled information about each station including its catchment area river discharge data is generally collected and maintained by national governments and research institutions and discharge data from the following countries national databases supplement the grdc dataset australia austria bangladesh brazil denmark ethiopia france germany switzerland and the united states note that the average river discharge in each hydrobasins sub basin a parameter used in river routing is a catchment characteristic sourced from the gloric database ouellet dallaire et al 2019 it is not directly based on observed values in the dhi ghm model setup 2 3 distributed rainfall runoff models the hydrological model element of the dhi ghm is comprised of distributed gridded rainfall runoff models specifically the nedbør afstrømnings model nam asger nielsen and hansen 1973 dhi a s 2022 that span the model domain the model domain from 80 n to 60 s is divided into a series of tiles and cells fig 1 cells are approximately 11x11 km at the equator and slightly smaller toward the poles and each cell situated over landmass contains a nam the earth s landmass between 80 n and 60 s thus spans 321 tiles and corresponds to 1 516 836 nam cells in dhi ghm the nam describes the rainfall runoff process by continuously accounting for the water content in four different yet interrelated storage compartments 1 snow storage 2 surface storage 3 lower root zone storage and 4 groundwater storage these four storage compartments are represented as the boxes in fig 3 of the fifteen parameters in the nam nine are most important to describe how water moves through between the storage compartments these nine parameters are listed in table 1 in traditional nam parameter estimation the nine nam parameters of primary importance are calibrated for a specific catchment against observed discharge time series data for that catchment autocalibration methods are typically used to minimize root mean square error between the simulated and observed discharge madsen 2000 and can only be applied to catchments where observed time series are available for global model calibration using autocalibration methods the parameters of relatively few catchments with observations are transferred to ungauged areas by regionalization dhi has used an a priori physical estimation approach for nam parameters to avoid parameter bias toward a specific forcing dataset and to make optimal use of global datasets which are not easily included in a traditional calibration process the nine relevant nam parameters are related to the physical characteristics of a catchment where the parameters are estimated based on physical catchment characteristics and evaluated against rivers around the globe where observed datasets exist dhi ghm as presented here is an uncalibrated model the nam parameters are determined from the globally available spatial landmass datasets described above and thereby also cover ungauged areas the distributed rainfall runoff models produce relevant hydrological time series datasets at the gridded 0 1 0 1 resolution and hourly or daily timestep these include runoff overland flow interflow baseflow snow coverage actual evaporation and soil moisture 2 3 1 root zone storage maximum lmax and surface zone storage maximum umax the maximum root zone storage lmax is the maximum soil water available for evapotranspiration it is estimated using global gridded datasets including modis land cover carroll et al 2017 friedl and sulla menashe 2019 and depth to bedrock shangguan et al 2017 root depth is estimated based on the type of land cover yang et al 2016 where for example forests are described by a root depth of 1800 mm shrubland by 800 mm and urban environments by 600 mm all root depth classifications are included in table s1 if bedrock depth is less than the root zone depth this depth is used instead lmax is calculated by multiplying the root zone depth by the available soil water the distribution of lmax spans from 0 01 mm to 372 mm with the largest values found in wet climates and the lowest values found in dry climates fig s4 the maximum water content in the surface storage umax is the water content in the interception storage in surface depression storages and in the uppermost few centimeters of the soil this is estimated as 10 of lmax 2 3 2 overland flow runoff coefficient co and threshold value for overland flow to the overland flow runoff coefficient co determines the distribution of excess rainfall between overland flow and infiltration co is determined by a relationship to the permanent wilting point of the soil which is the minimum soil moisture where plants do not experience wilting defined by hihydrosoil v2 0 as soil moisture at 16 times greater than atmospheric pressure simons et al 2020 as the wilting point increases co also increases fig s1 when soil can retain more water unavailable for uptake by vegetation it is more likely that rainfall results in overland flow in the nam co varies between 0 3 and 0 95 for the globe fig s5 overland flow is only generated if the relative moisture content in the root zone storage is larger than the threshold value for overland flow to a lower to therefore means less soil moisture is required before overland flow is allowed in the model the wilting point s inverse correlation to to mirrors its positive correlation to co fig s1 the greater the soil s capacity to hold residual water unavailable for uptake by vegetation the more easily that rainfall will result in overland flow in the nam to varies between 0 5 and 0 8 for the globe fig s6 2 3 3 threshold value for recharge tg recharge to the groundwater storage is only generated if the relative moisture content in the lower zone storage is larger than the threshold value for recharge tg global determination of tg is based on a linear relationship with the drainable porosity fig s2 drainable porosity is calculated by subtracting the field capacity from the saturated soil moisture content field capacity is defined by hihydrosoil v2 0 as the amount of soil moisture or water content held in the soil after excess water has drained away and the rate of downward movement has decreased simons et al 2020 when tg is zero recharge to the groundwater occurs regardless of the soil moisture content this is the case when the drainable porosity and hence infiltration capacity is high such as in sandy soils a larger pore space is filled and emptied by gravity and recharge to the groundwater is expected to occur at any soil moisture level as the drainable porosity decreases the amount of soil moisture required before recharge to the groundwater storage occurs increases and tg increases the relationship is based on the soil water characteristics for hydrological applications defined by saxton and rawls 2006 the value for tg varies between 0 and 0 98 for the globe fig s7 2 3 4 threshold value for interflow ti interflow is only generated if the relative moisture content in the lower zone storage is larger than the threshold value for interflow ti ti like tg is dependent on drainable porosity but the relationship is inverse to that of tg fig s3 high drainable porosity indicates that water is less likely to move as interflow and corresponds to a higher ti as the drainable porosity decreases the likelihood for interflow to occur increases and the ti decreases the value for ti varies between 0 02 and 1 00 for the globe fig s8 2 3 5 time constant for overland flow and interflow routing cr the time constants ck1 and ck2 denoted cr as a pair describe routing of overland flow and interflow through two linear reservoirs in series as is typical in nam ck1 is set equal to ck2 such that the same value describes both parameters madsen et al 2002 global estimation for cr is based on the us natural resources conservation service curve number nrcs cn method natural resources conservation service nrcs 1986 to determine direct runoff from a rainfall event based on land cover type and the ncrs hydrologic soil group hsg a curve number can be assigned to the globe s land surface there are four relevant soil types for the curve number method which are categorized by high moderate slow and very slow infiltration rates curve numbers for fair soil quality for each of the sixteen modis land cover types carroll et al 2017 friedl and sulla menashe 2019 and four hsgs were determined for the globe by zeng et al 2017 fig s11 determination of the cr using the curve number method is based on the time of concentration dhi a s 2022 natural resources conservation service nrcs 1986 the time of concentration is the time for runoff to travel from the hydraulically most distant point of a watershed to a point of interest in dhi ghm the point of interest is the outlet of the grid cell and the time of concentration is effectively cr the time for runoff to travel the length of the grid cell the time of concentration tc is described as 2 t c t l 0 6 where the lag time tl is the time between the center of the rainfall event and the runoff peak tl is described by 3 t l 32 8 10 3 l 0 8 1000 n avg 9 0 7 1900 y 0 5 where l km is the hydraulic length of the grid cell navg is the average curve number of the grid cell area and y is the average grid cell slope the hydraulic length of each grid cell is the square root of the portion of the 0 1 0 1 cell that includes land for most grid cells this is around 9 km the slope is calculated for each grid cell from the nasa srtm nasa jpl 2013 the value for tc and thus for cr varies from nearly 0 to 2500 hrs for the globe fig s9 2 3 6 baseflow time constant cb and time constant for interflow from the surface storage ci baseflow from the groundwater storage is generated using a linear reservoir model with time constant cb this is estimated globally using the total watershed runoff conceptual model developed by vogel and kroll 1992 the baseflow time constant is described by 4 c b e π 2 k s d 2 f α where k m hr 1 is the saturated hydraulic conductivity s the slope of the land surface d m 1 the drainage density of the basin f the drainage porosity of the soil and α a correction factor based on the aquifer to land area ratio saturated hydraulic conductivity is estimated using the wilting point and field capacity based on the soil water characteristics established by saxton and rawls 2006 drainage porosity is calculated as the soil saturation minus the field capacity leenaars et al 2015 it is assumed that all areas have groundwater and the land to aquifer area correction factor α is only applied to areas of a grid cell that contain large lakes or ocean the model developed by vogel and kroll 1992 is only valid for horizontal water tables in mountainous regions with sloped bedrock cbis calculated using the method presented in zecharias and brutsaert 1988 the time constant of groundwater flow for a sloped groundwater table is given by 5 c b f b 2 2 k p d cos 2 θ b sin θ where f is the drainable porosity b m is the horizontal aquifer length k m hr 1 is the hydraulic conductivity d m is the depth from the ground surface to the impermeable layer θ is the slope of the impermeable layer and p is a constant arising during linearization that is set to 1 drainable porosity and hydraulic conductivity were calculated as described above the value for cbvaries from 0 to 15 000 hrs with a skew toward the shorter time constants figure s10 the time constant for interflow from surface storage ci was set to half the value of the time constant for baseflow cb 2 4 kinematic routing model the speed and agility of the routing element of dhi ghm is one of its greatest strengths it is this ghm s routing method that allows for sub daily real time simulation and short range forecasting in over 1 000 000 basins in the globe routing of water in the model can be conceptualized in three steps fig 4 first water is routed as runoff within each cell using that cell s nam next runoff is routed kinematically between cells within each hydrobasins catchment lehner and grill 2013 in this second step the water is routed to that catchment s outlet the location where the river crosses the delineation of the catchment polygon lastly the water is routed kinematically between catchments from one sub basin to the next sub basin downstream kinematic river routing is modeled based on the manning formula for open channel flow manning 1891 6 v m r 2 3 s where v ms 1 is the cross sectional average velocity m m1 3s 1 is the manning coefficient r m is the hydraulic radius and s is the channel slope the slope of the river within each sub basin is calculated from the strm dem jarvis et al 2008 as the difference between the average elevation and minimum elevation within each catchment a manning coefficient of 15 is applied throughout dhi ghm to all basins the river routing and routing calculated in nam are separated mathematically in the model but in actuality these two processes are linked there is thus a connection between the nam parameter cr and the manning coefficient and the manning coefficient can be changed individually for each basin which allows for further refinement of the model if we assume a 1 10 triangular cross section in the river channel we can approximate the hydraulic radius as 7 r a 2 10 where a m2 is the cross sectional area of the river because the cross sectional river area is equal to the discharge divided by the velocity and the average river discharge is known the manning formula can be rewritten to solve for the average velocity of the water through the channel equation 8 8 v avg 0 4 q avg 0 25 m s 0 75 this allows for simulation of flow without explicit information as to the channel cross sectional area the velocity at a timestep can then be calculated from the discharge at that timestep which is produced by the rainfall runoff model and information from the previous timestep equation 9 9 v v avg q q avg 0 4 2 5 additional modelling elements 2 5 1 snow storage a degree day snow model that is distributed by altitude accounts for variation of meteorological variables with altitude in the distributed rainfall runoff models water is modeled as retained in snow in elevation zones which is particularly relevant within mountainous hydrological catchments this allows for accumulation of snow and variation of precipitation and temperature in grid cells with large elevation variation elevations zones are 200 m in height most of the modeled domain is designated as having only one zone and mountainous regions with high topographic variation can have up to sixteen zones fig 5 each elevation zone contains its own rainfall runoff model snow is allowed to build up to a certain threshold within a zone and continuous build up above the threshold is transferred to lower elevation zones the conceptual diagram in fig 6 shows a grid cell with two additional snow storage zones when snow storage in the higher zones is full excess snow moves into the next lower zone the snow physics included in the model is kept relatively simple and each elevation zone is modeled to have a snow water storage of 7 judson and doesken 2000 runoff can occur from all three zones simultaneously and the combined runoff from all elevation zones is routed in the nam grid cell and further by the kinematic routing model 2 5 2 retention in lakes in the kinematic routing model flow through lakes or reservoirs along major rivers is retarded by accounting for water retention in the lake reservoir using a linear reservoir model 10 c k bd q avg where ck s is the time constant b m2 is the active lake or reservoir area d m is the average active depth of the water body and qavg m3s 1 the average discharge of the river lakes are assumed to have an average active depth of 0 5 m and reservoirs an average active depth of 1 m the effect of retention in a lake is applied to the outlet of the sub basin containing the lake the retardation affects a proportion of the discharge equal to the proportion of the lake area to the catchment area lakes or reservoirs that span more than one catchment are applied to the outlet of the most downstream catchment there is an option for increased evaporation to be applied to lake surfaces for further model refinement 2 5 3 water use because the global water cycle is inextricably linked to human activity it is imperative that global hydrological modelling activities include water withdrawals sood and smakhtin 2015 van beek et al 2011 water use irrigation is included in the dhi ghm kinematic routing model using withdrawal data huang et al 2018 applied at hydrobasins level 6 catchments lehner and grill 2013 which are approximately 10 000 km2 in size water withdrawn from a catchment is stored at that catchment s outlet water is used during dry growing periods and stored during the remainder of the year with a maximum storage capacity of one month at each catchment outlet after the storage is full the water is routed through and the storage can be emptied each month irrigated water is modeled as a sink because water applied to fields generally evaporates rather than entering back into the rainfall runoff model as overland flow or interflow there is an option for groundwater abstraction to be included in the model in the irrigation component though this is not included at the model s current stage of development likewise explicit regulation on waterways is not included river routing accounts only for natural flow with the monthly irrigation modelling component at each catchment outlet 2 6 model performance evaluation as the dhi ghm presented here has undergone neither calibration nor validation the modelling concept was instead subjected to a performance evaluation process where the goodness of fit of simulated discharge produced using varied forcing datasets was compared to observed discharge by this evaluation global and regional scale confirmation of dhi ghm have been conducted to test the goodness of the model oreskes et al 1994 and ensure it yields the best overall results using available datasets observed time series of daily discharge for 1667 flow stations for the period 2001 2009 were compared to their corresponding model simulation results two methods were used to evaluate dhi ghm performance at these locations one is the water balance error wbe in which the average annual volume of water simulated is compared to the average annual volume of water observed a wbe of 0 indicates a perfect fit the second metric is the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 which in addition to accounting for volume also accounts for flow variability and dynamics qi et al 2022 the kge is defined as 11 e 1 r 1 2 q avg s i m q avg o b s 1 2 c v s i m c v o b s 1 2 where r is the linear correlation between observations and simulations q avg s i m and q avg o b s m3s 1 are the mean simulated and mean observed discharge respectively and c v s i m and c v o b s are the coefficients of variation of the simulated and observed discharge respectively the optimal value for kge is one indicating perfect agreement between simulated and observed discharge time series unlike other performance metrics used in hydrology like the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse kge has no inherent lower threshold for the nse metric zero is the case of no correlation between simulations and observations and zero is then sometimes used as a lower bound for kge out of convenience however the case of no correlation in kge where r 0 in equation 11 yields 0 41 knoben et al 2019 presentation of kge results thus spans from 0 41 to 1 with values below the lower threshold investigated independently in section 4 1 the kge results are also evaluated against upper and lower benchmarks seibert et al 2018 the lower benchmark values were produced globally with all observation stations by executing dhi ghm with the same historical forcing dataset but with default nam parameter values table s2 and omission of lake and reservoir routing the upper benchmark values are produced in six river basins elbe loire oder rhein seine vistula using 213 observation stations by execution of a regional calibration procedure the open source hyperparameter optimization framework optuna akiba et al 2019 was used to perform multi objective optimization of kge in each basin the routine included weighting by upland area for each observation station within the basin by a factor of area0 25 in the kinematic routing model the optimal manning coefficient was determined for each basin and applied to all sub catchments at the gridded level the potential evaporation priestley taylor αp and the nine nam parameter relations table 1 were adjusted where a calibration factor was applied to all grid cells in the basin the co ti to and tg relationships to wilting point and drainable porosity are defined by two parameters each figures s1 s2 and s3 in total 15 parameters were adjusted during basin level calibration 3 results 3 1 model output dhi ghm produces both gridded and sub basin level simulation results the distributed rainfall runoff model element produces gridded hydrological data including runoff overland flow interflow baseflow snow coverage actual evaporation and soil moisture the data is available at 0 1 0 1 resolution for the globe from 60 s to 80 n real time and short to medium range forecast outputs are calculated hourly at hourly timesteps seasonal forecast outputs are calculated every other day at daily time steps fig 7 shows runoff simulation results produced using the era5 precipitation and priestley taylor potential evaporation datasets as part of the historical simulation operation of dhi ghm these results are representative of what is produced and available at each time step discharge model outputs are also produced for each sub basin fig s15 shows example historical discharge model results for the nile basin from 2000 to 2021 produced using the era5 precipitation and priestley taylor potential evaporation forcing datasets hersbach et al 2018 mcmahon et al 2013 priestley and taylor 1972 both gridded and sub basin scale model results are available operationally through an api key and through a web application to provide data users access to hydrological data of global regional or national interest 3 2 model performance because it has been shown previously with the watergap model that the dominating source of model uncertainty in ghms stems from the input data palmer et al 2008 preliminary model simulations were conducted to select the best performing forcing datasets the era5 precipitation dataset and priestley taylor potential evaporation datasets were selected for use in dhi ghm operational system because these datasets best cover the model domain and yield the overall best results see supplementary material for details the tested period for model performance evaluation is 9 years from 2001 to 2009 with a warm up period of two years from 1999 to 2001 this period was chosen to be consistent with comparisons available from the isimip study frieler et al 2017 gosling et al 2019 which is discussed in section 4 2 the model evaluation is completed using the observed data points shown in fig s12 and covers 86 of the world s largest basins all of those with long daily observed time series available fig s13 the overall performance of the modelled daily discharge using era5 precipitation and priestley taylor potential evaporation forcing datasets is displayed in fig 8 as a histogram of kge for the 1667 stations evaluated 14 of the observed stations resulted in a kge below the threshold of 0 41 and more than half 55 resulted in a kge between 0 4 and 0 8 of the observed stations that resulted in kges 0 41 the average kge is 0 49 the median kge of all observations is 0 51 the wbe of the model is visualized in a scatter plot found in fig 9 for the 1435 observed discharge points where the kge is above the threshold 0 41 each point on the plots in fig 9 corresponds to an observed discharge station fig 9 shows that most observed stations especially those with larger flow are on or near the parity line stations with a smaller average flow are in general further from 0 wbe a difference of 1 m3s 1 is negligible when the average flow is very large but significant when the flow is very small the model demonstrates little bias as the points appear scattered relatively symmetrically around the parity line evaluation of the model performance on the global and continental scales is relevant to assessing the model s usefulness in various applications and assessing the parameter estimation scheme a continental analysis of the model performance using the era5 precipitation and priestley taylor potential evaporation forcing datasets is displayed in table 2 and fig 10 dhi ghm produces higher kge values in asia europe and north america kges of 0 52 0 55 and 0 49 respectively moderate kge values in south america kge of 0 41 and lower kge values in africa and australia kges of 0 22 and 0 20 respectively out of the 1667 stations evaluated 72 of them are located in europe and north america due to this the median kge for the world 0 51 is closer to the median kges found in europe and north america rather than those in africa and australia geographical trends can be further examined in the continental plots fig 10 arid areas in the rocky mountains in north america the iberian peninsula in europe sub saharan africa and central australia away from the coasts show kges less than zero europe and asia both present with fewer than 20 of kges below 0 41 the highest kge values 0 8 kge 1 are mostly located in western and northern europe and throughout north america excepting the mountainous west 4 discussion 4 1 dhi ghm performance from table 2 and fig 10 it is evident that there is a geographical distribution pattern of dhi ghm performance with higher kge values in temperate areas in north america and europe and lower kge values in dry areas in africa australia and the rocky mountains in north america a total of 232 stations out of the 1667 stations analyzed 14 yielded kge values below the threshold of 0 41 these stations were further investigated to determine the correlation between aridity and water use to the performance of dhi ghm the average aridity index value defined as the ratio of precipitation to potential evapotranspiration of the upland catchment area of the station was calculated based on values determined by zomer et al 2022 water use was investigated in two ways irrigation and reservoir storage capacity huang et al 2018 messager et al 2016 if the magnitude of the irrigation amount in the catchment was more than half of the observed flow it was determined to be heavily impacted by irrigation activity if the magnitude of the reservoir storage capacity summed for the catchment was greater than half of the observed flow it was determined to be heavily impacted by regulation in this case all reservoirs not just those over 10 km2 in area were considered table 3 shows the results of this analysis of the 232 poorly performing stations 54 had upland catchment area with an average aridity index of less than 0 5 20 of the poorly performing stations had an upland catchment area with an irrigation magnitude greater than half that of the observed flow in the catchment 38 of the poorly performing stations had a reservoir storage magnitude greater than half the that of the observed flow in the catchment in all 62 of the poorly performing catchments exhibited one or more of the three characteristics conversely only 12 of catchments with kge above the threshold of 0 41 had an aridity index less than 0 5 2 had an irrigation magnitude greater than half that of the observed flow and 7 had a reservoir storage magnitude greater than half that of the observed flow this indicates that arid areas most impacted by water use should be areas of focus for calibration activities and further model development this outcome is not unusual compared to other global hydrological modelling studies cold polar not antarctica and dry australia and africa regions were found to perform less well in the water and global change watch study that compared ghm performance voss et al 2008 the earth2observe study investigated how much uncertainty in run off simulated by land surface models is due to the model itself and how much is due to uncertainty in the forcing datasets marthews et al 2020 it was found that only in areas of low precipitation did the model uncertainties match or exceed the uncertainty inherent in the forcing datasets in areas with average to high precipitation model uncertainty stemmed mostly from uncertainties in the precipitation datasets water balance comparisons fig 9 show that dhi ghm is relatively unbiased which could be a benefit of the physical parameter estimation approach as it avoids compensation by local forcing biases lower model performance in drier places may stem from the models inability to capture augmented flows as low flows are particularly sensitive to human management veldkamp et al 2018 dhi ghm models natural flow with an irrigation component and in dry areas where natural flow is drastically disrupted such as the in the rocky mountains in north america the model performs less well a study comparing the routing schemes of ghms also determined that it is important to also consider water withdrawal for other sectors e g domestic industrial and flow alteration by structures and floodplains zhao et al 2017 comparison of the catchment specific kge results to those of the upper and lower benchmarks are presented in fig 11 where panel a displays the global analysis and panel b a regional analysis of six river basins that include an upper benchmark the global median kge is 0 51 for dhi ghm and 0 45 for the lower benchmark the regional median kge is 0 53 for the lower benchmark 0 64 for dhi ghm and 0 67 for the upper benchmark the gain in performance of dhi ghm over the lower benchmark is apparent in both the regional and global analyses there is an increase in performance from the applied regional calibration in the six basins included in the upper benchmark analysis though it is less than the increase in performance of dhi ghm fig 11 in both the regional and global analyses there is a change in the shape of the distribution at kge 0 40 where after this point the gap between the benchmarks and dhi ghm begins to decrease this indicates that the value added through dhi ghm s nam parameter estimation method has a larger effect on results below 0 4 fig 10 shows that many catchments with kge results in this range are located in africa asia and australia continents with data scarce areas where hydrological modelling applications could be informed by dhi ghm 4 2 dhi ghm and other global models performance and setup the inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project isimip provides a framework for consistently projecting the impacts from climate change across sectors and scales frieler et al 2017 gosling et al 2019 isimip consists of various simulation rounds where the simulated data from protocol 2a which focuses on regional and global water among other sectors are publicly available at the time of writing gosling et al 2019 various ghms have produced discharge simulations using the isimip2a protocol including the h08 hanasaki et al 2008a 2008b pcr globwb sutanudjaja et al 2018 van beek and bierkens 2008 and watergap2 2c muller schmied et al 2016 dhi ghm was run using the global soil wetness project 3 gswp3 forcing data dirmeyer et al 2006 lange and büchner 2020 as per the isimip2a protocol for comparison to these three models displayed for the amazon river obidos linigrafo in fig 12 comparisons for the mississippi and danube rivers are included in figures s23 and s24 simulated results visualized here include present day management pressoc of the three isimip studies watergap 2 2c fits best with kge of 0 847 h08 and pcr globwb fit less well with kges 0 51 and 0 47 respectively dhi ghm produces a kge of 0 53 with gswp3 and a kge of 0 854 with era5 and priestley taylor dhi ghm era5 and watergap 2 2c can reproduce well the timing and water balance of the observed discharge time series h08 can produce the timing but not the amplitude of the peaks pcr globwb can produce a more appropriate magnitude but the timing is poorly matched watergap 2 2c is a calibrated model and corrections are made for yearly water balance muller schmied et al 2016 the h08 and pcr globwb models used in isimip2a were not calibrated hanasaki et al 2008a 2008b van beek and bierkens 2008 in the h08 model as little correction was done as possible and some model parameters were tuned based on climatic zones and for specific river basins hanasaki et al 2008a it is of note that a correction to the gswp3 forcing data as described in hirabayashi et al 2008 was applied to the watergap 2 2c model run this correction increases snowfall and precipitation and was not applied to gwsp3 input data to produce the dhi ghm simulation results with this forcing dataset the same correction for elevation for temperature that was applied to the era5 temperature input data was also applied to the gswp3 temperature input data this correction alone appears to be insufficient fig s22 displays how peaks appear too early in the hydrograph indicating that snowmelt occurs too early in addition to the lack of water in the system as muller schmied et al 2016 also note uncertainty in global forcings propagates throughout to uncertainty in the simulation results and this could describe the poorer performance of dhi ghm with the gswp3 forcing data compared to the era5 application of the correction factor could increase the compatibility of comparison of dhi ghm with the isimip model results in the most recently published version of watergap 2 2d müller schmied et al 2021 259 of the 1319 analyzed stations yield an nse below zero corresponding to 80 above the no correlation threshold dhi ghm shows 232 out of 1667 analyzed stations with a kge below 0 41 corresponding to 86 of stations above the threshold watergap 2 2d gives an overall median kge of 0 61 the dhi ghm overall median is 0 51 and the median of stations with a kge above the threshold is 0 56 while these results are not entirely dissimilar the details of the analysis differ watergap 2 2d is analyzed using monthly streamflow whereas dhi ghm is analyzed using discharge time series with daily timesteps many of the basins analyzed in watergap 2 2d are calibrated and or corrected for water balance whereas no calibration is conducted in dhi ghm in the current study in its setup dhi ghm is like other ghms in that it includes the same foundational elements a precipitation partitioning model and a discharge routing model ghms are distinguished by which hydrological cycle elements are considered and at which spatial and temporal resolution distinctive modelling elements include reservoirs irrigation crops vegetation snow soil layers groundwater paul et al 2021 sood and smakhtin 2015 telteu et al 2021 the spatial and temporal resolution of the dhi ghm operational model is on par with the finest resolution land balance models and ghms gwava spatial resolution 0 1 meigh et al 1999 isba computational temporal resolution 20 min and trip temporal resolution 1 hr alkama et al 2010 furthermore dhi ghm achieves these resolutions with a runtime of less than one hour for the entire globe this becomes even more remarkable when it is considered that the model includes reservoir irrigation groundwater and snow modelling elements as well as 2 distinct soil layers and consideration for 16 land use types for a full comparison of dhi ghm technical features against those of other ghms as reviewed by sood and smakhtin 2015 and against wwh arheimer et al 2020 and glofas alfieri et al 2013 see table s4 other models that provide discharge forecasts are the operational wwh and the glofas operational system which combines the htessel and lisflood models alfieri et al 2013 arheimer et al 2020 harrigan et al 2020 wwh is calibrated in a step wise method where individual gauged catchments that represent a particular hydrological process are automatically calibrated against observed data for that process eleven processes are selected for calibration and the calibrated parameters from gauged catchments are then applied to ungauged catchments that share the same physical characteristics arheimer et al 2020 htessel used to determine runoff in glofas uses field derived parameter values that are applied to catchments with similar characteristics as well as values from literature results are assessed by comparison to grdc monthly and annual runoff products balsamo et al 2009 in lisflood the routing element of the glofas operational system the majority of the 34 model parameters can be determined a priori directly from literature existing datasets and satellite products the remaining parameters are calibrated against observed data and regionalized to ungauged catchments van der knijff et al 2010 dhi ghm is distinct in its parameterization scheme where global data products are used to establish physical based relationships with model parameters such that calibration against discharge measurements and regionalization of model parameters is not a necessity the operational wwh provides 10 day forecasts of streamflow presented as a return period indicator at a daily timestep and at a catchment resolution of 1000 km2 the operational glofas provides forecasts from 1 to 15 days at 18 km resolution and from 16 to 30 days at 36 km resolution forecasts are provided at daily timesteps updated either daily or twice weekly in comparison dhi ghm provides 10 day forecasts at hourly timesteps updated hourly at 10 km2 spatial resolution and at the catchment scale it is this hourly resolution and truly real time analysis that can warn of extreme events which is ever more relevant with the earth s rapidly changing climate wwh provides 7 month seasonal operational forecasts of river flow actual evapotranspiration surface runoff and soil water content as a monthly mean updated monthly the glofas operational system produces 16 week seasonal forecasts at daily timesteps updated monthly the weekly averages for the glofas seasonal forecasts are used to determine unusually high and low flows dhi ghm operational system produces 9 month seasonal ensemble forecasts at daily timesteps which are updated every other day this longer forecast at a finer resolution can prove useful as climate change becomes increasingly more important to water resources management decisions 4 3 dhi ghm application dhi ghm has been used to assess water resource availability especially with regards to the impacts of climate change in ten counties in northern kenya murray et al 2022 discharge and run off observations are nearly nonexistent in this region and dhi ghm was essential to completing the assessment based on historical time series simulations from the model water availability from the present to 2050 was then forecasted using climate change factors derived from the cordex africa regional climate model with the representative concentration pathway 4 5 scenario giorgi et al 2009 based on the projected water availability and water demand it is recommended that decision makers address water storage during wet months and review planned irrigation expansion in areas forecast to experience future water deficit the application of dhi ghm is valuable for climate change mitigation planning and decision making especially for areas without the resources for local monitoring or detailed basin scale models dhi ghm proved to be useful for organizations such as the united nations environmental programme unep and the global partnership on marine litter gpml that require a current and forecasted global overview of the earth s hydrology to discern its effect on environmental and societal issues one such issue is plastic pollution it is estimated that approximately 80 of plastic in the sea originates from land based sources lebreton et al 2018 li et al 2016 and thus information of when and where river discharge transports plastic litter is essential for strategy development and planning of intervention activities to combat plastic pollution in the environment the unep dhi centre has developed a model based on dhi ghm that simulates plastic pollution load in the global river network this riverine transport model is the engine behind the gpml s risk and warning system for macroplastic litter which provides 9 month seasonal forecasts at daily timesteps updated every other day for 870 000 simulation points around the globe accessible via the gpml s digital platform gpml unep dhi centre 2022 these forecasts are publicly available for use in action planning which is especially relevant in light of united national environment assembly fifth session resolution end plastic pollution towards an international legally binding instrument united nations environment assembly unea 2022 4 4 possible directions for future development possible next steps for further development of dhi ghm include expanded performance evaluation efforts with catchments of less than 1000 km2 and inclusion of lakes less than 10 km2 there is also scope for improvement of the potential evaporation forcing dataset by fine tuning of the priestley taylor empirical constant αp via calibration regional calibration of the nam model parameterizations is also a way to improve the model performance and the utility of the dhi ghm operational system evaluation of model uncertainty and parameter sensitivity is growing increasingly possible for global models and investigation of parameter sensitivity both within dhi ghm and as compared to other ghms for example through the isimip study could be particularly insightful frieler et al 2017 gosling et al 2019 reinecke et al 2021 reinecke et al 2019 the application of machine learning to ghms has also been demonstrated which could help in further defining uncertain parameters and uncertain model processes such as the complex water use regimes in arid areas kraft et al 2022 evaluation of hydrological forecast performance requires both observed discharge and meteorological forecast time series from the same period and meteorological forecasts are archived during dhi ghm operation currently few discharge time series are available in real time as discharge time series become available for the same period as the archived forecasts evaluation of dhi ghm forecast skill by for example the persistence criterion metric kitanidis and bras 1980 will become possible this would increase trust in the model as well as guide model development for example hydrological model forecast performance can be improved by data assimilation hydrological observations such as basin runoff and river discharge measurements are not available in real time at the global scale however soil moisture and water level measurements gathered by remote sensing are readily available babaeian et al 2019 soil moisture measured by satellites can be assimilated in the nam to improve forecast performance and water level measurement is especially appealing for updating larger lakes the hydroweb water levels of rivers and lakes product consists of long time series 1992 present 1 5 days delay for 124 of the world s large lakes and 11 336 measurement points on rivers bercher 2008 rosmorduc and vayre 2021 water level predictions are valuable to water managers in order to control for flood events and model development to include water level forecasting could be supported by altimetry derived datasets schneider et al 2018 increased spatial resolution of ghms with catchment delineation of as fine as 1 km2 has been cited as the ideal way forward for monitoring water availability bierkens et al 2015 wood et al 2011 however increased model spatial resolution that is not accompanied by increased resolution and decreased epistemic uncertainty in global forcing data may only increase the model uncertainty beven 2019 indeed the coarse spatial resolution of ghms cannot compete with traditional basin scale models in answer to this the dhi ghm modelling framework has been adapted for the country of denmark dhi s danish hydrological model or dhi dhm and local forcing data from the danish meteorological institute denmark is covered by 301 catchments in dhi ghm routing scheme and by 48 885 in dhi dhm routing scheme and local municipalities can better relate to discharge and water level simulations at this scale for decision making applications beven 2019 even if suitable forcing data were available the development of such refined catchment delineation for the whole world is limiting to global application at this scale as dhi dhm completes a real time and forecasting run in less than 5 min this resolution could theoretically be applied to larger areas with the current level of development and available computation resources within a not unreasonable amount of time regions of the globe may be able to be simulated in less than an hour as new forecasts are available while global simulation would no longer be in real time without additional development 5 conclusions dhi ghm is comprised of two components distributed grid based rainfall runoff models and a catchment based kinematic routing model the kinematic routing model is unique in its quick execution which is founded on the relationship between the actual and average discharge in the catchment the application of the nam in the rainfall runoff modelling component is based on a priori parameterization entirely from globally available datasets it does not rely on local data sources for calibration dhi ghm has produced long term historical time series and is executed as an operational system where real time simulations and 10 day and 9 month forecasts are produced real time and short term forecasts are produced each hour and seasonal forecasts are produced every other day the development of dhi ghm demonstrates that a relatively high resolution ghm can produce reasonable results for much of the world s river network also compared to other established ghms multiple forcing datasets were evaluated for operational use it was determined that the era5 and priestley taylor forcing datasets perform best when compared against 1667 discharge observation points over a historical 9 year period dhi ghm performs better in temperate and wetter areas and less well in arid and cold regions where two thirds of all poorly performing performance evaluation stations are impacted by one or more of the factors aridity withdrawal or regulation more focus should be dedicated to incorporating human effects on the hydrological cycle to address this common shortcoming of ghms credit authorship
