4380,estimating terrestrial evapotranspiration et accurately at various temporal and spatial scales is crucial for understanding the hydrological cycle and water resource management the currently available et estimates have some uncertainties and need to be further improved in this study six machine learning methods including the random forests support vector machine gaussian process regression gpr ensemble trees general regression neural network and bayesian model averaging are applied and evaluated to improve china terrestrial et estimation by integrating five process based et algorithms including semi pm rs pm rrs pm mod16 and pmlv2 then evaluations are conducted with the eddy covariance flux observations at 14 china flux tower sites distributing in forest shrub wetland grassland and cropland as well as with water balance based et at basin scale according to the multiple training validation and testing the gpr method is superior to all the other methods compared with the individual algorithms the gpr method can reduce the root mean square error rmse by 0 45 mm day 1 for semi pm 0 81 mm day 1 for pmlv2 improve the coefficientofdetermination r2 by 0 061 for pmlv2 0

terrestrial et is reliable r2 0 88 rmse 57 18 mm year 1 rpe 0 26 and has higher accuracy than the currently available eight high resolution et products and the estimates from the other five machine learning methods and the five single et models the annual average terrestrial et across china for 2000 2018 estimated by the gpr method is approximately 397 65 mm year 1 more ground based observations of terrestrial et covering various land types should be collected to update the integrating methods and improve et estimates the resultant china terrestrial et product with a spatial and temporal

et al 2013 and upscaling eddy covariance mastered et by machine learning methods carter and liang 2019 fang et al 2020 jung et al 2010 li et al 2018 although these approaches are widely used to estimate terrestrial et simulation results may differ substantially owing to differences in the input data algorithms themselves and the calibrated coefficients as a consequence a single et algorithm cannot well characterize et for all ecosystem types chen et al 2015 yao et al 2017 2014 for example china et estimates using eight different algorithms revealed that many et algorithms had substantial differences in accuracy for different ecosystem types chen et al 2015 three individual et algorithms including the modis et products algorithm mu et al 2011 the priestley taylor et algorithm of jet propulsion laboratory fisher et al 2008 and the semi empirical penman et algorithm wang et al 2010b all showed a poor performance in simulating daily et at the crop sites yao et al 2017 the integration of multi et models through complex methods helps to reduce the uncertainty of et estimation and increase the accuracy of et estimation yao et al 2017 2014 the linear combination methods such as the simple average sa method bhattarai et al 2019 and bayesian model averaging bma method chen et al 2015 yao et al 2014 and nonlinear combination methods such as machine learning techniques yao et al 2017 have both been applied to merge the individual et algorithms at the regional and global scale for example the bma method enhances the daily le estimates at all 120 globally distributed eddy covariance tower sites that cover forest shrubland savanna grassland and cropland with lower rmse root mean square error and higher r2 coefficientofdetermination than the sa method and the five individual process based et algorithms yao et al 2014 sa based et yielded hourly et with lower rmse than all of the seven individual surface energy balance models at four cropland sites located in india bhattarai et al 2019 using the support vector machine svm method to integrate three process based global et estimates was superior to the single et model bma and the general regression neural network grnn at the site and the basin level yao et al 2017 although the performance of svm merged et at the global scale is good yao et al 2017 there are also other machine learning methods such as random forest ensemble tree and gaussian process regression and the other process based et algorithm such as the penman monteith leuning version 2 leuning et al 2008 zhang et al 2019b has not been applied to integrate the individual et models to produce new et products which may have a better performance at different spatial and temporal scales the individual et models such as the complementary relationship model ma et al 2019 revised remote sensing based penman monteith method li et al 2014 upscaling flux tower observation et method li et al 2018 boreal ecosystem productivity simulator model liu et al 2013b vegetation interface processes model mo et al 2015 reanalysis data produced by land surface models feng et al 2018 and the ensemble et method such as bma method chen et al 2015 were widely applied to estimate et at different spatial resolution and temporal resolutions across china due to china s complex land surface conditions such as various ecosystem types multiple climatic zones and complex terrain and the complexity of the et process there exist large uncertainties on both magnitudes and trends of china s et which indicates the importance to improve china s et estimates for example the mean annual et over china was estimated to be 552 14 mm yr 1 during 1982 2015 li et al 2018 whereas 406 15 mm yr 1 during 1982 2012 ma et al 2019 integrating multiple et algorithms with multiple machine learning methods provides one way to improve terrestrial et estimation improving et estimates is important both regionally and globally the science communities that can capitalize on improved information on et are broad and include 1 agronomy e g agricultural water resource management 2 ecology e g biodiversity assessments 3 hydrology e g regional water balance closures 4 atmospheric science 5 climate 6 carbon cycle 7 coastal science and 8 policy economics e g water rights litigation fisher et al 2017 therefore the objective of this study is to develop reliable terrestrial et estimates across china by integrating multiple et algorithms using multi machine learning methods 2 data and methods the framework of this study is as in fig 1 five process based et algorithms are forced by the climate data including the china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd and interpolated air temperature with meteorological station data and remote sensing data including leaf area index lai fraction of photosynthetically active radiation fpar the normalized vegetation index ndvi and land use land cover lulc the specific input items for each et algorithm are shown in fig 1 then we evaluate the five et algorithms using the observed et by eddy covariance ec flux tower sites and we use six machine learning methods to establish the relationship between the site observation 10 day average et and five process based et under the same training set validation set and test set according to the minimum rmse value on the test set we select a better model in each machine learning method to generate the china 10 day interval terrestrial et product chinaet1km10day with the inputs of five china 10 day interval process based et products take the water balance et as the true value we compare the china annual et products derived from six machine learning methods with the china annual et derived from eight high resolution et products at the basin scale 2 1 forcing data 2 1 1 meteorological data cmfd including daily precipitation rate pressure wind speed at 10 m height relative humidity and downward shortwave is from http www tpedatabase cn kun and jie 2018 this dataset is produced based on the princeton re analysis data gldas data gewex xrb radiation data trmm precipitation and meteorological station data from 830 meteorological stations within china resulting in a high resolution 0 1 meteorological forcing dataset over china he et al 2020 cmfd has been applied in previous china et estimates ma et al 2019 the commonly used bilinear interpolation method was used to resample cmfd to 1 km resolution because cmfd does not include maximum temperature and minimum temperature we used the thin plate spline function considering the elevation effect on temperature hijmans et al 2005 mcvicar et al 2007 to interpolate temperature mean minimum and maximum temperature across china at a resolution of 1 km day using the observations at 830 meteorological stations fig 2 the daily weather was averaged to obtain 10 day average weather there are three 10 day averages for each month assuming there are n days in a month the average weather for the first two 10 day periods was computed from 1st to 10th and from 11st to 20th day in the month respectively while the average weather for the third period was computed using the rest of the days in the month i e from 21st to nth days the above method is also used for the average computation of flux tower observation on et and ndvi 2 1 2 remote sensing data lai fpar and the ndvi can characterize vegetation structure and function which are closely related to et lulc is related to the parameters in the et estimate lai fpar ndvi and lulc were all acquired from the mature satellite products 10 day interval geov2 lai and fpar with 1 km spatial resolution were downloaded from the copernicus global land service cgls https land copernicus eu global lai and fpar were from the spot vegetation and proba v data baret et al 2013 since the lai and fpar data from modis has a large number of missing values in northwest china and this research aims at calculating the et of all land types in china the lai and fpar data from modis are not used ndvi was from the mod13a2 product that contains the 16 day interval ndvi with 1 km resolution lulc was from the mcd12q1 product that recorded the annual 500 m resolution lulc the lulc classification of igbp in the mcd12q1 was used in this study because igbp classification is adopted by process based et models for biome properties look up table mcd12q1 and mod13a2 were downloaded from the nasa laads daac https ladsweb modaps eosdis nasa gov to reduce cloud contamination the savitzky golay filter and quality control documents were applied in the original mod13a2 to produce high quality data mo et al 2017 yin et al 2020b linear interpolation was used to produce daily sequences in ndvi carter and liang 2018 the above four variables were resampled to the same projection and spatial resolution 2 2 validation data 2 2 1 eddy covariance data the machine learning methods and five traditional et algorithms were validated using ground measured flux data the data were collected at fourteen ec flux tower sites table 1 fig 2 and provided by the chinaflux http www cnern org cn zhang et al 2019a fluxnet2015 https fluxnet fluxdata org multi scale surface flux and meteorological elements observation dataset in the hai river basin https data tpdc ac cn zh hans liu et al 2013a the flux tower data are given every 30 min there are some missing values filled by 999 in the 30 minute flux tower observation data when the number n of the valid 30 minute measurements is higher than 40 per day the daily total et is as calculated as 1 e t i l e i 60 30 2 501 0 002361 t i 10 6 2 e t i 1 n e t i 48 n where l e i is the given 30 min latent heat flux w m 2 ti is the air temperature if n is less than 40 the daily et measurements are set as fill value mu et al 2011 besides since the ec method suffers an energy imbalance problem the measured et was corrected using the method proposed by twine et al 2000 finally the daily water flux was aggregated into 10 day average et data if there were seven valid et measurements non filled during the 10 days flux towers are mainly located in the eastern parts of china fig 2 the climate for the flux tower locations varies from humid to dry and from tropical to the temperate zone the flux tower sites cover six major lulc types deciduous broadleaf forest dbf 1 site evergreen broadleaf forest ebf 3 sites cropland cro 5 sites grassland gra 4 sites open shrubland osb 1 site and permanent wetland wet 1 site the flux tower data cover the period from 2003 to 2017 and each flux tower has at least 3 years of reliable data 2 2 2 runoff data and water balance et for water resource management 10 major river basins were defined by the ministry of water resources of china which include songhua liao hai yellow huai yangtze southeast pearl and southwest and northwest river basins fig 2 the drainage areas of these basins range from 20 82 104 to 333 9 104 km2 the national water resources bulletin officially released by the ministry of water resources in china records the annual runoff q over these basins http www mwr gov cn sj tjgb szygb since the data are based on the official ground q observation networks of the ministry of water resources of china they are reliable water resources statistics and have been used for evaluating various et products ma et al 2019 therefore we collected the q during the years 2003 2016 from national water resources bulletin the merged et estimation over the basin and regional scale was evaluated based on the water balance equation the et based on the water balance equation has been commonly used as the reference to validate modeled et at a multi year scale ma et al 2019 velpuri et al 2013 xu et al 2019 et can be calculated based on precipitation prec q and the water storage change wsc within a water closed basin 3 et prec q wsc of the four budget components prec and q are acquired from the cmfd national water resources bulletin respectively and wsc is calculated based on the grace data with spatial resolution of 1 which are released by three processing centers german research centre for geosciences center for space research at the university of texas austin and jet propulsion laboratory all based on the same earth s gravity field the arithmetic average of these three products was used to reduce the uncertainties due to the noise terms in the different solutions ma et al 2019 grace data is only complete during the years 2003 2016 therefore annual wsc during the years 2003 2016 is calculated as the difference between consecutive december terrestrial water storage anomaly ma et al 2019 and terrestrial water balance et can be inferred using eq 3 within the major china large basins fig 2 2 2 3 high resolution et products as there are numerous et products available covering the whole of china it is necessary to compare the quality of the merged et values with other currently available et datasets eight et products were selected based on two criteria i the spatial resolution must be at least 0 1 10 km and ii the products should be derived by current mainstream methods the spatial resolution of eight et products varies from 500 m to 0 1 while the temporal resolution from 8 days to one month more detailed information about the eight et products is listed in table 2 considering the different temporal coverage of the eight et products we selected the common temporal coverage of 2003 2015 for comparisons between the merged et and eight et products 2 3 methods 2 3 1 process

by semi pm the algorithms table 3 are briefly described below 2 3 1 1 semi empirical penman monteith et algorithm semi pm due to the lack of long term satellite and ground measurement data no satellite based et method was available to detect global et long term changes wang et al 2010a b to fill that gap wang et al 2010a developed a semi empirical et algorithm based on the penman and penman monteith equations monteith 1965 penman 1948 using 64 globally distributed flux tower sites the algorithm mainly considered the impacts of rs tmin tmax vapor pressure deficit rh ndvi and wind

et al 2008 mu et al 2007 showed that the penman monteith equation is a biophysically sound and robust method for estimating et at regional to global scales using remotely sensed data however the penman monteith et algorithm is limited by global lai availability and accuracy in the pre modis era i e before 2000 cleugh et al 2007 leuning et al 2008 mu et al 2007 which causes the lack of continuous long term i e from the early 1980s satellite based et records based on the above researches zhang et al 2010a developed a biome specific ndvi based canopy conductance model rs pm and used 34 fluxnet tower sites to parameterize and 48 additional independent flux towers to validate it zhang et al 2010a they successfully produce a continuous satellite derived global record of land surface et from 1983 to 2006 which explained 80 variability in water balance et the formulas are as follows 7 et l e s l e c Œª 8 le c Œ¥ r nc œÅ c p v p d g a Œ¥ Œ≥ 1 g a g s 9 l e s r h 100 vpd Œ≤ Œ¥ r ns

pm equation and constraint parameters of air temperature and vpd that differ for different vegetation types after sensitivity experiments yuan et al 2010 found it is possible to set constant model parameters for different vegetation types which helps to reduce the impact of misclassification of land cover types therefore yuan et al 2010 developed a revised remote sensing based pm et algorithm rrs pm by calibrating the three parameters including total aerodynamic resistance mean potential stomatal conductance and vpdclose when water stress causes stomata to close almost completely halting plant transpiration as constants and replacing the calculation method of energy distribution between soil and canopy at the global 54 eddy covariance flux tower sites rrs pm could explain 82 and 68 of the observed variations of et at all the calibration and validation sites respectively yuan et al 2010 the rrs pm performed better than the beta version of the mod16 algorithm at the 23 eddy covariance flux tower sites in china with higher r2 and lower rmse chen et al 2014 the formulas are as follows 10 et l e s l e c Œª 11 l e c Œ¥ r nc œÅ c p v p d r a Œ¥ Œ≥ 1 r s r a 12 l e s 0 01 r h

implementation methods as well as the experimental settings of the entire machine learning process 2 3 2 1 machine learning methods six machine learning methods including svm gaussian process regression gpr ensemble trees ent and random forests rf generalized regression neural network grnn and bma were chosen to integrate five single et models in this study among them rf ent and gpr have not been used to integrate et algorithms in previous research svm regression conducts linear regression by nonlinearly mapping the original low dimensional input space to higher dimensional feature space using kernel functions sain and stephan 1997 we used the function of fitrsvm in matlab 2018a with the kernel function of radial basis function to train the svm and we used the bayesian optimization to optimize the hyperparameters box constraint kernel scale and epsilon the number of iterations of the bayesian optimization for each machine learning method was at least 100 and the minimum rmse of the validation data set was used as the objective value to obtain the optimal hyperparameters the optimization process and hyperparameters are in the supplementary files figs s1 s2 more details about the svm could be found in the reference mathworks 2019 gpr models are nonparametric kernel based probabilistic models which can fit non linear data well and output the probability distribution of predicted values and obtain a good regularization effect without cross validation by marginal log likelihood rasmussen and williams 2006 squared exponential kernel one of the most commonly used covariance functions was selected as the kernel function of the gpr model in this research the specific formula is 23 k x i x j Œ∏ œÉ f 2 exp 1 2 m 1 n x im x jm 2 œÉ m 2 where œÉm represents the length scale for predicator m m 1 2 n and œÉf is the signal standard deviation œÉ is the unconstrained parametrization we used the function of fitrgp in matlab 2018a to train the gpr and the hyperparameter of œÉ was optimizing using the bayesian optimization further details about gpr can be found in rasmussen and williams 2006 the optimization process and the optimal hyperparameters are in figs s3 s5 ent averages multiple regression trees to perform regression the data used to train the regression tree is obtained by the bagging method in this research in the bagging method the sampling method of the subset is random sampling with replacement about 36 8 of the data in the training set called out of bag data is not collected by the sampling set which ensures a strong generalization ability of the model and there is no dependency between the regression trees the function of templatetree was used to build the regression tree and the function of fitrensemble was used to averages the regression trees in matlab 2018a we use the bayesian optimization to optimal the hyperparameters including the number of learning cycles and minimum leaf size the optimization process and the optimal hyperparameters are in figs s6 s8 further details about ent can be found in the reference breiman 1996 and mathworks 2019 rf integrates multiple weak learners to perform regression breiman 2001 cart decision trees were used as weak learners in the rf based on the use of decision trees rf has improved the establishment of decision trees for ordinary decision trees we will choose an optimal feature from all n sample features on the node to divide the left and right subtrees of the decision tree however rf randomly selects a part of the sample features on the node this number is less than n and is assumed to be nsub then among these randomly selected nsub sample features an optimal feature is selected to divide the left and right subtrees of the decision tree this further enhances the generalization ability of the model the sampling method of the subsample is the bagging method we used the matlab program corresponding to the r package randomforest to implement the rf the hyperparameters the number of trees grown and the number of predictors sampled for splitting at each node were optimizing by bayesian optimization in matlab 2018a the optimization process and the optimal hyperparameters are in figs s9 11 further details about rf can be found in the literature breiman 2001 grnn is a type of supervised forward propagation network and the functional estimate of the grnn is calculated directly from the training data without iterative training which makes grnn training very fast specht 1991 the grnn has four layers including the input layer the pattern layer the summation layer and the output layer the input layer includes the input variables et estimated from five single algorithms and the output layer provides the grnn method estimated et by merging the five algorithms the pattern layer has many radial basis neurons that are usually probability density function such as the gaussian the grnn equations as follow 24 y x i 1 n y i exp d i 2 2 √Æ 2 i 1 n exp d i 2 2 √Æ 2 25 d i 2 x x i t x x i where y x is the estimation corresponding to the input vectors x yi is the output vector corresponding to the i th training input vector xi n is the number of samples di2 is the squared euclidean distance between x and xi and œÉ is a hyperparameter of smoothing parameter we used the function newgrnn in matlab 2018a to

dependent variable observed et ar a constant br the coefficients x a matrix and containing n variables five single et bma estimates models for all possible combinations of xi x the total combination is 2n and constructs a weighted average over all of them 2n models the weights stem from posterior model probabilities that arise from bayes theorem bma can be easily implemented through the r package bas that uses stochastic or deterministic sampling without replacement from posterior distributions clyde 2020 validation data is used to select the optimal bma model among the fifteen experiments 2 3 2 2 machine learning experimental setup to merge five satellite based et algorithms we trained the six machine learning methods based on the 10 day average et measured by eddy covariance flux tower and the corresponding estimated et using the individual algorithms during the period of 2003 2017 we train and test the models as follows firstly for each eddy covariance flux tower site the measured et samples are separated into two parts training set ts 85 and testing set 15 by the way of random sampling without replacement then the training set is further divided into a validation set 15 of the whole data and a test set 70 of the whole data the training data validation data and testing data don t share any replicates the training data set is used to build the model and the validation data is used to validate the generalization error and adjust the hyperparameters for optimizing the model the test data is used to evaluate model performance six machine methods used the same training set validation set and test set random sampling in the ts is repeated fifteen times and get the fifteen test results of each machine learning method under the same test set in this way each machine learning method will produce fifteen sets of models for each machine learning method according to the accuracy of fifteen times on the same test set we choose the better accurate models to merge the five process based et algorithms to generate china 10 day interval terrestrial et product each machine learning method will produce a china et the reason for adopting the above mentioned machine learning steps is that 1 six machine learning methods are selected rather than one model 2 the amount of sample is sufficient 3 the machine learning method is relatively simple and involves a few hyperparameters 4 the contrast of the six machine learning methods is guaranteed because the six machine learning methods are in the same training set test set and training set cross validation cannot guarantee that the six machine learning models will adjust their parameters on the same validation set which makes it difficult to compare the quality of the six machine learning models 5 multiple random sampling ensures that all data participates in training validation and testing 2 3 3 model performance three indicators rmse r2 and relative percent error rpe are used to evaluate the agreement between the simulated et and the measured et at the site level and regional scale r2 represents how much the model can explain the variations in the observations rmse quantifies the difference between simulations and observations rpe quantifies the difference between the average of the observed and simulated values the formulas of rmse r2 and rpe are as following 26 r m s e 1 n i 1 n y i x i 2 27 r 2 1 i 1 n x i y i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 28 r p e x y y 100 where n is the sample number xi is the simulated et yi is the observed et x is the average value of simulated et and y is the average value of observed et to test the relative importance of each individual et algorithm to the merged et we remove one et algorithm among the five et algorithms and replicate the training process using the other four et algorithms in the final each machine learning method the rmse change crmse i r2 change cr i 2 and absolute rpe change carpe i caused by reducing one et model are used to represent the relative importance of each algorithm the formulas are 29 c r m s e i r m s e i r m s e f i v e 30 c r i 2 r f i v e 2 r i 2 31 c a r p e i r p e f i v e r p e i where i is the single process based et model e g semi pm rmsei ri 2 and rpei are the rmse r2 and absolute rpe values of the integrated four et algorithms after removing the i th et model in the test set respectively rmsefive rfive 2 and rpefive are the rmse r2 and absolute rpe value of the integrated five et algorithms in the test set respectively the larger the value of crmse i cr i 2 and carpe i the higher the relative importance of the i th et model in the integration we also use the difference method to quantify how each machine learning method improves a single et on different land types 3 results 3 1 comparisons of the five single process based et algorithms at each flux tower site the five process based et algorithms exhibit substantial differences in et estimates the 10 day averaged et observed at 14 ec flux tower sites are compared with estimates in different lulc fig 3 for the ebf pmlv2 rs pm and rrs pm highly overestimate the observed et with rpe of 48 69 43 11 and 16 54 respectively while semi pm highly underestimates the observed et with rpe of 22 09 fig 3 mod16 underestimates the observed et rpe 9 39 and has the lowest rmse 0 80 mm day 1 among the five et models but mod16 can only explain 60 11 of the observed et variability therefore it is poor to characterize 10 day averaged et using the five process based et algorithms for the ebf for the dbf all et models can explain 87 90 of the observed et variability pmlv2 highly overestimate the observed et rpe 46 06 while rs pm mod16 and semi pm highly underestimate the observed et with rpe of 26 75 20 86 and 16 64 respectively rrs pm has the lowest rmse 0 53 mm day 1 vs 0 72 mm day 1 in mod16 lowest absolute rpe 7 50 among the five et models therefore rrs pm has a good performance in simulating et for the dbf for the osb although pmlv2 rs pm and semi pm can explain 91 54 94 21 of the observed et variability the three et models overestimate or underestimate the observed et by more than 30 rrs pm highly underestimates the observed et with an rpe of 41 89 besides mod16 has a high rmse of 0 99 mm day 1 and a low r2 of 0 54 so among the five process based et models no model is superior to the other four models in characterizing et for the osb for the gra pmlv2 highly overestimates 30 41 of the observed et while rrs pm semi pm and mod16 highly underestimate it by 14 45 for mod16 63 29 for rrs pm rs pm overestimates 9 82 of the observed et the rmse values of the five single et models vary from 0 63 mm day 1 for rs pm to 1 23 mm day 1 for rrs pm rs pm can explain 75 15 of the observed et variability which is higher than semi pm 67 11 rrs pm 60 18 and mod16 24 62 therefore rs pm has a better agreement with the observed et than the other four et models for the gra for the cro pmlv2 highly overestimate 53 36 of the observed et while rrs pm and semi pm underestimate the observed et by 17 61 and 14 15 respectively the rpe values of rs pm and mod16 are very small the rmse values of the five single et models vary from 0 98 mm day 1 for rs pm to 1 55 mm day 1 for rrs pm the r2 of rs pm is only 0 57 which is higher than mod16 0 38 and rrs pm 0 56 lower than pmlv2 0 70 and semi pm 0 65 in summary it is poor to simulate et for the cro using the five process based et algorithms for all datasets the rmse values of the five process based et algorithms are higher than 0 90 mm day 1 0 90 mm day 1 for semi pm 1 30 mm day 1 for pmlv2 the r2 values vary from 0 56 for mod16 0 83 for pmlv2 pmlv2 and rs pm overestimate the observed et especially with rpe of 44 25 for pmlv2 the other three et models underestimate the observed et from 8 9 for rrs pm to 23 32 for semi pm 3 2 evaluation of the machine learning methods at the test set according to section 3 1 it is obvious that no single et algorithm can perform best for all the lulc types warranting the necessity of integrating the single et estimates by the machine learning methods in this section we introduce the test results of the six machine learning methods in merging the five single et models using the test set among the six machine learning methods the gpr generally performs best based on the test set with the lowest rmse highest r2 and lowest absolute rpe fig 4 while bma performs worse in the term of rmse the mean rmse of gpr is 0 469 mm day 1 followed by svm 0 474 mm day 1 grnn 0 486 mm day 1 rf 0 493 mm day 1 ent 0 498 mm day 1 and bma 0 578 mm day 1 the mean rmse differences between gpr and the other four models except bma are less than 0 028 mm day 1 in the term of r2 the mean r2 differences among the five machine learning methods except bma are within 0 014 gpr and svm have a slightly higher r2 than grnn rf and ent they can all explain well the observed et variability by 87 59 89 01 at the test set while bma can explain 83 29 et variability fig 4 the rpe values of the six machine learning methods are all close to 0 varying 0 16 for rf 0 97 for bma which indicates that six methods slightly underestimate the observed et the evaluation of the optimal model established by each machine learning method on the same test set is shown in fig 5 and fig 6 at all test sets svm gpr and grnn perform generally better than the other three machine learning methods with lower rmse 0 47 mm day 1 and higher r2 0 89 the rmse 0 487 mm day 1 and r2 0 881 values of rf and ent are very close but the absolute rpe value of rf is closer to 0 fig 5 bma performs the worst among the six machine learning methods with lower r2 0 833 higher rmse 0 577 mm day 1 and higher absolute rpe than the other five machine learning methods fig 5 the optimal model of each machine learning method performs well at the ebf dbf osb and gra under the same test set with low rmse high r2 and low absolute rpe especially at the osb and dbf fig 6 six machine learning methods all slightly overestimate the et at the ebf and slightly underestimate the et at the gra six machine learning methods highly overestimate the et at the wet with rpe varying 7 80 for svm 18 39 for bma at the cro six machine learning methods can explain 62 for bma 83 for grnn et variability which is lower than that in other lulc and the rmse values at cro vary 0 61 mm day 1 for grnn 0 91 mm day 1 for bma which is also higher than other lulc 3 3 comparison of the merged et with the single process based et under the same test set compared with the single process based et model the six machine learning methods generally improve the et estimation for six lulc types with decreased rmse increased r2 and decreased absolute rpe fig 7 the magnitude of the improvement depends on the single et model and machine learning methods the et improvement using bma is lower than that using the other five machine learning methods for example for dbf the improvement in accuracy of et estimation using bma is small compared with the rs pm model but large compared with pmlv2 gpr svm ent grnn and rf improve et estimation accuracy similarly compared to different single et models for each lulc type at all the test data using gpr the increased r2 is between 0 061 vs pmlv2 and 0 33 vs mod16 the reduced rmse is between 0 45 mm day 1 vs semi pm and 0 80 mm day 1 vs pmlv2 and the reduced absolute rpe is between 8 33 vs rs pm and 42 47 vs pmlv2 3 4 relative importance of each single process based et model for each machine learning method the rmse value increases most and the r2 value decreases most when the pmlv2 model is excluded in the integration among the five process based et models fig 8 excluding the pmlv2 model causes an increase in absolute rpe in svm rf and bma while causes a very slight decrease 0 2 in absolute rpe in the other three machine learning methods therefore the pmlv2 algorithm is more important than the other four process based et models in merging et excluding semi pm causes a slight decrease in rmse and an increase in r2 but it causes an increase in absolute rpe in svm ent and rf excluding rs pm causes a decrease of rmse and an increase of r2 in ent but an increase of rmse and a decrease of r2 in other machine learning methods although the magnitude of the changes is lower than that for rrs pm mod16 and pmlv2 3 5 comparison of the merged et with other et products at the basin scale we use water balance et as the true value to evaluate the annual et estimated by each model fig 9 in the term of r2 the differences between the various et models are relatively small except for mte modis and glass the r2 values of the other eleven et models vary from 0 85 for bma to 0 91 for ssebop r2 of the machine learning methods including gpr rf and svm reach 0 88 which indicates that the et products derived by the gpr rf and svm can well capture the spatial variability of et across china gpr et has the lowest rmse 57 18 mm yr 1 among the fourteen et models followed by rf et 57 40 mm yr 1 svm et 58 21 mm yr 1 ent et 62 97 mm yr 1 bess et 63 37 mm yr 1 and bma et 67 62 mm yr 1 rmses for the other models are higher than 70 mm yr 1 pmlv2 et and ssebop et have slightly higher r2 than gpr et 0 89 vs 0 88 0 91 vs 0 88 but have more than double rmse values than gpr et 56 80 mm yr 1 vs 141 06 mm yr 1 56 80 mm yr 1 vs 133 30 mm yr 1 as for rpe the glass et mte et and pmlv2 et highly overestimate annual et by 88 68 40 77 and 26 16 respectively the ssebop et and modis et overestimate annual et by 20 24 and 14 35 respectively the rpe of gpr et 0 26 and svm et 0 58 are very close to 0 the cr et bess et and sebs et slightly underestimate the annual et by 3 42 3 72 and 5 95 respectively in summary gpr et and svm et have better agreement with the water balance based annual et than the current eight high resolution et products and the other four machine learning methods compared to the widely used modis et gpr et and svm et improve annual et estimation across china 3 6 spatial distribution of the average annual et during 2000 2018 based on the et evaluation results at the site scale fig 4 fig 5 fig 6 and the basin scale fig 9 merging the five process based et models using the gpr method can better characterize china et than svm grnn ent and bma we apply the five process based et algorithms and the six machine learning methods to develop china terrestrial et datasets with a spatial and temporal resolution of 1 km and 10 days chinaet1km10days since there is no barren type in the training site the et of barren type is replaced by the et estimated by the pmlv2 algorithm the annual average of terrestrial et across china over 2000 2018 is shown in fig 10 despite the general differences in et spatial distribution among different models all of the models exhibit a notable decreasing gradient from the southeast to the northwest among these methods rs pm and mod16 overestimate the annual et of the tibetan plateau considering that the data inputs of different single et models are similar the reason for the overestimation may be the algorithm structure after integration through machine learning methods the above errors are reduced these models yield a high annual et over the evergreen broadleaf forest whereas a low annual et in arid and desert regions owing to precipitation limitation the average annual terrestrial et across china merged by gpr is 397 65 mm year 1 63 72 of average annual precipitation it is higher than that derived by the rrs pm algorithm 305 28 mm year 1 grnn 367 72 mm year 1 bma 386 90 mm year 1 ent 390 88 mm year 1 semi pm algorithm 391 88 mm year 1 and rs pm algorithm 395 16 mm year 1 but it is lower than that derived by svm 400 76 mm year 1 rf 404 07 mm year 1 the pmlv2 algorithm 465 23 mm year 1 and the mod16 algorithm 468 80 mm year 1 according to the average annual et derived by gpr method the evergreen broadleaf forest has the highest average et 719 62 mm year 1 followed by evergreen needleleaf forests 640 58 mm year 1 savannas 620 15 mm year 1 woody savannas 587 05 mm year 1 mixed forests 574 20 mm year 1 closed shrublands 573 68 mm year 1 deciduous broadleaf forest 527 41 mm year 1 cropland 499 54 mm year 1 deciduous needle leaf forests 410 46 mm year 1 and grassland 363 12 mm year 1 4 discussion 4 1 the performance of the gpr method by merging the five process based et algorithms the gpr method not only preserves the partial dynamic information of the et process but also simulates terrestrial et with high accuracy compared with the five individual et models and eight currently et products the gpr method successfully improves the et estimation accuracy at both site and basin scales fig 7 fig 11 fig 9 the performance of gpr is slightly higher than svm and moderately higher than grnn ent and rf and much higher than bma in a previous study the accuracy of svm merged global et is higher than that of grnn and the bma method yao et al 2017 our research also found that svm merged china et was better than grnn and bma fig 4 fig 9 glass et was produced by using bma to integrate five process based et models including mod16 rrs pm semi pm priestley taylor based et algorithm pt jpl fisher et al 2008 and modified satellite based priestley taylor et algorithm ms pt yao et al 2013 yao et al 2014 but it greatly overestimated annual et across china rpe 88 6 and had a very high rmse of 474 66 mm yr 1 fig 9 this current study replaced the ms pt and pt jpl with rs pm and pmlv2 among the process based et algorithms included and used the bma to integrate five et process based et algorithms to generate the china et the evaluation results showed that bma merged china et performed much better than the glass et in quantifying china annual et at basin scale with much lower rpe 3 92 vs 88 6 and much lower rmse 67 62 mm yr 1 vs 474 66 mm yr 1 fig 9 which was related with the different input data in integrating et individual et and training samples this also indicates the importance of single et selection for integration using the six machine learning methods the pmlv2 algorithm consistently has the highest importance among the five process based et algorithms at site scale in integrating et however the pmlv2 algorithm was not included in the previous et integrating studies chen et al 2015 yao et al 2017 2014 therefore reasonable choices of integrated et models and machine learning methods can further improve the et estimation accuracy in cro type five single et models all had a poor performance with low r2 and high rmse fig 3 which caused the poor performance of gpr and the other five machine learning methods in cro than that in other lulc types fig 9 a previous study also showed that almost all three individual algorithms including mod16 pt jpl and semi pm had poor performance at the cro sites and so did the three merged estimates by svm grnn and bma yao et al 2017 for different lulc types and single et models the et estimation accuracy improvement by machine learning methods is different fig 7 which mainly depends on the machine learning method type and the accuracy of each single et algorithm for instance in gra six machine learning methods all increased high r2 compared with mod16 but increased little r2 compared with pmlv2 fig 7 machine learning methods can achieve high r2 because one or more of the five single et algorithms have high r2 pmlv2 and rrs pm instead of all five et algorithms with low r2 similar to cro the low r2 of mod16 makes the space large for machine learning methods to increase r2 while the high r2 of pmlv2 makes the space less for the machine learning methods to increase r2 for dbf rs pm has been able to characterize dbf et well and the improvement of it by various machine learning methods is weak fig 7 previous research showed that bma decreased average rmse by more than 5 w m 2 for crop and grass sites and more than 6 w m 2 for forest shrub and savanna sites compared to semi pm ms pt pt jpl rrs pm and mod16 yao et al 2014 our research showed that the improvement in the forest was less than that for grassland and crops upscaling is another way to use machine learning methods to generate regional or global et which trains the relationship between the factors that affect et e g ndvi lai and rn and the observed ground et rather than the relationship between multiple et models and the observed ground et carter and liang 2019 fang et al 2020 jung et al 2010 li et al 2018 compared with integrating multiple ets this method does not need to calculate each et model so the calculation process is greatly reduced however compared with the single et model the upscaling method may not improve the et estimation accuracy for example the researchers compared three upscaling methods including artificial neural network regression tree and svm and three process based et models including mod16 pt jpl and rs pm at 23 ec flux tower sites in china the validation results showed that mod16 had a smaller bias than three upscaling methods at 15 ec flux sites that covered cropland forest and grassland and the three upscaling methods all had higher bias than three process based et models at 10 ec sites that covered grassland forest and cropland chen et al 2015 our study showed that six machine learning methods generally performed better than each et model fig 7 li et al 2018 used the upscaling method of mte to produce the china et mte et in fig 9 the validation result showed that compared with mte et the et integration with different machine learning methods generally improved the accuracy of et estimation at basin scale in this current study fig 9 and mte et was not superior to other single et models fig 9 fig 11 besides the upscaling method requires a lot of ground observation data which is unsatisfactory in many parts of the world 4 2 uncertainties in the five individual et models the evaluation at site scale shows that the five individual et algorithms have large uncertainties fig 3 at basin scale five single et models could explain 79 for mod16 88 for semi pm annual et variability and the rmse values were between 60 32 mm yr 1 for semi pm and 111 57 mm yr 1 for mod16 and mod16 and pmlv2 moderately overestimated annual et rpe 10 while rrs moderately underestimated annual et and rs pm and semi pm slightly underestimated annual et fig 11 compared to the existing global modis and pmlv2 et products the mod16 and pmlv2 calculated in this research performed better in the quantitative annual et in china with lower rmse and lower rpe fig 9 fig 11 which was related to the higher accuracy of input climate data that this research used while global modis and pmlv2 used global coarse climate data e g the 0 25 resolution and 3 hour gldas 2 1 meteorological forcing mu et al 2011 zhang et al 2019b the overestimation or underestimation at site scale of the five single et models and the overestimation or underestimation of annual et at basin scale are derived from the input data and the et algorithm structure because of the atmospheric effects remote sensing data such as ndvi and lai usually contain missing values which pose a challenge to data consecutiveness fang et al 2020 quality control and gap filling algorithms have been applied in this study nevertheless biases can remain long et al 2014 overestimates of lai may result in overestimates of et even if other input data are relatively accurate mu et al 2011 a research validated seven global lai products eps geov2 used in this study glass globmap modis proba v and viirs over typical agricultural croplands in northeastern china and found all lai products showed typical seasonal variation patterns of agricultural crops and geov2 and proba v significantly overestimated the lai for all crops the highly overestimate of pmlv2 in cro may be related with the overestimates of geov2 lai the errors in the modis igbp collection 6 directly affect the model parameters related to the lulc the biome properties look up table in the et estimation is usually developed based on the modis land cover product gan et al 2018 mu et al 2011 zhang et al 2010a although there are currently more accurate long term land use products covering china liu et al 2014 the corresponding biome properties look up table has not been constructed for the meteorological input data we conducted validation at 14 ec sites shown in fig 2 and found that the main errors in meteorological data occurred in rh rs wind rn and prec especially in wind and prec fig 12 the models affected by wind speed were pmlv2 and semi pm the overestimation of precipitation rpe 18 40 increased the soil evaporation coefficient in pmlv2 consequently overestimating et because rn was calculated with the inputs of ndvi tmean and rs mu et al 2011 and the error in tmean was small the error of rn was mainly from the algorithm structure ndvi and rs rn is the main energy driving term of et in the rs pm rrs pm pmlv2 and mod16 model so its error will directly cause overestimates or underestimates of et the overestimation of et by rrs pm was related to the overestimation of rn and the large overestimation of et by pmlv2 was related to the overestimation of rn and prec at site scale besides the weather observation data at 830 meteorological stations fig 2 are used to interpolate china s daily maximum and minimum temperature the unbalanced distribution of meteorological stations can cause uncertainty in northwest china and consequently affect the china et estimation 4 3 uncertainties in the gpr merged et although gpr performs well in quantifying 10 day average et at site scale fig 5 fig 6 and quantifying annual et at basin scale fig 9 there are still uncertainties that are from the training data selection of the single et algorithm and machine learning method the reasons for choosing these five process based et models semi pm rs pm rrs pm mod16 and pmlv2 for integration in this research are 1 strong operability 2 same or similar input data 3 consistent basic et estimation framework e g pm logic 4 applicable to different spatial temporal scales et estimation 5 they have been validated in the global or china region in this way the operability of et estimation is guaranteed and the uncertainty of input data is reduced section 4 1 has demonstrated that such a choice is reasonable and the uncertainty caused is low but will the results become better if we delete one or two models research integrated eight et algorithms including five empirical and three process based models with bma and found an ensemble with four models showed the best model performance at twenty three ec flux towers chen et al 2015 in this study fig 8 showed that after removing semi pm we used gpr to integrate the other four et process based models at site scale which had a weak impact on rmse 0 0005 mm day 1 r2 0 0002 and absolute rpe 0 39 indicating that semi pm could be removed at site scale removing the other four models greatly increased rmse or decreased r2 fig 8 but at the basin scale semi pm was more accurate than the other four et models in quantifying annual et across china with lower rmse higher r2 and lower absolute rpe fig 11 implying its importance in china et integration we removed semi pm and only used gpr to integrate the other four et process based et models to produce china annual et and compared the accuracy before and after the comparison result showed that the estimation accuracy of annual et dropped significantly and specifically r2 dropped by 0 042 rmse increased by 46 21 mm yr 1 and rpe increased by 14 06 therefore the five single et models are very important and removing one of them cannot produce better results insufficient et measurements in representative lulc types mean that fewer samples can be trained validated and tested by machine learning methods thereby affecting the generalization ability of the model and consequently cause et uncertainty measured et data for six lulc types ebf dbf gra cro wet and osb covering the forest shrub grassland cropland and wetland at 14 ec sites were used in this paper to train the machine learning methods most ec sites are located in the east only few ec sites are located in the vast northwest china where barren type accounting for 24 59 0 34 of areas in china during 2000 2018 is dominant the uneven distribution of ec sites makes machine learning methods not suitable for integration in barren areas which increases the uncertainty of et estimation in northwest china therefore more ground based observations of terrestrial et covering wider geographical regions longer periods and different lulc e g snow urban areas types should be collected li et al 2018 yao et al 2017 to update the integrating methods and improve et estimates in further studies in addition the et algorithms integrated in this study are almost based on the pm formula while other structured algorithms such as cr pt and sebs are not included these algorithms are also widely used to estimate et and result in reasonable results finally with the continuous increase of observational data in the future and the inclusion of more et algorithms data driven deep learning methods such as convolutional neural network can be used to integrate multiple et algorithms to obtain better et mapping 5 data

there are 36 maps each year the data in distinct geotiff file are named as gpr yy dd et tif where yy and dd denote year order the order is from 1 to 36 there are three issues per month assuming there are n days in a month the unit of the first 2 issues is mm 10 day and the unit of the third issue is mm n 20 day the scale factor is 0 01 6 conclusions in this study we improve et estimates for china during the period 2000 2018 by integrating the five process based et algorithms i e semi pm rs pm rrs pm mod16 and pmlv2 using the gpr algorithm our estimated et is the average for the day not for daytime or nighttime the gpr algorithm is trained with daily in situ measurements at 14 sites covering forest shrub wetland grassland and cropland different et algorithms driven by meteorological data of cmfd and satellite data including lai ndvi fpar and lulc are evaluated using ground based data and observed hydrological data from major river basins compared with svm ent rf grnn bma and the individual algorithms the gpr method has better performance at site and basin scale and can be effectively applied to estimate terrestrial et across china among the five process based et models pmlv2 plays the most important role in the et integration at site scale the gpr merged et captures well the spatial patterns of china terrestrial et the regional water balance analyses demonstrate that the

estimate terrestrial et simulation results may differ substantially owing to differences in the input data algorithms themselves and the calibrated coefficients as a consequence a single et algorithm cannot well characterize et for all ecosystem types chen et al 2015 yao et al 2017 2014 for example china et estimates using eight different algorithms revealed that many et algorithms had substantial differences in accuracy for different ecosystem types chen et al 2015 three individual et algorithms including the modis et products algorithm mu et al 2011 the priestley taylor et algorithm of jet propulsion laboratory fisher et al 2008 and the semi empirical penman et algorithm wang et al 2010b all showed a poor performance in simulating daily et at the crop sites yao et al 2017 the integration of multi et models through complex methods helps to reduce the uncertainty of et estimation and increase the accuracy of et estimation yao et al 2017 2014 the linear combination methods such as the simple average sa method bhattarai et al 2019 and bayesian model averaging bma method chen et al 2015 yao et al 2014 and nonlinear combination methods such as machine learning techniques yao et al 2017 have both been applied to merge the individual et algorithms at the regional and global scale for example the bma method enhances the daily le estimates at all 120 globally distributed eddy covariance tower sites that cover forest shrubland savanna grassland and cropland with lower rmse root mean square error and higher r2 coefficientofdetermination than the sa method and the five individual process based et algorithms yao et al 2014 sa based et yielded hourly et with lower rmse than all of the seven individual surface energy balance models at four cropland sites located in

random forest ensemble tree and gaussian process regression and the other process based et algorithm such as the penman monteith leuning version 2 leuning et al 2008 zhang et al 2019b has not been applied to integrate the individual et models to produce new et products which may have a better performance at different spatial and temporal scales the individual et models such as the complementary

were widely applied to estimate et at different spatial resolution and temporal resolutions across china due to china s complex land surface conditions such as various ecosystem types multiple climatic zones and complex terrain and the complexity of the et process there exist large uncertainties on both magnitudes and trends of china s et which indicates the importance to improve china s et estimates for example the mean annual et over china was estimated to be 552 14 mm yr 1 during 1982 2015 li et al 2018 whereas 406 15 mm yr 1 during 1982 2012 ma et al 2019 integrating multiple et algorithms with multiple machine learning methods provides one way to improve terrestrial et estimation improving et estimates is important both regionally and globally the science communities that can capitalize on improved information on et are broad and include 1 agronomy e g agricultural water resource management 2 ecology e g biodiversity assessments 3 hydrology e g regional water balance closures 4 atmospheric science 5 climate 6 carbon cycle 7 coastal science and 8 policy economics e g water rights litigation fisher et al 2017 therefore the objective of this study is to develop reliable terrestrial et estimates across china by integrating multiple et algorithms using multi machine learning methods 2 data and methods the framework of this study is as in fig 1 five process based et algorithms are forced by the climate data including the china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd and interpolated air temperature with meteorological station data and remote sensing data including leaf area index lai fraction of photosynthetically active radiation fpar the normalized vegetation index ndvi and land use land cover lulc the specific input items for each et algorithm are shown in fig 1 then we evaluate the five et algorithms using the observed et by eddy covariance ec flux tower sites and we use six machine learning methods to establish the relationship between the site observation 10 day average et and five process based et under the same training set validation set and test set according to the minimum rmse value on the test set we select a better model in each machine learning method to generate the china 10 day interval terrestrial et product chinaet1km10day with the inputs of five china 10 day interval process based et products take the water balance et as the true value we compare the china annual et products derived from six machine learning methods with the china annual et derived from eight high resolution et products at the basin scale 2 1 forcing data 2 1 1 meteorological data cmfd including daily precipitation rate pressure wind speed at 10 m height relative humidity and downward shortwave is from http www tpedatabase cn kun and jie 2018 this dataset is produced based on the princeton re analysis data gldas data gewex xrb radiation data trmm precipitation and meteorological station data from 830 meteorological stations within china resulting in a high resolution 0 1 meteorological forcing dataset over china he et al 2020 cmfd has been applied in previous china et estimates ma et al 2019 the commonly used bilinear interpolation method was used to resample cmfd to 1 km resolution because cmfd does not include maximum temperature and minimum temperature we used the thin plate spline function considering the elevation effect on temperature hijmans et al 2005 mcvicar et al 2007 to interpolate temperature mean minimum and maximum temperature across china at a resolution of 1 km day using the observations at 830 meteorological stations fig 2 the daily weather was averaged to obtain 10 day average weather there are three 10 day averages for each month assuming there are n days in a month the average weather for the first two 10 day periods was computed from 1st to 10th and from 11st to 20th day in the month respectively while the average weather for the third period was computed using the rest of the days in the month i e from 21st to nth days the above method is also used for the average computation of flux tower observation on et and ndvi 2 1 2 remote sensing data lai fpar and the ndvi can characterize vegetation structure and function which are closely related to et lulc is related to the parameters in the et estimate lai fpar ndvi and lulc were all acquired from the mature satellite products 10 day interval geov2 lai and fpar with 1 km spatial resolution were downloaded from the copernicus global land service cgls https land copernicus eu global lai and fpar were from the spot vegetation and proba v data baret et al 2013 since the lai and fpar data from modis has a large number of missing values in northwest china and this research aims at calculating the et of all land types in china the lai and fpar data from modis are not used ndvi was from the mod13a2 product that contains the 16 day interval ndvi with 1 km resolution lulc was from the mcd12q1 product that recorded the annual 500 m resolution lulc the lulc classification of igbp in the mcd12q1 was used in this study because igbp classification is adopted by process based et models for biome properties look up table mcd12q1 and mod13a2 were downloaded from the nasa laads daac https ladsweb modaps eosdis nasa gov to reduce cloud contamination the savitzky golay filter and quality control documents were applied in the original mod13a2 to produce high quality data mo et al 2017 yin et al 2020b linear interpolation was used to produce daily sequences in ndvi carter and liang 2018 the above four variables were resampled to the same projection and spatial resolution 2 2 validation data 2 2 1 eddy covariance data the machine learning methods and five traditional et algorithms were validated using ground measured flux data the data were collected at fourteen ec flux tower sites table 1 fig 2 and provided by the chinaflux http www cnern org cn zhang et al 2019a fluxnet2015 https fluxnet fluxdata org multi scale surface flux and meteorological elements observation dataset in the hai river basin https data tpdc ac cn zh hans liu et al 2013a the flux tower data are given every 30 min there are some missing values filled by 999 in the 30 minute flux tower observation data when the number n of the valid 30 minute measurements is higher than 40 per day the daily total et is as calculated as 1 e t i l e i 60 30 2 501 0 002361 t i 10 6 2 e t i 1 n e t i 48 n where l e i is the given 30 min latent heat flux w m 2 ti is the air temperature if n is less than 40 the daily et measurements are set as fill value mu et al 2011 besides since the ec method suffers an energy imbalance problem the measured et was corrected using the method proposed by twine et al 2000 finally the daily water flux was aggregated into 10 day average et data if there were seven valid et measurements non filled during the 10 days flux towers are mainly located in the eastern parts of china fig 2 the climate for the flux tower locations varies from humid to dry and from tropical to the temperate zone the flux tower sites cover six major lulc types deciduous broadleaf forest dbf 1 site evergreen broadleaf forest ebf 3 sites cropland cro 5 sites grassland gra 4 sites open shrubland osb 1 site and permanent wetland wet 1 site the flux tower data cover the period from 2003 to 2017 and each flux tower has at least 3 years of reliable data 2 2 2 runoff data and water balance et for water resource management 10 major river basins were defined by the ministry of water resources of china which include songhua liao hai yellow huai yangtze southeast pearl and southwest and northwest river basins fig 2 the drainage areas of these basins range from 20 82 104 to 333 9 104 km2 the national water resources bulletin officially released by the ministry of water resources in china records the annual runoff q over these basins http www mwr gov cn sj tjgb szygb since the data are based on the official ground q observation networks of the ministry of water resources of china they are reliable water resources statistics and have been used for evaluating various et products ma et al 2019 therefore we collected the q during the years 2003 2016 from national water resources bulletin the merged et estimation over the basin and regional scale was evaluated based on the water balance equation the et based on the water balance equation has been commonly used as the reference to validate modeled et at a multi year scale ma et al 2019 velpuri et al 2013 xu et al 2019 et can be calculated based on precipitation prec q and the water storage change wsc within a water closed basin 3 et prec q wsc of the four budget components prec and q are acquired from the cmfd national water resources bulletin respectively and wsc is calculated based on the grace data with spatial resolution of 1 which are released by three processing centers german research centre for geosciences center for space research at the university of texas austin and jet propulsion laboratory all based on the same earth s gravity field the arithmetic average of these three products was used to reduce the uncertainties due to the noise terms in the different solutions ma et al 2019 grace data is only complete during the years 2003 2016 therefore annual wsc during the years 2003 2016 is calculated as the difference between consecutive december terrestrial water storage anomaly ma et al 2019 and terrestrial water balance et can be inferred using eq 3 within the major china large basins fig 2 2 2 3 high resolution et products as there are numerous et products available covering the whole of china it is necessary to compare the quality of the merged et values with other currently available et datasets eight et products were selected based on two criteria i the spatial resolution must be at least 0 1 10 km and ii the products should be derived by current mainstream methods the spatial resolution of eight et products varies from 500 m to 0 1 while the temporal resolution from 8 days to one month more detailed information about the eight et products is listed in table 2 considering the different temporal coverage of the eight et products we selected the common temporal coverage of 2003 2015 for comparisons between the merged et and eight et products 2 3 methods 2 3 1 process

by semi pm the algorithms table 3 are briefly described below 2 3 1 1 semi empirical penman monteith et algorithm semi pm due to the lack of long term satellite and ground measurement data no satellite based et method was available to detect global et long term changes wang et al 2010a b to fill that gap wang et al 2010a developed a semi empirical et algorithm based on the penman and penman monteith equations monteith 1965 penman 1948 using 64 globally distributed flux tower sites the algorithm mainly considered the impacts of rs tmin tmax vapor pressure deficit rh ndvi and wind

et al 2008 mu et al 2007 showed that the penman monteith equation is a biophysically sound and robust method for estimating et at regional to global scales using remotely sensed data however the penman monteith et algorithm is limited by global lai availability and accuracy in the pre modis era i e before 2000 cleugh et al 2007 leuning et al 2008 mu et al 2007 which causes the lack of continuous long term i e from the early 1980s satellite based et records based on the above researches zhang et al 2010a developed a biome specific ndvi based canopy conductance model rs pm and used 34 fluxnet tower sites to parameterize and 48 additional independent flux towers to validate it zhang et al 2010a they successfully produce a continuous satellite derived global record of land surface

pm equation and constraint parameters of air temperature and vpd that differ for different vegetation types after sensitivity experiments yuan et al 2010 found it is possible to set constant model parameters for different vegetation types which helps to reduce the impact of misclassification of land cover types therefore yuan et al 2010 developed a revised remote sensing based pm et algorithm rrs pm by calibrating the three parameters including total aerodynamic resistance mean potential stomatal conductance and vpdclose when water stress causes stomata to close almost completely halting plant transpiration as constants and replacing the calculation method of energy distribution between soil and canopy at the global 54 eddy covariance flux tower sites rrs pm could explain 82 and 68 of the observed variations of et at all the calibration and validation sites respectively yuan et al 2010 the rrs pm performed better than the beta version of the mod16 algorithm at the 23 eddy

implementation methods as well as the experimental settings of the entire machine learning process 2 3 2 1 machine learning methods six machine learning methods including svm gaussian process regression gpr ensemble trees ent and random forests rf generalized regression neural network grnn and bma were chosen to integrate five single et models in this study among them rf ent and gpr have not been used to integrate et algorithms in previous research svm regression conducts linear regression by nonlinearly mapping the original low dimensional input space to higher dimensional feature space using kernel functions sain and stephan 1997 we used the function of fitrsvm in matlab 2018a with the kernel function of radial basis function to train the svm and we used the bayesian optimization to optimize the hyperparameters box constraint kernel scale and epsilon the number of iterations of the bayesian optimization for each machine learning method was at least 100 and the minimum rmse of the validation data set was used as the objective value to obtain the optimal hyperparameters the optimization process and hyperparameters are in the supplementary files figs s1 s2 more details about the svm could be found in the reference mathworks 2019 gpr models are nonparametric kernel based probabilistic models which can fit non linear data well and output the probability distribution of predicted values and obtain a good regularization effect without cross validation by marginal log likelihood rasmussen and williams 2006 squared exponential kernel one of the most commonly used covariance functions was selected as the kernel function of the gpr model in this research the specific formula is 23 k x i x j Œ∏ œÉ f 2 exp 1 2 m 1 n x im x jm 2 œÉ m 2 where œÉm represents the length scale for predicator m m 1 2 n and œÉf is the signal standard deviation œÉ is the unconstrained parametrization we used the function of fitrgp in matlab 2018a to train the gpr

hyperparameters are in figs s3 s5 ent averages multiple regression trees to perform regression the data used to train the regression tree is obtained by the bagging method in this research in the bagging method the sampling method of the subset is random sampling with replacement about 36 8 of the data in the training set called out of bag data is not collected by the sampling set which ensures a strong generalization ability of the model and there is no dependency between the regression trees the function of templatetree was used to build the regression tree and the function of fitrensemble was used to averages the regression trees in matlab 2018a we use the bayesian optimization to optimal the hyperparameters including the number of learning cycles and minimum leaf size the optimization process and the optimal hyperparameters are in figs s6 s8 further details about ent can be found in the reference breiman 1996 and mathworks 2019 rf integrates multiple weak learners to perform regression breiman 2001 cart decision trees were used as weak learners in the rf based on the use of decision trees rf has improved the establishment of decision trees for ordinary decision trees we will choose an optimal feature from all n sample features on the node to divide the left and right subtrees of the decision tree however rf randomly selects a part of the sample features on the node this number is less than n and is assumed to be nsub then among these randomly selected nsub sample features an optimal feature is selected to divide the left and right subtrees of the decision tree this further enhances the generalization ability of the model the sampling method of the subsample is the bagging method we used the matlab program corresponding to the r package randomforest to implement the rf the hyperparameters the number of trees grown and the number of predictors sampled for splitting at each node were optimizing by bayesian optimization in matlab 2018a the optimization process and the optimal hyperparameters are in figs s9 11 further details about rf can be found in the literature breiman 2001 grnn is a type of supervised forward propagation network

input layer the pattern layer the summation layer and the output layer the input layer includes the input variables et estimated from five single algorithms and the output layer provides the grnn method estimated et by merging the five algorithms the pattern layer has many radial basis neurons that are usually probability density function such as the gaussian the grnn equations as follow 24 y

2 2 machine learning experimental setup to merge five satellite based et algorithms we trained the six machine learning methods based on the 10 day average et measured by eddy covariance flux tower and the corresponding estimated et using the individual algorithms during the period of 2003 2017 we train and test the models as follows firstly for each eddy covariance flux tower site the measured et samples are separated into two parts training set ts 85 and testing set 15 by the way of random sampling without replacement then the training set is further divided into a validation set 15 of the whole data and a test set 70 of the whole data the training data validation data and testing data don t share any replicates the training data set is used to build the model and the validation data is used to validate the generalization error and adjust the hyperparameters for optimizing the model the test data is used to evaluate model performance six machine methods used the same training set validation set and test set random sampling in the ts is repeated fifteen times and get the fifteen test results of each machine learning method under the same test set in this way each machine learning method will produce fifteen sets of models for each machine learning method according to the accuracy of fifteen times on the same test set we choose the better accurate models to merge the five process based et algorithms to generate china 10 day interval terrestrial et product each machine learning method will produce a china et the reason for adopting the above mentioned machine learning steps is that 1 six machine learning methods are selected rather than one model 2 the amount of sample is sufficient 3 the machine learning method is relatively simple and involves a few hyperparameters 4 the contrast of the six machine learning methods is guaranteed because the six machine learning methods are in the same training set test set and training set cross validation cannot guarantee that the six machine learning models will adjust their parameters on the same validation set which makes it difficult to compare the quality of the six machine learning models 5 multiple random sampling ensures that all data participates in training validation and testing 2 3 3 model performance three indicators rmse r2 and relative percent error rpe are used to evaluate the agreement between the simulated et and the measured et at the site level and regional scale r2 represents how much the model can explain the variations in the observations rmse quantifies the difference between simulations and observations rpe quantifies the difference between the average of the observed and simulated values the formulas of rmse r2 and rpe are as following 26 r m s e 1 n i 1 n y i x i 2 27 r 2 1 i 1 n x i y i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 28 r p e x y y 100 where n is the sample number xi is the simulated et yi is the observed et x is the average value of simulated et and y is the average value of observed et to test the relative importance of each individual et algorithm to the merged et we remove one et algorithm among the five et algorithms and replicate the training process using the other four et algorithms in the final each machine learning method the rmse change crmse i r2 change cr i 2 and absolute rpe change carpe i caused by reducing one et model are used to represent the relative importance of each algorithm the formulas are 29 c r m s e i r m s e i r m s e f i v e 30 c r i 2 r f i v e 2 r i 2 31 c a r p e i r p e f i v e r p e i where i is the single process based et model e g semi pm rmsei ri 2 and rpei are the rmse r2 and absolute rpe values of the integrated four et algorithms after removing the i th et model in the test set respectively rmsefive rfive 2 and rpefive are the rmse r2 and absolute rpe value of the integrated five et algorithms in the test set respectively the larger the value of crmse i cr i 2 and carpe i the higher the relative importance of the i th et model in the integration we also use the difference method to quantify how each machine learning method improves a single et on different land types 3 results 3 1 comparisons of the five single process based et algorithms at each flux tower site the five process based et algorithms exhibit substantial differences in et estimates the 10 day averaged et observed at 14 ec flux tower sites are compared with estimates in different lulc fig 3 for the ebf pmlv2 rs pm and rrs pm highly overestimate the observed et with rpe of 48 69 43 11 and 16 54 respectively while semi pm highly underestimates the observed et with rpe of 22 09 fig 3 mod16 underestimates the observed et rpe 9 39 and has the lowest rmse 0 80 mm day 1 among the five et models but mod16 can only explain 60 11 of the observed et variability therefore it is poor to characterize 10 day averaged et using the five process based et algorithms for the ebf for the dbf all et models can explain 87 90 of the observed et variability pmlv2 highly overestimate the observed et rpe 46 06 while rs pm mod16 and semi pm highly underestimate the observed et with rpe of 26 75 20 86 and 16 64 respectively rrs pm has the lowest rmse 0 53 mm day 1 vs 0 72 mm day 1 in mod16 lowest absolute rpe 7 50 among the five et models therefore rrs pm has a good performance in simulating et for the dbf for the osb although pmlv2 rs pm and semi pm can explain 91 54 94 21 of the observed et variability the three et models overestimate or underestimate the observed et by more than 30 rrs pm highly underestimates the observed et with an rpe of 41 89 besides mod16 has a high rmse of 0 99 mm day 1 and a low r2 of 0 54 so among the five process based et models no model is superior to the other four models in characterizing et for the osb for the gra pmlv2 highly overestimates 30 41 of the observed et while rrs pm semi pm and mod16 highly underestimate it by 14 45 for mod16 63 29 for rrs pm rs pm overestimates 9 82 of the observed et the rmse values of the five single et models vary from 0 63 mm day 1 for rs pm to 1 23 mm day 1 for rrs pm rs pm can explain 75 15 of the observed et variability which is higher than semi pm 67 11 rrs pm 60 18 and mod16 24 62 therefore rs pm has a better agreement with the observed et than the other four et models for the gra for the cro pmlv2 highly overestimate 53 36 of the observed et while rrs pm and semi pm underestimate the observed et by 17 61 and 14 15 respectively the rpe values of rs pm and mod16 are very small the rmse values of the five single et models vary from 0 98 mm day 1 for rs pm to 1 55 mm day 1 for rrs pm the r2 of rs pm is only 0 57 which is higher than mod16 0 38 and rrs pm 0 56 lower than pmlv2 0 70 and semi pm 0 65 in summary it is poor to simulate et for the cro using the five process based et algorithms for all datasets the rmse values of the five process based et algorithms are higher than 0 90 mm day 1 0 90 mm day 1 for semi pm 1 30 mm day 1 for pmlv2 the r2 values vary from 0 56 for mod16 0 83 for pmlv2 pmlv2 and rs pm overestimate the observed et especially with rpe of 44 25 for pmlv2 the other three et models underestimate the observed et from 8 9 for rrs pm to 23 32 for semi pm 3 2 evaluation of the machine learning methods at the test set according to section 3 1 it is obvious that no single et algorithm can perform best for all the lulc types warranting the necessity of integrating the single et estimates by the machine learning methods in this section we introduce the test results of the six machine learning methods in merging the five single et models using the test set among the six machine learning methods the gpr generally performs best based on the test set with the lowest rmse highest r2 and lowest absolute rpe fig 4 while bma performs worse in the term of rmse the mean rmse of gpr is 0 469 mm day 1 followed by svm 0 474 mm day 1 grnn 0 486 mm day 1 rf 0 493 mm day 1 ent 0 498 mm day 1 and bma 0 578 mm day 1 the mean rmse differences between gpr and the other four models except bma are less than 0 028 mm day 1 in the term of r2 the mean r2 differences among the five machine learning methods except bma are within 0 014 gpr and svm have a slightly higher r2 than grnn rf and ent they can all explain well the observed et variability by 87 59 89 01 at the test set while bma can explain 83 29 et variability fig 4 the rpe values of the six machine learning methods are all close to 0 varying 0 16 for rf 0 97 for bma which indicates that six methods slightly underestimate the observed et the evaluation of the optimal model established by each machine learning method on the same test set is shown in fig 5 and fig 6 at all test sets svm gpr and grnn perform generally better than the other three machine learning methods with lower rmse 0 47 mm day 1 and higher r2 0 89 the rmse 0 487 mm day 1 and r2 0 881 values of rf and ent are very close but the absolute rpe value of rf is closer to 0 fig 5 bma performs the worst among the six machine learning methods with lower r2 0 833 higher rmse 0 577 mm day 1 and higher absolute rpe than the other five machine learning methods fig 5 the optimal model of each machine learning method performs well at the ebf dbf osb and gra under the same test set with low rmse high r2 and low absolute rpe especially at the osb and dbf fig 6 six machine learning methods all slightly overestimate the et at the ebf and slightly underestimate the et at the gra six machine learning methods highly overestimate the et at the wet with rpe varying 7 80 for svm 18 39 for bma at the cro six machine learning methods can explain 62 for bma 83 for grnn et variability which is lower than that in other lulc and the rmse values at cro vary 0 61 mm day 1 for grnn 0 91 mm day 1 for bma which is also higher than other lulc 3 3 comparison of the merged et with the single process based et under the same test set compared with the single process based et model the six machine learning methods generally improve the et estimation for six lulc types with decreased rmse increased r2 and decreased absolute rpe fig 7 the magnitude of the improvement depends on the single et model and machine learning methods the et improvement using bma is lower than that using the other five machine learning methods for example for dbf the improvement in accuracy of et estimation using bma is small compared with the rs pm model but large compared with pmlv2 gpr svm ent grnn and rf improve et estimation accuracy similarly compared to different single et models for each lulc type at all the test data using gpr the increased r2 is between 0 061 vs pmlv2 and 0 33 vs mod16 the reduced rmse is between 0 45 mm day 1 vs semi pm and 0 80 mm day 1 vs pmlv2 and the reduced absolute rpe is between 8 33 vs rs pm and 42 47 vs pmlv2 3 4 relative importance of each single process based et model for each machine learning method the rmse value increases most and the r2 value decreases most when the pmlv2 model is excluded in the integration among the five process based et models fig 8 excluding the pmlv2 model causes an increase in absolute rpe in svm rf and bma while causes a very slight decrease 0 2 in absolute rpe in the other three machine learning methods therefore the pmlv2 algorithm is more important than the other four process based et models in merging et excluding semi pm causes a slight decrease in rmse and an increase in r2 but it causes an increase in absolute rpe in svm ent and rf excluding rs pm causes a decrease of rmse and an increase of r2 in ent but an increase of rmse and a decrease of r2 in other machine learning methods although the magnitude of the changes is lower than that for rrs pm mod16 and pmlv2 3 5 comparison of the merged et with other et products at the basin scale we use water balance et as the true value to evaluate the annual et estimated by each model fig 9 in the term of r2 the differences between the various et models are relatively small except for mte modis and glass the r2 values of the other eleven et models vary from 0 85 for bma to 0 91 for ssebop r2 of the machine learning methods including gpr rf and svm reach 0 88 which indicates that the et products derived by the gpr rf and svm can well capture the spatial variability of et across china gpr et has the lowest rmse 57 18 mm yr 1 among the fourteen et models followed by rf et 57 40 mm yr 1 svm et 58 21 mm yr 1 ent et 62 97 mm yr 1 bess et 63 37 mm yr 1 and bma et 67 62 mm yr 1 rmses for the other models are higher than 70 mm yr 1 pmlv2 et and ssebop et have slightly higher r2 than gpr et 0 89 vs 0 88 0 91 vs 0 88 but have more than double rmse values than gpr et 56 80 mm yr 1 vs 141 06 mm yr 1 56 80 mm yr 1 vs 133 30 mm yr 1 as for rpe the glass et mte et and pmlv2 et highly overestimate annual et by 88 68 40 77 and 26 16 respectively the ssebop et and modis et overestimate annual et by 20 24 and 14 35 respectively the rpe of gpr et 0 26 and svm et 0 58 are very close to 0 the cr et bess et and sebs et slightly underestimate the annual et by 3 42 3 72 and 5 95 respectively in summary gpr et and svm et have better agreement with the water balance based annual et than the current eight high resolution et products and the other four machine learning methods compared to the widely used modis et gpr et and svm et improve annual et estimation across china 3 6 spatial distribution of the average annual et during 2000 2018 based on the et evaluation results at the site scale fig 4 fig 5 fig 6 and the basin scale fig 9 merging the five process based et models using the gpr method can better characterize china et than svm grnn ent and bma we apply the five process based et algorithms and the six machine learning methods to develop china terrestrial et datasets with a spatial and temporal resolution of 1 km and 10 days chinaet1km10days since there is no barren type in the training site the et of barren type is replaced by the et estimated by the pmlv2 algorithm the annual average of terrestrial et across china over 2000 2018 is shown in fig 10 despite the general differences in et spatial distribution among different models all of the models exhibit a notable decreasing gradient from the southeast to the northwest among these methods rs pm and mod16 overestimate the annual et of the tibetan plateau considering that the data inputs of different single et models are similar the reason for the overestimation may be the algorithm structure after integration through machine learning methods the above errors are reduced these models yield a high annual et over the evergreen broadleaf forest whereas a low annual et in arid and desert regions owing to precipitation limitation the average annual terrestrial et across china merged by gpr is 397 65 mm year 1 63 72 of average annual precipitation it is higher than that derived by the rrs pm algorithm 305 28 mm year 1 grnn 367 72 mm year 1 bma 386 90 mm year 1 ent 390 88 mm year 1 semi pm algorithm 391 88 mm year 1 and rs pm algorithm 395 16 mm year 1 but it is lower than that derived by svm 400 76 mm year 1 rf 404 07 mm year 1 the pmlv2 algorithm 465 23 mm year 1 and the mod16 algorithm 468 80 mm year 1 according to the average annual et derived by gpr method the evergreen broadleaf forest has the highest average et 719 62 mm year 1 followed by evergreen needleleaf forests 640 58 mm year 1 savannas 620 15 mm year 1 woody savannas 587 05 mm year 1 mixed forests 574 20 mm year 1 closed shrublands 573 68 mm year 1 deciduous broadleaf forest 527 41 mm year 1 cropland 499 54 mm year 1 deciduous needle leaf forests 410 46 mm year 1 and grassland 363 12 mm year 1 4 discussion 4 1 the performance of the gpr method by merging the five process based et algorithms the gpr method not only preserves the partial dynamic information of the et process but also simulates terrestrial et with high accuracy compared with the five individual et models and eight currently et products the gpr method successfully improves the et estimation accuracy at both site and basin scales fig 7 fig 11 fig 9 the performance of gpr is slightly higher than svm and moderately higher than grnn ent and rf and much higher than bma in a previous study the accuracy of svm merged global et is higher than that of grnn and the bma method yao et al 2017 our research also found that svm merged china et was better than grnn and bma fig 4 fig 9 glass et was produced by using bma to integrate five process based et models including mod16 rrs pm semi pm priestley taylor based et algorithm pt jpl fisher et al 2008 and modified satellite based priestley taylor et algorithm ms pt yao et al 2013 yao et al 2014 but it greatly overestimated annual et across china rpe 88 6 and had a very high rmse of 474 66 mm yr 1 fig 9 this current study replaced the ms pt and pt jpl with rs pm and pmlv2 among the process based et algorithms included and used the bma to integrate five et process based et algorithms to generate the china et the evaluation results showed that bma merged china et performed much better than the glass et in quantifying china annual et at basin scale with much lower rpe 3 92 vs 88 6 and much lower rmse 67 62 mm yr 1 vs 474 66 mm yr 1 fig 9 which was related with the different input data in integrating et individual et and training samples this also indicates the importance of single et selection for integration using the six machine learning methods the pmlv2 algorithm consistently has the highest importance among the five process based et algorithms at site scale in integrating et however the pmlv2 algorithm was not included in the previous et integrating studies chen et al 2015 yao et al 2017 2014 therefore reasonable choices of integrated et models and machine learning methods can further improve the et estimation accuracy in cro type five single et models all had a poor performance with low r2 and high rmse fig 3 which caused the poor performance of gpr and the other five machine learning methods in cro than that in other lulc types fig 9 a previous study also showed that almost all three individual algorithms including mod16 pt jpl and semi pm had poor performance at the cro sites and so did the three merged estimates by svm grnn and bma yao et al 2017 for different lulc types and single et models the et estimation accuracy improvement by machine learning methods is different fig 7 which mainly depends on the machine learning method type and the accuracy of each single et algorithm for instance in gra six machine learning methods all increased high r2 compared with mod16 but increased little r2 compared with pmlv2 fig 7 machine learning methods can achieve high r2 because one or more of the five single et algorithms have high r2 pmlv2 and rrs pm instead of all five et algorithms with low r2 similar to cro the low r2 of mod16 makes the space large for machine learning methods to increase r2 while the high r2 of pmlv2 makes the space less for the machine learning methods to increase r2 for dbf rs pm has been able to characterize dbf et well and the improvement of it by various machine learning methods is weak fig 7 previous research showed that bma decreased average rmse by more than 5 w m 2 for crop and grass sites and more than 6 w m 2 for forest shrub and savanna sites compared to semi pm ms pt pt jpl rrs pm and mod16 yao et al 2014 our research showed that the improvement in the forest was less than that for grassland and crops upscaling is another way to use machine learning methods to generate regional or global et which trains the relationship between the factors that affect et e g ndvi lai and rn and the observed ground et rather than the relationship between multiple et models and the observed ground et carter and liang 2019 fang et al 2020 jung et al 2010 li et al 2018 compared with integrating multiple ets this method does not need to calculate each et model so the calculation process is greatly reduced however compared with the single et model the upscaling method may not improve the et estimation accuracy for example the researchers compared three upscaling methods including artificial neural network regression tree and svm and three process based et models including mod16 pt jpl and rs pm at 23 ec flux tower sites in china the validation results showed that mod16 had a smaller bias than three upscaling methods at 15 ec flux sites that covered cropland forest and grassland and the three upscaling methods all had higher bias than three process based et models at 10 ec sites that covered grassland forest and cropland chen et al 2015 our study showed that six machine learning methods generally performed better than each et model fig 7 li et al 2018 used the upscaling method of mte to produce the china et mte et in fig 9 the validation result showed that compared with mte et the et integration with different machine learning methods generally improved the accuracy of et estimation at basin scale in this current study fig 9 and mte et was not superior to other single et models fig 9 fig 11 besides the upscaling method requires a lot of ground observation data which is unsatisfactory in many parts of the world 4 2 uncertainties in the five individual et models the evaluation at site scale shows that the five individual et algorithms have large uncertainties fig 3 at basin scale five single et models could explain 79 for mod16 88 for semi pm annual et variability and the rmse values were between 60 32 mm yr 1 for semi pm and 111 57 mm yr 1 for mod16 and mod16 and pmlv2 moderately overestimated annual et rpe 10 while rrs moderately underestimated annual et and rs pm and semi pm slightly underestimated annual et fig 11 compared to the existing global modis and pmlv2 et products the mod16 and pmlv2 calculated in this research performed better in the quantitative annual et in china with lower rmse and lower rpe fig 9 fig 11 which was related to the higher accuracy of input climate data that this research used while global modis and pmlv2 used global coarse climate data e g the 0 25 resolution and 3 hour gldas 2 1 meteorological forcing mu et al 2011 zhang et al 2019b the overestimation or underestimation at site scale of the five single et models and the overestimation or underestimation of annual et at basin scale are derived from the input data and the et algorithm structure because of the atmospheric effects remote sensing data such as ndvi and lai usually contain missing values which pose a challenge to data consecutiveness fang et al 2020 quality control and gap filling algorithms have been applied in this study nevertheless biases can remain long et al 2014 overestimates of lai may result in overestimates of et even if other input data are relatively accurate mu et al 2011 a research validated seven global lai products eps geov2 used in this study glass globmap modis proba v and viirs over typical agricultural croplands in northeastern china and found all lai products showed typical seasonal variation patterns of agricultural crops and geov2 and proba v significantly overestimated the lai for all crops the highly overestimate of pmlv2 in cro may be related with the overestimates of geov2 lai the errors in the modis igbp collection 6 directly affect the model parameters related to the lulc the biome properties look up table in the et estimation is usually developed based on the modis land cover product gan et al 2018 mu et al 2011 zhang et al 2010a although there are currently more accurate long term land use products covering china liu et al 2014 the corresponding biome properties look up table has not been constructed for the meteorological input data we conducted validation at 14 ec sites shown in fig 2 and found that the main errors in meteorological data occurred in rh rs wind rn and prec especially in wind and prec fig 12 the models affected by wind speed were pmlv2 and semi pm the overestimation of precipitation rpe 18 40 increased the soil evaporation coefficient in pmlv2 consequently overestimating et because rn was calculated with the inputs of ndvi tmean and rs mu et al 2011 and the error in tmean was small the error of rn was mainly from the algorithm structure ndvi and rs rn is the main energy driving term of et in the rs pm rrs pm pmlv2 and mod16 model so its error will directly cause overestimates or underestimates of et the overestimation of et by rrs pm was related to the overestimation of rn and the large overestimation of et by pmlv2 was related to the overestimation of rn and prec at site scale besides the weather observation data at 830 meteorological stations fig 2 are used to interpolate china s daily maximum and minimum temperature the unbalanced distribution of meteorological stations can cause uncertainty in northwest china and consequently affect the china et estimation 4 3 uncertainties in the gpr merged et although gpr performs well in quantifying 10 day average et at site scale fig 5 fig 6 and quantifying annual et at basin scale fig 9 there are still uncertainties that are from the training data selection of the single et algorithm and machine learning method the reasons for choosing these five process based et models semi pm rs pm rrs pm mod16 and pmlv2 for integration in this research are 1 strong operability 2 same or similar input data 3 consistent basic et estimation framework e g pm logic 4 applicable to different spatial temporal scales et estimation 5 they have been validated in the global or china region in this way the operability of et estimation is guaranteed and the uncertainty of input data is reduced section 4 1 has demonstrated that such a choice is reasonable and the uncertainty caused is low but will the results become better if we delete one or two models research integrated eight et algorithms including five empirical and three process based models with bma and found an ensemble with four models showed the best model performance at twenty three ec flux towers chen et al 2015 in this study fig 8 showed that after removing semi pm we used gpr to integrate the other four et process based models at site scale which had a weak impact on rmse 0 0005 mm day 1 r2 0 0002 and absolute rpe 0 39 indicating that semi pm could be removed at site scale removing the other four models greatly increased rmse or decreased r2 fig 8 but at the basin scale semi pm was more accurate than the other four et models in quantifying annual et across china with lower rmse higher r2 and lower absolute rpe fig 11 implying its importance in china et integration we removed semi pm and only used gpr to integrate the other four et process based et models to produce china annual et and compared the accuracy before and after the comparison result showed that the estimation accuracy of annual et dropped significantly and specifically r2 dropped by 0 042 rmse increased by 46 21 mm yr 1 and rpe increased by 14 06 therefore the five single et models are very important and removing one of them cannot produce better results insufficient et measurements in representative lulc types mean that fewer samples can be trained validated and tested by machine learning methods thereby affecting the generalization ability of the model and consequently cause et uncertainty measured et data for six lulc types ebf dbf gra cro wet and osb covering the forest shrub grassland cropland and wetland at 14 ec sites were used in this paper to train the machine learning methods most ec sites are located in the east only few ec sites are located in the vast northwest china where barren type accounting for 24 59 0 34 of areas in china during 2000 2018 is dominant the uneven distribution of ec sites makes machine learning methods not suitable for integration in barren areas which increases the uncertainty of et estimation in northwest china therefore more ground based observations of terrestrial et covering wider geographical regions longer periods and different lulc e g snow urban areas types should be collected li et al 2018 yao et al 2017 to update the integrating methods and improve et estimates in further studies in addition the et algorithms integrated in this study are almost based on the pm formula while other structured algorithms such as cr pt and sebs are not included these algorithms are also widely used to estimate et and result in reasonable results finally with the continuous increase of observational data in the future and the inclusion of more et algorithms data driven deep learning methods such as convolutional neural network can be used to integrate multiple et algorithms to obtain better et mapping 5 data availability currently the resultant chinaet1km10days dataset has become available at https doi org 10 6084 m9 figshare 12278684 v3 the chinaet1km10days dataset is produced based on the gpr method there are 36 maps each year the data in distinct geotiff file are named as gpr yy dd et tif where yy and dd denote year order the order is from 1 to 36 there are three issues per month assuming there are n days in a month the unit of the first 2 issues is mm 10 day and the unit of the third issue is mm n 20 day the scale factor is 0 01 6 conclusions in this study we improve et estimates for china during the period 2000 2018 by integrating the five process based et algorithms i e semi pm rs pm rrs pm mod16 and pmlv2 using the gpr algorithm our estimated et is the average for the day not for daytime or nighttime the gpr algorithm is trained with daily in situ measurements at 14 sites covering forest shrub wetland grassland and cropland different et algorithms driven by meteorological data of cmfd and satellite data including lai ndvi fpar and lulc are evaluated using ground based data and observed hydrological data from major river basins compared with svm ent rf grnn bma and the individual algorithms the gpr method has better performance at site and basin scale and can be effectively applied to estimate terrestrial et across china among the five process based et models pmlv2 plays the most important role in the et integration at site scale the gpr merged et captures well the spatial patterns of china terrestrial et the regional water balance analyses demonstrate that the gpr merged annual et is reliable and has higher accuracy than the current eight high resolution et products i e mte et cr et pmlv2 et modis et sebs et ssebop et bess et and glass et the annual average

4381,well testing in double porosity fractured aquifers or oil and gas reservoirs is one of the long lasting research problems in subsurface hydrology and petroleum engineering where the double porosity implies that the media of concern can be approximated as a two interrelated continuums fracture network and rock matrix with two distinctively different porosities however most of those studies in double porosity fractured aquifers only concern darcian flow in the fractured continuum in this study we will expand such studies from darcian flow regime to non darcian flow regime which is most likely to be the case for the field well testing site reported in this investigation new solutions based on power law and a linearization approximation are obtained for hydraulic heads in laplace domain and subsequently inverted to give spatiotemporal distributions in real time domain the non darcian flow model in single porosity media is obtained by setting the leakage coefficient c to 0 or the storage coefficient of the matrix sm to 0 where c is the rate of fluid transfer between the fracture and rock matrix parameter analysis is conducted using dimensionless formats a larger

1 introduction subsurface fluid flow either in single phase or multi phase in fractured media is an important and long lasting subject for geoscientists and petroleum engineers such as water resource management papadopoulou et al 2009 geothermal energy development cook 1992 kishida et al 2013 min et al 2009 petroleum exploration and production camac et al 2006 karpyn et al 2009 and underground tunnel excavation molinero et al 2002 ren et al 2015 in recent decades researchers have made significant efforts to understand this issue and realized that the fractured media of concern may have to be approximated using multiple interrelated continuums such as double porosity triple porosity double permeability triple permeability etc jenkins and prentice 1982 kohl et al 1997 quinn et al 2011 radilla et al 2013 laboratory experiments li et al 2017 li et al 2019 qian et al 2005 rong et al 2017 field tests quinn et al 2013 and numerical simulations smaoui et al 2012 wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2019 have been utilized extensively to investigate such an issue the double porosity model may be regarded as a subset of the double permeability model as it approximates the rock matrix permeability as almost negligible meaning that flow among different rock matrix is not permitted unless it is through the fracture similarly the triple porosity model may be regarded as the subset of triple permeability model as well as it regarded the permeability values in the low permeability media as zeros as well regardless of the complexity associated with flow in a fractured media darcy s law is the primary law used for describing flow in those continuums associated with the fracture media however it is confirmed that flow in fracture or coarse granular porous media sometime deviates noticeably from darcy s law at high velocities or more specifically high reynolds numbers of flow banerjee et al 2017 cherubini et al 2012 li et al 2019 qian et al 2015 qian et al 2007 zoorabadi et al 2015 this is primarily because the inertial effect that is neglected in darcy s law becomes increasingly prominent and non negligible when the flow velocities or reynolds numbers in those media become sufficiently high which is very likely to occur in the fractured network under certain circumstances on the other end in some much less permeable rock matrix as in dual permeability and triple permeability frameworks instead of double porosity and triple porosity frameworks in which direct flow communication between rock matrixes is prohibited unless it is through the fracture network darcy s law may also break down when a threshold hydraulic gradient is required to mobilize fluid flow there this is mainly caused by various driving forces in addition to the viscous force which is the primary driving force for darcian flow such as electric forces caused by surface charges forces associated with chemical potentials bolt and groenevelt 1969 neuzil 1986 etc flow starts to deviate from darcian flow regime when reynolds number starts to increase a non darcian flow law is needed when the reynolds number exceeds the critical reynolds number which is a representative reynolds number separating the darcian flow regime from the non darcian flow regime qian et al 2005 xia et al 2017 the critical reynolds number should be understood as a representative number or the average reynolds number within a transitional range in which the transition from darcian flow to non darcian flow happened smoothly in respect of the candidate equations for describing non darcian flow forchheimer law or second order polynomial function forchheimer 1901 and izbash law or power law izbash 1931 are two of the most popular ones sen 1987 tzelepis et al 2015 wu 2002 zhu and wen 2020 in the forchheimer law the hydraulic gradient is a second order polynomial function of flow rate or specific discharge and the linear term and the quadratic term describe the energy losses due to viscous and inertial dissipation mechanisms respectively cherubini et al 2013 javadi et al 2014 sen 1987 wu 2002 in the izbash law the hydraulic gradient is an empirical power law function of the flow rate chen et al 2015 soni et al 1978 for instance sen 1987 characterized the non darcian flow in a planar fracture by the forchheimer law cherubini et al 2013 carried out laboratory hydraulic tests in an artificially created fractured rock and confirmed the validity of forchheimer law soni et al 1978 applied the izbash law to the constant head permeameter tests in coarse grained porous media with satisfactory liu et al 2016 presented a fractal izbash law based analytical model for data interpretation of constant rate tests in a fractured crystalline aquifer and concluded that the power index could be understood as a phenomenological approximation of flow with some sorts of average in the region not so far away from the pumping well for some cases both forchheimer law and izbash law are equally acceptable to describe flow in a fractured media bordier and zimmer 2000 qian et al 2011 xia et al 2017 the izbash law has been criticized for not describing the far field the field far from the pumping or injection wells very well because flow in those regions is assumed to follow the darcy s law such a criticism has been reconciled in a number of studies before xiao et al 2019 furthermore from a practical point of view the data that are most important for pumping test interpretation are not collected from the far field in which the drawdown response is too weak much detailed discussion on the rationale of using the izbash equation for this study will be documented in section 2 3 based on the analysis of the pumping test data when a fractured medium is characterized as double porosity the primary porosity rock matrix continuum is usually characterized as of low almost negligible permeability and high storage capacity and the secondary porosity fracture network continuum is characterized as of high permeability and low storage capacity barenblatt et al 1960 moench 1984 warren and root 1963 fluid can transfer between these two continuums but no fluid exchange can happen between neighboring rock matrix blocks without involving fractures de smedt 2011 in the previous studies it was considered that the flows in the fracture continuum followed darcy s law de smedt 2011 hamm and bidaux 1996 kaczmaryk and delay 2007 kazemi and seth 1969 however it is noteworthy that the non darcian flow effect appears in the fracture continuum quite easily altinors and onder 2008 for example kohl et al 1997 used numerical simulation to investigate a fracture matrix flow system with non darcian fracture flow which can well explain the hydraulic production and injection experiments conducted at the soultz hot dry rock test site wu 2002 employed the forchheimer law to describe the non darcian flow through fractures in a double porosity framework and derived a steady state analytical solution for the spatial distribution of the hydraulic head altinors and onder 2008 expanded the forchheimer law in a fractured aquifer bounded by a stream zhang 2020 developed a anisotropic double porosity elastoplastic framework which considered both darcian flow and non darcian flow in fissured rock and zhang et al 2021 extended it to a double porosity media with ultra low matrix permeability overall there are more modeling studies concerning non darcian flow in a fractured media but very few field tests to confirm those modeling exercises to access the importance of non darcian flow effect in fractured media huangtun located in anhui province china is an area that has undergone multiple periods of tectonic activity and magma intrusion the jurassic andesite stratum is supposed to be low permeability in nature before it was reconstructed by tectonic activity whereas the initial stratum is intersected by faults to generate fractures resulting in the stratum functioning as a double porosity media as the fractures or fissures enhance the permeability of stratum rapid response to hydraulic stress recharge events pumping tests is common in a fracture network which is dominated by preferential flow through the low storage high permeability fracture in which non darcian flow is prone to occur because of the highly permeable nature of fractures worthington et al 2019 hence it is worthwhile to investigate how the non darcian flow regime in fracture affects the hydraulic responses in pumping tests conducted in a double porosity media however despite of its obvious importance field studies associated with non darcian flow in a double porosity media is very rare up to present the huangtun field site investigated in this study provides a much needed opportunity for such a purpose because of its double porosity nature to sum up the objective of this work is to present a comprehensive field well test conducted in a fractured aquifer to demonstrate the unique features of well testing in an actual fractured media that may be approximated as a double porosity media after this we will search for a proper mathematical model to interpret the data collected from the tests lastly we will introduce a particle swarm optimization pso algorithm to conduct a parameter estimation exercise based on the inverse modeling of the established forward mathematical model of flow 2 material and method 2 1 study area the field test site is situated 30 km northeast of lujiang county anhui province of china in the middle of yangtze river fig 1 a the study area is located in the upstream portion of the huangtun river alluvial plain the area has a typical subtropical humid monsoon climate and a mean annual temperature of 15 6 c according to the observation data of lujiang meteorological station the average annual precipitation is 1258 94 mm most of the annual precipitation falls during the rainy season from may to august while the average annual surface water evaporation is 1353 14 mm the field site has a three layer structure with quaternary on the top jurassic in the middle and triassic in the bottom the clay of poor permeability forms the quaternary formation which cut off the hydraulic connection of surface water huangtun river and subsurface groundwater the jurassic aquifer is considered as an aquiclude the jurassic stratum mainly consisting of andesite with a thickness of about 250 m fig 1b is the main aquifer in the study area the lithology of the triassic stratum is mainly quartz sandstone and this stratum is considered as aquiclude because of its poorly developed fracture according to field geological and geophysical survey there is a fault on the east and west sides of the study area the fault f1 on the west side is a reverse fault with a length of more than 1200 m and a dip angle of about 70 90 the fault f2 on the east side is a translational fault with a length of more than 1200 m and a dip angle of about 63 74 due to the influence of diagenesis and tectonic activities the jurassic volcanic rocks develop both small pores and fractures as confirmed by core samples excavated from this stratum fig 2 2 2 multi well pumping test a multi well pumping test has been designed to study the hydraulic characteristics of the jurassic aquifer of concern a pumping well w1 runs through the jurassic aquifer in the middle of the study area and four observation wells w2 w5 are scattered around it fig 1b the nearest observation well is w2 at 5 57 m from the pumping well and the farthest is w5 at 81 91 m from the pumping well w3 and w4 are away from pumping well for distance 54 84 m and 73 48 m respectively a deep mining dewatering well w1 continues pumping about 2 h to generate considerable drawdown near the pumping well in the jurassic aquifer fig 3 the pumping rate measured by a triangular weir is similar to a constant rate pump and the pumping rate is determined to be 417 m3 hr the groundwater levels in the observation wells are monitored by automatic water level monitor levelogger 3 0 0 05 solinst canada with an inspection frequency of 20 s the drawdown logarithmic time curves at observation wells are shown in fig 4 among all the observation wells it can be divided into two classes one is the observation well w2 which is the closest to the pumping well w1 with a radial distance of r 5 57 m with the largest drawdown and showing a s shape curve the rest is the other observation wells except w2 with relatively small drawdowns and showing monotonously increasing curves analyzing the drawdown of w2 over the entire pumping duration one can see that at the beginning of the pumping the water level in w2 drops rapidly at about 6 min of pumping the growth of drawdown slows down and the drawdown curve exhibits an inflection point the drawdown increases rapidly again after the inflection point the drawdown curve of w2 over the whole pumping time results in a s shape which is incongruent to the drawdown curve typically seen in homogeneous aquifers at the end of pumping the maximum drawdown is 2 89 m in w2 as the pumping time is limited to 2 h no obvious water level drops have been observed near faults f1 and f2 implying that the groundwater depression cone has not yet reached the faults in addition there are little changes of water level in quaternary borehole during the pumping time indicating that the jurassic aquifer can be considered as a confined aquifer owing to the weak connection with the upper water bearing layer the recovery time continues for 2 h to observe the water level change in the jurassic aquifer as fig 4 shows during the limited recovery period the water level in the four observation wells recovered from the maximum drawdown to the approximate drawdown about 0 8 m 2 3 mathematical formulation the background hydraulic gradient at the field site is quite gentle before pumping and the initial groundwater levels can be approximately treated as horizontal the jurassic aquifer contains well developed fractures and relatively intact rock matrixes which may be conceptualized as a double porosity media the s shaped drawdown type curve observed in w2 is also supportive of the double porosity media characteristics barenblatt et al 1960 moench 1984 warren and root 1963 during the pumping test the groundwater flow rate changes rapidly and a considerable cone of depression develops because of the massive rate of withdrawal because of such a large rate of pumping it is understandable that significant inertial energy losses may be generated in addition to the viscous energy losses creating the non darcian flow near the pumping well in the fractured network we have conducted numerous numerical exercises attempting to understand the drawdown type curves based on the single porosity darcian flow model or the theis model or the double porosity darcian flow model and is generally unsuccessful this forces us to look for either the single porosity non darcian flow model such as those of wen et al 2006 and mathias et al 2008 or the double porosity non darcian flow model the exercises of the single porosity non darcian flow model are also unsatisfactory which is understandable as the existence of fracture and rock matrix as two vastly different porosities is obvious therefore we move on to search for a proper double porosity non darcian flow model to understand the drawdown data among the two popular non darcian flow models forchheimer equation and izbash equation we find that the izbash equation appears to work better for the case of concern here the use of the izbash equation is further discussed as follows firstly the key feature of non darcian flow from a macroscopic perspective is its deviation from the linear trend of the hydraulic gradient versus the specific discharge and such a deviation has been described using many different functions by numerous scholars for many decades blick 1966 ergun 1952 forchheimer 1901 izbash 1931 macdonald et al 1979 among the vast number of functions proposed so far two types of functions are most frequently used one is the polynomial type functions particularly the second order polynomial function called the forchheimer equation li et al 2020a mathias and moutsopoulos 2016 mathias and todman 2010 quinn et al 2020 shi et al 2020 wang et al 2014 wen et al 2011 wen et al 2014 the second is the power law function called the izbash equation bordier and zimmer 2000 kang et al 2011 qian et al 2018 rong et al 2016 wen et al 2013 wen and wang 2013 some scholars have stated that the forchheimer equation is probably a better choice because it satisfies the two extremes of the non darcian flow i e when the specific discharge is sufficiently small it degenerates to darcian flow and when the specific discharge is sufficiently large it degenerates to the fully developed turbulent flow balhoff et al 2009 banerjee and pasupuleti 2019 sivanesapillai et al 2014 skjetne and auriault 1999 zhou et al 2015 however satisfying the two extreme conditions sufficiently small and sufficiently large specific discharges does not necessarily mean that the function is the optimal choice for the intermediate range of the specific discharge between the two extremes furthermore the effort of trying to connect the coefficients of forchheimer equation with the fundamental aquifer parameters such as porosity pore size distributions pore geometry heterogeneities etc is still far from successful indeed active research on this subject is still going on li et al 2020a li et al 2019 li et al 2020b mwetulundila and atangana 2020 therefore the use of those non darcian flow functions regardless of the forchheimer and izbash functions should be regarded as a phenomenological approximation based on the measured relationship between the hydraulic gradient and the specific discharge in another word trying to find an exact hydrogeological interpretation of such non darcian flow equation is still debatable and requires much more new research one should be aware that such functions may only be valid within a certain range of the hydraulic gradient or specific discharge secondly the izbash equation is a powerful analytical tool for analyzing the non darcian flow feng and wen 2016 li et al 2021 qian et al 2018 wen et al 2016 zhu and wen 2020 but it has also been criticized for not satisfying the two extremes as the forchheimer equation i e it does not automatically degenerate to darcy s law when the specific discharge is sufficiently small or degenerate to the fully turbulent flow when the specific discharge is sufficiently large however it is worthwhile to point out that use of the izbash equation is not focused on those two extremes instead it is more focused on the intermediate range of the specific discharge which may be better described with a power law function for some field circumstances this is exactly the case for the field site investigated in this study the reason for the izbash equation to work satisfactorily for this field site is not completely clear but we can speculate that it has something to do with the specific fracture networks at the field site of concern once again trying to make a direct hydrogeological interpretation of the parameters used in the power law function for a specific field site will be challenging and requires further research based on above discussion the izbash equation will be considered here to depict the non darcian flow in the fractured media to build a mathematical model in a double porosity framework for parameter estimation the aquifer is supposed to be horizontal confined with a thickness of b l and extends to infinity laterally the hydraulic properties are assumed to be homogeneous and horizontally isotropic in each continuum with both fractured system and matrix system fig 5 as the pumping well w1 is fully penetrating so vertical flow is not a concern in this study for the fractured continuum the governing equation of flow is 1 q r t r q r t r s f b s f r t t q Œ± where q r t is the specific discharge l t sf is the storage coefficient of the fracture s f r t represent the drawdown of the fracture l qŒ± is the fluid exchange between fracture and matrix l t b is the thickness of aquifer l t is time t r is the radial distance from the well l in a general double permeability framework the groundwater flow in rock matrix is darcian and can be governed by the following equation barenblatt et al 1960 de smedt 2011 warren and root 1963 2 k m 2 s m r t s m b s m r t t q Œ± where km is the hydraulic conductivity of the matrix l t s m r t represents the drawdown of the matrix l sm is the storage coefficient of the matrix it is important to notice that with the double porosity framework which is a subset of the double permeability framework the rock matrix permeability km is assumed to be extremely small and negligible thus the left hand side of eq 2 is essentially zero de smedt 2011 moench 1984 warren and root 1963 the fluid exchange qŒ± between fracture and matrix under the assumption of pseudo steady state flow is governed by the following equation de smedt 2011 3 q Œ± Œ± k m s f r t s m r t where Œ± is a shape factor with a dimension of inverse area l 2 and it is related to the geometry of the matrix elements and controls the flow exchange between the fracture and matrix the assumption of the left side of eq 2 to be zero yields the expression for qŒ± which is substituted into eqs 1 and 3 then one has 4 q r t r q r t r s f b s f r t t s m b s m r t t and 5 s m s m r t t c s f r t s m r t respectively where c Œ± k m b is the leakage coefficient between fractures and matrix t 1 initial drawdowns in the fractures and the matrix are zero everywhere 6 s f r 0 s m r 0 0 the outer boundary conditions far away from the pumping well are described as 7 s f t s m t 0 and for a well radius approaching zero one has 8 lim r 0 2 œÄ r b q r t q with q as the pumping rate l3 t which is positive for pumping and negative for injection applying the izbash equation to describe the non darcian flow wen et al 2008a one has 9 q r t n k q s f r t r in which kq and n are constants the value of n is between 1 and 2 and kq is termed the quasi hydraulic conductivity l t n when n equals to 1 eq 9 turns to darcy s law and k q becomes the hydraulic conductivity eq 9 can be rewritten as 10 q r t k q 1 n s f r t r 1 n substituting eq 10 into eq 4 will yield 11 2 s f r 2 n r s f r s f b n k q 1 n s

wang et al 2017 zhan et al 2009 the stehfest method is straightforward to use with sufficient accuracy particularly the stehfest method in this study has used a 16 term n 16 series approximation 2 4 dimensionless transformation dimensionless terms are adopted here for parameter analysis to eliminating the effect of unit system and to reduce the number of free parameters defining the dimensionless

results and discussion 3 1 analysis of parameters the drawdown response in the fracture to pumping can be approximately classified to three stages i e early intermediate and late time stages at the early time the fracture responses to the pumping immediately after the start of pumping but the matrix has not responded to pumping yet because the water exchange between the matrix and the fracture is rate limited and requires time during this stage the system functions as a single porosity fracture media at the late stage the matrix and the fracture have reached a hydrodynamic equilibrium thus the drawdown in the matrix is the same as the drawdown in the fracture at any given location and the water exchange between the matrix and the fracture also ceases because there is no hydraulic head difference between the matrix and the fracture to drive water flow between them during this stage the system also functions as a single porosity media but with an augmented porosity equaling the summation of porosities of the matrix and the fracture at the late stage the fracture acts as a conducting medium while the matrix is the main source of supply for pumping at the intermediate stage however the water exchange between the matrix and the fracture plays an important role in regulating the drawdown in the fracture and a greater water exchange rate i e a larger cd means a greater contribution of the matrix storage to the fracture thus will lead to a smaller drawdown in the fracture the parameter analysis of the drawdown behaviors will be specifically illustrated as follows the analysis of the dimensionless non darcian conductivity kqd which is an important parameter to describe the characteristic of the aquifer is shown in fig 6 a larger non darcian conductivity kqd represents a greater capability for the fracture to transmit water to the pumping well thus a quicker response to pumping will be observed in the fracture at the early state of pumping as evident in fig 6 at the late stage however a greater kqd means that a smaller hydraulic gradient is required to transmit the same amount of water to the pumping well thus the drawdown curve looks flatter and the drawdown is also smaller for a greater kqd the dimensionless parameter œï s m s f represents the distinction of water storage capacity of fracture and matrix which is analyzed in fig 7 a larger œï represents a larger storativity difference between the matrix and the fracture in another word a larger œï means a greater replenishment capacity from the rock matrix to the fracture thus will lead to a smaller drawdown in the fracture furthermore a larger œï also implies a greater volume of matrix storage thus will lead to a longer transitional period of water exchange between the matrix and the fracture when œï equals to zero which essentially reduces the double porosity media to the single porosity fracture media or the storage coefficient of matrix is inexistence the drawdown curves are simplified to those of non darcian flow in a single porosity system as expected the dimensionless leakage coefficient cd between the matrix and the fracture is a lumped parameter which is related to the conductivity of matrix and the characteristic of fluid exchange between matrix and fracture this parameter is responsible for water exchange rate between matrix to fracture thus can affect the overall behavior of drawdown characteristics as fig 8 shows the fracture drawdown curves are similar at the early and late stages for different values of cd in a non darcian double porosity system while the drawdown in the transitional period is distinctly affected by the value of cd and a greater cd means a smaller drawdown in the fracture at a given time these observations are understandable first at the early pumping stage the water exchange between the matrix and the fracture has not yet occurred as such an exchange process is rate limited and requires time thus the drawdown response in the fracture is not related to the value of cd at the late pumping stage the matrix and the fracture has reached a hydrodynamic equilibrium meaning that the drawdown in the matrix and the drawdown in the fracture has no difference from each other thus the water exchange between the matrix and the fracture will cease because such a water exchange term depends on the drawdown difference between the matrix and the fracture therefore the drawdown response at the late stage will not be related to the value of cd second during the intermediate pumping stage the water exchange between the matrix and the fracture will play an important role and a greater cd means a greater rate of supply of water from the matrix storage to the fracture thus will lead to a smaller drawdown in the fracture above observations will also occur when flow in the fracture continuum is strictly darcian occurrence of non darcian flow in the fracture continuum will modify the actual values of drawdown but generally will not change the overall pattern of the type curves 3 2 parameter inversion and discussion to put the above theory into application we will employ the solutions to interpret the pumping test described in section 2 for the purpose of comparison we will also use the liu solution single porosity with non darcian flow and the warren and root de smedt solution double porosity with darcian flow to interpret the same set of data and to compare the results of parameter estimated using such different interpretative theories it is notable that there is a minor difference between the model of warren and root 1963 and the model of de smedt 2011 the storage ratio œÉ in the warren and root model refers to the total storage of fracture and matrix combined with respect to the storage of fracture sf yet the de smedt solution is expressed as the storage of matrix sm with respect to the storage of fracture sf which is the same as the definition of storage ratio in this study considering the delayed response of the matrix to the pumping test here a particle swarm optimization pso algorithm has been introduced to a self written matlab source code to get the optimal hydrogeological parameters and the effectiveness of the pso algorithm has been proven in a number of recent studies such as chen et al 2020 the advantage of pso algorithm is that the particle has memory which can update itself by tracking the extreme value in each iteration and eventually find the optimal solution of multi parameter group quickly and efficiently in the case of different populations size np 40 80 and 120 the results of estimated aquifer parameters are very close to each other among which the result of a population size of np 40 is the most appropriate therefore np 40 is used in the pso algorithm in this study table 2 shows the hydraulic parameters obtained by matching the four theoretical type curves with observed drawdown data here the calculated hydraulic parameters are used to predict the recovery curve during recovery period and are plotted in the same picture with the drawdown in pumping time as shown in figs 9 to 12 several interesting observations can be made from these figures first it is clearly evident that the curves of the non darcian double porosity model of this study provide better fit with the pumping and recovery data than the other three reference solutions of liu et al 2016 warren and root 1963 and de smedt 2011 we need to point out that a better fit between a model and field data should not be used as the only criterion of warranting a model s superiority as a model involving more fitting parameters usually will do a better job in curve fitting but such best fitting exercises can provide some insurance of a model s suitability and further evidence is required to validate a model s applicability second the single porosity model of liu et al 2016 is clearly incapable of reproduce the pumping and recovery data showing that double porosity nature of the heterogeneous media must be considered the darcian flow double porosity models of warren and root 1963 and de smedt 2011 provide better fitting than the single porosity model of liu et al 2016 but they appear to overestimate the drawdown during the intermediate time of pumping and significantly underestimate the residual drawdown during most time of the recovery stage furthermore the fitting of the double porosity models of warren and root 1963 and de smedt 2011 during the recovery period is very poor suggesting that some additional mechanisms of flow are probably missing in those models to explain the field data third our model of this study provides substantial improvement in terms of fitting than the other three models but in general the fitting during the recovery period is worser than the fitting during the pumping period specifically we notice that our model appears to mildly overestimate the residual drawdown during the recovery period for well w4 although the fittings for the other three wells w2 w3 and w5 are better during the recovery period some of above observations may be understood from a hydrodynamic standpoint for instance let us compare the hydrodynamic characteristics of this model non darcian double porosity flow and those of warren and root 1963 and de smedt 2011 darcian double porosity flow during the intermediate pumping stage comparing with the darcian flow model which only considers viscous flow the non darcian flow model considers the inertial flow effect in addition to the viscous flow component therefore when the pumping starts and the cone of depression begins to expand rapidly from the pumping well the inertial effect in the fracture continuum in the non darcian double porosity model means additional resistance to flow or greater energy loss or greater hydraulic head loss to flow during this early stage of pumping as compared to the darcian double porosity models such a greater hydraulic head loss in the fracture continuum during the early stage of pumping will create a greater hydraulic head difference between the fracture continuum and matrix continuum which will lead to a greater water flow rate from the matrix continuum to the fracture continuum at the intermediate stage of pumping because of the greater contribution of water flux from the matrix continuum to the fracture continuum during the intermediate stage the fracture continuum will experience less drawdown for the recovery period different hydrodynamic characteristics of the non darcian double porosity model and the darcian double porosity model may also explain the observations made above from figs 9 12 for instance at the moment of recovery or the end of pumping the cone of depression has already expanded to its maximum with a large influenced volume of fractured media surrounding the pumping well at this moment the inertial effect of the non darcian double porosity flow model can be significant when pumping stops or recovery starts the hydraulic head starts to rise however because of the inertial effect of the non darcian flow it is more difficult to recover the drawdown in the non darcian double porosity model as compared to the darcian double porosity model which does not include the inertial effect in another word the residual drawdown in the non darcian double porosity model is higher than that in the darcian double porosity model which is clearly visible in figs 9 12 in fact the significant improvement of this model as compared to the darcian double porosity models of warren and root 1963 and de smedt 2011 leads us to believe that one must consider the non darcian nature of flow in the media the minor discrepancy of this model and the field test data during the recovery period may also suggest that even with the consideration of the non darcian flow the actual flow field is probably even more complex than the simplified two parameter izbash equation this is a subject we will continue to investigate in the future as is shown in table 2 the calculated quasi hydraulic conductivity kq for the fracture continuum range from 6 57 10 6 m s n to 1 18 10 5 m s n while the hydraulic conductivity values of the fracture continuum obtained from the other two double porosity models are 7 2 10 6 m s 3 98 10 5 m s for warren and root 1963 and 2 67 10 5 m s 5 51 10 5 m s for de smedt 2011 although it is not very meaningful to rigorously compare the quasi hydraulic conductivity of the non darcian flow with the hydraulic conductivity as they are not exactly the same parameter and have different units as well one can still see that the variational range of the quasi hydraulic conductivity of our model here which is 5 23 10 6 m s n is about one order of magnitude smaller than those of the hydraulic conductivity obtained from the darcian double porosity models which are 3 26 10 5 m s for warren and root 1963 and 3 84 10 5 m s for de smedt 2011 the narrower range of the fitted parameter in some degree suggests that including the non darcian flow into the double porosity model is a reasonable approach than the double porosity model excluding the non darcian flow the fitted storativity of the fracture medium sf ranges from 4 76 10 4 to 5 0 10 2 using the new model of this study this value is somewhat similar to the values obtained using the warren and root 1963 model 2 67 10 3 6 53 10 2 and the de smedt 2011 model 2 80 10 4 7 13 10 2 3 3 discussion although the non darcian double porosity model appears to work better than the non darcian single porosity model i e the liu s model and the darcian double porosity model i e the warren and root s model or de smedt s model for interpreting the pumping test results of this study some factors have not been taken into account and further investigations are probably needed in the future firstly some complexities that are likely associated with many pumping tests have not been included in this investigation for instance the wellbore storage wen et al 2006 zhu and wen 2020 skin effect chen et al 2020 and the effect of variation in pumping rate have not been considered the wellbore storage effect may be secondary as the radius of the pumping well used in this study is relatively small rw 0 115 m but the impact of skin effect is unknown due to lack of information secondly the izbash equation used in this study appears to be satisfactory but a comprehensive comparison study of the proposed model with other possible alternative models has not been reported here due to the limit of scope of this investigation this is based on a few considerations first of all the izbash equation despite of its empirical nature appears to work very well for interpreting the pumping test data here this equation works particularly well in the near field where the non darcian flow effect is most profound which happens to be the focus of this investigation wu 2002 has used forchheimer equation to obtain the steady state solution of non darcian flow in a double porosity framework but such a steady state solution cannot be used for interpreting transient pumping test data in the future it is necessary to work with the forchheimer type of non darcian flow in a double porosity framework under transient flow condition thirdly it should also be worthwhile to develop non darcian flow in a double permeability framework in the future if the matrix to matrix flow without through the fracture network becomes non negligible fourthly this research is based on the presumption that the fractured media can be conceptualized as two homogeneous continuums the fracture network continuum and rock matrix continuum such a presumption of course is idealized because it essentially assumes that the fracture network does not have any heterogeneity or preference of orientations the homogeneity presumption may be questionable as some realistic fracture networks could be heterogeneous and may have preferred orientations 4 conclusions an analytical solution is presented for describing radial flow in double porosity fractured aquifers by considering non darcian flow in fracture continuum the behavior of drawdown with time in the fractured continuum is characterized by five parameters n kq c sm and sf the special case of our solution when n equals to 1 is the same as the de smedt 2011 solution that assume darcian flow in the fracture continuum another special case of our solution for c or sm equaling to zero turns to wen 2008a solution for single porosity aquifers a dimensionless solution is derived for parameter sensitivity analysis a larger dimensionless non darcian conductivity kqd value means a larger drawdown in early pumping time while a smaller drawdown in late pumping time a larger cd or œï value promotes greater water exchange between fracture continuum and matrix continuum causing a more profound and longer transitional stage the darcian double porosity models of warren and root 1963 and de smedt 2011 overestimate the drawdown in the intermediate time during the pumping period while significantly underestimate the residual drawdown during the recovery period without considering the non darcian flow in fracture in addition the non darcian single porosity model of liu et al 2016 performs poorly to match the field data for both the pumping period and recovery period the proposed new model considering non darcian flow using an empirical power law based izbash equation in a double porosity framework has successfully explained the observed drawdown type curves and derivative drawdown type curves as well the new model has been successfully applied for estimating aquifer parameters such as hydraulic conductivity or quasi hydraulic conductivity and storage capacities using a particle swarm optimization pso algorithm the research is limited for not considering wellbore storage and skin effect and it relies on the promise that the media can be conceptualized as two interrelated homogenous continuums fracture network and rock matrix it also depends on the suitability of a power law based non darcian flow equation to derive the semi

4381,well testing in double porosity fractured aquifers or oil and gas reservoirs is one of the long lasting research problems in subsurface hydrology and petroleum engineering where the double porosity implies that the media of concern can be approximated as a two interrelated continuums fracture network and rock matrix with two distinctively different porosities however most of those studies in double porosity fractured aquifers only concern darcian flow in the fractured continuum in this study we will expand such studies from darcian flow regime to non darcian flow regime which is most likely to be the case for the field well testing site reported in this investigation new solutions based on power law and a linearization approximation are obtained for hydraulic heads in laplace domain and subsequently inverted to give spatiotemporal distributions in real time domain the non darcian flow model in single porosity media is obtained by setting the leakage coefficient c to 0 or the storage coefficient of the matrix sm to 0 where c is the rate of fluid transfer between the fracture and rock matrix parameter analysis is conducted using dimensionless formats a larger dimensionless quasi conductivity coefficient kqd a larger drawdown in the early stage and a smaller drawdown in the late stage the dimensionless parameters cd and œï influence the drawdown in transitional state and the values get larger the drawdown in transitional state drop smaller a pumping test conducted in huangtun anhui province of china has been applied to test the non darcian flow effect in a double porosity aquifer in which a particle swarm optimization pso algorithm will be applied here to seek the optimal hydraulic parameters as the result shows the observed drawdown data fit well with the new model in the pumping stage the predicted recovery drawdown curve with the calculated parameters of the new model also performs well with the field drawdown data which supports the applicability of the new model to interpret the field data keywords multi well pumping test double porosity medium non darcian flow izbash equation parameter inversion particle swarm optimization 1 introduction subsurface fluid flow either in single phase or multi phase in fractured media is an important and long lasting subject for geoscientists and petroleum engineers such as water resource management papadopoulou et al 2009 geothermal energy development cook 1992 kishida et al 2013 min et al 2009 petroleum exploration and production camac et al 2006 karpyn et al 2009 and underground tunnel excavation molinero et al 2002 ren et al 2015 in recent decades researchers have made significant efforts to understand this issue and realized that the fractured media of concern may have to be approximated using multiple interrelated continuums such as double porosity triple porosity double permeability triple permeability etc jenkins and prentice 1982 kohl et al 1997 quinn et al 2011 radilla et al 2013 laboratory experiments li et al 2017 li et al 2019 qian et al 2005 rong et al 2017 field tests quinn et al 2013 and numerical simulations smaoui et al 2012 wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2019 have been utilized extensively to investigate such an issue the double porosity model may be regarded as a subset of the double permeability model as it approximates the rock matrix permeability as almost negligible meaning that flow among different rock matrix is not permitted unless it is through the fracture similarly the triple porosity model may be regarded as the subset of triple permeability model as well as it regarded the permeability values in the low permeability media as zeros as well regardless of the complexity associated with flow in a fractured media darcy s law is the primary law used for describing flow in those continuums associated with the fracture media however it is confirmed that flow in fracture or coarse granular porous media sometime deviates noticeably from darcy s law at high velocities or more specifically high reynolds numbers of flow banerjee et al 2017 cherubini et al 2012 li et al 2019 qian et al 2015 qian et al 2007 zoorabadi et al 2015 this is primarily because the inertial effect that is neglected in darcy s law becomes increasingly prominent and non negligible when the flow velocities or reynolds numbers in those media become sufficiently high which is very likely to occur in the fractured network under certain circumstances on the other end in some much less permeable rock matrix as in dual permeability and triple permeability frameworks instead of double porosity and triple porosity frameworks in which direct flow communication between rock matrixes is prohibited unless it is through the fracture network darcy s law may also break down when a threshold hydraulic gradient is required to mobilize fluid flow there this is mainly caused by various driving forces in addition to the viscous force which is the primary driving force for darcian flow such as electric forces caused by surface charges forces associated with chemical potentials bolt and groenevelt 1969 neuzil 1986 etc flow starts to deviate from darcian flow regime when reynolds number starts to increase a non darcian flow law is needed when the reynolds number exceeds the critical reynolds number which is a representative reynolds number separating the darcian flow regime from the non darcian flow regime qian et al 2005 xia et al 2017 the critical reynolds number should be understood as a representative number or the average reynolds number within a transitional range in which the transition from darcian flow to non darcian flow happened smoothly in respect of the candidate equations for describing non darcian flow forchheimer law or second order polynomial function forchheimer 1901 and izbash law or power law izbash 1931 are two of the most popular ones sen 1987 tzelepis et al 2015 wu 2002 zhu and wen 2020 in the forchheimer law the hydraulic gradient is a second order polynomial function of flow rate or specific discharge and the linear term and the quadratic term describe the energy losses due to viscous and inertial dissipation mechanisms respectively cherubini et al 2013 javadi et al 2014 sen 1987 wu 2002 in the izbash law the hydraulic gradient is an empirical power law function of the flow rate chen et al 2015 soni et al 1978 for instance sen 1987 characterized the non darcian flow in a planar fracture by the forchheimer law cherubini et al 2013 carried out laboratory hydraulic tests in an artificially created fractured rock and confirmed the validity of forchheimer law soni et al 1978 applied the izbash law to the constant head permeameter tests in coarse grained porous media with satisfactory liu et al 2016 presented a fractal izbash law based analytical model for data interpretation of constant rate tests in a fractured crystalline aquifer and concluded that the power index could be understood as a phenomenological approximation of flow with some sorts of average in the region not so far away from the pumping well for some cases both forchheimer law and izbash law are equally acceptable to describe flow in a fractured media bordier and zimmer 2000 qian et al 2011 xia et al 2017 the izbash law has been criticized for not describing the far field the field far from the pumping or injection wells very well because flow in those regions is assumed to follow the darcy s law such a criticism has been reconciled in a number of studies before xiao et al 2019 furthermore from a practical point of view the data that are most important for pumping test interpretation are not collected from the far field in which the drawdown response is too weak much detailed discussion on the rationale of using the izbash equation for this study will be documented in section 2 3 based on the analysis of the pumping test data when a fractured medium is characterized as double porosity the primary porosity rock matrix continuum is usually characterized as of low almost negligible permeability and high storage capacity and the secondary porosity fracture network continuum is characterized as of high permeability and low storage capacity barenblatt et al 1960 moench 1984 warren and root 1963 fluid can transfer between these two continuums but no fluid exchange can happen between neighboring rock matrix blocks without involving fractures de smedt 2011 in the previous studies it was considered that the flows in the fracture continuum followed darcy s law de smedt 2011 hamm and bidaux 1996 kaczmaryk and delay 2007 kazemi and seth 1969 however it is noteworthy that the non darcian flow effect appears in the fracture continuum quite easily altinors and onder 2008 for example kohl et al 1997 used numerical simulation to investigate a fracture matrix flow system with non darcian fracture flow which can well explain the hydraulic production and injection experiments conducted at the soultz hot dry rock test site wu 2002 employed the forchheimer law to describe the non darcian flow through fractures in a double porosity framework and derived a steady state analytical solution for the spatial distribution of the hydraulic head altinors and onder 2008 expanded the forchheimer law in a fractured aquifer bounded by a stream zhang 2020 developed a anisotropic double porosity elastoplastic framework which considered both darcian flow and non darcian flow in fissured rock and zhang et al 2021 extended it to a double porosity media with ultra low matrix permeability overall there are more modeling studies concerning non darcian flow in a fractured media but very few field tests to confirm those modeling exercises to access the importance of non darcian flow effect in fractured media huangtun located in anhui province china is an area that has undergone multiple periods of tectonic activity and magma intrusion the jurassic andesite stratum is supposed to be low permeability in nature before it was reconstructed by tectonic activity whereas the initial stratum is intersected by faults to generate fractures resulting in the stratum functioning as a double porosity media as the fractures or fissures enhance the permeability of stratum rapid response to hydraulic stress recharge events pumping tests is common in a fracture network which is dominated by preferential flow through the low storage high permeability fracture in which non darcian flow is prone to occur because of the highly permeable nature of fractures worthington et al 2019 hence it is worthwhile to investigate how the non darcian flow regime in fracture affects the hydraulic responses in pumping tests conducted in a double porosity media however despite of its obvious importance field studies associated with non darcian flow in a double porosity media is very rare up to present the huangtun field site investigated in this study provides a much needed opportunity for such a purpose because of its double porosity nature to sum up the objective of this work is to present a comprehensive field well test conducted in a fractured aquifer to demonstrate the unique features of well testing in an actual fractured media that may be approximated as a double porosity media after this we will search for a proper mathematical model to interpret the data collected from the tests lastly we will introduce a particle swarm optimization pso algorithm to conduct a parameter estimation exercise based on the inverse modeling of the established forward mathematical model of flow 2 material and method 2 1 study area the field test site is situated 30 km northeast of lujiang county anhui province of china in the middle of yangtze river fig 1 a the study area is located in the upstream portion of the huangtun river alluvial plain the area has a typical subtropical humid monsoon climate and a mean annual temperature of 15 6 c according to the observation data of lujiang meteorological station the average annual precipitation is 1258 94 mm most of the annual precipitation falls during the rainy season from may to august while the average annual surface water evaporation is 1353 14 mm the field site has a three layer structure with quaternary on the top jurassic in the middle and triassic in the bottom the clay of poor permeability forms the quaternary formation which cut off the hydraulic connection of surface water huangtun river and subsurface groundwater the jurassic aquifer is considered as an aquiclude the jurassic stratum mainly consisting of andesite with a thickness of about 250 m fig 1b is the main aquifer in the study area the lithology of the triassic stratum is mainly quartz sandstone and this stratum is considered as aquiclude because of its poorly developed fracture according to field geological and geophysical survey there is a fault on the east and west sides of the study area the fault f1 on the west side is a reverse fault with a length of more than 1200 m and a dip angle of about 70 90 the fault f2 on the east side is a translational fault with a length of more than 1200 m and a dip angle of about 63 74 due to the influence of diagenesis and tectonic activities the jurassic volcanic rocks develop both small pores and fractures as confirmed by core samples excavated from this stratum fig 2 2 2 multi well pumping test a multi well pumping test has been designed to study the hydraulic characteristics of the jurassic aquifer of concern a pumping well w1 runs through the jurassic aquifer in the middle of the study area and four observation wells w2 w5 are scattered around it fig 1b the nearest observation well is w2 at 5 57 m from the pumping well and the farthest is w5 at 81 91 m from the pumping well w3 and w4 are away from pumping well for distance 54 84 m and 73 48 m respectively a deep mining dewatering well w1 continues pumping about 2 h to generate considerable drawdown near the pumping well in the jurassic aquifer fig 3 the pumping rate measured by a triangular weir is similar to a constant rate pump and the pumping rate is determined to be 417 m3 hr the groundwater levels in the observation wells are monitored by automatic water level monitor levelogger 3 0 0 05 solinst canada with an inspection frequency of 20 s the drawdown logarithmic time curves at observation wells are shown in fig 4 among all the observation wells it can be divided into two classes one is the observation well w2 which is the closest to the pumping well w1 with a radial distance of r 5 57 m with the largest drawdown and showing a s shape curve the rest is the other observation wells except w2 with relatively small drawdowns and showing monotonously increasing curves analyzing the drawdown of w2 over the entire pumping duration one can see that at the beginning of the pumping the water level in w2 drops rapidly at about 6 min of pumping the growth of drawdown slows down and the drawdown curve exhibits an inflection point the drawdown increases rapidly again after the inflection point the drawdown curve of w2 over the whole pumping time results in a s shape which is incongruent to the drawdown curve typically seen in homogeneous aquifers at the end of pumping the maximum drawdown is 2 89 m in w2 as the pumping time is limited to 2 h no obvious water level drops have been observed near faults f1 and f2 implying that the groundwater depression cone has not yet reached the faults in addition there are little changes of water level in quaternary borehole during the pumping time indicating that the jurassic aquifer can be considered as a confined aquifer owing to the weak connection with the upper water bearing layer the recovery time continues for 2 h to observe the water level change in the jurassic aquifer as fig 4 shows during the limited recovery period the water level in the four observation wells recovered from the maximum drawdown to the approximate drawdown about 0 8 m 2 3 mathematical formulation the background hydraulic gradient at the field site is quite gentle before pumping and the initial groundwater levels can be approximately treated as horizontal the jurassic aquifer contains well developed fractures and relatively intact rock matrixes which may be conceptualized as a double porosity media the s shaped drawdown type curve observed in w2 is also supportive of the double porosity media characteristics barenblatt et al 1960 moench 1984 warren and root 1963 during the pumping test the groundwater flow rate changes rapidly and a considerable cone of depression develops because of the massive rate of withdrawal because of such a large rate of pumping it is understandable that significant inertial energy losses may be generated in addition to the viscous energy losses creating the non darcian flow near the pumping well in the fractured network we have conducted numerous numerical exercises attempting to understand the drawdown type curves based on the single porosity darcian flow model or the theis model or the double porosity darcian flow model and is generally unsuccessful this forces us to look for either the single porosity non darcian flow model such as those of wen et al 2006 and mathias et al 2008 or the double porosity non darcian flow model the exercises of the single porosity non darcian flow model are also unsatisfactory which is understandable as the existence of fracture and rock matrix as two vastly different porosities is obvious therefore we move on to search for a proper double porosity non darcian flow model to understand the drawdown data among the two popular non darcian flow models forchheimer equation and izbash equation we find that the izbash equation appears to work better for the case of concern here the use of the izbash equation is further discussed as follows firstly the key feature of non darcian flow from a macroscopic perspective is its deviation from the linear trend of the hydraulic gradient versus the specific discharge and such a deviation has been described using many different functions by numerous scholars for many decades blick 1966 ergun 1952 forchheimer 1901 izbash 1931 macdonald et al 1979 among the vast number of functions proposed so far two types of functions are most frequently used one is the polynomial type functions particularly the second order polynomial function called the forchheimer equation li et al 2020a mathias and moutsopoulos 2016 mathias and todman 2010 quinn et al 2020 shi et al 2020 wang et al 2014 wen et al 2011 wen et al 2014 the second is the power law function called the izbash equation bordier and zimmer 2000 kang et al 2011 qian et al 2018 rong et al 2016 wen et al 2013 wen and wang 2013 some scholars have stated that the forchheimer equation is probably a better choice because it satisfies the two extremes of the non darcian flow i e when the specific discharge is sufficiently small it degenerates to darcian flow and when the specific discharge is sufficiently large it degenerates to the fully developed turbulent flow balhoff et al 2009 banerjee and pasupuleti 2019 sivanesapillai et al 2014 skjetne and auriault 1999 zhou et al 2015 however satisfying the two extreme conditions sufficiently small and sufficiently large specific discharges does not necessarily mean that the function is the optimal choice for the intermediate range of the specific discharge between the two extremes furthermore the effort of trying to connect the coefficients of forchheimer equation with the fundamental aquifer parameters such as porosity pore size distributions pore geometry heterogeneities etc is still far from successful indeed active research on this subject is still going on li et al 2020a li et al 2019 li et al 2020b mwetulundila and atangana 2020 therefore the use of those non darcian flow functions regardless of the forchheimer and izbash functions should be regarded as a phenomenological approximation based on the measured relationship between the hydraulic gradient and the specific discharge in another word trying to find an exact hydrogeological interpretation of such non darcian flow equation is still debatable and requires much more new research one should be aware that such functions may only be valid within a certain range of the hydraulic gradient or specific discharge secondly the izbash equation is a powerful analytical tool for analyzing the non darcian flow feng and wen 2016 li et al 2021 qian et al 2018 wen et al 2016 zhu and wen 2020 but it has also been criticized for not satisfying the two extremes as the forchheimer equation i e it does not automatically degenerate to darcy s law when the specific discharge is sufficiently small or degenerate to the fully turbulent flow when the specific discharge is sufficiently large however it is worthwhile to point out that use of the izbash equation is not focused on those two extremes instead it is more focused on the intermediate range of the specific discharge which may be better described with a power law function for some field circumstances this is exactly the case for the field site investigated in this study the reason for the izbash equation to work satisfactorily for this field site is not completely clear but we can speculate that it has something to do with the specific fracture networks at the field site of concern once again trying to make a direct hydrogeological interpretation of the parameters used in the power law function for a specific field site will be challenging and requires further research based on above discussion the izbash equation will be considered here to depict the non darcian flow in the fractured media to build a mathematical model in a double porosity framework for parameter estimation the aquifer is supposed to be horizontal confined with a thickness of b l and extends to infinity laterally the hydraulic properties are assumed to be homogeneous and horizontally isotropic in each continuum with both fractured system and matrix system fig 5 as the pumping well w1 is fully penetrating so vertical flow is not a concern in this study for the fractured continuum the governing equation of flow is 1 q r t r q r t r s f b s f r t t q Œ± where q r t is the specific discharge l t sf is the storage coefficient of the fracture s f r t represent the drawdown of the fracture l qŒ± is the fluid exchange between fracture and matrix l t b is the thickness of aquifer l t is time t r is the radial distance from the well l in a general double permeability framework the groundwater flow in rock matrix is darcian and can be governed by the following equation barenblatt et al 1960 de smedt 2011 warren and root 1963 2 k m 2 s m r t s m b s m r t t q Œ± where km is the hydraulic conductivity of the matrix l t s m r t represents the drawdown of the matrix l sm is the storage coefficient of the matrix it is important to notice that with the double porosity framework which is a subset of the double permeability framework the rock matrix permeability km is assumed to be extremely small and negligible thus the left hand side of eq 2 is essentially zero de smedt 2011 moench 1984 warren and root 1963 the fluid exchange qŒ± between fracture and matrix under the assumption of pseudo steady state flow is governed by the following equation de smedt 2011 3 q Œ± Œ± k m s f r t s m r t where Œ± is a shape factor with a dimension of inverse area l 2 and it is related to the geometry of the matrix elements and controls the flow exchange between the fracture and matrix the assumption of the left side of eq 2 to be zero yields the expression for qŒ± which is substituted into eqs 1 and 3 then one has 4 q r t r q r t r s f b s f r t t s m b s m r t t and 5 s m s m r t t c s f r t s m r t respectively where c Œ± k m b is the leakage coefficient between fractures and matrix t 1 initial drawdowns in the fractures and the matrix are zero everywhere 6 s f r 0 s m r 0 0 the outer boundary conditions far away from the pumping well are described as 7 s f t s m t 0 and for a well radius

results and discussion 3 1 analysis of parameters the drawdown response in the fracture to pumping can be approximately classified to three stages i e early intermediate and late time stages at the early time the fracture responses to the pumping immediately after the start of pumping but the matrix has not responded to pumping yet because the water exchange between the matrix and the fracture is rate limited and requires time during this stage the system functions as a single porosity fracture media at the late stage the matrix and the fracture have reached a hydrodynamic equilibrium thus the drawdown in the matrix is the same as the drawdown in the fracture at any given location and the water exchange between the matrix and the fracture also ceases because there is no hydraulic head difference between the matrix and the fracture to drive water flow between them during this stage the system also functions as a single porosity media but with an augmented porosity equaling the summation of porosities of the matrix and the fracture at the late stage the fracture acts as a conducting medium while the matrix is the main source of supply for pumping at the intermediate stage however the water exchange between the matrix and the fracture plays an important role in regulating the drawdown in the fracture and a greater water exchange rate i e a larger cd means a greater contribution of the matrix storage to the fracture thus will lead to a smaller drawdown in the fracture the parameter analysis of the drawdown behaviors will be specifically illustrated as follows the analysis of the dimensionless non darcian conductivity kqd which is an important parameter to describe the characteristic of the aquifer is shown in fig 6 a larger non darcian conductivity kqd represents a greater capability for the fracture to transmit water to the pumping well thus a quicker response to pumping will be observed in the fracture at the early state of pumping as evident in fig 6 at the late stage however a greater kqd means that a smaller hydraulic gradient is required to transmit the same amount of water to the pumping well thus the drawdown curve looks flatter and the drawdown is also smaller for a greater kqd the dimensionless parameter œï s m s f represents the distinction of water storage capacity of fracture and matrix which is analyzed in fig 7 a larger œï represents a larger storativity difference between the matrix and the fracture in another word a larger œï means a greater replenishment capacity from the rock matrix to the fracture thus will lead to a smaller drawdown in the fracture furthermore a larger œï also implies a greater volume of matrix storage thus will lead to a longer transitional period of water exchange between the matrix and the fracture when œï equals to zero which essentially reduces the double porosity media to the single porosity fracture media or the storage coefficient of matrix is inexistence the drawdown curves are simplified to those of non darcian flow in a single porosity system as expected the dimensionless leakage coefficient cd between the matrix and the fracture is a lumped parameter which is related to the conductivity of matrix and the characteristic of fluid exchange between matrix and fracture this parameter is responsible for water exchange rate between matrix to fracture thus can affect the overall behavior of drawdown characteristics as fig 8 shows the fracture drawdown curves are similar at the early and late stages for different values of cd in a non darcian double porosity system while the drawdown in the transitional period is distinctly affected by the value of cd and a greater cd means a smaller drawdown in the fracture at a given time these observations are understandable first at the early pumping stage the water exchange between the matrix and the fracture has not yet occurred as such an exchange process is rate limited and requires time thus the drawdown response in the fracture is not related to the value of cd at the late pumping stage the matrix and the fracture has reached a hydrodynamic equilibrium meaning that the drawdown in the matrix and the drawdown in the fracture has no difference from each other thus the water exchange between the matrix and the fracture will cease because such a water exchange term depends on the drawdown difference between the matrix and the fracture therefore the drawdown response at the late stage will not be related to the value of cd second during the intermediate pumping stage the water exchange between the matrix and the fracture will play an important role and a greater cd means a greater rate of supply of water from the matrix storage to the fracture thus will lead to a smaller drawdown in the fracture above observations will also occur when flow in the fracture continuum is strictly darcian occurrence of non darcian flow in the fracture continuum will modify the actual values of drawdown but generally will not change the overall pattern of the type curves 3 2 parameter inversion and discussion to put the above theory into application we will employ the solutions to interpret the pumping test described in section 2 for the purpose of comparison we will also use the liu solution single porosity with non darcian flow and the warren and root de smedt solution double porosity with darcian flow to interpret the same set of data and to compare the results of parameter estimated using such different interpretative theories it is notable that there is a minor difference between the model of warren and root 1963 and the model of de smedt 2011 the storage ratio œÉ in the warren and root model refers to the total storage of fracture and matrix combined with respect to the storage of fracture sf yet the de smedt solution is expressed as the storage of matrix sm with respect to the storage of fracture sf which is the same as the definition of storage ratio in this study considering the delayed response of the matrix to the pumping test here a particle swarm optimization pso algorithm has been introduced to a self written matlab source code to get the optimal hydrogeological parameters and the effectiveness of the pso algorithm has been proven in a number of recent studies such as chen et al 2020 the advantage of pso algorithm is that the particle has memory which can update itself by tracking the extreme value in each iteration and eventually find the optimal solution of multi parameter group quickly and efficiently in the case of different populations size np 40 80 and 120 the results of estimated aquifer parameters are very close to each other among which the result of a population size of np 40 is the most appropriate therefore np 40 is used in the pso algorithm in this study table 2 shows the hydraulic parameters obtained by matching the four theoretical type curves with observed drawdown data here the calculated hydraulic parameters are used to predict the recovery curve during recovery period and are plotted in the same picture with the drawdown in pumping time as shown in figs 9 to 12 several interesting observations can be made from these figures first it is clearly evident that the curves of the non darcian double porosity model of this study provide better fit with the pumping and recovery data than the other three reference solutions of liu et al 2016 warren and root 1963 and de smedt 2011 we need to point out that a better fit between a model and field data should not be used as the only criterion of warranting a model s superiority as a model involving more fitting parameters usually will do a better job in curve fitting but such best fitting exercises can provide some insurance of a model s suitability and further evidence is required to validate a model s applicability second the single porosity model of liu et al 2016 is clearly incapable of reproduce the pumping and recovery data showing that double porosity nature of the heterogeneous media must be considered the darcian flow double porosity models of warren and root 1963 and de smedt 2011 provide better fitting than the single porosity model of liu et al 2016 but they appear to overestimate the drawdown during the intermediate time of pumping and significantly underestimate the residual drawdown during most time of the recovery stage furthermore the fitting of the double porosity models of warren and root 1963 and de smedt 2011 during the recovery period is very poor suggesting that some additional mechanisms of flow are probably missing in those models to explain the field data third our model of this study provides substantial improvement in terms of fitting than the other three models but in general the fitting during the recovery period is worser than the fitting during the pumping period specifically we notice that our model appears to mildly overestimate the residual drawdown during the recovery period for well w4 although the fittings for the other three wells w2 w3 and w5 are better during the recovery period some of above observations may be understood from a hydrodynamic standpoint for instance let us compare the hydrodynamic characteristics of this model non darcian double porosity flow and those of warren and root 1963 and de smedt 2011 darcian double porosity flow during the intermediate pumping stage comparing with the darcian flow model which only considers viscous flow the non darcian flow model considers the inertial flow effect in addition to the viscous flow component therefore when the pumping starts and the cone of depression begins to expand rapidly from the pumping well the inertial effect in the fracture continuum in the non darcian double porosity model means additional resistance to flow or greater energy loss or greater hydraulic head loss to flow during this early stage of pumping as compared to the darcian double porosity models such a greater hydraulic head loss in the fracture continuum during the early stage of pumping will create a greater hydraulic head difference between the fracture continuum and matrix continuum which will lead to a greater water flow rate from the matrix continuum to the fracture continuum at the intermediate stage of pumping because of the greater contribution of water flux from the matrix continuum to the fracture continuum during the intermediate stage the fracture continuum will experience less drawdown for the recovery period different hydrodynamic characteristics of the non darcian double porosity model and the darcian double porosity model may also explain the observations made above from figs 9 12 for instance at the moment of recovery or the end of pumping the cone of depression has already expanded to its maximum with a large influenced volume of fractured media surrounding the pumping well at this moment the inertial effect of the non darcian double porosity flow model can be significant when pumping stops or recovery starts the hydraulic head starts to rise however because of the inertial effect of the non darcian flow it is more difficult to recover the drawdown in the non darcian double porosity model as compared to the darcian double porosity model which does not include the inertial effect in another word the residual drawdown in the non darcian double porosity model is higher than that in the darcian double porosity model which is clearly visible in figs 9 12 in fact the significant improvement of this model as compared to the darcian double porosity models of warren and root 1963 and de smedt 2011 leads us to believe that one must consider the non darcian nature of flow in the media the minor discrepancy of this model and the field test data during the recovery period may also suggest that even with the consideration of the non darcian flow the actual flow field is probably even more complex than the simplified two parameter izbash equation this is a subject we will continue to investigate in the future as is shown in table 2 the calculated quasi hydraulic conductivity kq for the fracture continuum range from 6 57 10 6 m s n to 1 18 10 5 m s n while the hydraulic conductivity values of the fracture continuum obtained from the other two double porosity models are 7 2 10 6 m s 3 98 10 5 m s for warren and root 1963 and 2 67 10 5 m s 5 51 10 5 m s for de smedt 2011 although it is not very meaningful to rigorously compare the quasi hydraulic conductivity of the non darcian flow with the hydraulic conductivity as they are not exactly the same parameter and have different units as well one can still see that the variational range of the quasi hydraulic conductivity of our model here which is 5 23 10 6 m s n is about one order of magnitude smaller than those of the hydraulic conductivity obtained from the darcian double porosity models which are 3 26 10 5 m s for warren and root 1963 and 3 84 10 5 m s for de smedt 2011 the narrower range of the fitted parameter in some degree suggests that including the non darcian flow into the double porosity model is a reasonable approach than the double porosity model excluding the non darcian flow the fitted storativity of the fracture medium sf ranges from 4 76 10 4 to 5 0 10 2 using the new model of this study this value is somewhat similar to the values obtained using the warren and root 1963 model 2 67 10 3 6 53 10 2 and the de smedt 2011 model 2 80 10 4 7 13 10 2 3 3 discussion although the non darcian double porosity model appears to work better than the non darcian single porosity model i e the liu s model and the darcian double porosity model i e the warren and root s model or de smedt s model for interpreting the pumping test results of this study some factors have not been taken into account and further investigations are probably needed in the future firstly some complexities that are likely associated with many pumping tests have not been included in this investigation for instance the wellbore storage wen et al 2006 zhu and wen 2020 skin effect chen et al 2020 and the effect of variation in pumping rate have not been considered the wellbore storage effect may be secondary as the radius of the pumping well used in this study is relatively small rw 0 115 m but the impact of skin effect is unknown due to lack of information secondly the izbash equation used in this study appears to be satisfactory but a comprehensive comparison study of the proposed model with other possible alternative models has not been reported here due to the limit of scope of this investigation this is based on a few considerations first of all the izbash equation despite of its empirical nature appears to work very well for interpreting the pumping test data here this equation works particularly well in the near field where the non darcian flow effect is most profound which happens to be the focus of this investigation wu 2002 has used forchheimer equation to obtain the steady state solution of non darcian flow in a double porosity framework but such a steady state solution cannot be used for interpreting transient pumping test data in the future it is necessary to work with the forchheimer type of non darcian flow in a double porosity framework under transient flow condition thirdly it should also be worthwhile to develop non darcian flow in a double permeability framework in the future if the matrix to matrix flow without through the fracture network becomes non negligible fourthly this research is based on the presumption that the fractured media can be conceptualized as two homogeneous continuums the fracture network continuum and rock matrix continuum such a presumption of course is idealized because it essentially assumes that the fracture network does not have any heterogeneity or preference of orientations the homogeneity presumption may be questionable as some realistic fracture networks could be heterogeneous and may have preferred orientations 4 conclusions an analytical solution is presented for describing radial flow in double porosity fractured aquifers by considering non darcian flow in fracture continuum the behavior of drawdown with time in the fractured continuum is characterized by five parameters n kq c sm and sf the special case of our solution when n equals to 1 is the same as the de smedt 2011 solution that assume darcian flow in the fracture continuum another special case of our solution for c or sm equaling to zero turns to wen 2008a solution for single porosity aquifers a dimensionless solution is derived for parameter sensitivity analysis a larger dimensionless non darcian conductivity kqd value means a larger drawdown in early pumping time while a smaller drawdown in late pumping time a larger cd or œï value promotes greater water exchange between fracture continuum and matrix continuum causing a more profound and longer transitional stage the darcian double porosity models of warren and root 1963 and de smedt 2011 overestimate the drawdown in the intermediate time during the pumping period while significantly underestimate the residual drawdown during the recovery period without considering the non darcian flow in fracture in addition the non darcian single porosity model of liu et al 2016 performs poorly to match the field data for both the pumping period and recovery period the proposed new model considering non darcian flow using an empirical power law based izbash equation in a double porosity framework has successfully explained the observed drawdown type curves and derivative drawdown type curves as well the new model has been successfully applied for estimating aquifer parameters such as hydraulic conductivity or quasi hydraulic conductivity and storage capacities using a particle swarm optimization pso algorithm the research is limited for not considering wellbore storage and skin effect and it relies on the promise that the media can be conceptualized as two interrelated homogenous continuums fracture network and rock matrix it also depends on the suitability of a power law based non darcian flow equation to derive the semi

4382,the soil sorptivity s and saturated hydraulic conductivity ks can be estimated from the inverse analysis of a cumulative infiltration curve using the quasi exact implicit qei formulation or its corresponding 4 terms 4t approximation although these models consider the soil as homogeneous media there is no information about how heterogeneous profiles can affect the inferred soil properties this work analyzes the influence of layered soils on ks and s estimates using qei and 4t models and designs a new procedure for treating infiltration curves measured on layered soil profiles the sequential infiltration analysis sia method considers a sequence of increasing time series from the cumulative infiltration data to estimate ks and s and its corresponding rmse as a function of the number of samples used a procedure to estimate the thickness of the upper uniform soil layer from the estimated wetting front advance wfa is also reported the sia method was applied on i synthetic homogeneous profiles of loam soil and six layered profiles involving a 1 2 and 3 cm thickness loam layer over silty or sandy loam soils respectively ii stratified laboratory soil columns and iii 20 experimental infiltrations performed in a semiarid region of north eastern spain similar results were found between qei and 4t models for all cases erroneous estimates of ks and s were observed when the total infiltration time series was considered for the analysis regardless of the presence of soil layering in opposite estimates improved when the sia method was applied to the layered systems the sia method exploits the fact that the rmse increases when the wetting front reaches the interface between the soil layers such increase allows i detection of the soil heterogeneity ii determination of the infiltration time to required for the wetting front to reach the lower layer and iii accurate estimates of the upper layer ks and s along with its thickness laboratory experiments on layered soils and field measurements demonstrated that the sia method could be satisfactorily applied on different curves with contrasting shapes and magnitudes although soil layering encountered on most field samplings restricted the treatment of the observed infiltrations to short medium times the sia method allowed robust estimates of ks and s these results indicate that the proposed method is a promising tool for characterizing the hydraulic properties of layered and heterogeneous soil profiles keywords sorptivity hydraulic conductivity infiltration heterogeneous soil profiles 1 introduction measurements of the soil surface hydraulic properties is crucial to solve many hydrological engineering and environmental issues linked to soil water storage and transport in the vadose zone the tension disc infiltrometer perroux and white 1988 has become a popular infiltration method because of the portable and its easy in situ applicability angulo jaramillo et al 2000 this instrument consists of a disc base attached to a water supply reservoir and a bubbling tower to impose a negative pressure head h at the disc base perroux and white 1988 the soil hydraulic properties sorptivity s and hydraulic conductivity ks are commonly calculated from the cumulative water infiltration curve measured with the disc infiltrometer to this end methods based on the transient state data analysis can be employed the main advantage of the transient methods compared to water steady state based procedures ankeny et al 1991 lassabatere et al 2006 is that they allow shorter experiments which involves smaller sampled soil volumes and hence a more homogeneous soil and initial water content profile angulo jaramillo et al 2000 among the different water transient models the quasi exact implicit qei analytical formulation of haverkamp et al 1994 has become one of the most popular methods to estimate the soil hydraulic properties e g fernandez galvez et al 2019 lassabatere et al 2009

et al 2013 its reduced temporal validity makes its use uncertain to solve this limitation latorre et al 2105 determined the soil hydraulic properties form the inverse analysis of the qei model instead of using approximations like in best methods lassabatere et al 2006 bagarello et al 2014 on their track fernandez galvez et al 2019 compute a new version of best that makes use of the qei formulation however such formulation is implicit and could lead to numerical indetermination while slowing down the inversion procedure given those difficulties moret fern√°ndez et al 2020 suggested estimating ks and s using the three terms 3t and four terms 4t approximations of the qei formulation these expansions are more accurate than the 2t since they incorporate more terms and thus remain valid over larger time intervals besides the 4t model presents four degrees of freedom and thus the potential to estimate the four input variables ks s Œ≥ and Œ≤ however moret fern√°ndez et al 2020 demonstrated that the inversion was affected by equifinality and non uniqueness due to the small contribution of the fourth term to the bulk infiltration consequently constant a Œ≥ r d Œ∏ s Œ∏ i and Œ≤ values are required in the inverse analysis of experimental infiltration curves measured with contact sand layer as a corollary because of Œ≥ and Œ≤ values are strongly linked unrealistic hydraulic properties values could be obtained most models developed for water infiltration consider isotropic and homogeneous porous media this means that soil hydraulic properties and initial water content are considered uniform in all directions however soil heterogeneity in the field is more the rule than the exception and this may strongly impact cumulative infiltrations iovino et al 2017 lassabatere et al 2010 2014 angulo jaramillo et al 2019 for instance double slope infiltration curves may be obtained in case of hydrophobicity lassabatere et al 2019 or infiltration curves with extra concavity may be obtained due to soil sealing and the concomitancy of several layers di prima et al 2018 in these cases the application of models based on soil uniformity can result in erroneous estimates of the soil hydraulic properties angulo jaramillo et al 2019 given the scarce information on the application of inverting methods developed for uniform soils to non uniform and layered soils the objective of this work is to study the influence of layered profiles on ks and s estimates obtained by fitting qei or its approximate expansions to infiltration data the second objective is the development of a procedure for an appropriate characterization of the soil hydraulic properties of the upper soil layer and to approximate its thickness to this end both the qei and 4t models were fitted to infiltration curves obtained experimentally or numerically in homogenous and layered soil profiles the procedure implements a sequential analysis of the infiltration data series by fitting the model to an increasing number of samples and reporting the evolution of the quality of the fit or the rmse the best fit characterized by the minimum rmse identifies the values of ks and s from the upper layer and provides the optimum infiltration time from which the thickness of the upper layer is also estimated the new method referred to as sia for sequential infiltration analysis was validated using numerically generated data laboratory experiments with homogeneous and layered soil profiles and also real field data 2 theory 2 1 cumulative infiltration curve equations the 3d cumulative infiltration i 3 d model qei for disc infiltrometer measurements corresponding to a zero water pressure head imposed at the soil surface i e saturated conditions can be described as follows haverkamp et al 1994 smettem et al 1994 1a i 3 d i 1 d a t 1b a Œ≥ s 2 r d Œ∏ s Œ∏ i where t is time t rd is the radius of the disc l s is the sorptivity l t 0 5 and Œ≥ is a proportionality constant that accounts for the correction of the wetting front shape smettem et al 1994 the a parameter as originally defined by lassabatere et al 2006 quantifies the capillarity driven lateral water flux lassabatere et al 2006 and i 1 d denotes the 1d cumulative infiltration curve that can be modeled using the qei formulation developed by haverkamp et al 1994 2 2 k s k i 2 s 2 t 2 1 Œ≤ k s k i i 1 d k

l3 l 3 respectively and Œ≤ is the integral shape parameter for regular working conditions Œ≤ varies between 0 6 and 1 7 lassabatere et al 2009 and Œ≥ between 0 6 and 0 8 haverkamp et al 1994 the cumulative 3d infiltration curve can be also approximated with power series in t1 2 fig 1 as proposed by haverkamp et al 1994 3 i 3 d t c 1 t 1 2 c 2 t c 3 t 3 2 c 4 t 2 c 5 t 5 2 where ci l t i 2 are coefficients that depend on the soil hydraulic properties and the initial conditions the application of taylor series to the 3d qei up to fourth order in powers of t1 2 results in the following 4t approximation moret fern√°ndez et al 2020 4 i 3 d 4 t t s t 1 2 2 Œ≤ 3 k s a s 2 t k s 2 9 s Œ≤ 2 Œ≤ 1 t 3 2 2 Œ≤ 2 Œ≤ 1 1 2 Œ≤ 135 k s 3 s 2 t 2 given that we have four unknown parameters s ks Œ≤ and a on one hand and that four coefficients c i i 1 4 are involved in the 4t approximate expansion on the other the inverse analysis can potentially determine the four unknowns however moret fern√°ndez et al 2020 demonstrated that the a and Œ≤ parameters need to be fixed a priori for the case of water infiltration curve measured with the addition of a contact sand layer such addition aims to improve the contact between the infiltration device and the soil given that inverting infiltration data for soil layered profile remains tricky in the following we defined a new method to analyze soil for layered profiles 2 2 sequential infiltration analysis sia and soil surface layer thickness estimate using both qei and 4t models the new procedure involves the analysis of a sequence of increasing time series from the cumulative infiltration data the sia procedure estimates s and ks by fitting qei or 4t to increasing time series and computes the rmse as a function of the number of samples the optimal infiltration time to is identified by the minimum rmse and its corresponding inversion provides the estimates of ks and s a total of 30 increasing times ranged from 50 s to the total available infiltration data were considered the inverse analysis with 4t eq 7 was performed using a nonlinear weighted least square method that incorporates the levenberg marquardt optimization algorithm the procedure was implemented into a function that returns a vector of weighted residuals whose sum square is minimized more 1978 bates and watts 1988 bates and chambers 1992 to this end the r r version 3 5 0 the r foundation for statistical computing software was employed for the qei model the global inverse analysis proposed by latorre et al 2015 was used in this case s and ks were estimated by minimizing an objective function that represents the difference between the implicit model eq 1 and the experimental cumulative infiltration data to this end a brute force search horst and romeijn 2002 was employed enumerating all possible candidates of the hydraulic parameters to a certain precision and selecting the best result in all cases Œ≥ and Œ≤ values were fixed at their recommended values 0 75 and 0 6 respectively the thickness of the soil surface layer was defined as the position of the wetting front advance wfa at time to the position of the wetting front was calculated as

the previously optimized ks s and Œ≤ 0 6 3 material and methods 3 1 validation of sia method with synthetic soils numerically generated data the infiltration curves were simulated with hydrus 3d model ≈°imunek et al 1999 the van genuchten 1980 model was selected for water retention curves and the mualem 1976 model for the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity defined for sandyloam loam and silt soils carsel and parrish 1988 table 1 the soil volume was discretized as a cylinder 25 cm in radius and 25 cm depth covering the axisymmetric plane with a 2d rectangular mesh of 100 900 cells a disc infiltrometer of 10 cm in radius was represented by a fixed water pressure boundary with a value of 0 cm a null pressure head was considered as bottom boundary the initial soil water content corresponded to its residual water content the synthetic data was computed for 2000 s which corresponds to a regular experimental infiltration in addition we checked that this time was enough for the wetting front did not reach the lower layer no contact sand layer was defined more details about the cumulative infiltration curves generation can be found in latorre et al 2015 the simulations fig 2 were performed on a homogeneous loam l soil and layered soil profiles consisting on a 1 2 and 3 cm thickness loam soil followed by a sandy loam l sl or silt l si synthetic soil respectively the Œ∏s and Œ∏i needed to estimate the soil hydraulic parameters are summarized in table 1 the application of the sia method leads to the results reported in table 2 and that will be discussed in the results section 3 2 laboratory experiments five laboratory infiltration experiments were conducted on different soil columns the first experiments consisted on three 15 cm depth and 30 cm diameter soil columns homogeneously packed with sand 80 Œºm mean size particle 2 mm sieved loam 28 47 25 and 1 2 of sand silt clay and organic carbon respectively and loam clay soils 20 50 30 and 2 0 of sand silt clay and organic carbon respectively the remaining experiments consisted on 30 cm diameter columns made with a 3 cm thickness upper layer of sand and loam soil followed by a 5 cm thickness clay loam layer fig 3 an infiltration curve was measured in each soil column using a 10 cm diameter perroux and white 1988 model tension disc infiltrometer all the infiltration experiments are considered to be 3d with no impact of the edges of the columns on the lateral expansion of the infiltration bulb all measurements were performed at soil saturation conditions at surface the water infiltration was monitored with 35 2 cm differential pressure transducer microswitch honeywell at 1 s of time interval infiltration measurements continued between 60 s and 1400 s the initial and saturated soil water contents of the upper layer were measured with the core method grossman and reinsch 2002 similarly as described in the previous section s ks and to were estimated with the sia procedure using both 4t and qei models a constant Œ≤ and Œ≥ equal to 0 6 and 0 75 together with the actual disc radius and the measured Œ¥ Œ∏ table 3 were employed the rmse and the wfas were calculated as described in the previous section negative ks obtained from the inverse analysis were omitted and fixed to 10 5 mm s 1 3 3 field measurements the infiltration measurements were performed on agro pastoral fields located in the municipality of mediana de arag√≥n m1 41 25 n 0 44 w in the zaragoza province of arag√≥n ne spain average annual temperature and precipitation are 14 9 c and 350 mm yr 1 respectively the lithology in the area is mainly gypsum outcrops soils are leptosols in the hills and gypsisols in the flat bottomed valleys navas 1991 these are poorly developed soils with a sandy loam to loam texture high gypsum between 680 and 940 g kg 1 and low organic matter between 9 and 48 g kg 1 contents navas 1991 field infiltrations were performed on bare r1 and soils with plants r2 in fields with low l and medium m grazing intensity a 50 mm in diameter and 50 mm in height undisturbed soil cores were sampled close to the infiltration points the Œ∏s was measured by saturating the soil core and subsequently drying it at 50 c during 48 h the initial volumetric water content Œ∏i was measured with a deltat water content probe one replication for Œ∏s and Œ∏i was performed per sampling site a 10 cm diameter disc infiltrometer was employed a thin layer 1 cm thick of commercial sand 80 160 Œºm grain size was placed between base disc and soil surface the duration of the experiments varied between 500 and 1800 s depending on the time needed to reach steady state infiltration conditions a total of 20 cumulative infiltration curves were recorded the influence of the contact sand layer tsand on ks and s estimates was removed using the procedure developed by latorre et al 2015 this consists of a layered flow model that assumes that water does not infiltrate into the soil until the sand layer is completely saturated the sand effect is considered as a gap in time and volume before water infiltrates into the soil the contact sand layer effect is removed by finding the sand infiltration time and its corresponding water volume and shifting the experimental data to the origin the maximum infiltration time due to the sand wetting layer was fixed to 10 s consequently for modeling with the sia method we no longer considered the sandy layer only the soil layering if any is expected to have an effect on the cumulative infiltration curves the sia method was then used as described for the synthetic soils analysis to provide s ks to rmse and wfa both 4t and qei models were considered for the application of the sia method on the field measurements 4 results and discussion 4 1 results for the synthetic soils numerically generated data except for the first infiltration times s and ks estimates for the homogeneous loam soil l using 4t were constant along the whole duration of the experiment fig 4 the initial divergences could be attributed to the large tension difference at the beginning of the experiment which changes from 10 3 to 107 cm and affects the numerical stability of the simulated cumulative infiltrations apart from this initial variation the estimates remain constant along the experiment this result indicates that under homogeneous soil conditions the considered infiltration time does not affect the predictions of the hydraulic parameters meanwhile a slight decrease of rmse was noticed with increasing time for the homogeneous synthetic loam column this is due to the fact that the difference between the synthetic and simulated curves is divided by the total number of data points in addition the rmse change with increasing analyzed time resulted in an indicator of the soil heterogeneity with no significant variations in the absence of soil layering the rmse represents the difference between the measured data and the theoretical curve which is consistent with the hypothesis of a homogeneous soil consequently the sudden increase of the rmse is expected in the presence of soil layering from the time when the infiltration bulb reaches the layers interface and both curves experimental and theoretical begin to differ in heterogeneous or layered soil profiles the rmse increased at the time to when the infiltration bulb reaches the lower soil layer fig 4b from time to s and ks started to deviate from their theoretical values fig 4c and d thus these results indicate that the sia method using 4t detects the soil heterogeneity and identifies the maximum time to to be considered for accurate estimations of s and ks of the upper soil layer in contrast erroneous hydraulic properties were reported when infiltration times larger than to are employed fig 4c and d for example this is the case of the l1cm si soil where long time analysis resulted in smaller ks values in this case the significant decrease of ks from to should be attributed to the extra concavity of the infiltration curve promoted by the less permeable deeper soil layer di prima et al 2018 which forces the model to reduce ks to the minimum threshold of 10 5 mm s 1 defined in the optimization for the l1cm sl synthetic soil erroneous ks estimates would be also obtained if for instance long time infiltration values were considered in this respect the extra convexity promoted by the more permeable deeper soil layer makes ks decreasing to the minimum threshold of 10 5 mm s 1 just after to to later stabilize ks at a value close that defined for sl table 1 these results indicate that ks evolution from to contains valuable information about the permeability of the deeper soil layer in conclusion these results indicate that the infiltration time is an important factor to estimate the soil hydraulic properties of heterogeneous soil profiles the sia method using the 4t model was an efficient tool to detect soil homogeneity and to estimate s and ks from the upper layer of heterogeneous soils overall good estimates of soil hydraulic properties were obtained when the sia method using either 4t or qei was applied to the homogeneous synthetic loam soil table 2 versus table 1 in this case the relative difference between theoretical and the optimized s and ks ks in log scale were 0 45 and 3 17 respectively similar results were reported by latorre et al 2015 and moret fern√°ndez et al 2020 except for the synthetic soil profiles with the thinnest top soil layer l1cm sl and l1cm si the s and ks estimates with qei and 4t also agreed with their theoretical values table 2 versus table 1 these results indicate that accurate estimations of s and ks require a minimum thickness of soil depth the similarity of the estimations using the qei and 4t expansion in heterogeneous profiles table 2 corroborates the 4t expansion was accurate enough for a proper estimation of the soil hydraulic properties this is an interesting result since the complexity of the latorre et al 2015 procedure may restrict its use when the sia method is applied on a large dataset of infiltration measurements this problem however vanishes using the 4t model for which the simpler equation allows fast and affordable analyses the numerical results also show that the prediction of the thickness of the upper soil layer is quite accurate indeed the calculated wetting front advance wfa were significantly correlated to the real values of the top layer thickness y 0 94x 0 36 r2 0 97 p 0 0001 table 2 these results indicate that the thickness of the upper soil layer can be estimated from the sequential analysis of the cumulative infiltration curve using both qei and 4t models 4 2 laboratory experiments the soil hydraulic properties estimated in the laboratory soil columns are summarized in table 3 as observed in synthetic homogenous soil fig 4a the decrease of rmse with time observed in the uniform loam soil is also present in the uniform laboratory loam fig 5 a the soil uniformity is also corroborated by the almost constant ks and s values estimated along the whole infiltration time the wfa calculated for the loam and clay loam soils table 3 were close to the 4 2 4 4 cm thickness of the wetted soil bulb measured in both soils at the end of the experiment a different behavior was observed in the stratified soil columns the minimum rmse found with the sia method indicated a change of soil layer at time to corresponding to the minimum rmse value fig 5b and c the smaller to observed in the sand clay loam s cl column fig 5c may be related to the significant higher ks and s of the sand table 3 which accelerated the infiltration that reaches the lower layer in less time however although the two columns presented an absolute minimum of the rmse the ks behavior after time to was different in the two experiments the large variability of ks around its optimal value observed in loam soil clay loam l cl column fig 5b indicates that the model cannot fit the experimental curve probably due to the extra concavity observed at large times the change of soil layer however was more evident in the s cl profile fig 5c where much contrasted ks and s values were obtained table 3 in this case the smaller ks and s of the clay loam soil generated an infiltration curve with a shift in its slope and shape and with a significant decrease in ks with time overall the similarity of ks and s estimates between the homogeneous loam and sand columns on one hand and the layered profiles on the other table 3 indicates that the method was robust and pointed at accurate estimates of the hydraulic properties in all the cases overall the thickness of the upper soil layer predicted from wfa values was close to their actual value table 3 as observed in the synthetic soils these results indicate the sia method allowed estimating the thickness of the upper soil layer the robust relationship between ks and s estimates obtained with qei and 4t models y 1 013x 0 022 r2 0 9091 p 0 0001 is in line with previous results and indicates that 4t model is accurate to estimate the soil hydraulic properties 4 3 field measurements overall the field soils presented a sandy loam texture high amount of gypsum 73 and low organic matter content 1 66 a great variability of types and shapes of infiltration curves was observed from field experiments fig 6 given the different types of cumulative infiltration curves described by angulo jaramillo et al 2019 four main types were analyzed i a regular fig 7 a ii extra concavity fig 7b iii double slope infiltration curve previously checked that it was affected by water repellency phenomena fig 7c and iv infiltration showing some irregularities at early times fig 7d in the first case m1m2r2 fig 7a a standard curve corresponding to a homogeneous soil where the rmse decreased along all the experiment 600 s with its corresponding estimates reported in table 4 other indicators corroborating the homogeneity of this soil were the stability of s and ks estimates and the almost constant time for the contact sand layer tsand these results suggest that the soil profile at the place of this infiltration curve was homogeneous the thickness of the corresponding soil layer was 4 3 cm table 4 in the second example m1l5r1 fig 7b although a preliminary visual analysis might suggest a behavior similar to the previous curve the sequential analysis evidenced the existence of a non uniform soil profile within the measured infiltration time the decreasing behavior of the infiltration rate which corresponds to a kind of extra concavity defined by angulo jaramillo et al 2019 was similar to that observed in the l1cm si synthetic soil fig 4b and also in the stratified laboratory soil columns fig 5b and c the minimum rmse was located around 170 s to time from which the rmse increased to the end of the infiltration other indicator of the existence of a layered profile was the decrease of ks and the large variation of tsand from to this large tsand variation is due to the model had to adapt the tsand value to find the best fitting for the heterogeneous profile on the other hand the decrease of ks over time would indicate that the profile presented a less permeable deeper layer di prima et al 2018 although less evident these changes were also manifested in s whose values kept almost constant until to 170 s before increasing in this case the thickness of the top soil layer was 1 4 cm table 4 thus the sequential analysis of the infiltration curve suggested the existence of a heterogeneous profile with a less permeable deeper layer a different behavior was depicted in fig 7c m1l3r1 where an inflection point was observed around 150 s this behavior was due to water repellence phenomenon moret fern√°ndez et al 2019 as previously experimentally checked with the water drop penetration time wdpt test watson and letey 1970 when water infiltrates into hydrophobic soils the water advance during the early phase of wetting is impeded owing to hydrophobic surface films on soil particles jarvis et al 2008 however once the hydrophobic layer is overcome to the infiltration rise promoted a significant increase of rmse and ks and a decrease of s an important increase of tsand was also observed just after the inflection point although water repellency and hence the inflection point can be visually detected angulo jaramillo et al 2019 the minimum rmse located with the sia procedure allowed a more objective determination of to and hence more accurate estimates of s and ks the average thickness of the top soil layer measured from wfa was around 1 2 cm table 4 in the last example m1m2r1 fig 7d a curve with an unclear behavior is presented in this case if determination of to is only based on the absolute rmse minimum a to around 210 s was obtained discontinuous vertical line however a more detailed analysis indicated that after the absolute rmse minimum there is another local minimum that coincides with more stable tsand s and ks values since the dispersion of all variables with time was relatively small in this case we would suggest omitting the initial times grey points in fig 5d and analyze the remaining infiltration section in this case to increased up to 680 s table 4 and the corresponding wfa was about 3 4 cm all these examples demonstrated that the sia method can be applied to real experimental data and should be considered when accurate estimates of hydraulic properties are required overall similar s ks to Œ± n and wfa values were obtained with both qei and 4t models table 4 the robust relationships between the hydraulic parameters estimated with both models table 5 indicates that hydraulic properties could be indistinctly estimated with qei or 4t models the small differences between both models could be explained by the different time increment employed to remove the effect of the contact sand layer latorre et al 2015 0 5 vs 0 1 s for qei and 4t respectively preliminary analyses of synthetic soils with sand layer using the same time increment 0 1 s confirmed not significant differences between qei and 4t only attributed to the different employed optimization algorithms the larger time interval used in qei is the result of a compromise between computation time and accuracy that is to say shorted time intervals would result in excessively long calculation times however the simpler and faster analysis of the 4t model allowed reducing this time interval which might result in better estimates of the hydraulic properties these results suggest that the 4t expansion is a robust alternative to estimate the soil hydraulic properties from the inverse analysis of a cumulative infiltration curve within a large range of infiltration times the s and ks estimated from the measured infiltration curves ranged between 0 07 and 0 60 mm s 0 5 and 1 8 10 3 to 3 72 10 2 mm s 1 respectively over the 20 experimental infiltrations only 3 measurements presented a to equal to the total measured infiltration time 600 s 25 of the analyzed curves presented to 400 s and 200 to 400 respectively and 50 a to 200 s these results would indicate that for the most cases the hydraulic properties were estimated from short to medium infiltration times for the 70 of the studied soils the estimated upper soil layer was thinner than 2 cm and only three soils presented a uniform upper layer wider than 4 cm these results suggest that overall the analyzed soils presented a thin upper layer which could probably correspond with the soil surface crust 5 conclusions this work presents a procedure to analyze the infiltration curves measured on layered soil profiles this new method referred as sia sequential infiltration analysis consists of analyzing infiltration curves at increasing time intervals and calculating the corresponding ks s and the rmse characterizing the quality of the fit to this end both qei and 4t models were employed a procedure to estimate the wetting front advance wfa or the thickness of the upper uniform soil layer from the infiltration analysis was also presented the procedure which was applied on synthetic layered profiles and experimental soils showed that erroneous estimates of ks and s were obtained when the inverse analysis was applied to the whole infiltration curve obtained for heterogeneous profiles this limitation however vanished using the sia procedure which allowed satisfactory estimates of to ks s and the corresponding wfa for very different types of infiltration curves however because the sia method sequentially analyzes the series of infiltrations results only correspond to the upper soil layer which can be considered homogeneous this hypothesis implies a limitation of the method when the thickness of the upper layer is very thin on the other hand since the results also show that some of the properties of the deepest soil layers are also contained in the infiltration curve it opens the possibility to advance in the method improvement to obtain additional information of the total soil profile from the analysis of the complete infiltration curve in most experimental soils only short to medium infiltration times could be analyzed and the thickness of the upper homogeneous soil layer ranged between 1 and 5 cm in conclusion these results showed that great care must be taken when calculating the soil hydraulic properties from the inversion of the measured infiltration curves questioning the possibility that anomalous curves cannot be analyzed accurately on the other hand although similar results were obtained with both qei and 4t models the simpler and faster analysis allowed by 4t suggests that this expansion can be a robust alternative to be implemented in the sia method for the estimation of the ks and s of the top layer

4382,the soil sorptivity s and saturated hydraulic conductivity ks can be estimated from the inverse analysis of a cumulative infiltration curve using the quasi exact implicit qei formulation or its corresponding 4 terms 4t approximation although these models consider the soil as homogeneous media there is no information about how heterogeneous profiles can affect the inferred soil properties this work analyzes the influence of layered soils on ks and s estimates using qei and 4t models and designs a new procedure for treating infiltration curves measured on layered soil profiles the sequential infiltration analysis sia method considers a sequence of increasing time series from the cumulative infiltration data to estimate ks and s and its corresponding rmse as a function of the number of samples used a procedure to estimate the thickness of the upper uniform soil layer from the estimated wetting front advance wfa is also reported the sia method was applied on i synthetic homogeneous profiles of loam soil and six layered profiles involving a 1 2 and 3 cm thickness loam layer over silty or sandy loam soils respectively ii stratified laboratory soil columns and iii 20 experimental infiltrations performed in a semiarid region of north eastern spain similar results were found between qei and 4t models for all cases erroneous estimates of ks and s were observed when the total infiltration time series was considered for the analysis regardless of the presence of soil layering in opposite estimates improved when the sia method was applied to the layered systems the sia method exploits the fact that the rmse increases when the wetting front reaches the interface between the soil layers such increase allows i detection of the soil heterogeneity ii determination of the infiltration time to required for the wetting front to reach the lower layer and iii accurate estimates of the upper layer ks and s along with its thickness laboratory experiments on layered soils and field measurements demonstrated that the sia method could be satisfactorily applied on different curves with contrasting shapes and magnitudes although soil layering encountered on most field samplings restricted the treatment of the observed infiltrations to short medium times the sia method allowed robust estimates of ks and s these results indicate that the proposed method is a promising tool for characterizing the hydraulic properties of layered and heterogeneous soil profiles keywords sorptivity hydraulic conductivity infiltration heterogeneous soil profiles 1 introduction measurements of the soil surface hydraulic properties is crucial to solve many hydrological engineering and environmental issues linked to soil water storage and transport in the vadose zone the tension disc infiltrometer perroux and white 1988 has become a popular infiltration method because of the portable and its easy in situ applicability angulo jaramillo et al 2000 this instrument consists of a disc base attached to a water supply reservoir and a bubbling tower to impose a negative pressure head h at the disc base perroux and white 1988 the soil hydraulic properties sorptivity s and hydraulic conductivity ks are commonly calculated from the cumulative water infiltration curve measured with the disc infiltrometer to this end methods based on the transient state data analysis can be employed the main advantage of the transient methods compared to water steady state based procedures ankeny et al 1991 lassabatere et al 2006 is that they allow shorter experiments which involves smaller sampled soil volumes and hence a more homogeneous soil and initial water content profile angulo jaramillo et al 2000 among the different water transient models the quasi exact implicit qei analytical formulation of haverkamp et al 1994 has become one of the most popular methods to estimate the soil hydraulic properties e g fernandez galvez et al 2019 lassabatere et al 2009 latorre et al 2015 the haverkamp et al 1994 model was extended to 3d disc infiltrometer measurements by smettem et al 1994 involving the following input parameters ks s the radius of the disc rd the Œ≤ and Œ≥ constants and the initial and final volumetric water contents Œ∏i and Œ∏s haverkamp et al 1994 smettem et al 1994 the Œ≤ shape parameter is related to the soil diffusivity d Œ∏ and the soil

convenient than complex implicit equations haverkamp et al 1994 proposed the simplified two terms 2t approximation for their quasi exact implicit qei formulation however such an approximation remains valid only for short to intermediate infiltration times although this simplified model has been largely employed for characterizing soils vandervaere et al 2000 lassabatere et al 2006 moret fern√°ndez et al 2013 its reduced temporal validity makes its use uncertain to solve this limitation latorre et al 2105 determined the soil hydraulic properties form the inverse analysis of the qei model instead of using approximations like in best methods lassabatere et al 2006 bagarello et al 2014 on their track fernandez galvez et al 2019 compute a new version of best that makes use of the qei formulation however such formulation is implicit and could lead to numerical indetermination while slowing down the inversion procedure given those difficulties moret fern√°ndez et al 2020 suggested estimating ks and s using the three terms 3t and four terms 4t approximations of the qei formulation these expansions are more accurate than the 2t since they incorporate more terms and thus remain valid over larger time intervals besides the 4t model presents four degrees of freedom and thus the potential to estimate the four input variables ks s Œ≥ and Œ≤ however moret fern√°ndez et al 2020 demonstrated that the inversion was affected by equifinality and non uniqueness due to the small contribution of the fourth term to the bulk infiltration consequently constant a Œ≥ r d Œ∏ s Œ∏ i and Œ≤ values are required in the inverse analysis of experimental infiltration curves measured with contact sand layer as a corollary because of Œ≥ and Œ≤ values are strongly linked unrealistic hydraulic properties values could be obtained most models developed for water infiltration consider isotropic and homogeneous porous media this means that soil hydraulic properties and initial water content are considered uniform in all directions however soil heterogeneity in the field is more the rule than the exception and this may strongly impact cumulative infiltrations iovino et al 2017 lassabatere et al 2010 2014 angulo jaramillo et al 2019 for instance double slope infiltration curves may be obtained in case of hydrophobicity lassabatere et al 2019 or infiltration curves with extra concavity may be obtained due to soil sealing and the concomitancy of several layers di prima et al 2018 in these cases the application of models based on soil uniformity can result in erroneous estimates of the soil hydraulic properties angulo jaramillo et al 2019 given the scarce information on the application of inverting methods developed for uniform soils to non uniform and layered soils the objective of this work is to study the influence of layered profiles on ks and s estimates obtained by fitting qei or its approximate expansions to infiltration data the second objective is the development of a procedure for an appropriate characterization of the soil hydraulic properties of the upper soil layer and to approximate its thickness to this end both the qei and 4t models were fitted to infiltration curves obtained experimentally or numerically in homogenous and layered soil profiles the procedure implements a sequential analysis of the infiltration data series by fitting the model to an increasing number of samples and reporting the evolution of the quality of the fit or the rmse the best fit characterized by the minimum rmse identifies the values of ks and s from the upper layer and provides the optimum infiltration time from which the thickness of the upper layer is also estimated the new method referred to as sia for sequential infiltration analysis was validated using numerically generated data laboratory experiments with homogeneous and layered soil profiles and also real field data 2 theory 2 1 cumulative infiltration curve equations the 3d cumulative infiltration i 3 d model qei for disc infiltrometer measurements corresponding to a zero water pressure head imposed at the soil surface i e saturated conditions can be described as follows haverkamp et al 1994 smettem et al 1994 1a i 3 d i 1 d a t 1b a Œ≥ s 2 r d Œ∏ s Œ∏ i where t is time t rd is the radius of the disc l s is the sorptivity l t 0 5 and Œ≥ is a proportionality constant that accounts for the correction of the wetting front shape smettem et al 1994 the a parameter as originally defined by lassabatere et al 2006 quantifies the capillarity driven lateral water flux lassabatere et al 2006 and i 1 d denotes the 1d cumulative infiltration curve that can be modeled using the qei formulation developed by haverkamp et al 1994 2 2 k s k i 2 s 2 t 2 1 Œ≤ k s k i i 1 d k

l3 l 3 respectively and Œ≤ is the integral shape parameter for regular working conditions Œ≤ varies between 0 6 and 1 7 lassabatere et al 2009 and Œ≥ between 0 6 and 0 8 haverkamp et al 1994 the cumulative 3d infiltration curve can be also approximated with power series in t1 2 fig 1 as proposed by haverkamp et al 1994 3 i 3 d t c 1 t 1 2 c 2 t c 3 t 3 2 c 4 t 2 c 5 t 5 2 where ci l t i 2 are coefficients that depend on the soil hydraulic properties and the initial conditions the application of taylor series to the 3d qei up to fourth order in powers of t1 2 results in the following 4t approximation moret fern√°ndez et al 2020 4 i 3 d 4 t t s t 1 2 2 Œ≤ 3 k s a s 2 t k s 2 9 s Œ≤ 2 Œ≤ 1 t 3 2 2 Œ≤ 2 Œ≤ 1 1 2 Œ≤ 135 k s 3 s 2 t 2 given that we have four unknown parameters s ks Œ≤ and a on one hand and that four coefficients c i i 1 4 are involved in the 4t approximate expansion on the other the inverse analysis can potentially determine the four unknowns however moret fern√°ndez et al 2020 demonstrated that the a and Œ≤ parameters need to be fixed a priori for the case of water infiltration curve measured with the addition of a contact sand layer such addition aims to improve the contact between the infiltration device and the soil given that inverting infiltration data for soil layered profile remains tricky in the following we defined a new method to analyze soil for layered profiles 2 2 sequential infiltration analysis sia and soil surface layer thickness estimate using both qei and 4t models the new procedure involves the analysis of a sequence of increasing time series from the cumulative infiltration data the sia procedure estimates s and ks by fitting qei or 4t to increasing time series and computes the rmse as a function of the number of samples the optimal infiltration time to is identified by the minimum rmse and its corresponding inversion provides the estimates of ks and s a total of 30 increasing times ranged from 50 s to the total available infiltration data were considered the inverse analysis with 4t eq 7 was performed using a nonlinear weighted least square method that incorporates the levenberg marquardt optimization algorithm the procedure was implemented into a function that returns a vector of weighted residuals whose sum square is minimized more 1978 bates and watts 1988 bates and chambers 1992 to this end the r r version 3 5 0 the r foundation for statistical computing software was employed for the qei model the global inverse analysis proposed by latorre et al 2015 was used in this case s and ks were estimated by minimizing an objective function that represents the difference between the implicit model eq 1 and the experimental cumulative infiltration data to this end a brute force search horst and romeijn 2002 was employed enumerating all possible candidates of the hydraulic parameters to a certain precision and selecting the best result in all cases Œ≥ and Œ≤ values were fixed at their recommended values 0 75 and 0 6 respectively the thickness of the soil surface layer was defined as the position of the wetting front advance wfa at time to the position of the wetting front was calculated as

the previously optimized ks s and Œ≤ 0 6 3 material and methods 3 1 validation of sia method with synthetic soils numerically generated data the infiltration curves were simulated with hydrus 3d model ≈°imunek et al 1999 the van genuchten 1980 model was selected for water retention curves and the mualem 1976 model for the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity defined for sandyloam loam and silt soils carsel and parrish 1988 table 1 the soil volume was discretized as a cylinder 25 cm in radius and 25 cm depth covering the axisymmetric plane with a 2d rectangular mesh of 100 900 cells a disc infiltrometer of 10 cm in radius was represented by a fixed water pressure boundary with a value of 0 cm a null pressure head was considered as bottom boundary the initial soil water content corresponded to its residual water content the synthetic data was computed for 2000 s which corresponds to a regular experimental infiltration in addition we checked that this time was enough for the wetting front did not reach the lower layer no contact sand layer was defined more details about the cumulative infiltration curves generation can be found in latorre et al 2015 the simulations fig 2 were performed on a homogeneous loam l soil and layered soil profiles consisting on a 1 2 and 3 cm thickness loam soil followed by a sandy loam l sl or silt l si synthetic soil respectively the Œ∏s and Œ∏i needed to estimate the soil hydraulic parameters are summarized in table 1 the application of the sia method leads to the results reported in table 2 and that will be discussed in the results section 3 2 laboratory experiments five laboratory infiltration experiments were conducted on different soil columns the first experiments consisted on three 15 cm depth and 30 cm diameter soil columns homogeneously packed with sand 80 Œºm mean size particle 2 mm sieved loam 28 47 25 and 1 2 of sand silt clay and organic carbon respectively and loam clay soils 20 50 30 and 2 0 of sand silt clay and organic carbon respectively the remaining experiments consisted on 30 cm diameter columns made with a 3 cm thickness upper layer of sand and loam soil followed by a 5 cm thickness clay loam layer fig 3 an infiltration curve was measured in each soil column using a 10 cm diameter perroux and white 1988 model tension disc infiltrometer all the infiltration experiments are considered to be 3d with no impact of the edges of the columns on the lateral expansion of the infiltration bulb all measurements were performed at soil saturation conditions at surface the water infiltration was monitored with 35 2 cm differential pressure transducer microswitch honeywell at 1 s of time interval infiltration measurements continued between 60 s and 1400 s the initial and saturated soil water contents of the upper layer were measured with the core method grossman and reinsch 2002 similarly as described in the previous section s ks and to were estimated with the sia procedure using both 4t and qei models a constant Œ≤ and Œ≥ equal to 0 6 and 0 75 together with the actual disc radius and the measured Œ¥ Œ∏ table 3 were employed the rmse and the wfas were calculated as described in the previous section negative ks obtained from the inverse analysis were omitted and fixed to 10 5 mm s 1 3 3 field measurements the infiltration measurements were performed on agro pastoral fields located in the municipality of mediana de arag√≥n m1 41 25 n 0 44 w in the zaragoza province of arag√≥n ne spain average annual temperature and precipitation are 14 9 c and 350 mm yr 1 respectively the lithology in the area is mainly gypsum outcrops soils are leptosols in the hills and gypsisols in the flat bottomed valleys navas 1991 these are poorly developed soils with a sandy loam to loam texture high gypsum between 680 and 940 g kg 1 and low organic matter between 9 and 48 g kg 1 contents navas 1991 field infiltrations were performed on bare r1 and soils with plants r2 in fields with low l and medium m grazing intensity a 50 mm in diameter and 50 mm in height undisturbed soil cores were sampled close to the infiltration points the Œ∏s was measured by saturating the soil core and subsequently drying it at 50 c during 48 h the initial volumetric water content Œ∏i was measured with a deltat water content probe one replication for Œ∏s and Œ∏i was performed per sampling site a 10 cm diameter disc infiltrometer was employed a thin layer 1 cm thick of commercial sand 80 160 Œºm grain size was placed between base disc and soil surface the duration of the experiments varied between 500 and 1800 s depending on the time needed to reach steady state infiltration conditions a total of 20 cumulative infiltration curves were recorded the influence of the contact sand layer tsand on ks and s estimates was removed using the procedure developed by latorre et al 2015 this consists of a layered flow model that assumes that water does not infiltrate into the soil until the sand layer is completely saturated the sand effect is considered as a gap in time and volume before water infiltrates into the soil the contact sand layer effect is removed by finding the sand infiltration time and its corresponding water volume and shifting the experimental data to the origin the maximum infiltration time due to the sand wetting layer was fixed to 10 s consequently for modeling with the sia method we no longer considered the sandy layer only the soil layering if any is expected to have an effect on the cumulative infiltration curves the sia method was then used as described for the synthetic soils analysis to provide s ks to rmse and wfa both 4t and qei models were considered for the application of the sia method on the field measurements 4 results and discussion 4 1 results for the synthetic soils numerically generated data except for the first infiltration times s and ks estimates for the homogeneous loam soil l using 4t were constant along the whole duration of the experiment fig 4 the initial divergences could be attributed to the large tension difference at the beginning of the experiment which changes from 10 3 to 107 cm and affects the numerical stability of the simulated cumulative infiltrations apart from this initial variation the estimates remain constant along the experiment this result indicates that under homogeneous soil conditions the considered infiltration time does not affect the predictions of the hydraulic parameters meanwhile a slight decrease of rmse was noticed with increasing time for the homogeneous synthetic loam column this is due to the fact that the difference between the synthetic and simulated curves is divided by the total number of data points in addition the rmse change with increasing analyzed time resulted in an indicator of the soil heterogeneity with no significant variations in the absence of soil layering the rmse represents the difference between the measured data and the theoretical curve which is consistent with the hypothesis of a homogeneous soil consequently the sudden increase of the rmse is expected in the presence of soil layering from the time when the infiltration bulb reaches the layers interface and both curves experimental and theoretical begin to differ in heterogeneous or layered soil profiles the rmse increased at the time to when the infiltration bulb reaches the lower soil layer fig 4b from time to s and ks started to deviate from their theoretical values fig 4c and d thus these results indicate that the sia method using 4t detects the soil heterogeneity and identifies the maximum time to to be considered for accurate estimations of s and ks of the upper soil layer in contrast erroneous hydraulic properties were reported when infiltration times larger than to are employed fig 4c and d for example this is the case of the l1cm si soil where long time analysis resulted in smaller ks values in this case the significant decrease of ks from to should be attributed to the extra concavity of the infiltration curve promoted by the less permeable deeper soil layer di prima et al 2018 which forces the model to reduce ks to the minimum threshold of 10 5 mm s 1 defined in the optimization for the l1cm sl synthetic soil erroneous ks estimates would be also obtained if for instance long time infiltration values were considered in this respect the extra convexity promoted by the more permeable deeper soil layer makes ks decreasing to the minimum threshold of 10 5 mm s 1 just after to to later stabilize ks at a value close that defined for sl table 1 these results indicate that ks evolution from to contains valuable information about the permeability of the deeper soil layer in conclusion these results indicate that the infiltration time is an important factor to estimate the soil hydraulic properties of heterogeneous soil profiles the sia method using the 4t model was an efficient tool to detect soil homogeneity and to estimate s and ks from the upper layer of heterogeneous soils overall good estimates of soil hydraulic properties were obtained when the sia method using either 4t or qei was applied to the homogeneous synthetic loam soil table 2 versus table 1 in this case the relative difference between theoretical and the optimized s and ks ks in log scale were 0 45 and 3 17 respectively similar results were reported by latorre et al 2015 and moret fern√°ndez et al 2020 except for the synthetic soil profiles with the thinnest top soil layer l1cm sl and l1cm si the s and ks estimates with qei and 4t also agreed with their theoretical values table 2 versus table 1 these results indicate that accurate estimations of s and ks require a minimum thickness of soil depth the similarity of the estimations using the qei and 4t expansion in heterogeneous profiles table 2 corroborates the 4t expansion was accurate enough for a proper estimation of the soil hydraulic properties this is an interesting result since the complexity of the latorre et al 2015 procedure may restrict its use when the sia method is applied on a large dataset of infiltration measurements this problem however vanishes using the 4t model for which the simpler equation allows fast and affordable analyses the numerical results also show that the prediction of the thickness of the upper soil layer is quite accurate indeed the calculated wetting front advance wfa were significantly correlated to the real values of the top layer thickness y 0 94x 0 36 r2 0 97 p 0 0001 table 2 these results indicate that the thickness of the upper soil layer can be estimated from the sequential analysis of the cumulative infiltration curve using both qei and 4t models 4 2 laboratory experiments the soil hydraulic properties estimated in the laboratory soil columns are summarized in table 3 as observed in synthetic homogenous soil fig 4a the decrease of rmse with time observed in the uniform loam soil is also present in the uniform laboratory loam fig 5 a the soil uniformity is also corroborated by the almost constant ks and s values estimated along the whole infiltration time the wfa calculated for the loam and clay loam soils table 3 were close to the 4 2 4 4 cm thickness of the wetted soil bulb measured in both soils at the end of the experiment a different behavior was observed in the stratified soil columns the minimum rmse found with the sia method indicated a change of soil layer at time to corresponding to the minimum rmse value fig 5b and c the smaller to observed in the sand clay loam s cl column fig 5c may be related to the significant higher ks and s of the sand table 3 which accelerated the infiltration that reaches the lower layer in less time however although the two columns presented an absolute minimum of the rmse the ks behavior after time to was different in the two experiments the large variability of ks around its optimal value observed in loam soil clay loam l cl column fig 5b indicates that the model cannot fit the experimental curve probably due to the extra concavity observed at large times the change of soil layer however was more evident in the s cl profile fig 5c where much contrasted ks and s values were obtained table 3 in this case the smaller ks and s of the clay loam soil generated an infiltration curve with a shift in its slope and shape and with a significant decrease in ks with time overall the similarity of ks and s estimates between the homogeneous loam and sand columns on one hand and the layered profiles on the other table 3 indicates that the method was robust and pointed at accurate estimates of the hydraulic properties in all the cases overall the thickness of the upper soil layer predicted from wfa values was close to their actual value table 3 as observed in the synthetic soils these results indicate the sia method allowed estimating the thickness of the upper soil layer the robust relationship between ks and s estimates obtained with qei and 4t models y 1 013x 0 022 r2 0 9091 p 0 0001 is in line with previous results and indicates that 4t model is accurate to estimate the soil hydraulic properties 4 3 field measurements overall the field soils presented a sandy loam texture high amount of gypsum 73 and low organic matter content 1 66 a great variability of types and shapes of infiltration curves was observed from field experiments fig 6 given the different types of cumulative infiltration curves described by angulo jaramillo et al 2019 four main types were analyzed i a regular fig 7 a ii extra concavity fig 7b iii double slope infiltration curve previously checked that it was affected by water repellency phenomena fig 7c and iv infiltration showing some irregularities at early times fig 7d in the first case m1m2r2 fig 7a a standard curve corresponding to a homogeneous soil where the rmse decreased along all the experiment 600 s with its corresponding estimates reported in table 4 other indicators corroborating the homogeneity of this soil were the stability of s and ks estimates and the almost constant time for the contact sand layer tsand these results suggest that the soil profile at the place of this infiltration curve was homogeneous the thickness of the corresponding soil layer was 4 3 cm table 4 in the second example m1l5r1 fig 7b although a preliminary visual analysis might suggest a behavior similar to the previous curve the sequential analysis evidenced the existence of a non uniform soil profile within the measured infiltration time the decreasing behavior of the infiltration rate which corresponds to a kind of extra concavity defined by angulo jaramillo et al 2019 was similar to that observed in the l1cm si synthetic soil fig 4b and also in the stratified laboratory soil columns fig 5b and c the minimum rmse was located around 170 s to time from which the rmse increased to the end of the infiltration other indicator of the existence of a layered profile was the decrease of ks and the large variation of tsand from to this large tsand variation is due to the model had to adapt the tsand value to find the best fitting for the heterogeneous profile on the other hand the decrease of ks over time would indicate that the profile presented a less permeable deeper layer di prima et al 2018 although less evident these changes were also manifested in s whose values kept almost constant until to 170 s before increasing in this case the thickness of the top soil layer was 1 4 cm table 4 thus the sequential analysis of the infiltration curve suggested the existence of a heterogeneous profile with a less permeable deeper layer a different behavior was depicted in fig 7c m1l3r1 where an inflection point was observed around 150 s this behavior was due to water repellence phenomenon moret fern√°ndez et al 2019 as previously experimentally checked with the water drop penetration time wdpt test watson and letey 1970 when water infiltrates into hydrophobic soils the water advance during the early phase of wetting is impeded owing to hydrophobic surface films on soil particles jarvis et al 2008 however once the hydrophobic layer is overcome to the infiltration rise promoted a significant increase of rmse and ks and a decrease of s an important increase of tsand was also observed just after the inflection point although water repellency and hence the inflection point can be visually detected angulo jaramillo et al 2019 the minimum rmse located with the sia procedure allowed a more objective determination of to and hence more accurate estimates of s and ks the average thickness of the top soil layer measured from wfa was around 1 2 cm table 4 in the last example m1m2r1 fig 7d a curve with an unclear behavior is presented in this case if determination of to is only based on the absolute rmse minimum a to around 210 s was obtained discontinuous vertical line however a more detailed analysis indicated that after the absolute rmse minimum there is another local minimum that coincides with more stable tsand s and ks values since the dispersion of all variables with time was relatively small in this case we would suggest omitting the initial times grey points in fig 5d and analyze the remaining infiltration section in this case to increased up to 680 s table 4 and the corresponding wfa was about 3 4 cm all these examples demonstrated that the sia method can be applied to real experimental data and should be considered when accurate estimates of hydraulic properties are required overall similar s ks to Œ± n and wfa values were obtained with both qei and 4t models table 4 the robust relationships between the hydraulic parameters estimated with both models table 5 indicates that hydraulic properties could be indistinctly estimated with qei or 4t models the small differences between both models could be explained by the different time increment employed to remove the effect of the contact sand layer latorre et al 2015 0 5 vs 0 1 s for qei and 4t respectively preliminary analyses of synthetic soils with sand layer using the same time increment 0 1 s confirmed not significant differences between qei and 4t only attributed to the different employed optimization algorithms the larger time interval used in qei is the result of a compromise between computation time and accuracy that is to say shorted time intervals would result in excessively long calculation times however the simpler and faster analysis of the 4t model allowed reducing this time interval which might result in better estimates of the hydraulic properties these results suggest that the 4t expansion is a robust alternative to estimate the soil hydraulic properties from the inverse analysis of a cumulative infiltration curve within a large range of infiltration times the s and ks estimated from the measured infiltration curves ranged between 0 07 and 0 60 mm s 0 5 and 1 8 10 3 to 3 72 10 2 mm s 1 respectively over the 20 experimental infiltrations only 3 measurements presented a to equal to the total measured infiltration time 600 s 25 of the analyzed curves presented to 400 s and 200 to 400 respectively and 50 a to 200 s these results would indicate that for the most cases the hydraulic properties were estimated from short to medium infiltration times for the 70 of the studied soils the estimated upper soil layer was thinner than 2 cm and only three soils presented a uniform upper layer wider than 4 cm these results suggest that overall the analyzed soils presented a thin upper layer which could probably correspond with the soil surface crust 5 conclusions this work presents a procedure to analyze the infiltration curves measured on layered soil profiles this new method referred as sia sequential infiltration analysis consists of analyzing infiltration curves at increasing time intervals and calculating the corresponding ks s and the rmse characterizing the quality of the fit to this end both qei and 4t models were employed a procedure to estimate the wetting front advance wfa or the thickness of the upper uniform soil layer from the infiltration analysis was also presented the procedure which was applied on synthetic layered profiles and experimental soils showed that erroneous estimates of ks and s were obtained when the inverse analysis was applied to the whole infiltration curve obtained for heterogeneous profiles this limitation however vanished using the sia procedure which allowed satisfactory estimates of to ks s and the corresponding wfa for very different types of infiltration curves however because the sia method sequentially analyzes the series of infiltrations results only correspond to the upper soil layer which can be considered homogeneous this hypothesis implies a limitation of the method when the thickness of the upper layer is very thin on the other hand since the results also show that some of the properties of the deepest soil layers are also contained in the infiltration curve it opens the possibility to advance in the method improvement to obtain additional information of the total soil profile from the analysis of the complete infiltration curve in most experimental soils only short to medium infiltration times could be analyzed and the thickness of the upper homogeneous soil layer ranged between 1 and 5 cm in conclusion these results showed that great care must be taken when calculating the soil hydraulic properties from the inversion of the measured infiltration curves questioning the possibility that anomalous curves cannot be analyzed accurately on the other hand although similar results were obtained with both qei and 4t models the simpler and faster analysis allowed by 4t suggests that this expansion can be a robust alternative to be implemented in the sia method for the estimation of the ks and s of the top layer

4383,the tension disc infiltrometer has become a widespread method to measure soil hydraulic properties under unsaturated conditions although several automated devices have been developed most designs include an elongated water reservoir and a pressure transducer with electronic components to register the water level increasing its cost and limiting its application the objective of this work is to present a new tension disc infiltrometer with a compact design of 10 cm diameter and height where the water level is monitored by a smartphone camera the infiltration curve is determined from the automated analysis of the images recorded by the smartphone without additional electronic components the device was first validated in the laboratory by comparing visual measurements v the camera imagery ca and a pressure transducer pt next it was tested on field infiltration experiments robust fits r2 0 99 were found between the water level measured with ca in the laboratory and those obtained with v and pt procedures the ca method is accurate robust and independent of the relative camera position good fits were also observed between ca water level and those obtained with pt in the field experiments similar hydraulic conductivity and sorptivity values were obtained with both sensors using the numerical solution of the haverkamp nsh equation the compact infiltrometer in conjunction with the smartphone camera is an accurate accessible portable and easy to use field based device for soil hydraulic characterisation keywords automated single ring infiltrometer compact design infiltration rate measurements nsh soil hydraulic properties 1 introduction characterisation of soil surface hydraulic properties sorptivity and hydraulic conductivity is crucial to solving many hydrological and environmental issues linked to soil water storage and transport in the vadose zone in practice this is achieved by field determinations of transient or steady state infiltration curves angulo jaramillo et al 2000 the tension disc infiltrometer is a standard and worldwide employed device for measuring these soil hydraulic properties under field conditions this instrument consists of a base disc attached to a graduated water supply reservoir and a bubble tower to impose a negative pressure head at the base disc perroux and white 1988 overall the diameter of the water reservoir is several times smaller than the disc base however there is also the mini disc infiltrometer madsen and chandler 2007 where the disc has the same diameter as the water reservoir the measured drop in the reservoir water level over time is used to determine the cumulative infiltration curve the cumulative infiltration was originally determined by the visual notation of the reservoir water level but this practice was tedious and required constant vigilance sometimes over long periods e g in impermeable clays the manual recording was subsequently replaced by automated systems such as those where the water level is monitored by pressure transducers constantz and murphy 1987 ankeny et al 1988 casey and derby 2002 madsen and chandler 2007 alternatively moret et al 2004 monitored the reservoir water level changes using a long three rod coated time domain reflectometry tdr probe vertically inserted in the water supply reservoir a different design was proposed by moret fern√°ndez et al 2012 where the disc was separated from a high capacity water reservoir with the infiltration rate curve measured using a micro flowmeter plus mariotte tube system more recently kl√≠pa et al 2015 developed a new design where the cumulative infiltration was measured by recording the change in buoyancy acting on a vertical solid bar fixed in the reservoir tube of the infiltrometer although all above described techniques applied to the disc infiltrometer have been demonstrated to be accurate and efficient for water level measurement both the load cells lord and smith 1983 pressure transducers liu and higgins 2015 and tdr pepin et al 1995 are temperature dependent a factor that can affect the estimate of the water level under field conditions where temperature changes during the day however though this problem could be solved by introducing a corrector factor in the equation that relates mv with the water level this would involve introducing a new sensor which complicates the method on the other hand for the particular case of the pressure transducer another limitation of this technique is the sensitivity of this sensor to the bubbling inside the water reservoir which effects tend to increase with increasing infiltration rates ≈°pongrov√° et al 2009 this bubbling introduces an unwanted noise in the infiltration curve that increases the uncertainty in the estimation of the soil hydraulic properties latorre et al 2015 the cost of the different devices to measure the disc infiltrometer water level drop depends on the employed technique for instance the most expensive method would correspond to that based on the tdr technique moret et al 2004 where cable testers which can cost several thousand euros are connected to a laptop in this case the laptop allows checking if the tdr signal is correctly recorded however this technique which needs long tdr probes limits its application to high capacity reservoirs this configuration together with the cables connecting the tdr cable tester to the corresponding probe makes this method not very manageable under field conditions in contrast the main advantage of this system is it could allow simultaneous estimates of the water level and soil water content which can be useful if for instance the schwartz and evett 2002 infiltration method is employed more inexpensive are the methods based on pressure transducers casey and derby 2002 among others or load cells kl√≠pa et al 2015 which only requires the sensor around 50 to 100 and a datalogger around 200 to 700 for recording the data although this configuration allows the use of more portable and manageable disc infiltrometers i e mini disc infiltrometer madsen and chandler 2007 the cable connecting the datalogger to the sensor can hinder its use in areas with difficult access on the other hand the small diameter of the mini disc infiltrometer 3 2 cm makes the measurements less representative and the small disc base total height 20 30 cm ratio makes it more unstable with soil surface irregularities or the wind effect for field measurements a screen to check whether the sensors are correctly running is also recommended for instance wrong measures can be recorded when pressure transducers are wet although this problem can be solved using data loggers with a digital screen campbel scientific developed a smartphone app https www campbellsci es loggernet which connects via bluetooth to a campbel scientific datalogger and allows checking at real time the cumulative infiltration curve however although this wireless system allows eliminating cables it makes also the method more expensive although these existing techniques remove the need for visual observations all of them require a data logger or pc to store the sensor data which increases the device cost and complexity additionally the wire connecting the sensor and the data logger can limit its use in areas with difficult access thus there is a need to develop a compact and wireless disc infiltrometer system to facilitate infiltration measurements under field conditions this paper presents a new compact disc infiltrometer design of 10 cm diameter and height where the water level drop of the infiltrometer reservoir and corresponding cumulative infiltration curve are measured by a smartphone camera the device was validated in the laboratory where camera ca water level measurements were compared with visual v and pressure transducer pt readings the new design was finally tested in the field where soil sorptivity and saturated hydraulic conductivity estimated from the cumulative infiltration curve measured with pt were compared to that calculated from the recorded video 2 material and methods the proposed device consists of a new compact disc infiltrometer and a smartphone installed in a standard tripod to continuously record the water level fig 1 the description of the system is provided in the following sections i compact infiltrometer design ii camera characteristics iii image analysis and iv field setup to this end the device was tested in the laboratory and next used in laboratory and field experiments 2 1 smartphone based tension disc infiltrometer 2 1 1 compact infiltrometer design the proposed design of tension disc infiltrometer employs the same physical principles as the original perroux and white 1988 instrument consisting of a bubbling tower water reservoir and a disc base fig 2 the external shape which is similar to that of the mini disc infiltrometer madsen and chandler 2007 consists of a uniform 10 cm long cylindrical tube made of methacrylate with a base disc of the same diameter the water reservoir is hermetically sealed at the top with two mobile pipes of 6 mm external diameter traversing the top lid fig 2 the first one pipe 1 fig 2 crosses the infiltrometer body longitudinally up to 0 5 cm above the soil surface and is connected to the bubble tower which in turn is attached to the disc infiltrometer the bubble tower has a mobile tube submerged 0 5 cm in water tube bubble tower fig 2 that allows compensating for the overpressure produced by the 0 5 cm height between the end of pipe 1 and the base of the disc this makes it possible to have 0 cm of pressure head on the disc base although the bubbling tower could allow measuring at negative pressure heads this infiltrometer design which cannot be moved once infiltration starts is addressed to run only on a single pressure head the second pipe pipe 2 fig 2 is inserted 2 cm inside the infiltrometer through the centre of the water reservoir this second pipe which has a valve at the end is used to fill up the infiltrometer by vacuum once the instrument is placed on a water sheet this system allows consistent filling of the reservoir to the same water height the body of the infiltrometer has a plastic wall that divides it into two parts longitudinally fig 2 the two sections are connected by a 0 5 cm high slot made at the base and top of the wall enabling water and air to move freely from one compartment to the other by the bottom and top slots respectively one side of the water reservoir houses the bubbling pipe end of pipe 1 and a cylindrical buoy of 2 5 cm diameter fig 2 this buoy which is screwed onto the infiltrometer lid allows for reducing the volume of water contained in the water reservoir similarly as done in conventional disc infiltrometers where the reservoir can be interchanged by pipes of different diameters depending on the soil permeability a thinner or wider buoy could be employed the second chamber of the water reservoir is empty and has a tape measure attached to the external wall this second chamber is used to measure the water level using the smartphone camera the water was previously tinted using a generic food colorant to increase the contrast of the water surface and facilitate its automatic detection and precise location under both laboratory and field conditions internally the separation between the bubbling tube end of pipe 1 and the chamber for the water level measurement minimises the bubbling effect on the water surface preventing disturbance to the infiltration measurement the base of the infiltrometer is covered with 5 mm aperture steel mesh followed by a 44 ¬µm pore size nylon mesh fig 2 a spirit level was attached to the top of the device 2 1 2 camera characteristics after testing different types of commercially available cameras i e action cameras standard photo cameras or autofocus endoscope we found that the camera integrated into a smartphone presented the best characteristics to measure the water level of the disc infiltrometer reservoir for several reasons i it allows recording hd videos and ii it can work with a free frame lapse app so it does not require any prior programming iii the screen necessary to frame and focus the water reservoir is integrated into the same device iv it presents an easy system to start and stop recording video in each infiltration measurement v it is a compact portable and manageable device where the battery camera screen and switches are integrated into the same device and vi the recorded video can be renamed and commented on in situ vii the cost is relatively low available from 100 and viii the smartphone is increasingly used for many different applications in our case an android smartphone oppo a9 2020 model was employed in the experiments the frontal camera has a sensor with 48 megapixels mp resolution and 0 8 ¬µm pixel size the camera lenses have an f 1 8 aperture adjustable focus and a field of view fov of 79 the images were recorded in a video with a generic and free time lapse application framelapse pro 4 0 using full hd resolution 1920 1080 pixels an image acquisition interval of one second was selected the smartphone was installed vertically in a standard flexible tripod with the device placed upside down to align the camera sensor with the half height of the reservoir the tripod was manually positioned in front of the infiltrometer at a distance where the entire reservoir was visible on the screen with an angle so that the tape measure resulted centred on the image fig 1 and fig 3 2 1 3 image analysis a script for the automatic analysis of the recorded videos was developed in the r programming language using the imager cran package and the ffmpeg tool barthelme et al 2020 tomar 2006 the separate analysis of each experiment includes the following steps after extracting the sequence of images using ffmpeg manual analysis was performed to identify the image in which the infiltrometer was initially placed on the soil this consisted of checking the first frames and selecting the initial image corresponding to the time where the disc infiltrometer was placed and stabilised on the sand layer from the initial image the required spatial references on the measuring tape were manually identified two points with a known spacing 6 cm in our experiments were located over the tape measure this manual analysis is performed once for every experiment to calibrate the required parameters for the sequential analysis of the video images using these reference points the images were rotated to align the infiltrometer vertically two rectangular analysis windows one located on the measuring tape and the second one on the dyed water were next defined from the rgb colour values the changes of the red channel along each window allow the automatic detection of the metric marks on the tape measure and the position of the water level fig 3 the references of the tape measure were located using a peak detector the position of the water level was identified using a step detector and a percentile based threshold linear regression was computed from the positions of the metric marks to transform pixel coordinates to metric units over the tape measure 1 h a h b where h represents the water level in metric units a and b are the coefficients of the linear regression and h represents the water level in pixel units the influence of lens distortion in the conducted experiments was found negligible so no correction was required for instance the seven control points from the tape measure visible in fig 3 present a linear fit with a coefficient of determination r2 0 9995 and sub pixel residual errors 0 1 px the water level observed by the camera is affected by the refraction of light through the methacrylate wall causing a variable shift the real water level was computed from the apparent or virtual water level following geometric optics approximation fig 4 as described in appendix i to obtain the following equation 2 h h t h w 2 naw 2 t a n f o v 2 where h and h represent the real and the apparent water levels respectively both in pixel units t is the wall thickness in meters and n its index of refraction a represents the scale factor from the regression in eq 1 and w is the image width in pixel units finally the real water level was transformed into metric units using eq 1 the sequential analysis of the video frames assumes that the reservoir and the smartphone remain static during the experiment a separate analysis of the video in different parts will be required if the infiltrometer is displaced during the measurement i e soil collapsing process 2 1 4 infiltrometer field setup to increase the contrast of the water in the reservoir for better detection of its surface in the image analysis a blue dye was added to the infiltration water in our case an inexpensive biodegradable and non toxic generic food colorant was employed figs 1 and 3 the dye was dissolved in a bottle containing the water that will be used later to fill the infiltrometer in our case we added 4 drops of food colouring per litre and a half of water once matched the height of pipe 1 and that of the pipe submerged in the bubbling tower fig 2 the infiltrometer was ready to be filled to fill the water reservoir the infiltrometer was placed in a water tank with blue coloured water the filling process was done by suctioning through pipe 2 fig 2 until the water begins to rise through the pipe at this time the disc infiltrometer was ready to be placed on the soil surface to improve the water level measures the reservoir wall should be clean after each use a task that can be simply done with a wet rag as described by perroux and white 1988 a thin contact sand layer was placed between the disc base and the soil surface the sand was levelled using a methacrylate tube closed at the bottom with the same diameter and height as the infiltrometer the orientation of the sand surface was adjusted using a horizontal bubble level fixed on the top of the leveller fig 1 excess sand outside the leveller base was then removed the smartphone installed upside down on the tripod was then manually placed in front of the leveller at a distance of approximately 10 cm to focus the image and adjust the camera distance and angle so the whole reservoir was visible on the screen and the measuring tape was centred on the image fig 3 after starting the video recording the leveller was replaced by the disc infiltrometer filled with water fig 1 oriented so that the tape measure resulted centred on the image the time at which infiltration commenced 2 2 laboratory calibration the accuracy and precision of the new design were evaluated in the laboratory where two sets of experiments were performed the first consisted of comparing the water levels measured at static conditions with the camera ca with those obtained with a pressure transducer pt and visually v stair shaped water level drop curves were constructed where each step corresponded to each cm on the measuring tape to check the influence of the camera position on the water level measurements this experiment was repeated twice where the camera was placed at different heights relative to the infiltrometer a 35 cm pressure transducer pt microswitch honeywell international inc previously calibrated was employed the pt connected to a data logger cr1000 campbell scientist inc logan ut usa was installed in the disc infiltrometer according to casey and dervy 2002 the second calibration experiment consisted of comparing the continuous water level measurements ca and pt with v readings visual readings corresponded to the crossing of each cm on the tape measure the experiment consisted of an infiltration at 0 cm of pressure head on a wet cloth at the end of which the water was allowed to drain by gravity with a single replicate 2 3 field experiments the method was next tested under field conditions the experiments compared the cumulative infiltration curve measured with the ca and pt as in the laboratory calibration experiments a 35 cm pressure transducer pt connected to a data logger was installed in the disc infiltrometer four infiltrations were performed the first two were undertaken on a grass plot g1 and g2 with loam soils in the estaci√≥n experimental de aula dei csic zaragoza spain before infiltration measurements the grass was cut to the soil level two additional infiltrations were performed at two plots under conventional ct and no tillage treatment nt the experimental field on a nearly flat area slope 0 2 with loam soils corresponded to a long term conservation tillage experiment started in 1991 l√≥pez and arr√∫e 1995 the measurement under ct was performed on freshly tilled soil after copious rainfall soil dry bulk density œÅb was determined with the core method grossman and reinsch 2002 using cores of 50 mm in diameter and height this sampling was also used to determine the initial volumetric water content Œ∏i a thin layer 1 cm thickness of commercial sand 80 160 Œºm grain size was placed between the base disc and soil surface a zero cm pressure head was applied to the base disc at the end of the experiment and after removing the sand layer a saturated soil sample was taken under the base disc the Œ∏s was calculated as the product between saturated gravimetric water content and œÅb 2 4 soil hydraulic properties estimates the soil hydraulic properties were estimated using the latorre et al 2015 numerical procedure this consisted in minimising the objective function q which quantifies the difference between the modelled i 3 d s k s t and the experimental data ie3d 3 q s k i 1 n i e 3 d i 3 d s k s t i Œ¥ t 2 modelled 3d cumulative infiltrations were described with the quasi analytical haverkamp et al 1994 solution 4 2 k s k i 2 s 2 t

proportionality constant that accounts for the correction of the wetting front shape haverkamp et al 1994 the existence and the uniqueness of the solution are studied with q error maps generated for the s ks plane using a global optimisation pardalos and romeijn 2002 the response surfaces are calculated on a rectangular grid with ks from 0 001 to 0 1 mm s 1 s from 0 1 to 1 2 although for regular working conditions Œ≥ varies between 0 6 and 0 8 haverkamp et al 1994 and Œ≤ between 0 3 and 1 7 lassabatere et al 2009 constant values of Œ≥ and Œ≤ of 0 75 and 0 6 were respectively employed angulo jaramillo et al 2000 latorre et al 2015 more details of the global numerical optimisation can be found in latorre et al 2015 all calculations were done using the http swi csic es infiltration map website 3 results and discussion given that the physical mechanism of the infiltrometer is exactly the same as the original perroux and white 1988 design the proposed compact disc infiltrometer is valid for all kind of soils although this design could be used also to measure under negative pressure heads the low capacity of the water reservoir which does not allow measuring long enough cumulative infiltration curves to reach a steady state in successive tensions makes this prototype not suitable for multitension measurements on the other hand given that the automatic video analysis requires the infiltrometer to always be in the same position this design makes it impossible to refill the reservoir without moving the infiltrometer in addition in the case that there was enough volume of water to measure at several tensions moving the pipe of the bubbling tower would probably involve moving the infiltrometer which would hinder the video analysis this last limitation however could be solved by separating the bubbling tower from the infiltrometer body in conclusion the presented design which is motivated by the madsen and chandler 2007 unitension mini disc infiltrometer is not optimal for multitension measures and the main rule of the bubbling tower is to allow a more accurate definition of the saturated soil tension a robust fit was found between the water level measured with the ca on the laboratory stair shaped curve and the corresponding values obtained with v and pt fig 5 the significant relationship between v and ca y 1 006 0 014 r2 0 999 p 0 0001 and pt and ca measurements y 0 999x 0 035 r2 0 999 p 0 0001 indicates the ca method allowed satisfactory measurements of the water level under static conditions the strong correlation between v pt and ca readings when this last one was placed at different positions regarding to the infiltrometer y 1 006x 0 014 r2 0 999 y 1 0077x 0 128 r2 0 999 indicated the method is independent of the relative position of the camera this is a relevant result for field experiments since the irregularities of the soil surface make it difficult to use a constant position between the camera and disc infiltrometer a robust fit was also observed between the infiltration curve measured on the wet cloth with ca pt and v readings fig 6 the highly significant correlation between water levels recorded with ca and pt y 1 018x 0 009 r2 0 999 p 0 0001 and those obtained by comparing ca and v readings y 1 0105x 0 0196 r2 0 999 p 0 0001 indicates the smartphone also allowed accurate continuous estimate of the water level drop visual examination of the videos showed that the compartmentalised reservoir minimised the effect of bubbling on the water level measurements resulting in stable infiltration curves good fits were found between ca water level drop measurements and those obtained with pt in the infiltration field experiments fig 7 compared to the ca method pt produced finely saw shaped infiltration curves likely due to discontinuous changes of the pressure head produced by the intermittent bubbling inside the reservoir ≈°pongrov√° et al 2009 another explanation for these irregularities could be the possible effect of temperature on the pt measurements liu and higgins 2015 these irregularities were not observed with the ca method where water level drop measurements are independent of the water reservoir pressure head and external temperature regarding the precision of ca measurements the spatial resolution of the conducted videos was approximately 0 008 cm 1 2 10 4 psi per pixel in the water level positioning the analysis of the registered data from the pt revealed a similar effective precision of 0 009 cm 1 3 10 4 psi possibly determined by the resolution of the analogue to digital converter unit in the data logger the inverse analysis applied on the noisier pt infiltration curves resulted in q eq 3 values almost 30 higher than those found with ca table 1 which means that ca resulted in more stable and less noisy infiltration curves the similar ks and s values obtained with both methods table 1 indicate the ca method is a robust technique to examine soil hydraulic properties highly significant relationships with slopes close to one were obtained between s y 1 084x 0 014 r2 0 99 p 0 0001 and ks y 0 986x 0 0018 r2 0 94 p 0 0001 estimated from the infiltration curves measured with pt and the ca method respectively fig 8 4 conclusions this paper presents an alternative unitension disc infiltrometer design along with a new technique to measure the cumulative infiltration curve the new method consists of a compact 10 cm diameter and height disc infiltrometer where the water level is measured from the analysis of a video recorded with a smartphone camera both laboratory calibration and field infiltration experiments demonstrated the camera allows accurate estimates of water level for the proposed application of soil hydraulic characterization the compact disc infiltrometer is stable easy to manage under field conditions and allowed satisfactory estimates of the soil sorptivity and hydraulic conductivity the ubiquitous use of smartphones makes this technique accessible to practically all researchers the r script to analyse the videos was written specifically for this project and is distributed as open source software http swi csic es makes this technique easy to use and implement compared to other methods the water level measured using the smartphone camera is not affected by temperature a factor that can vary under field conditions such as on sunny days with alternating clouds manual visual inspection of the recorded videos also provides a means to check the validity of the water levels calculated by the automated video analysis the infiltrometer design and measurement technique presented in this paper is wireless compact portable relatively inexpensive valid for all kind of soils accurate and easy to manage in the field providing an important advance to the measurement of soil hydraulic properties on the other hand although it is well known that that disc infiltrometer can be employed for multitension measures the characteristics of this prototype with a low water reservoir capacity and bubbling tower attached to the infiltrometer body makes this design not suitable for multitension

propagation of light rays following geometrical optics is depicted in fig 4 where two optical effects must be considered first the water level and the measure tape are located in different planes separated by the infiltrometer wall this causes a variable shift on the apparent water level registered in the measure tape plane secondly the rays experiment an additional bending caused by the refraction of light as it passes from the methacrylate wall to the air with different refractive index the units of the vertical dimensions in fig 4 are presented in pixel units lowercase letters to emphasize that they are registered in the raw image coordinates but they can be converted to metric units capital letters using eq 1 or the opposite way from pixel units to metric units using the inverse transformation the calculus of the trigonometric functions will be derived for convenience in pixel units in order to first correct the water level as it is registered in the raw image

4383,the tension disc infiltrometer has become a widespread method to measure soil hydraulic properties under unsaturated conditions although several automated devices have been developed most designs include an elongated water reservoir and a pressure transducer with electronic components to register the water level increasing its cost and limiting its application the objective of this work is to present a new tension disc infiltrometer with a compact design of 10 cm diameter and height where the water level is monitored by a smartphone camera the infiltration curve is determined from the automated analysis of the images recorded by the smartphone without additional electronic components the device was first validated in the laboratory by comparing visual measurements v the camera imagery ca and a pressure transducer pt next it was tested on field infiltration experiments robust fits r2 0 99 were found between the water level measured with ca in the laboratory and those obtained with v and pt procedures the ca method is accurate robust and independent of the relative camera position good fits were also observed between ca water level and those obtained with pt in the field experiments similar hydraulic conductivity and sorptivity values were obtained with both sensors using the numerical solution of the haverkamp nsh equation the compact infiltrometer in conjunction with the smartphone camera is an accurate accessible portable and easy to use field based device for soil hydraulic characterisation keywords automated single ring infiltrometer compact design infiltration rate measurements nsh soil hydraulic properties 1 introduction characterisation of soil surface hydraulic properties sorptivity and hydraulic conductivity is crucial to solving many hydrological and environmental issues linked to soil water storage and transport in the vadose zone in practice this is achieved by field determinations of transient or steady state infiltration curves angulo jaramillo et al 2000 the tension disc infiltrometer is a standard and worldwide employed device for measuring these soil hydraulic properties under field conditions this instrument consists of a base disc attached to a graduated water supply reservoir and a bubble tower to impose a negative pressure head at the base disc perroux and white 1988 overall the diameter of the water reservoir is several times smaller than the disc base however there is also the mini disc infiltrometer madsen and chandler 2007 where the disc has the same diameter as the water reservoir the measured drop in the reservoir water level over time is used to determine the cumulative infiltration curve the cumulative infiltration was originally determined by the visual notation of the reservoir water level but this practice was tedious and required constant vigilance sometimes over long periods e g in impermeable clays the manual recording was subsequently replaced by automated systems such as those where the water level is monitored by pressure transducers constantz and murphy 1987 ankeny et al 1988 casey and derby 2002 madsen and chandler 2007 alternatively moret et al 2004 monitored the reservoir water level changes using a long three rod coated time domain reflectometry tdr probe vertically inserted in the water supply reservoir a different design was proposed by moret fern√°ndez et al 2012 where the disc was separated from a high capacity water reservoir with the infiltration rate curve measured using a micro flowmeter plus mariotte tube system more recently kl√≠pa et al 2015 developed a new design where the cumulative infiltration was measured by recording the change in buoyancy acting on a vertical solid bar fixed in the reservoir tube of the infiltrometer although all above described techniques applied to the disc infiltrometer have been demonstrated to be accurate and efficient for water level measurement both the load cells lord and smith 1983 pressure transducers liu and higgins 2015 and tdr pepin et al 1995 are temperature dependent a factor that can affect the estimate of the water level under field conditions where temperature changes during the day however though this problem could be solved by introducing a corrector factor in the equation that relates mv with the water level this would involve introducing a new sensor which complicates the method on the other hand for the particular case of the pressure transducer another limitation of this technique is the sensitivity of this sensor to the bubbling inside the water reservoir which effects tend to increase with increasing infiltration rates ≈°pongrov√° et al 2009 this bubbling introduces an unwanted noise in the infiltration curve that increases the uncertainty in the estimation of the soil hydraulic properties latorre et al 2015 the cost of the different devices to measure the disc infiltrometer water level drop depends on the employed technique for instance the most expensive method would correspond to that based on the tdr technique moret et al 2004 where cable testers which can cost several thousand euros are connected to a laptop in this case the laptop allows checking if the tdr signal is correctly recorded however this technique which needs long tdr probes limits its application to high capacity reservoirs this configuration together with the cables connecting the tdr cable tester to the corresponding probe makes this method not very manageable under field conditions in contrast the main advantage of this system is it could allow simultaneous estimates of the water level and soil water content which can be useful if for instance the schwartz and evett 2002 infiltration method is employed more inexpensive are the methods based on pressure transducers casey and derby 2002 among others or load cells kl√≠pa et al 2015 which only requires the sensor around 50 to 100 and a datalogger around 200 to 700 for recording the data although this configuration allows the use of more portable and manageable disc infiltrometers i e mini disc infiltrometer madsen and chandler 2007 the cable connecting the datalogger to the sensor can hinder its use in areas with difficult access on the other hand the small diameter of the mini disc infiltrometer 3 2 cm makes the measurements less representative and the small disc base total height 20 30 cm ratio makes it more unstable with soil surface irregularities or the wind effect for field measurements a screen to check whether the sensors are correctly running is also recommended for instance wrong measures can be recorded when pressure transducers are wet although this problem can be solved using data loggers with a digital screen campbel scientific developed a smartphone app https www campbellsci es loggernet which connects via bluetooth to a campbel scientific datalogger and allows checking at real time the cumulative infiltration curve however although this wireless system allows eliminating cables it makes also the method more expensive although these existing techniques remove the need for visual observations all of them require a data logger or pc to store the sensor data which increases the device cost and complexity additionally the wire connecting the sensor and the data logger can limit its use in areas with difficult access thus there is a need to develop a compact and wireless disc infiltrometer system to facilitate infiltration measurements under field conditions this paper presents a new compact disc infiltrometer design of 10 cm diameter and height where the water level drop of the infiltrometer reservoir and corresponding cumulative infiltration curve are measured by a smartphone camera the device was validated in the laboratory where camera ca water level measurements were compared with visual v and pressure transducer pt readings the new design was finally tested in the field where soil sorptivity and saturated hydraulic conductivity estimated from the cumulative infiltration curve measured with pt were compared to that calculated from the recorded video 2 material and methods the proposed device consists of a new compact disc infiltrometer and a smartphone installed in a standard tripod to continuously record the water level fig 1 the description of the system is provided in the following sections i compact infiltrometer design ii camera characteristics iii image analysis and iv field setup to this end the device was tested in the laboratory and next used in laboratory and field experiments 2 1 smartphone based tension disc infiltrometer 2 1 1 compact infiltrometer design the proposed design of tension disc infiltrometer employs the same physical principles as the original perroux and white 1988 instrument consisting of a bubbling tower water reservoir and a disc base fig 2 the external shape which is similar to that of the mini disc infiltrometer madsen and chandler 2007 consists of a uniform 10 cm long cylindrical tube made of methacrylate with a base disc of the same diameter the water reservoir is hermetically sealed at the top with two mobile pipes of 6 mm external diameter traversing the top lid fig 2 the first one pipe 1 fig 2 crosses the infiltrometer body longitudinally up to 0 5 cm above the soil surface and is connected to the bubble tower which in turn is attached to the disc infiltrometer the bubble tower has a mobile tube submerged 0 5 cm in water tube bubble tower fig 2 that allows compensating for the overpressure produced by the 0 5 cm height between the end of pipe 1 and the base of the disc this makes it possible to have 0 cm of pressure head on the disc base although the bubbling tower could allow measuring at negative pressure heads this infiltrometer design which cannot be moved once infiltration starts is addressed to run only on a single pressure head the second pipe pipe 2 fig 2 is inserted 2 cm inside the infiltrometer through the centre of the water reservoir this second pipe which has a valve at the end is used to fill up the infiltrometer by vacuum once the instrument is placed on a water sheet this system allows consistent filling of the reservoir to the same water height the body of the infiltrometer has a plastic wall that divides it into two parts longitudinally fig 2 the two sections are connected by a 0 5 cm high slot made at the base and top of the wall enabling water and air to move freely from one compartment to the other by the bottom and top slots respectively one side of the water reservoir houses the bubbling pipe end of pipe 1 and a cylindrical buoy of 2 5 cm diameter fig 2 this buoy which is screwed onto the infiltrometer lid allows for reducing the volume of water contained in the water reservoir similarly as done in conventional disc infiltrometers where the reservoir can be interchanged by pipes of different diameters depending on the soil permeability a thinner or wider buoy could be employed the second chamber of the water reservoir is empty and has a tape measure attached to the external wall this second chamber is used to measure the water level using the smartphone camera the water was previously tinted using a generic food colorant to increase the contrast of the water surface and facilitate its automatic detection and precise location under both laboratory and field conditions internally the separation between the bubbling tube end of pipe 1 and the chamber for the water level measurement minimises the bubbling effect on the water surface preventing disturbance to the infiltration measurement the base of the infiltrometer is covered with 5 mm aperture steel mesh followed by a 44 ¬µm pore size nylon mesh fig 2 a spirit level was attached to the top of the device 2 1 2 camera characteristics after testing different types of commercially available cameras i e action cameras standard photo cameras or autofocus endoscope we found that the camera integrated into a smartphone presented the best characteristics to measure the water level of the disc infiltrometer reservoir for several reasons i it allows recording hd videos and ii it can work with a free frame lapse app so it does not require any prior programming iii the screen necessary to frame and focus the water reservoir is integrated into the same device iv it presents an easy system to start and stop recording video in each infiltration measurement v it is a compact portable and manageable device where the battery camera screen and switches are integrated into the same device and vi the recorded video can be renamed and commented on in situ vii the cost is relatively low available from 100 and viii the smartphone is increasingly used for many different applications in our case an android smartphone oppo a9 2020 model was employed in the experiments the frontal camera has a sensor with 48 megapixels mp resolution and 0 8 ¬µm pixel size the camera lenses have an f 1 8 aperture adjustable focus and a field of view fov of 79 the images were recorded in a video with a generic and free time lapse application framelapse pro 4 0 using full hd resolution 1920 1080 pixels an image acquisition interval of one second was selected the smartphone was installed vertically in a standard flexible tripod with the device placed upside down to align the camera sensor with the half height of the reservoir the tripod was manually positioned in front of the infiltrometer at a distance where the entire reservoir was visible on the screen with an angle so that the tape measure resulted centred on the image fig 1 and fig 3 2 1 3 image analysis a script for the automatic analysis of the recorded videos was developed in the r programming language using the imager cran package and the ffmpeg tool barthelme et al 2020 tomar 2006 the separate analysis of each experiment includes the following steps after extracting the sequence of images using ffmpeg manual analysis was performed to identify the image in which the infiltrometer was initially placed on the soil this consisted of checking the first frames and selecting the initial image corresponding to the time where the disc infiltrometer was placed and stabilised on the sand layer from the initial image the required spatial references on the measuring tape were manually identified two points with a known spacing 6 cm in our experiments were located over the tape measure this manual analysis is performed once for every experiment to calibrate the required parameters for the sequential analysis of the video images using these reference points the images were rotated to align the infiltrometer vertically two rectangular analysis windows one located on the measuring tape and the second one on the dyed water were next defined from the rgb colour values the changes of the red channel along each window allow the automatic detection of the metric marks on the tape measure and the position of the water level fig 3 the references of the tape measure were located using a peak detector the position of the water level was identified using a step detector and a percentile based threshold linear regression was computed from the positions of the metric marks to transform pixel coordinates to metric units over the tape measure 1 h a h b where h represents the water level in metric units a and b are the coefficients of the linear regression and h represents the water level in pixel units the influence of lens distortion in the conducted experiments was found negligible so no correction was required for instance the seven control points from the tape measure visible in fig 3 present a linear fit with a coefficient of determination r2 0 9995 and sub pixel residual errors 0 1 px the water level observed by the camera is affected by the refraction of light through the methacrylate wall causing a variable shift the real water level was computed from the apparent or virtual water level following geometric optics approximation fig 4 as described in appendix i to obtain the following equation 2 h h t h w 2 naw 2 t a n f o v 2 where h and h represent the real and the apparent water levels respectively both in pixel units t is the wall thickness in meters and n its index of refraction a represents the scale factor from the regression in eq 1 and w is the image width in pixel units finally the real water level was transformed into metric units using eq 1 the sequential analysis of the video frames assumes that the reservoir and the smartphone remain static during the experiment a separate analysis of the video in different parts will be required if the infiltrometer is displaced during the measurement i e soil collapsing process 2 1 4 infiltrometer field setup to increase the contrast of the water in the reservoir for better detection of its surface in the image analysis a blue dye was added to the infiltration water in our case an inexpensive biodegradable and non toxic generic food colorant was employed figs 1 and 3 the dye was dissolved in a bottle containing the water that will be used later to fill the infiltrometer in our case we added 4 drops of food colouring per litre and a half of water once matched the height of pipe 1 and that of the pipe submerged in the bubbling tower fig 2 the infiltrometer was ready to be filled to fill the water reservoir the infiltrometer was placed in a water tank with blue coloured water the filling process was done by suctioning through pipe 2 fig 2 until the water begins to rise through the pipe at this time the disc infiltrometer was ready to be placed on the soil surface to improve the water level measures the reservoir wall should be clean after each use a task that can be simply done with a wet rag as described by perroux and white 1988 a thin contact sand layer was placed between the disc base and the soil surface the sand was levelled using a methacrylate tube closed at the bottom with the same diameter and height as the infiltrometer the orientation of the sand surface was adjusted using a horizontal bubble level fixed on the top of the leveller fig 1 excess sand outside the leveller base was then removed the smartphone installed upside down on the tripod was then manually placed in front of the leveller at a distance of approximately 10 cm to focus the image and adjust the camera distance and angle so the whole reservoir was visible on the screen and the measuring tape was centred on the image fig 3 after starting the video recording the leveller was replaced by the disc infiltrometer filled with water fig 1 oriented so that the tape measure resulted centred on the image the time at which infiltration commenced 2 2 laboratory calibration the accuracy and precision of the new design were evaluated in the laboratory where two sets of experiments were performed the first consisted of comparing the water levels measured at static conditions with the camera ca with those obtained with a pressure transducer pt and visually v stair shaped water level drop curves were constructed where each step corresponded to each cm on the measuring tape to check the influence of the camera position on the water level measurements this experiment was repeated twice where the camera was placed at different heights relative to the infiltrometer a 35 cm pressure transducer pt microswitch honeywell international inc previously calibrated was employed the pt connected to a data logger cr1000 campbell scientist inc logan ut usa was installed in the disc infiltrometer according to casey and dervy 2002 the second calibration experiment consisted of comparing the continuous water level measurements ca and pt with v readings visual readings corresponded to the crossing of each cm on the tape measure the experiment consisted of an infiltration at 0 cm of pressure head on a wet cloth at the end of which the water was allowed to drain by gravity with a single replicate 2 3 field experiments the method was next tested under field conditions the experiments compared the cumulative infiltration curve measured with the ca and pt as in the laboratory calibration experiments a 35 cm pressure transducer pt connected to a data logger was installed in the disc infiltrometer four infiltrations were performed the first two were undertaken on a grass plot g1 and g2 with loam soils in the estaci√≥n experimental de aula dei csic zaragoza spain before infiltration measurements the grass was cut to the soil level two additional infiltrations were performed at two plots under conventional ct and no tillage treatment nt the experimental field on a nearly flat area slope 0 2 with loam soils corresponded to a long term conservation tillage experiment started in 1991 l√≥pez and arr√∫e 1995 the measurement under ct was performed on freshly tilled soil after copious rainfall soil dry bulk density œÅb was determined with the core method grossman and reinsch 2002 using cores of 50 mm in diameter and height this sampling was also used to determine the initial volumetric water content Œ∏i a thin layer 1 cm thickness of commercial sand 80 160 Œºm grain size was placed between the base disc and soil surface a zero cm pressure head was applied to the base disc at the end of the experiment and after removing the sand layer a saturated soil sample was taken under the base disc the Œ∏s was calculated as the product between saturated gravimetric water content and œÅb 2 4 soil hydraulic properties estimates the soil hydraulic properties were estimated using the latorre et al 2015 numerical procedure this consisted in minimising the objective function q which quantifies the difference between the modelled i 3 d s k s t and the experimental data ie3d 3 q s k i 1 n i e 3 d i 3 d s k s t i Œ¥ t 2 modelled 3d cumulative infiltrations were described with the quasi analytical haverkamp et al 1994 solution 4 2 k s k i 2 s 2 t

proportionality constant that accounts for the correction of the wetting front shape haverkamp et al 1994 the existence and the uniqueness of the solution are studied with q error maps generated for the s ks plane using a global optimisation pardalos and romeijn 2002 the response surfaces are calculated on a rectangular grid with ks from 0 001 to 0 1 mm s 1 s from 0 1 to 1 2 although for regular working conditions Œ≥ varies between 0 6 and 0 8 haverkamp et al 1994 and Œ≤ between 0 3 and 1 7 lassabatere et al 2009 constant values of Œ≥ and Œ≤ of 0 75 and 0 6 were respectively employed angulo jaramillo et al 2000 latorre et al 2015 more details of the global numerical optimisation can be found in latorre et al 2015 all calculations were done using the http swi csic es infiltration map website 3 results and discussion given that the physical mechanism of the infiltrometer is exactly the same as the original perroux and white 1988 design the proposed compact disc infiltrometer is valid for all kind of soils although this design could be used also to measure under negative pressure heads the low capacity of the water reservoir which does not allow measuring long enough cumulative infiltration curves to reach a steady state in successive tensions makes this prototype not suitable for multitension measurements on the other hand given that the automatic video analysis requires the infiltrometer to always be in the same position this design makes it impossible to refill the reservoir without moving the infiltrometer in addition in the case that there was enough volume of water to measure at several tensions moving the pipe of the bubbling tower would probably involve moving the infiltrometer which would hinder the video analysis this last limitation however could be solved by separating the bubbling tower from the infiltrometer body in conclusion the presented design which is motivated by the madsen and chandler 2007 unitension mini disc infiltrometer is not optimal for multitension measures and the main rule of the bubbling tower is to allow a more accurate definition of the saturated soil tension a robust fit was found between the water level measured with the ca on the laboratory stair shaped curve and the corresponding values obtained with v and pt fig 5 the significant relationship between v and ca y 1 006 0 014 r2 0 999 p 0 0001 and pt and ca measurements y 0 999x 0 035 r2 0 999 p 0 0001 indicates the ca method allowed satisfactory measurements of the water level under static conditions the strong correlation between v pt and ca readings when this last one was placed at different positions regarding to the infiltrometer y 1 006x 0 014 r2 0 999 y 1 0077x 0 128 r2 0 999 indicated the method is independent of the relative position of the camera this is a relevant result for field experiments since the irregularities of the soil surface make it difficult to use a constant position between the camera and disc infiltrometer a robust fit was also observed between the infiltration curve measured on the wet cloth with ca pt and v readings fig 6 the highly significant correlation between water levels recorded with ca and pt y 1 018x 0 009 r2 0 999 p 0 0001 and those obtained by comparing ca and v readings y 1 0105x 0 0196 r2 0 999 p 0 0001 indicates the smartphone also allowed accurate continuous estimate of the water level drop visual examination of the videos showed that the compartmentalised reservoir minimised the effect of bubbling on the water level measurements resulting in stable infiltration curves good fits were found between ca water level drop measurements and those obtained with pt in the infiltration field experiments fig 7 compared to the ca method pt produced finely saw shaped infiltration curves likely due to discontinuous changes of the pressure head produced by the intermittent bubbling inside the reservoir ≈°pongrov√° et al 2009 another explanation for these irregularities could be the possible effect of temperature on the pt measurements liu and higgins 2015 these irregularities were not observed with the ca method where water level drop measurements are independent of the water reservoir pressure head and external temperature regarding the precision of ca measurements the spatial resolution of the conducted videos was approximately 0 008 cm 1 2 10 4 psi per pixel in the water level positioning the analysis of the registered data from the pt revealed a similar effective precision of 0 009 cm 1 3 10 4 psi possibly determined by the resolution of the analogue to digital converter unit in the data logger the inverse analysis applied on the noisier pt infiltration curves resulted in q eq 3 values almost 30 higher than those found with ca table 1 which means that ca resulted in more stable and less noisy infiltration curves the similar ks and s values obtained with both methods table 1 indicate the ca method is a robust technique to examine soil hydraulic properties highly significant relationships with slopes close to one were obtained between s y 1 084x 0 014 r2 0 99 p 0 0001 and ks y 0 986x 0 0018 r2 0 94 p 0 0001 estimated from the infiltration curves measured with pt and the ca method respectively fig 8 4 conclusions this paper presents an alternative unitension disc infiltrometer design along with a new technique to measure the cumulative infiltration curve the new method consists of a compact 10 cm diameter and height disc infiltrometer where the water level is measured from the analysis of a video recorded with a smartphone camera both laboratory calibration and field infiltration experiments demonstrated the camera allows accurate estimates of water level for the proposed application of soil hydraulic characterization the compact disc infiltrometer is stable easy to manage under field conditions and allowed satisfactory estimates of the soil sorptivity and hydraulic conductivity the ubiquitous use of smartphones makes this technique accessible to practically all researchers the r script to analyse the videos was written specifically for this project and is distributed as open source software http swi csic es makes this technique easy to use and implement compared to other methods the water level measured using the smartphone camera is not affected by temperature a factor that can vary under field conditions such as on sunny days with alternating clouds manual visual inspection of the recorded videos also provides a means to check the validity of the water levels calculated by the automated video analysis the infiltrometer design and measurement technique presented in this paper is wireless compact portable relatively inexpensive valid for all kind of soils accurate and easy to manage in the field providing an important advance to the measurement of soil hydraulic properties on the other hand although it is well known that that disc infiltrometer can be employed for multitension measures the characteristics of this prototype with a low water reservoir capacity and bubbling tower attached to the infiltrometer body makes this design not suitable for multitension

propagation of light rays following geometrical optics is depicted in fig 4 where two optical effects must be considered first the water level and the measure tape are located in different planes separated by the infiltrometer wall this causes a variable shift on the apparent water level registered in the measure tape plane secondly the rays experiment an additional bending caused by the refraction of light as it passes from the methacrylate wall to the air with different refractive index the units of the vertical dimensions in fig 4 are presented in pixel units lowercase letters to emphasize that they are registered in the raw image coordinates but they can be converted to metric units capital letters using eq 1 or the opposite way from pixel units to metric units using the inverse transformation the calculus of the trigonometric functions will be derived for convenience in pixel units in order to first correct the water level as it is registered in the raw image

4384,storm drain inlet blockage causes more flooding incidents than does storm sewer overloading in flat urban catchments although inlet clearance has proved to be cost effective in mitigating pluvial flooding clearing all inlets in the wet season is unfeasible no study has sought to partition the role of storm drain inlets because the dynamic flow exchange at every inlet is impossible to monitor at a catchment scale and even hard to calculate this study presents a proactive approach to identifying strategic i e most influential inlets to save considerable labor costs in grate inlet maintenance our findings show that the tapered pareto distribution can describe the distribution of inlet interception rates almost invariant to rainfall types a modified pareto principle called the 70 25 rule is derived suggesting that 70 surface runoff is drained by the top 25 inlets a nested hydrodynamic model which solves full shallow water equations and captures detailed physical processes was built to compute surface runoff intercepted by grate inlets in the built environment the model is composed of a subcatchment scale 2d 1d dual drainage model embedded in a catchment scale 1d model the 2d 1d interaction was described by a piecewise function of piezometric head at the grate inlet the parameters in each subfunction were statistically derived from a series of 3d numerical experiments involving full processes from free surface flow to pressurized flow the 2d model was built on a sensitivity tested unstructured mesh with allowable triangle areas ranging from 0 15 to 6 m2 the simulations showed a mild ca 5 versus radical 40 50 reduction in runoff interception with the removal of the non strategic versus strategic inlets under non extreme rainfalls the application to the low lying ultra urban test case confirmed the robustness and effectiveness of the method for strategic inlets identification keywords urban pluvial flood dual drainage surface sewer interaction

reducing their hydraulic capacity ciccarello et al 2012 palla et al 2018 post et al 2017 rietveld et al 2020 inlet cleaning or blockage clearance is either inadequate or unfocused because the location and degree of inlet blockage remain by and large unpredictable g√≥mez et al 2013 leit√£o et al 2017 palla et al 2018 although clearing a small number of inlets needs limited laborers tools and time chen et al 2017 all inlet clearance turns out to be unfeasible in the wet season there is a growing consensus that far more flooding incidents are caused by inlet blockage in flat urban areas than by storm sewer overloading caradot et al 2011 cherqui et al 2015 post et al 2017 ten veldhuis et al 2011 inlet blockage may lead to local flooding before the internal capacity of a drainage system is exceeded leit√£o et al 2017 palla et al 2018 ten veldhuis et al 2011 for instance an investigation carried out in rotterdam shows that a pluvial flood occurs even when a rainfall event is approximately half of the sewer system capacity expressed in design storm bouwens et al 2018 fault probability inferences assisted with call data also suggest that inlet blockage in urban lowlands contributes to 70 80 of flood events post et al 2017 ten veldhuis et al 2011 or over 90 if the blockage in inlet connection pipes is included post et al 2017 another example in portland indicates that 66 of citizen reported flooding events are attributable to blocked inlets among which 74 are due to insufficient inlet maintenance michelson and chang 2019 as such inlet management shall be prioritized over sewer management in flat areas to improve the overall performance of drainage system inlet systems in flat areas are more fragile than in hilly areas because therein an inlet s contributing area is subject to abrasion re pavement or re landscaping in very flat areas such as lowlands streets longitudinal slopes are tiny or even lower than engineering recommendations the runoff approaching and intercepted by an inlet at such a slight gradient is uncertain to meet the minimum gradient requirements e g 0 3 engineers would design a rolling gutter profile brown et al 2009 such practices however would increase the malposition of inlets deviated from the local low points and conversely worsen the localized ponding even properly constructed the rolling gutter profile along with the transverse slope makes the flow approaching to the grate inlet more complex than any experiment ever reported although preventing inlets from blockage has demonstrated to be the most efficient way to reduce flood risk ten veldhuis et al 2011 inlet blockage seems randomly distributed and uncorrelated with its terrain gradient and position g√≥mez et al 2013 the unknown pattern of inlet blockage occasionally results in more local flooding by frequent rainfalls than by less frequent ones leit√£o et al 2017 aside from local flooding inlet blockage induces bypass runoff and exerts a transferring effect on downstream inlets despotovic et al 2005 this downstream flooding would make the reactive approaches that rely on the inlets flooded before target the wrong ones or omit some severely blocked ones while the reactive data driven approaches can partially help identify pluvial flooding causes and act on flood risk management these actions rely on a corrective basis of citizen reporting accumulation moreover citizen reporting is incomplete or bias in that some flooding incidents may not be reported or subjectively judged arthur et al 2009 caradot et al 2011 post et al 2017 ten veldhuis et al 2011 only when the flooding incidents are typical could data driven approaches suffice in identifying the causes and supply effective strategies alternatively we seek a proactive approach to inlet inspection by identifying the most influential inlets in advance such a proactive strategy for inlets has never been reported but a somewhat similar policy for sewers in the uk can date back to the 1980s this policy suggested proactively performing a periodic inspection to critical sewers and doing non periodic maintenance in hindsight to non critical sewers the critical sewers comprising 20 of sewer pipes on average were defined by those among the highest cost to be repaired from collapse rather than those most critical to system failure however decades of practice revealed that non critical sewers by definition could also be critical to system failure for only around 30 of critical sewers were in poor structural conditions for this reason the uk has decided to improve its original strategy after the year 2000 at least to be more proactive in maintaining the non critical sewers fenner 2000 fenner and sweeting 1999 the uk s experience from the other side implies a need to spot truly critical assets critical components should be identified according to the role they play in the system as yet however proactive sewer asset management strategies are mainly based on the inspectors intuition and tacit knowledge tscheikner gratl et al 2020 van riel et al 2016 to address this problem here we propose a method to identify critical inlets according to their runoff interception weights the quantification is built on a hybrid hydrodynamic model composed of a two and one dimensional 2d 1d dual drainage model embedded in a catchment scale sewer model the dual drainage model considers an integrated system comprising the surface and subsurface drainage components to convey stormwater see smith 2006 for the concept and early attempts the subsurface system is designed to drain the runoff from a non extreme for example 1 to 5 year storm without surcharge while the surface drainage needs to accommodate exceedance flows when the sewer system exceeds its design capacity in this study the overland flow model adopts a fully dynamic approach which is proved necessary to capture the complex flow patterns costabile et al 2020 influenced by buildings and structures e g steps fences and raised beds apart from the detailed representation of overland flows the representation of 2d 1d coupling via inlets is paramount to this study as well as is acknowledged by several other researchers even in a simplified e g diffusive wave model e g chang et al 2018 that said gully flows are too complex to be approximated by shallow water equations lopes et al 2017 and the transition from weir to orifice flow through a grate inlet is a continuously varying mixture flow guo et al 2009 without readily available equations as such we employed computational fluid dynamic cfd modeling as a virtual experiment djordjeviƒá et al 2013 g√≥mez et al 2016 to formulate the bidirectional interaction at grate inlets armed with such a physically based 2d 1d model we attempt to find an invariant relation from the grate inlet interception distributions under various rainfalls in flat areas this invariant is expected to be an identifier of the critical and non critical inlets regardless of rainfall types ideally these critical inlets cover a relatively small percentage of inlets but intercept most urban runoff periodically inspecting critical inlets before wet seasons coincides with the idea of strategic management thereby we term these inlets as strategic i e most influential inlets this paper will answer the following questions first in what sense that the strategic inlets are understood and precisely how can we define them second how are they distributed by interception and by location under various types of rainfalls third why are they deemed to be strategic and how does a drainage system perform without them or with only of them the remainder of the paper first introduces a fully coupled 2d 1d hydrodynamic model applicable to urban catchments to calculate exchanges between surface and subsurface flows via grate inlets it then presents a method to define strategic inlets and an idea to test these inlets consistency and effectiveness under extreme and non extreme rainfalls next the method is illustrated in central tanggu a low lying urban catchment prone to nuisance flooding finally the paper recaps the overall result discusses the validity of the approach and summarizes future improvements 2 methods to accurately represent the existing surface of catchment we reconstructed the ground surface via airborne light detection and ranging lidar terrain data along with 1 500 digital line graph dlg these data were both amended by on site inspection the dlg contains the features of manholes and grate

a prescribed design storm e g a 2 year storm event in this paper without surcharging above the pipe soffit butler et al 2018 water uk 2018 the redesign adopted standard practice for flat areas complying with or at least not violating several drainage design standards e g en 752 bsi 2018 mohud 2016 water uk 2018 van luijtelaar 1999 redesigning the sewer network is partly because combined sewer systems are common practice in old urban areas wherein the sewer information such as conduit size and elevation is often incomplete or unavailable aronica and lanza 2005 moreover modeling with a properly redesigned sewer network can narrow down the causes of local flooding 2 1 hydrodynamic modeling we constructed a set of hydrodynamic models to simulate urban flooding in a low lying catchment these numerical models consist of three parts a a coarse catchment scale 1d sewer system model b a fine scale 2d 1d dual drainage model embedded in the catchment scale model and c a three dimensional 3d grate inlet system model for computing the interactions between the surface and subsurface flows via grate inlets among these the 2d 1d model lies at the core of the model structure fig 1 both the 1d and 2d 1d models adopted the fully dynamic approach coupled and built in infoworks icm integrated catchment modelling and the 3d modeling was performed in openfoam open source cfd the time step of the coupled 1d and 2d 1d models was fixed to 5 seconds while the 3d model was adaptive from 10 3 to 10 4 seconds 2 1 1 1d model we first built a two scale 1d sewer model within the 2d domain all inlets lateral connections and sewers were included outside it only sewers under the major and secondary streets were simulated when modeling the finer scale 2d domain we partitioned it into subcatchments with a series of simple unweighted attributes as done in krebs et al 2013 each subcatchment contained one land cover type with distinct properties e g 100 or nil imperviousness with a uniform slope specifically pavements were subdivided by yard walls and roofs by inlets if conveyed by internal drains or downspouts otherwise although such partitioning was aimed at reducing the ambiguity in subcatchment parameterization to identify a contributing area is never straightforward as flow paths in flat areas are virtually unpredictable for this reason we employed a high resolution 2d model to simulate each mesh cell s peak flow direction and delineate the subcatchments according to the peak flow directions under a given intense storm we then aggregated all flow directions to eight directions and merged the abutting subcatchments with the same landcover contributing to the same inlets this way enabled us to largely disambiguate an inlet s contributing area and improve the accuracy in sizing the sewer network conduits thereby we were able to route runoff to the inlet within the subcatchment or to an immediately downstream one if the subcatchment in question contains no inlet next when modeling the coarser scale remaining catchment we divided the streets into segments and blocks into subcatchments by walls between property units normally the runoff from subcatchments was routed to the nearby manholes yet for those containing elevated green areas i e raised beds the runoff was internally routed from the pervious sub area to the impervious sub area of the subcatchment huber 2001 raised beds are used when soil is too sandy compacted saline or alkaline for plants to grow well in this model all conduits were initially empty conduit outfalls were initially open to the atmosphere during the conduit sizing i e the redesign and modeled by fixed flow pump stations afterwards the ratio of hydraulic gradient to conduit slope was used to size a sewer conduit if any conduit whose hydraulic conduit gradient ratio is over or well below one e g less than 0 6 we would resize it and perform re modeling we repeated the process until all conduits were moderately or slightly lower than their full capacity under a given design storm 2 1 2 2d model we then constructed a high resolution 2d rainfall runoff model in this model we generated 2d mesh via schewchuk s triangle shewchuk 2005 to represent the complex micro topographies with tiny projections and depressions schubert et al 2008 edges of buildings or structures e g curbs steps raised beds as well as street centerlines were retained as breaklines for accurate representation to attain a robust model result while balancing the accuracy and computational cost we tested the mesh sensitivity to the bounds of maximum cell size and the minimum cell angle normally each subdomain was expected to be spanned by a minimum of two cells the cell size being tested was based on the length distribution of the edges of and the gaps between buildings or structures the mode of the length distribution was used to represent the mesh resolution by which the maximum allowable cell size was defined in this paper the maximum cell size was set to the mesh resolution multiplying a fourth of square root of three for simplicity the cell size for testing was rounded to an integer then reduced or increased by 1 0 m2 to form a set of maximum cell sizes likewise the minimum allowable cell size for computing accorded to the smallest length in the distribution below which undesirably small triangles were merged for a given cell size we investigated the effects of an array of minimum cell angles drawing upon a series of delaunay refinement algorithms most minimum cell angles in the array have been proved refined or recast by shewchuk 2002 including in ascending order a 20 7 after ruppert s algorithm ruppert 1995 b 26 5 after chew s second algorithm chew 1993 chew 1993 c 28 6 a refinement of b built on miller et al s work miller et al 2003 d 30 from chew s first algorithm chew 1989 and e 34 an upper bound from triangle shewchuk 2005 additionally we interpolated a few more values in the array such as 22 6 24 5 25 5 and 32 to find the most possible bound for the minimum cell angle this 2d model considers three basic types of mesh boundaries including a the internal boundary the solid wall that prevents runoff from entering or leaving the 2d polygon across the boundary line b the external boundary the free discharge that allows runoff to leave the 2d polygon with velocity continuity at the boundary line and c the external boundary the critical at which the flow is calculated via a broad crested weir equation if the level in the boundary element of the 2d polygon is above the boundary face level otherwise is treated as a solid wall the second and third boundaries normally apply to the rare and frequent storms respectively to include the case that runoff flows over the curb we extended the boundary lines to the building edges at the downstream blocks buildings were extracted and generated as holes in triangulation schubert and sanders 2012 schubert et al 2008 such treatment however omits roof runoff drained to the ground unlike most 2d models that ignore external drainage i e non directly connected roof runoff our model adds it back and regards it as a point source inflow boundary at the roof s downspout additionally doorsteps and free fall drainage roofs were treated as mesh level zones 2 1 3 2d 1d interaction the interaction between the 2d overland flow and 1d sewer flow was represented by the relationship between piezometric head combining pressure head with elevation head and discharge at the grate inlet we derived a piecewise function describing the head discharge relation under both interception and surcharge conditions by analyzing a series of 3d numerical experiments of the overland and sewer flow exchanges the 3d incompressible volume of fluid vof method see appendix a for the governing equations was used to describe the air water two phase flow at the grate inlet to simulate the inlet under surcharge conditions we imposed a pressure head on the pipe s outlet while assigning an inflow to the pipe s inlet a series of simulated pairs of piezometric heads h and discharges q 2d1d were fit to a scaling relation such that q 2 d 1 d h Œ± h Œ≤ g√≥mez and russo 2005 palla et al 2018 in which factor Œ± was supposed to be proportional to the through area of a grate and exponent Œ≤ to be interaction coefficient given an inflow discharged at the street boundary q 2d1d was sampled at its stabilized stage of the 3d model outputs and was averaged out by three values at the inlet s upstream intermediate and downstream for all conditions the head discharge relation reads 1 q 2 d 1 d h Œ± s h Œ≤ s h 0 Œ± i h Œ≤ i 0 h h c Œ± i h c Œ≤ i h h c in equation 1 the subscripts i and s of parameters Œ± and Œ≤ denote the interception and surcharge respectively h c denotes the piezometric head corresponding to the interception capacity of grate inlet here the third stage when the inlet approaches its capacity is approximated to a constant yet an extension to a subfunction is straightforward in the 2d domain the 2d and 1d models are coupled at nodes each node s piezometric head h between the manhole and mesh cell containing the inlet is computed under three circumstances first h is positive and equivalent to the elevation head of the mesh cell second h is non negative as the pressure head at the manhole does not exceed the elevation head of the mesh cell water level third h is negative as the pressure head at the manhole exceeds the elevation head of the mesh cell water level meanwhile the model considers all water approaching the mesh cell that contains the inlet otherwise each cell in a high resolution 2d model will yield far less runoff than the discharge corresponding to the piezometric head see fig s1 s3 for the calibration and validation of 2d 1d interactions under laboratory conditions 2 2 defining extreme and non extreme rainfalls extreme or non extreme rainfalls can be understood in two ways one way is merely from rainfall frequency analysis and represented by the n th percentile of a cumulative distribution function for all daily rainfalls over a long period in this way the split between the extreme and non extreme events can be defined by a threshold such as the 95th or 99th percentile nonetheless even rainfalls over the 99th percentile are deemed frequent in the other way that pertains to the exceedance of a drainage system capacity balmforth et al 2006 koks et al 2012 this capacity is represented by the exceedance of a probability in annual maximum rainfall distribution several practices adopted 0 1 annual maxima probability i e 10 year recurrence as a split between the frequent and rare events for example the 10 year recurrence was used to define the design capacity of the minor system in hec 22 brown et al 2009 the limited inconvenience flooding on street van luijtelaar 2006 the nuisance flood ball et al 2019 and the threshold of non extreme runoff fennessey and miller 2001 by definition non extreme events are more frequent than the 10 year recurrence wang 2017 in this paper we included three non extreme rainfalls and one marginally extreme rainfall i e 10 year storm 2 3 identifying strategic inlets predicting an inlet intercepting capacity in actual cases can be complicated because the interactions between the upstream and downstream inlets remain poorly understood the surface flow drains partly into the inlet while the bypassing flow merges with other flows and may further be intercepted by downstream inlets even the water intercepted at this moment will escape back to the surface at another moment if it reaches the pressurized part of a sewer system it would be vain to attain a stable intercepted flow of a single inlet but the cumulative intercepted volume distribution for all inlets over a rainfall event is expected to be robust in light of this we computed each inlet s cumulative intercepted volume by summing the flood from 2d 1d interaction and flood onto overflow the 2d domain over a rainfall event thereby we define the strategic inlets for the first time by spotting out the most effective inlets specifically they are defined by those high ranking inlets sorted by the cumulative intercepted volume invariant to the pattern magnitude and frequency of rainfalls since the histogram of inlets cumulative intercepted volume exhibits a reverse j shape containing a long tail without a mode one can presume the intercepted volume x x x obeys the generalized pareto distribution gpd whose cumulative distribution function cdf is defined by castillo and hadi 1997 2 f x Œæ 0 œÉ Œº 1 1 Œæ x Œº œÉ 1 Œæ where Œæ œÉ œÉ 0 and Œº Œº r are shape scale and location parameters respectively when Œæ 0 x Œº Œº œÉ Œæ when Œæ 0 x Œº for the special case when Œæ 0 the gpd reduces to the exponential distribution f x œÉ Œº 1 exp x Œº œÉ the probability density function pdf for equation 2 corresponds to 3 f x Œæ 0 œÉ Œº œÉ 1 1 Œæ x Œº œÉ 1 1 Œæ with a faster decaying tail than the pareto distribution gpd has finite moments when Œæ 1 2 1 2 which is desirable for describing a bounded quantity schoenberg and patel 2012 such as inlet interactions since an inlet s intercepted volume is non negative i e x 0 one can consider a left truncated distribution f in a closed form 4 f x 0 Œæ œÉ Œº 1 1 Œæ x max 0 Œº œÉ Œæ max 0 Œº Œº 1 Œæ for Œæ 0 we then normalized the inlet s intercepted volume to a dimensionless quantity such as contributed interception rate and calculated the contribution rate distribution with x 0 1 we hypothesized that the contribution rate distributions obeyed the gpd for all with nearly identical parameters that is approximately invariant to rainfall types if true one can find an average distribution among these distributions in fitting the gpd to both datasets i e intercepted volumes and contribution rates we adopted the maximum likelihood method to estimate the distribution parameters the maximum likelihood asymptotic solutions for gpd are proved valid for Œæ 1 2 smith 1984 and are shown to be satisfactory when a sample size reaches 100 hosking and wallis 1987 although a larger sample size e g over 500 is preferred the fitted gpds were tested by statistics of cram√©r von mises and kolmogorov smirnov next we generated n inlets contribution rates from the averaged distribution and deduced a law of inlets contribution a relationship between the percentage of contributed inlets and percentile of intercepted volume theoretically the strategic inlets are defined by the k th percentile of interception in other words the strategic ratio e g 25 5 is set by a probability cumulated to k per cent e g 70 80 although the k th percentile of interception is anticipated to be stable under various rainfalls these theoretically defined strategic inlets will slightly vary in spatial distribution with respect to storm patterns for this reason one may adopt the union of the calculated strategic inlets across a variety of rainfalls for inlets management on the safe side or opt for the intersection to reduce labor costs 2 4 testing the consistency and effectiveness of strategic inlets we first looked at how consistently strategic inlets were distributed in the 2d domain under the extreme and non extreme rainfalls the consistency can be measured by a ratio of the number of calculated strategic inlets to that of the union of the inlets involved in all rainfalls that is the more the ratio approaches one the more stable the strategic inlets are spatially distributed we then examined the effects of strategic inlets on urban flooding by removing the strategic and the remaining non strategic inlets under surcharge and non surcharge conditions for the surcharge conditions we considered three measures including the depth duration and extent to illustrate the risk of inundation each threshold of which was targeted to the degree of nuisance flooding in low lying urban catchments while the non strategic inlets play an insignificant role with the presence of the strategic inlets some non strategic inlets for example those sitting close to the removed strategic inlets will compensate the loss of the removal and become high intercepting inlets for this reason one may derive the second level strategic inlets from the non strategic inlets in the first level using the same procedure meanwhile we tested the robustness of the presumed distribution by examining the consistency in the distribution parameters before and after removing the strategic inlets i e part of inlets concerning management costs we were inclined to adopt the intersection of the inlets involved across rainfalls as candidates of the second level strategic inlets further we excluded the inlets with negative interactions i e surcharge over interception among the candidates when sewer pipes are exceeded their design capacity under an extreme rainfall as such we regarded the remaining better performance candidates as the second level strategic inlets 3 data and parameters the study area is a typical low lying urban catchment prone to nuisance flooding it covers an area of 293 hm2 in central tanggu tianjin lying at the left bank of downstream hai river and 11 km upstream of the tidal barrier fig 2 a 3 1 topography and land covers the lidar data were detected and filtered in 2010 with a horizontal resolution at 1 0 m and vertical accuracy less than 0 15 m root mean square errors rmse as shown in the digital elevation model dem extracted from the lidar data the catchment descends southward fig 2b with a mean longitudinal slope of all streets no more than 0 05 the major streets form an orthogonal pattern among which a central thoroughfare runs from the north boundary until the north end of the riverside park the mean directional slope of the gutters on the major streets perpendicular to the river from north to south is 0 015 and parallel to the river from west to east is 0 093 gutter profiles are shown to be rolling hence the mean absolute longitudinal slope of gutters achieved 0 34 pump stations become necessary in such a low lying catchment because the sewer outlets are below the mean surface level there are two pump stations with each capacity of 5 m3 s one pump station lies at the southeast of the park and another about 800 m away to the east the 2d domain covering 6 71 hm2 is embedded in the catchment and bordered by the north south and east west thoroughfares on the west and south fig 2c slightly descending from the northwest to the southeast the mean slopes of the streets surrounding the 2d domain are 1 2 for transverse sections and 0 13 for longitudinal gradients the land covers within the 2d domain are mostly i e 83 impervious including 31 3 streets 10 3 alleys 23 5 pavements and 30 2 buildings 3 2 rainfalls and evaporation we adopted two design storms 2 and 10 year and two actual rainfalls flash and moderate to represent various rainfall types fig 3 a the flash lasted for an hour with high intensity while the moderate lasted for 15 hours with low intensity we plotted the hyetographs of the two design storms with a 3 hour duration and 5 minute intervals according to a local rainfall design guide ren et al 2012 tucc 2016 the total depths of the 2 and 10 year design storms amounted to 72 4 mm and 100 5 mm respectively and the peak intensities were 50 6 mm h and 76 8 mm h in this paper we let the design storms start at 10 00 and end at 13 00 the flash totaling 28 7 mm and gauged at 1 minute resolution started at 10 47 rained heavily for 20 minutes till 11 07 and ended at 11 48 on july 23 2015 the moderate totaling 64 5 mm and gauged at 5 minute resolution started from 23 20 on july 4 and ended at 14 10 on july 5 2008 fig 3b and fig 3c show a series of rainfall maxima curves plotted by the intensity duration frequency idf formula for this area these curves were used to benchmark the frequency and magnitude of actual rainfall events both idf and ddf depth duration frequency curves indicate that the flash approaches the annual exceedance probability of 0 9999 while the moderate happens more frequently than annually for each simulation we let it start as the rainfall started and let it run for nine hours after the rainfall stopped and the time step was fixed to 5 seconds for comparison we applied the same evaporation data a 24 hour hourly time series to all simulations whereas the water intercepted by transpiration and plants were ignored in this study 3 3 infiltration model parameterization the horton equation proved to be fit for the infiltration process on a vegetative surface shao and baumgartl 2014 was adopted to simulate the runoff on green areas since the original horton equation ignores the process when rainfall intensity i mm is lower than the infiltration capacity before ponding time t p smith 1972 the horton equation is rewritten as 5 f t i t t p f c f 0 f c exp k t t 0 t t p here f 0 and f c denote initial and final infiltration rates mm h k is an infiltration decay coefficient 1 h t 0 is the time shifted from the classical horton infiltration curve and t 0 t p these parameters were all estimated by fitting the equation 5 to a set of measured infiltration rates in a local field experiment by yang et al 2011 this experiment was performed on a 95 vegetative 1 m 1 m plot under a steady rainfall intensity of 60 mm h for an hour accordingly we parameterized the equation 5 as f 0 72 875 mm h f c 5 996 mm h k 2 466 t 0 0 01 h and t p 0 097 h fig 4 the overall fitting was satisfactory with the goodness of fit tests being rmse 3 949 and r 2 0 969 3 4 conduits inlets and roof drains the 1d model for the 2d domain comprised 168 manholes 163 inlets and 198 subcatchments for the remaining catchment the model included 363 manholes and 420 subcatchments the conduits in the catchment and the 2d domain totaled 23 5 km and 4175 m in length the conduits sizes accorded to those in practice and were assigned to 400 to 2000 mm in diameter we let the conduit slope conform to the surface slope as much as possible ranging from 0 05 to 0 35 mostly 0 05 0 10 or 0 15 the diameter and slope for lateral connections were fixed to 200 mm and 1 all inlets in the 2d domain are grate inlets including a 52 large iron grates each sized 0 90 m 0 60 m with a through area of 0 278 m2 b 42 medium concrete grates each sized 0 75 m 0 45 m with a through area of 0 072 m2 and c 72 small concrete grates each sized 0 50 m 0 30 m with a through area of 0 024 m2 all large inlets sit at the street gutters three of which are double inlets sized twice the large one medium inlets are mainly placed on the allies while small ones sit between the residential buildings or on the pavements the buildings are composed of over a dozen of multistory dwellings a theatre and a residential complex the complex tenants access their homes from the roof of the first floor occupied by commercial uses the theatre and complex roofs are partly installed internal drainage which drains the runoff directly to the sewer system the remaining buildings occupying approximately two thirds of the total roof area contain 179 external roof downspouts each external roof drain covering 67 8 m2 roof area on average was assigned as a point source compensated to the 2d domain fig 5 4 results 4 1 mesh sensitivity test we used the flash rainfall to test the runoff sensitivity to the resolution and angle of the triangulation usinging the bound of minimum cell angle to 26 5 we first evaluated the impact of cell size according to the length distributions of object edges and gaps based on a planar straight line graph i e a planar graph connected by straight line segments at its vertices see shewchuk 2002 the highest frequency edges fell in 1 m 1 5 m and the highest and second highest frequency gaps fell in 5 35 m 5 67 m and 0 0 35 m the upper bound of cell size was set to 4 5 6 7 8 9 or 10 m2 paired with a fixed lower bound of 0 15 m2 the tests indicated that the inlet intercepted volume varied slightly with a gradual increase in cell count when the cell size upper bound ranged from 5 to 8 m2 fig s4a fixing the maximum allowable cell size to 5 m2 we then tested the influence of minimum allowable cell angle with nine values ranging from 20 7 to 34 0 the choice of each value according to subsection 2 1 2 the tests showed that the inlet intercepted volume fluctuated with a sharp increase in cell count when the bound of minimum cell angle was larger than 28 6 fig s4b the 2d model showed insensitivity to mesh resolution when the maximum allowable cell size fell in 5 m2 8 m2 regardless of the minimum allowable cell angle varying from 20 7 to 28 6 consequently we assigned the maximum allowable cell size to 6 m2 and the minimum allowable cell angle to 25 and generated a mesh containing 23 576 cells with an average cell size of 2 1 m2 4 2 the head discharge relation and 2d 1d interaction the 3d model included a half street bounded by a ridge and one side curb a street inlet the large inlet in this paper a lateral connection a manhole and a sewer pipe the half street was 5 9 m in length and 5 5 m in width with a longitude slope of 0 167 and a transverse slope of 1 5 the inlet comprising a 5 cm thick grate and 1 m deep chamber was placed on the street gutter s midpoint the lateral connection and the sewer pipe were measured 200 mm and 300 mm in diameter the depth and diameter of the manhole were 2 1 m and 1 0 m when modeling under non surcharge conditions we removed the manhole and sewer pipe to reduce computational cost the street inflows approaching the inlets were given 16 values from 2 0 to 181 5 l s among which 151 27 l s and 181 5 l s were the largest two values the intercepted flows remained nearly unchanged even when the inflow increased from 151 27 to 181 5 l s suggesting that the inlet interception approached its capacity when modeling under surcharge conditions we included the manhole and sewer pipe and considered 22 combinations of street inflows sewer inflows and pressure heads at the sewer outlet ranging from 0 0 m to 2 8 m in fig 6 we presented the results obtained from 3d modeling in hollow dots see fig a2 for validation of head discharge relation and plotted the head discharge curve by fitting equation 1 to the modeled results the overall fittings were nearly perfect i e r 2 0 9952 and rmse 0 7721 for 0 h h c r 2 0 9998 and rmse 0 8062 for h 0 and the head discharge relation parameters for the three inlet types were summarized in table 1 in which when h c 4 9 cm the large medium and small inlets reached their interception capacity at 31 11 l s 8 24 l s and 2 75 l s respectively to illustrate how the head discharge relations worked on the large medium and small inlets in the modeling we arbitrarily chose three inlets and showed their flow exchanges under two design storms under the 2 year design storm these three inlets intercepted runoff all the time among which the medium inlet no 20 approached its capacity and remained the stage for about 1 5 hours see the dashed line in fig 7 a under the 10 year design storm the three inlets reached their intercepting capabilities albeit asynchronously and then surcharged fig 7b 4 3 inlet interception distributions by volume fraction and location the gpd offers an adequate fit to all intercepted volume distributions under the four distinct rainfalls fig 8 a that is no hypothesis was rejected according to the goodness of fit tests of cram√©r von mises and kolmogorov smirnov at a significant level of 5 as expected the distribution s shape parameters Œæ fall within 0 1 2 ranging from 0 29 under the 10 year design storm to 0 49 under the flash rainfall table 2 a the range of Œæ suggests that a the moments of these gpds exist b the parameter estimates are reliable and c the biases of the maximum likelihood estimator are relatively small hosking and wallis 1987 despite variations among intercepted volumes the ranking of inlet s contribution was generally stable spearman œÅ 0 845 0 965 under various rainfalls see table s1 for the correlation matrix of inlet contribution ranks the contribution rate distributions under four rainfalls were almost identical marginally affected by the pattern magnitude and frequency of the rainfalls fig 8b since the variations among the four distributions can be negligible we simply averaged the distribution parameters to deduce a representative distribution for inlet contribution rates and thus scaled it up to an urban catchment scale supposing an urban catchment contains 5000 inlets we randomly generated 5000 contribution rates from the representative distribution in 0 100 and repeated the generation for ten runs for each run we derived a relationship between the fraction of inlets and the cumulative contribution rate by re fitting equation 3 to the generated data each fitting echoes a tapered pareto law shown as a 70 25 rule in the sense that the top 25 inlets intercept over 70 i e 72 runoff or conversely the 70th percentile of runoff interception involves 24 3 inlets fig 9 we also investigated the effect of inlet types on the shape of gpd we compared the contribution rate distribution under a virtual case with identical inlets and that under actual cases with three inlet types the comparisons under all four rainfalls demonstrated that the distribution curves became more tapered off with reduced upper tails when the medium and small inlets were replaced by the large ones this was even more evident under an intensive rainfall like the flash rainfall therefore the diversity of inlet types also contributes to the underlying distribution ignoring inlet types in urban flood modeling will be biased toward the less important ones while the strategic inlets can be mathematically defined by the upper quartile of inlets 41 163 the union of inlets distributed in the 2d domain across the four rainfalls involved 53 inlets among them three inlets no 1 no 113 and no 125 performed unstably no 113 fell in the lower quartile under the moderate rainfall no 1 and no 125 fell outside the upper quartile under the three non extreme rainfalls therefore we dropped these three inlets and included the remaining 50 inlets as strategic inlets despite the unstable performance of the three inlets the ratio of the strategic inlets mathematically defined to that of the union of the inlets spatially distributed across the four rainfalls was 0 77 41 53 indicating that the strategic inlets are generally stable in spatial distribution fig 10 and see fig s5 for the workflow we also divided the 2d domain into four quadrants to characterize the location of strategic inlets quadrants i and iv represented the upstream and downstream parts quadrants ii and iii represented the midstream parts for any rainfall event each quadrant contained no less than 8 strategic inlets 8 41 suggesting the evenness of their distribution quadrant i contained more strategic inlets than any other quadrants ranging from 11 flash to 16 moderate across four rainfalls quadrant i contained the most 16 while quadrant iv the least 10 among the 50 first level strategic inlets see fig s6 these results demonstrated that despite their locations at the upstream or downstream the strategic inlets were fairly evenly distributed 4 4 consistency in the fitted probability distributions the simulation confirmed that the compensation effect did occur in case of the strategic inlets being sealed the remaining inlets intercepted a larger proportion of runoff with the removal of the strategic inlets than they did with all inlets i e 54 7 versus 26 5 the top two compensatory inlets no 90 and no 1 even intercepted more runoff than their counterparts e g no 146 and no 43 in the moderate rainfall and no 41 and no 43 in the 2 year design storm considering the compensation effect we derived the second level contribution rate distribution from the remaining inlets with the strategic inlets being sealed as revealed in the statistical tests the contribution rate distribution for the sample excluding the strategic inlets also obeys the truncated gpd table 2b moreover the parameter values of the averaged second level contribution rate distribution across the three non extreme rainfalls were close to those of the first level distribution averaged by the four rainfalls such consistency in the first and second level distributions suggests that the gpd can be a robust model to describe the general behavior of grate inlet interception in flat areas using the same method described before we derived the relationship between a fraction of inlets and a cumulative interception again the top 25 remaining inlets intercepted over 70 73 of runoff or conversely the 70th percentile of interception involves 22 7 inlets we adopted the intersection 21 inlets of the 22 7 inlets across the three non extreme rainfalls as candidates of the second level strategic inlets when including the 10 year design storm we excluded three inlets that spilled more than intercepted with negative interactions and specified 18 second level strategic inlets among these 18 inlets the top five sat on the streets intercepting the runoff initially intercepted by the adjacent or upstream strategic inlets this explained why inlets no 90 and no 1 located at the corner of a street intersecting another street or alley were the top two compensatory inlets apart from the five street inlets the remaining second level strategic inlets were located on the allies to the up and midstream of the block see fig s6 4 5 effectiveness of strategic inlets we first investigated the effectiveness of the strategic inlets by simulating the cases of either the strategic or non strategic inlets being sealed under the three non extreme rainfalls the simulation showed a mild reduction mean 4 8 see table 3 and fig 11 in runoff interception with the removal of 113 non strategic inlets by contrast sealing the strategic inlets resulted in a radical reduction in runoff interception mean 45 2 and an increase by five to six times of surface water transfer to the downstream next we investigated the performance of strategic inlets under the surcharge condition with the 10 year design storm at first the severity of inundation was defined by depth and duration we considered two depth thresholds such as 0 05 m for tolerable ponding i e lower impact level in caradot et al 2011 and 0 10 m for flooding i e the upper bound of nuisance flooding in moftakhari et al 2018 and the threshold for the duration of inundation was set to one hour sealing part of inlets resulted in a shift of the ponding duration from less than to over two hours nevertheless this shift was more pronounced with the removal of the strategic inlets than that of the non strategic ones fig 12 and table s2 for example with all inlets a half of tolerable ponding area would be drained within two hours this proportion decreased from 2 5 with the removal of the non strategic inlets to less than 1 5 with the removal of the strategic ones as for the flooding for instance the increase in the area inundated for 3 4 hours with the non strategic inlets was nearly eight times of that with the strategic inlets we further assessed the severity of ponding and flooding by considering their extent sealing the strategic inlets exacerbated the gutter flooding immediately surrounding the points where the top intercepting and surcharging inlets were located see circles and crosses in fig 12a new flooding appeared on the upstream streets while the flooding duration on the downstream streets was prolonged a severe inundation emerged near the upstream inlet no 69 at which the ponding exceeded 100 m2 and the flooding reached 35 m2 on the downstream street the area ratio of ponding over three hours increased from the original 4 to 28 wherein a half retained for more than four hours the flooded areas over three hours increased from none to 18 82 of the 2 hour flooded areas extended the duration to three hours and 17 to four hours contrasted to the case without the strategic inlets sealing the non strategic inlets exerted a marginal effect on gutter flooding except for the one found at the rear of the residential complex because of the removal of a chain of small inlets 5 conclusions and discussion we have shown that the gpd with shape parameter Œæ ranging from 0 to 1 2 can robustly describe the behaviors of grate inlet interception in flat areas the distribution of inlet contribution rates fit by the gpd is almost invariant to the pattern magnitude and frequency of rainfall events that is there exists a stable relationship between the fraction of inlets and the cumulative probability of interception using this relationship one can define the strategic inlets by the upper quartile contributing to 70 of runoff interception the 70 25 rule holds even if a proportion of inlets are removed we also confirmed that most of the upper quartile inlets stayed at consistent locations spearman œÅ 0 845 0 965 under the four rainfalls spotting strategic inlets in the real world is however non trivial because they appeared dispersed and weakly correlated with elevations pearson r 0 4 either at the upstream or downstream since surface sewer interactions have only been experimented at a single street level and remained undocumented at a catchment scale mignot et al 2019 physically based models are the best suited approximation of reality salvadore et al 2015 in this study we built a full dynamic dual drainage model in which the 2d 1d interactions were represented by the head discharge relations derived from the 3d modeling including full processes from free surface flow to pressurized flow the 3d model is more reliable than those widely adopted simplified methods in minor flood inundation for example the weir orifice equations will give uncertain results for flooding depths from 0 01 to 0 30 m galambos 2012 a range relevant to flat areas while the inlet interception capacity captured by the 3d simulations is reflected in our head discharge piecewise function the gpd applies regardless of the upper bound of interception disregarding the upper bound tends to steepen the shape of the probability distribution thereby may overestimate the role of strategic inlets aside from the particular attention paid to the 2d 1d flow exchanges we have improved the precision and accuracy of the 2d surface flow model through several aspects first we tested the sensitivity of the triangulation to describe the microtopography with relevant details second we compensated for the lost roof runoff arising from the building hole method roofs may contribute to a considerable fraction of the drainage area ignoring the discharge from external downspouts will not only underestimate the surface runoff but also affect the routing pattern locally third we fit the shifted horton model to the results of a local field experiment and attained the model parameters although it exhibited only a small curve shifting in this study including the unsaturated infiltration state is necessary when pervious coverage is unneglectable unlike a reactive approach that responds to plugged inlets after being reported spotting strategic inlets is a proactive approach that enables drainage managers to focus on the most influential inlets clearance beforehand although the pattern of inlet blockage ratio remains little known insofar the approach and method we have presented can guide inlet clearance toward the strategic ones saving 1 2 with two levels of strategic inlets to 2 3 with the first level of labor costs while maintaining the overall drainage performance acceptably normally the first level strategic inlets need cleaning before the wet season cleaning the second level strategic inlets would be necessary whenever an extreme storm is forecast in this case strategic inlets clearance would involve the chambers lateral connections associated manholes and pipelines while strategic inlets are shown to be robust in the probability distribution their spatial distribution varies slightly as the rainfall intensity increases that is more inlets are deemed strategic at upstream whereas almost no downstream ones are affected one can tailor the current hydrodynamic model to a case specific model if the initial condition assumptions i e all pipes are empty no pipes or inlets are clogged are dropped and replaced by observed data given the model s initial conditions the present study can be immediately applicable to cases when storm drains and inlets are already inspected repaired and cleared before the wet season in addition the flooding survey in appendix b indicates that strategic inlets may imply flood hotspots the most vulnerable locations to flooding if a drainage system is left unmaintained and malfunctioned moreover the present work awaits several improvements future work would consider a chain of blocks as the 2d domain nested in the catchment scale 1d model and include more actual rainfall events to corroborate the 70 25 rule in this paper the stage approaching to the interception capacity was approximated to a constant yet extension to a subfunction is straightforward future efforts would extend this stage and refine the interception subfunction parameters affected by grate configuration admittedly for any catchment of interest the strategic inlets shall be checked and updated periodically with the changes in microtopography and sewer pipes such updates will not affect the model framework and the procedure rather the 2d or 1d model can be amended accordingly to estimate how frequently the model shall be updated a follow up study may examine the extent to which the initially defined strategic inlets can withstand years of surface deformation credit authorship contribution statement

4384,storm drain inlet blockage causes more flooding incidents than does storm sewer overloading in flat urban catchments although inlet clearance has proved to be cost effective in mitigating pluvial flooding clearing all inlets in the wet season is unfeasible no study has sought to partition the role of storm drain inlets because the dynamic flow exchange at every inlet is impossible to monitor at a catchment scale and even hard to calculate this study presents a proactive approach to identifying strategic i e most influential inlets to save considerable labor costs in grate inlet maintenance our findings show that the tapered pareto distribution can describe the distribution of inlet interception rates almost invariant to rainfall types a modified pareto principle called the 70 25 rule is derived suggesting that 70 surface runoff is drained by the top 25 inlets a nested hydrodynamic model which solves full shallow water equations and captures detailed physical processes was built to compute surface runoff intercepted by grate inlets in the built environment the model is composed of a subcatchment scale 2d 1d dual drainage model embedded in a catchment scale 1d model the 2d 1d interaction was described by a piecewise function of piezometric head at the grate inlet the parameters in each subfunction were statistically derived from a series of 3d numerical experiments involving full processes from free surface flow to pressurized flow the 2d model was built on a sensitivity tested unstructured mesh with allowable triangle areas ranging from 0 15 to 6 m2 the simulations showed a mild ca 5 versus radical 40 50 reduction in runoff interception with the removal of the non strategic versus strategic inlets under non extreme rainfalls the application to the low lying ultra urban test case confirmed the robustness and effectiveness of the method for strategic inlets identification keywords urban pluvial flood dual drainage surface sewer interaction grate inlet hydrodynamic modeling minor inundation 1 introduction storm drain inlets are pivotal interfaces between surface and subsurface drainage systems butler and memon 1999 leit√£o et al 2017 the runoff failing to be captured by inlets induces localized palla et al 2018 or downstream flooding despotovic et al 2005 apart from routing runoff inlets are used to trap debris and then alleviate sewer clogs and reduce pollution of receiving waters butler and karunaratne 1995 deletic 2000 post et al 2016 the trapped debris progressively accumulates at inlet grates or lateral connections hence reducing their hydraulic capacity ciccarello et al 2012 palla et al 2018 post et al 2017 rietveld et al 2020 inlet cleaning or blockage clearance is either inadequate or unfocused because the location and degree of inlet blockage remain by and large unpredictable g√≥mez et al 2013 leit√£o et al 2017 palla et al 2018 although clearing a small number of inlets needs limited laborers tools and time chen et al 2017 all inlet clearance turns out to be unfeasible in the wet season there is a growing consensus that far more flooding incidents are caused by inlet blockage in flat urban areas than by storm sewer overloading caradot et al 2011 cherqui et al 2015 post et al 2017 ten veldhuis et al 2011 inlet blockage may lead to local flooding before the internal capacity of a drainage system is exceeded leit√£o et al 2017 palla et al 2018 ten veldhuis et al 2011 for instance an investigation carried out in rotterdam shows that a pluvial flood occurs even when a rainfall event is approximately half of the sewer system capacity expressed in design storm bouwens et al 2018 fault probability inferences assisted with call data also suggest that inlet blockage in urban lowlands contributes to 70 80 of flood events post et al 2017 ten veldhuis et al 2011 or over 90 if the blockage in inlet connection pipes is included post et al 2017 another example in portland indicates that 66 of citizen reported flooding events are attributable to blocked inlets among which 74 are due to insufficient inlet maintenance michelson and chang 2019 as such inlet management shall be prioritized over sewer management in flat areas to improve the overall performance of drainage system inlet systems in flat areas are more fragile than in hilly areas because therein an inlet s contributing area is subject to abrasion re pavement or re landscaping in very flat areas such as lowlands streets longitudinal slopes are tiny or even lower than engineering recommendations the runoff approaching and intercepted by an inlet at such a slight gradient is uncertain to meet the minimum gradient requirements e g 0 3 engineers would design a rolling gutter profile brown et al 2009 such practices however would increase the malposition of inlets deviated from the local low points and conversely worsen the localized ponding even properly constructed the rolling gutter profile along with the transverse slope makes the flow approaching to the grate inlet more complex than any experiment ever reported although preventing inlets from blockage has demonstrated to be the most efficient way to reduce flood risk ten veldhuis et al 2011 inlet blockage seems randomly distributed and uncorrelated with its terrain gradient and position g√≥mez et al 2013 the unknown pattern of inlet blockage occasionally results in more local flooding by frequent rainfalls than by less frequent ones leit√£o et al 2017 aside from local flooding inlet blockage induces bypass runoff and exerts a transferring effect on downstream inlets despotovic et al 2005 this downstream flooding would make the reactive approaches that rely on the inlets flooded before target the wrong ones or omit some severely blocked ones while the reactive data driven approaches can partially help identify pluvial flooding causes and act on flood risk management these actions rely on a corrective basis of citizen reporting accumulation moreover citizen reporting is incomplete or bias in that some flooding incidents may not be reported or subjectively judged arthur et al 2009 caradot et al 2011 post et al 2017 ten veldhuis et al 2011 only when the flooding incidents are typical could data driven approaches suffice in identifying the causes and supply effective strategies alternatively we seek a proactive approach to inlet inspection by identifying the most influential inlets in advance such a proactive strategy for inlets has never been reported but a somewhat similar policy for sewers in the uk can date back to the 1980s this policy suggested proactively performing a periodic inspection to critical sewers and doing non periodic maintenance in hindsight to non critical sewers the critical sewers comprising 20 of sewer pipes on average were defined by those among the highest cost to be repaired from collapse rather than those most critical to system failure however decades of practice revealed that non critical sewers by definition could also be critical to system failure for only around 30 of critical sewers were in poor structural conditions for this reason the uk has decided to improve its original strategy after the year 2000 at least to be more proactive in maintaining the non critical sewers fenner 2000 fenner and sweeting 1999 the uk s experience from the other side implies a need to spot truly critical assets critical components should be identified according to the role they play in the system as yet however proactive sewer asset management strategies are mainly based on the inspectors intuition and tacit knowledge tscheikner gratl et al 2020 van riel et al 2016 to address this problem here we propose a method to identify critical inlets according to their runoff interception weights the quantification is built on a hybrid hydrodynamic model composed of a two and one dimensional 2d 1d dual drainage model embedded in a catchment scale sewer model the dual drainage model considers an integrated system comprising the surface and subsurface drainage components to convey stormwater see smith 2006 for the concept and early attempts the subsurface system is designed to drain the runoff from a non extreme for example 1 to 5 year storm without surcharge while the surface drainage needs to accommodate exceedance flows when the sewer system exceeds its design capacity in this study the overland flow model adopts a fully dynamic approach which is proved necessary to capture the complex flow patterns costabile et al 2020 influenced by buildings and structures e g steps fences and raised beds apart from the detailed representation of overland flows the representation of 2d 1d coupling via inlets is paramount to this study as well as is acknowledged by several other researchers even in a simplified e g diffusive wave model e g chang et al 2018 that said gully flows are too complex to be approximated by shallow water equations lopes et al 2017 and the transition from weir to orifice flow through a grate inlet is a continuously varying mixture flow guo et al 2009 without readily available equations as such we employed computational fluid dynamic cfd modeling as a virtual experiment djordjeviƒá et al 2013 g√≥mez et al 2016 to formulate the bidirectional interaction at grate inlets armed with such a physically based 2d 1d model we attempt to find an invariant relation from the grate inlet interception distributions under various rainfalls in flat areas this invariant is expected to be an identifier of the critical and non critical inlets regardless of rainfall types ideally these critical inlets cover a relatively small percentage of inlets but intercept most urban runoff periodically inspecting critical inlets before wet seasons coincides with the idea of strategic management thereby we term these inlets as strategic i e most influential inlets this paper will answer the following questions first in what sense that the strategic inlets are understood and precisely how can we define them second how are they distributed by interception and by location under various types of rainfalls third why are they deemed to be strategic and how does a drainage system perform without them or with only of them the remainder of the paper first introduces a fully coupled 2d 1d hydrodynamic model applicable to urban catchments to calculate exchanges between surface and subsurface flows via grate inlets it then presents a method to define strategic inlets and an idea to test these inlets consistency and effectiveness under extreme and non extreme rainfalls next the method is illustrated in central tanggu a low lying urban catchment prone to nuisance flooding finally the paper recaps the overall result discusses the validity of the approach and summarizes future improvements 2 methods to accurately represent the existing surface of catchment we reconstructed the ground surface via airborne light detection and ranging lidar terrain data along with 1 500 digital line graph dlg these data were both amended by on site inspection the dlg contains the features of manholes and grate inlets by which the layout of sewer network was obtained while we preserved the network layout and 2d 1d interactive nodes e g inlets manholes pumps we redesigned the subsurface sewer system to accept a prescribed design storm e g a 2 year storm event in this paper without surcharging above the pipe soffit butler et al 2018 water uk 2018 the redesign adopted standard practice for flat areas complying with or at least not violating several drainage design standards e g en 752 bsi 2018 mohud 2016 water uk 2018 van luijtelaar 1999 redesigning the sewer network is partly because combined sewer systems are common practice in old urban areas wherein the sewer information such as conduit size and elevation is often incomplete or unavailable aronica and lanza 2005 moreover modeling with a properly redesigned sewer network can narrow down the causes of local flooding 2 1 hydrodynamic modeling we constructed a set of hydrodynamic models to simulate urban flooding in a low lying catchment these numerical models consist of three parts a a coarse catchment scale 1d sewer system model b a fine scale 2d 1d dual drainage model embedded in the catchment scale model and c a three dimensional 3d grate inlet system model for computing the interactions between the surface and subsurface flows via grate inlets among these the 2d 1d model lies at the core of the model structure fig 1 both the 1d and 2d 1d models adopted the fully dynamic approach coupled and built in infoworks icm integrated catchment modelling and the 3d modeling was performed in openfoam open source cfd the time step of the coupled 1d and 2d 1d models was fixed to 5 seconds while the 3d model was adaptive from 10 3 to 10 4 seconds 2 1 1 1d model we first built a two scale 1d sewer model within the 2d domain all inlets lateral connections and sewers were included outside it only sewers under the major and secondary streets were simulated when modeling the finer scale 2d domain we partitioned it into subcatchments with a series of simple unweighted attributes as done in krebs et al 2013 each subcatchment contained one land cover type with distinct properties e g 100 or nil imperviousness with a uniform slope specifically pavements were subdivided by yard walls and roofs by inlets if conveyed by internal drains or downspouts otherwise although such partitioning was aimed at reducing the ambiguity in subcatchment parameterization to identify a contributing area is never straightforward as flow paths in flat areas are virtually unpredictable for this reason we employed a high resolution 2d model to simulate each mesh cell s peak flow direction and delineate the subcatchments according to the peak flow directions under a given intense storm we then aggregated all flow directions to eight directions and merged the abutting subcatchments with the same landcover contributing to the same inlets this way enabled us to largely disambiguate an inlet s contributing area and improve the accuracy in sizing the sewer network conduits thereby we were able to route runoff to the inlet within the subcatchment or to an immediately downstream one if the subcatchment in question contains no inlet next when modeling the coarser scale remaining catchment we divided the streets into segments and blocks into subcatchments by walls between property units normally the runoff from subcatchments was routed to the nearby manholes yet for those containing elevated green areas i e raised beds the runoff was internally routed from the pervious sub area to the impervious sub area of the subcatchment huber 2001 raised beds are used when soil is too sandy compacted saline or alkaline for plants to grow well in this model all conduits were initially empty conduit outfalls were initially open to the atmosphere during the conduit sizing i e the redesign and modeled by fixed flow pump stations afterwards the ratio of hydraulic gradient to conduit slope was used to size a sewer conduit if any conduit whose hydraulic conduit gradient ratio is over or well below one e g less than 0 6 we would resize it and perform re modeling we repeated the process until all conduits were moderately or slightly lower than their full capacity under a given design storm 2 1 2 2d model we then constructed a high resolution 2d rainfall runoff model in this model we generated 2d mesh via schewchuk s triangle shewchuk 2005 to represent the complex micro topographies with tiny projections and depressions schubert et al 2008 edges of buildings or structures e g curbs steps raised beds as well as street centerlines were retained as breaklines for accurate representation to attain a robust model result while balancing the accuracy and computational cost we tested the mesh sensitivity to the bounds of maximum cell size and the minimum cell angle normally each subdomain was expected to be spanned by a minimum of two cells the cell size being tested was based on the length distribution of the edges of and the gaps between buildings or structures the mode of the length distribution was used to represent the mesh resolution by which the maximum allowable cell size was defined in this paper the maximum cell size was set to the mesh resolution multiplying a fourth of square root of three for simplicity the cell size for testing was rounded to an integer then reduced or increased by 1 0 m2 to form a set of maximum cell sizes likewise the minimum allowable cell size for computing accorded to the smallest length in the distribution below which undesirably small triangles were merged for a given cell size we investigated the effects of an array of minimum cell angles drawing upon a series of delaunay refinement algorithms most minimum cell angles in the array have been proved refined or recast by shewchuk 2002 including in ascending order a 20 7 after ruppert s algorithm ruppert 1995 b 26 5 after chew s second algorithm chew 1993 chew 1993 c 28 6 a refinement of b built on miller et al s work miller et al 2003 d 30 from chew s first algorithm chew 1989 and e 34 an upper bound from triangle shewchuk 2005 additionally we interpolated a few more values in the array such as 22 6 24 5 25 5 and 32 to find the most possible bound for the minimum cell angle this 2d model considers three basic types of mesh boundaries including a the internal boundary the solid wall that prevents runoff from entering or leaving the 2d polygon across the boundary line b the external boundary the free discharge that allows runoff to leave the 2d polygon with velocity continuity at the boundary line and c the external boundary the critical at which the flow is calculated via a broad crested weir equation if the level in the boundary element of the 2d polygon is above the boundary face level otherwise is treated as a solid wall the second and third boundaries normally apply to the rare and frequent storms respectively to include the case that runoff flows over the curb we extended the boundary lines to the building edges at the downstream blocks buildings were extracted and generated as holes in triangulation schubert and sanders 2012 schubert et al 2008 such treatment however omits roof runoff drained to the ground unlike most 2d models that ignore external drainage i e non directly connected roof runoff our model adds it back and regards it as a point source inflow boundary at the roof s downspout additionally doorsteps and free fall drainage roofs were treated as mesh level zones 2 1 3 2d 1d interaction the interaction between the 2d overland flow and 1d sewer flow was represented by the relationship between piezometric head combining pressure head with elevation head and discharge at the grate inlet we derived a piecewise function describing the head discharge relation under both interception and surcharge conditions by analyzing a series of 3d numerical experiments of the overland and sewer flow exchanges the 3d incompressible volume of fluid vof method see appendix a for the governing equations was used to describe the air water two phase flow at the grate inlet to simulate the inlet under surcharge conditions we imposed a pressure head on the pipe s outlet while assigning an inflow to the pipe s inlet a series of simulated pairs of piezometric heads h and discharges q 2d1d were fit to a scaling relation such that q 2 d 1 d h Œ± h Œ≤ g√≥mez and russo 2005 palla et al 2018 in which factor Œ± was supposed to be proportional to the through area of a grate and exponent Œ≤ to be interaction coefficient given an inflow discharged at the street boundary q 2d1d was sampled at its stabilized stage of the 3d model outputs and was averaged out by three values at the inlet s upstream intermediate and downstream for all conditions the head discharge relation reads 1 q 2 d 1 d h Œ± s h Œ≤ s h 0 Œ± i h Œ≤ i 0 h h c Œ± i h c Œ≤ i h h c in equation 1 the subscripts i and s of parameters Œ± and Œ≤ denote the interception and surcharge respectively h c denotes the piezometric head corresponding to the interception capacity of grate inlet here the third stage when the inlet approaches its capacity is approximated to a constant yet an extension to a subfunction is straightforward in the 2d domain the 2d and 1d models are coupled at nodes each node s piezometric head h between the manhole and mesh cell containing the inlet is computed under three circumstances first h is positive and equivalent to the elevation head of the mesh cell second h is non negative as the pressure head at the manhole does not exceed the elevation head of the mesh cell water level third h is negative as the pressure head at the manhole exceeds the elevation head of the mesh cell water level meanwhile the model considers all water approaching the mesh cell that contains the inlet otherwise each cell in a high resolution 2d model will yield far less runoff than the discharge corresponding to the piezometric head see fig s1 s3 for the calibration and validation of 2d 1d interactions under laboratory conditions 2 2 defining extreme and non extreme rainfalls extreme or non extreme rainfalls can be understood in two ways one way is merely from rainfall frequency analysis and represented by the n th percentile of a cumulative distribution function for all daily rainfalls over a long period in this way the split between the extreme and non extreme events can be defined by a threshold such as the 95th or 99th percentile nonetheless even rainfalls over the 99th percentile are deemed frequent in the other way that pertains to the exceedance of a drainage system capacity balmforth et al 2006 koks et al 2012 this capacity is represented by the exceedance of a probability in annual maximum rainfall distribution several practices adopted 0 1 annual maxima probability i e 10 year recurrence as a split between the frequent and rare events for example the 10 year recurrence was used to define the design capacity of the minor system in hec 22 brown et al 2009 the limited inconvenience flooding on street van luijtelaar 2006 the nuisance flood ball et al 2019 and the threshold of non extreme runoff fennessey and miller 2001 by definition non extreme events are more frequent than the 10 year recurrence wang 2017 in this paper we included three non extreme rainfalls and one marginally extreme rainfall i e 10 year storm 2 3 identifying strategic inlets predicting an inlet intercepting capacity in actual cases can be complicated because the interactions between the upstream and downstream inlets remain poorly understood the surface flow drains partly into the inlet while the bypassing flow merges with other flows and may further be intercepted by downstream inlets even the water intercepted at this moment will escape back to the surface at another moment if it reaches the pressurized part of a sewer system it would be vain to attain a stable intercepted flow of a single inlet but the cumulative intercepted volume distribution for all inlets over a rainfall event is expected to be robust in light of this we computed each inlet s cumulative intercepted volume by summing the flood from 2d 1d interaction and flood onto overflow the 2d domain over a rainfall event thereby we define the strategic inlets for the first time by spotting out the most effective inlets specifically they are defined by those high ranking inlets sorted by the cumulative intercepted volume invariant to the pattern magnitude and frequency of rainfalls since the histogram of inlets cumulative intercepted volume exhibits a reverse j shape containing a long tail without a mode one can presume the intercepted volume x x x obeys the generalized pareto distribution gpd whose cumulative distribution function cdf is defined by castillo and hadi 1997 2 f x Œæ 0 œÉ Œº 1 1 Œæ x Œº œÉ 1 Œæ where Œæ œÉ œÉ 0 and Œº Œº r are shape scale and location parameters respectively when Œæ 0 x Œº Œº œÉ Œæ when Œæ 0 x Œº for the special case when Œæ 0 the gpd reduces to the exponential distribution f x œÉ Œº 1 exp x Œº œÉ the probability density function pdf for equation 2 corresponds to 3 f x Œæ 0 œÉ Œº œÉ 1 1 Œæ x Œº œÉ 1 1 Œæ with a faster decaying tail than the pareto distribution gpd has finite moments when Œæ 1 2 1 2 which is desirable for describing a bounded quantity schoenberg and patel 2012 such as inlet interactions since an inlet s intercepted volume is non negative i e x 0 one can consider a left truncated distribution f in a closed form 4 f x 0 Œæ œÉ Œº 1 1 Œæ x max 0 Œº œÉ Œæ max 0 Œº Œº 1 Œæ for Œæ 0 we then normalized the inlet s intercepted volume to a dimensionless quantity such as contributed interception rate and calculated the contribution rate distribution with x 0 1 we hypothesized that the contribution rate distributions obeyed the gpd for all with nearly identical parameters that is approximately invariant to rainfall types if true one can find an average distribution among these distributions in fitting the gpd to both datasets i e intercepted volumes and contribution rates we adopted the maximum likelihood method to estimate the distribution parameters the maximum likelihood asymptotic solutions for gpd are proved valid for Œæ 1 2 smith 1984 and are shown to be satisfactory when a sample size reaches 100 hosking and wallis 1987 although a larger sample size e g over 500 is preferred the fitted gpds were tested by statistics of cram√©r von mises and kolmogorov smirnov next we generated n inlets contribution rates from the averaged distribution and deduced a law of inlets contribution a relationship between the percentage of contributed inlets and percentile of intercepted volume theoretically the strategic inlets are defined by the k th percentile of interception in other words the strategic ratio e g 25 5 is set by a probability cumulated to k per cent e g 70 80 although the k th percentile of interception is anticipated to be stable under various rainfalls these theoretically defined strategic inlets will slightly vary in spatial distribution with respect to storm patterns for this reason one may adopt the union of the calculated strategic inlets across a variety of rainfalls for inlets management on the safe side or opt for the intersection to reduce labor costs 2 4 testing the consistency and effectiveness of strategic inlets we first looked at how consistently strategic inlets were distributed in the 2d domain under the extreme and non extreme rainfalls the consistency can be measured by a ratio of the number of calculated strategic inlets to that of the union of the inlets involved in all rainfalls that is the more the ratio approaches one the more stable the strategic inlets are spatially distributed we then examined the effects of strategic inlets on urban flooding by removing the strategic and the remaining non strategic inlets under surcharge and non surcharge conditions for the surcharge conditions we considered three measures including the depth duration and extent to illustrate the risk of inundation each threshold of which was targeted to the degree of nuisance flooding in low lying urban catchments while the non strategic inlets play an insignificant role with the presence of the strategic inlets some non strategic inlets for example those sitting close to the removed strategic inlets will compensate the loss of the removal and become high intercepting inlets for this reason one may derive the second level strategic inlets from the non strategic inlets in the first level using the same procedure meanwhile we tested the robustness of the presumed distribution by examining the consistency in the distribution parameters before and after removing the strategic inlets i e part of inlets concerning management costs we were inclined to adopt the intersection of the inlets involved across rainfalls as candidates of the second level strategic inlets further we excluded the inlets with negative interactions i e surcharge over interception among the candidates when sewer pipes are exceeded their design capacity under an extreme rainfall as such we regarded the remaining better performance candidates as the second level strategic inlets 3 data and parameters the study area is a typical low lying urban catchment prone to nuisance flooding it covers an area of 293 hm2 in central tanggu tianjin lying at the left bank of downstream hai river and 11 km upstream of the tidal barrier fig 2 a 3 1 topography and land covers the lidar data were detected and filtered in 2010 with a horizontal resolution at 1 0 m and vertical accuracy less than 0 15 m root mean square errors rmse as shown in the digital elevation model dem extracted from the lidar data the catchment descends southward fig 2b with a mean longitudinal slope of all streets no more than 0 05 the major streets form an orthogonal pattern among which a central thoroughfare runs from the north boundary until the north end of the riverside park the mean directional slope of the gutters on the major streets perpendicular to the river from north to south is 0 015 and parallel to the river from west to east is 0 093 gutter profiles are shown to be rolling hence the mean absolute longitudinal slope of gutters achieved 0 34 pump stations become necessary in such a low lying catchment because the sewer outlets are below the mean surface level there are two pump stations with each capacity of 5 m3 s one pump station lies at the southeast of the park and another about 800 m away to the east the 2d domain covering 6 71 hm2 is embedded in the catchment and bordered by the north south and east west thoroughfares on the west and south fig 2c slightly descending from the northwest to the southeast the mean slopes of the streets surrounding the 2d domain are 1 2 for transverse sections and 0 13 for longitudinal gradients the land covers within the 2d domain are mostly i e 83 impervious including 31 3 streets 10 3 alleys 23 5 pavements and 30 2 buildings 3 2 rainfalls and evaporation we adopted two design storms 2 and 10 year and two actual rainfalls flash and moderate to represent various rainfall types fig 3 a the flash lasted for an hour with high intensity while the moderate lasted for 15 hours with low intensity we plotted the hyetographs of the two design storms with a 3 hour duration and 5 minute intervals according to a local rainfall design guide ren et al 2012 tucc 2016 the total depths of the 2 and 10 year design storms amounted to 72 4 mm and 100 5 mm respectively and the peak intensities were 50 6 mm h and 76 8 mm h in this paper we let the design storms start at 10 00 and end at 13 00 the flash totaling 28 7 mm and gauged at 1 minute resolution started at 10 47 rained heavily for 20 minutes till 11 07 and ended at 11 48 on july 23 2015 the moderate totaling 64 5 mm and gauged at 5 minute resolution started from 23 20 on july 4 and ended at 14 10 on july 5 2008 fig 3b and fig 3c show a series of rainfall maxima curves plotted by the intensity duration frequency idf formula for this area these curves were used to benchmark the frequency and magnitude of actual rainfall events both idf and ddf depth duration frequency curves indicate that the flash approaches the annual exceedance probability of 0 9999 while the moderate happens more frequently than annually for each simulation we let it start as the rainfall started and let it run for nine hours after the rainfall stopped and the time step was fixed to 5 seconds for comparison we applied the same evaporation data a 24 hour hourly time series to all simulations whereas the water intercepted by transpiration and plants were ignored in this study 3 3 infiltration model parameterization the horton equation proved to be fit for the infiltration process on a vegetative surface shao and baumgartl 2014 was adopted to simulate the runoff on green areas since the original horton equation ignores the process when rainfall intensity i mm is lower than the infiltration capacity before ponding time t p smith 1972 the horton equation is rewritten as 5 f t i t t p f c f 0 f c exp k t t 0 t t p here f 0 and f c denote initial and final infiltration rates mm h k is an infiltration decay coefficient 1 h t 0 is the time shifted from the classical horton infiltration curve and t 0 t p these parameters were all estimated by fitting the equation 5 to a set of measured infiltration rates in a local field experiment by yang et al 2011 this experiment was performed on a 95 vegetative 1 m 1 m plot under a steady rainfall intensity of 60 mm h for an hour accordingly we parameterized the equation 5 as f 0 72 875 mm h f c 5 996 mm h k 2 466 t 0 0 01 h and t p 0 097 h fig 4 the overall fitting was satisfactory with the goodness of fit tests being rmse 3 949 and r 2 0 969 3 4 conduits inlets and roof drains the 1d model for the 2d domain comprised 168 manholes 163 inlets and 198 subcatchments for the remaining catchment the model included 363 manholes and 420 subcatchments the conduits in the catchment and the 2d domain totaled 23 5 km and 4175 m in length the conduits sizes accorded to those in practice and were assigned to 400 to 2000 mm in diameter we let the conduit slope conform to the surface slope as much as possible ranging from 0 05 to 0 35 mostly 0 05 0 10 or 0 15 the diameter and slope for lateral connections were fixed to 200 mm and 1 all inlets in the 2d domain are grate inlets including a 52 large iron grates each sized 0 90 m 0 60 m with a through area of 0 278 m2 b 42 medium concrete grates each sized 0 75 m 0 45 m with a through area of 0 072 m2 and c 72 small concrete grates each sized 0 50 m 0 30 m with a through area of 0 024 m2 all large inlets sit at the street gutters three of which are double inlets sized twice the large one medium inlets are mainly placed on the allies while small ones sit between the residential buildings or on the pavements the buildings are composed of over a dozen of multistory dwellings a theatre and a residential complex the complex tenants access their homes from the roof of the first floor occupied by commercial uses the theatre and complex roofs are partly installed internal drainage which drains the runoff directly to the sewer system the remaining buildings occupying approximately two thirds of the total roof area contain 179 external roof downspouts each external roof drain covering 67 8 m2 roof area on average was assigned as a point source compensated to the 2d domain fig 5 4 results 4 1 mesh sensitivity test we used the flash rainfall to test the runoff sensitivity to the resolution and angle of the triangulation usinging the bound of minimum cell angle to 26 5 we first evaluated the impact of cell size according to the length distributions of object edges and gaps based on a planar straight line graph i e a planar graph connected by straight line segments at its vertices see shewchuk 2002 the highest frequency edges fell in 1 m 1 5 m and the highest and second highest frequency gaps fell in 5 35 m 5 67 m and 0 0 35 m the upper bound of cell size was set to 4 5 6 7 8 9 or 10 m2 paired with a fixed lower bound of 0 15 m2 the tests indicated that the inlet intercepted volume varied slightly with a gradual increase in cell count when the cell size upper bound ranged from 5 to 8 m2 fig s4a fixing the maximum allowable cell size to 5 m2 we then tested the influence of minimum allowable cell angle with nine values ranging from 20 7 to 34 0 the choice of each value according to subsection 2 1 2 the tests showed that the inlet intercepted volume fluctuated with a sharp increase in cell count when the bound of minimum cell angle was larger than 28 6 fig s4b the 2d model showed insensitivity to mesh resolution when the maximum allowable cell size fell in 5 m2 8 m2 regardless of the minimum allowable cell angle varying from 20 7 to 28 6 consequently we assigned the maximum allowable cell size to 6 m2 and the minimum allowable cell angle to 25 and generated a mesh containing 23 576 cells with an average cell size of 2 1 m2 4 2 the head discharge relation and 2d 1d interaction the 3d model included a half street bounded by a ridge and one side curb a street inlet the large inlet in this paper a lateral connection a manhole and a sewer pipe the half street was 5 9 m in length and 5 5 m in width with a longitude slope of 0 167 and a transverse slope of 1 5 the inlet comprising a 5 cm thick grate and 1 m deep chamber was placed on the street gutter s midpoint the lateral connection and the sewer pipe were measured 200 mm and 300 mm in diameter the depth and diameter of the manhole were 2 1 m and 1 0 m when modeling under non surcharge conditions we removed the manhole and sewer pipe to reduce computational cost the street inflows approaching the inlets were given 16 values from 2 0 to 181 5 l s among which 151 27 l s and 181 5 l s were the largest two values the intercepted flows remained nearly unchanged even when the inflow increased from 151 27 to 181 5 l s suggesting that the inlet interception approached its capacity when modeling under surcharge conditions we included the manhole and sewer pipe and considered 22 combinations of street inflows sewer inflows and pressure heads at the sewer outlet ranging from 0 0 m to 2 8 m in fig 6 we presented the results obtained from 3d modeling in hollow dots see fig a2 for validation of head discharge relation and plotted the head discharge curve by fitting equation 1 to the modeled results the overall fittings were nearly perfect i e r 2 0 9952 and rmse 0 7721 for 0 h h c r 2 0 9998 and rmse 0 8062 for h 0 and the head discharge relation parameters for the three inlet types were summarized in table 1 in which when h c 4 9 cm the large medium and small inlets reached their interception capacity at 31 11 l s 8 24 l s and 2 75 l s respectively to illustrate how the head discharge relations worked on the large medium and small inlets in the modeling we arbitrarily chose three inlets and showed their flow exchanges under two design storms under the 2 year design storm these three inlets intercepted runoff all the time among which the medium inlet no 20 approached its capacity and remained the stage for about 1 5 hours see the dashed line in fig 7 a under the 10 year design storm the three inlets reached their intercepting capabilities albeit asynchronously and then surcharged fig 7b 4 3 inlet interception distributions by volume fraction and location the gpd offers an adequate fit to all intercepted volume distributions under the four distinct rainfalls fig 8 a that is no hypothesis was rejected according to the goodness of fit tests of cram√©r von mises and kolmogorov smirnov at a significant level of 5 as expected the distribution s shape parameters Œæ fall within 0 1 2 ranging from 0 29 under the 10 year design storm to 0 49 under the flash rainfall table 2 a the range of Œæ suggests that a the moments of these gpds exist b the parameter estimates are reliable and c the biases of the maximum likelihood estimator are relatively small hosking and wallis 1987 despite variations among intercepted volumes the ranking of inlet s contribution was generally stable spearman œÅ 0 845 0 965 under various rainfalls see table s1 for the correlation matrix of inlet contribution ranks the contribution rate distributions under four rainfalls were almost identical marginally affected by the pattern magnitude and frequency of the rainfalls fig 8b since the variations among the four distributions can be negligible we simply averaged the distribution parameters to deduce a representative distribution for inlet contribution rates and thus scaled it up to an urban catchment scale supposing an urban catchment contains 5000 inlets we randomly generated 5000 contribution rates from the representative distribution in 0 100 and repeated the generation for ten runs for each run we derived a relationship between the fraction of inlets and the cumulative contribution rate by re fitting equation 3 to the generated data each fitting echoes a tapered pareto law shown as a 70 25 rule in the sense that the top 25 inlets intercept over 70 i e 72 runoff or conversely the 70th percentile of runoff interception involves 24 3 inlets fig 9 we also investigated the effect of inlet types on the shape of gpd we compared the contribution rate distribution under a virtual case with identical inlets and that under actual cases with three inlet types the comparisons under all four rainfalls demonstrated that the distribution curves became more tapered off with reduced upper tails when the medium and small inlets were replaced by the large ones this was even more evident under an intensive rainfall like the flash rainfall therefore the diversity of inlet types also contributes to the underlying distribution ignoring inlet types in urban flood modeling will be biased toward the less important ones while the strategic inlets can be mathematically defined by the upper quartile of inlets 41 163 the union of inlets distributed in the 2d domain across the four rainfalls involved 53 inlets among them three inlets no 1 no 113 and no 125 performed unstably no 113 fell in the lower quartile under the moderate rainfall no 1 and no 125 fell outside the upper quartile under the three non extreme rainfalls therefore we dropped these three inlets and included the remaining 50 inlets as strategic inlets despite the unstable performance of the three inlets the ratio of the strategic inlets mathematically defined to that of the union of the inlets spatially distributed across the four rainfalls was 0 77 41 53 indicating that the strategic inlets are generally stable in spatial distribution fig 10 and see fig s5 for the workflow we also divided the 2d domain into four quadrants to characterize the location of strategic inlets quadrants i and iv represented the upstream and downstream parts quadrants ii and iii represented the midstream parts for any rainfall event each quadrant contained no less than 8 strategic inlets 8 41 suggesting the evenness of their distribution quadrant i contained more strategic inlets than any other quadrants ranging from 11 flash to 16 moderate across four rainfalls quadrant i contained the most 16 while quadrant iv the least 10 among the 50 first level strategic inlets see fig s6 these results demonstrated that despite their locations at the upstream or downstream the strategic inlets were fairly evenly distributed 4 4 consistency in the fitted probability distributions the simulation confirmed that the compensation effect did occur in case of the strategic inlets being sealed the remaining inlets intercepted a larger proportion of runoff with the removal of the strategic inlets than they did with all inlets i e 54 7 versus 26 5 the top two compensatory inlets no 90 and no 1 even intercepted more runoff than their counterparts e g no 146 and no 43 in the moderate rainfall and no 41 and no 43 in the 2 year design storm considering the compensation effect we derived the second level contribution rate distribution from the remaining inlets with the strategic inlets being sealed as revealed in the statistical tests the contribution rate distribution for the sample excluding the strategic inlets also obeys the truncated gpd table 2b moreover the parameter values of the averaged second level contribution rate distribution across the three non extreme rainfalls were close to those of the first level distribution averaged by the four rainfalls such consistency in the first and second level distributions suggests that the gpd can be a robust model to describe the general behavior of grate inlet interception in flat areas using the same method described before we derived the relationship between a fraction of inlets and a cumulative interception again the top 25 remaining inlets intercepted over 70 73 of runoff or conversely the 70th percentile of interception involves 22 7 inlets we adopted the intersection 21 inlets of the 22 7 inlets across the three non extreme rainfalls as candidates of the second level strategic inlets when including the 10 year design storm we excluded three inlets that spilled more than intercepted with negative interactions and specified 18 second level strategic inlets among these 18 inlets the top five sat on the streets intercepting the runoff initially intercepted by the adjacent or upstream strategic inlets this explained why inlets no 90 and no 1 located at the corner of a street intersecting another street or alley were the top two compensatory inlets apart from the five street inlets the remaining second level strategic inlets were located on the allies to the up and midstream of the block see fig s6 4 5 effectiveness of strategic inlets we first investigated the effectiveness of the strategic inlets by simulating the cases of either the strategic or non strategic inlets being sealed under the three non extreme rainfalls the simulation showed a mild reduction mean 4 8 see table 3 and fig 11 in runoff interception with the removal of 113 non strategic inlets by contrast sealing the strategic inlets resulted in a radical reduction in runoff interception mean 45 2 and an increase by five to six times of surface water transfer to the downstream next we investigated the performance of strategic inlets under the surcharge condition with the 10 year design storm at first the severity of inundation was defined by depth and duration we considered two depth thresholds such as 0 05 m for tolerable ponding i e lower impact level in caradot et al 2011 and 0 10 m for flooding i e the upper bound of nuisance flooding in moftakhari et al 2018 and the threshold for the duration of inundation was set to one hour sealing part of inlets resulted in a shift of the ponding duration from less than to over two hours nevertheless this shift was more pronounced with the removal of the strategic inlets than that of the non strategic ones fig 12 and table s2 for example with all inlets a half of tolerable ponding area would be drained within two hours this proportion decreased from 2 5 with the removal of the non strategic inlets to less than 1 5 with the removal of the strategic ones as for the flooding for instance the increase in the area inundated for 3 4 hours with the non strategic inlets was nearly eight times of that with the strategic inlets we further assessed the severity of ponding and flooding by considering their extent sealing the strategic inlets exacerbated the gutter flooding immediately surrounding the points where the top intercepting and surcharging inlets were located see circles and crosses in fig 12a new flooding appeared on the upstream streets while the flooding duration on the downstream streets was prolonged a severe inundation emerged near the upstream inlet no 69 at which the ponding exceeded 100 m2 and the flooding reached 35 m2 on the downstream street the area ratio of ponding over three hours increased from the original 4 to 28 wherein a half retained for more than four hours the flooded areas over three hours increased from none to 18 82 of the 2 hour flooded areas extended the duration to three hours and 17 to four hours contrasted to the case without the strategic inlets sealing the non strategic inlets exerted a marginal effect on gutter flooding except for the one found at the rear of the residential complex because of the removal of a chain of small inlets 5 conclusions and discussion we have shown that the gpd with shape parameter Œæ ranging from 0 to 1 2 can robustly describe the behaviors of grate inlet interception in flat areas the distribution of inlet contribution rates fit by the gpd is almost invariant to the pattern magnitude and frequency of rainfall events that is there exists a stable relationship between the fraction of inlets and the cumulative probability of interception using this relationship one can define the strategic inlets by the upper quartile contributing to 70 of runoff interception the 70 25 rule holds even if a proportion of inlets are removed we also confirmed that most of the upper quartile inlets stayed at consistent locations spearman œÅ 0 845 0 965 under the four rainfalls spotting strategic inlets in the real world is however non trivial because they appeared dispersed and weakly correlated with elevations pearson r 0 4 either at the upstream or downstream since surface sewer interactions have only been experimented at a single street level and remained undocumented at a catchment scale mignot et al 2019 physically based models are the best suited approximation of reality salvadore et al 2015 in this study we built a full dynamic dual drainage model in which the 2d 1d interactions were represented by the head discharge relations derived from the 3d modeling including full processes from free surface flow to pressurized flow the 3d model is more reliable than those widely adopted simplified methods in minor flood inundation for example the weir orifice equations will give uncertain results for flooding depths from 0 01 to 0 30 m galambos 2012 a range relevant to flat areas while the inlet interception capacity captured by the 3d simulations is reflected in our head discharge piecewise function the gpd applies regardless of the upper bound of interception disregarding the upper bound tends to steepen the shape of the probability distribution thereby may overestimate the role of strategic inlets aside from the particular attention paid to the 2d 1d flow exchanges we have improved the precision and accuracy of the 2d surface flow model through several aspects first we tested the sensitivity of the triangulation to describe the microtopography with relevant details second we compensated for the lost roof runoff arising from the building hole method roofs may contribute to a considerable fraction of the drainage area ignoring the discharge from external downspouts will not only underestimate the surface runoff but also affect the routing pattern locally third we fit the shifted horton model to the results of a local field experiment and attained the model parameters although it exhibited only a small curve shifting in this study including the unsaturated infiltration state is necessary when pervious coverage is unneglectable unlike a reactive approach that responds to plugged inlets after being reported spotting strategic inlets is a proactive approach that enables drainage managers to focus on the most influential inlets clearance beforehand although the pattern of inlet blockage ratio remains little known insofar the approach and method we have presented can guide inlet clearance toward the strategic ones saving 1 2 with two levels of strategic inlets to 2 3 with the first level of labor costs while maintaining the overall drainage performance acceptably normally the first level strategic inlets need cleaning before the wet season cleaning the second level strategic inlets would be necessary whenever an extreme storm is forecast in this case strategic inlets clearance would involve the chambers lateral connections associated manholes and pipelines while strategic inlets are shown to be robust in the probability distribution their spatial distribution varies slightly as the rainfall intensity increases that is more inlets are deemed strategic at upstream whereas almost no downstream ones are affected one can tailor the current hydrodynamic model to a case specific model if the initial condition assumptions i e all pipes are empty no pipes or inlets are clogged are dropped and replaced by observed data given the model s initial conditions the present study can be immediately applicable to cases when storm drains and inlets are already inspected repaired and cleared before the wet season in addition the flooding survey in appendix b indicates that strategic inlets may imply flood hotspots the most vulnerable locations to flooding if a drainage system is left unmaintained and malfunctioned moreover the present work awaits several improvements future work would consider a chain of blocks as the 2d domain nested in the catchment scale 1d model and include more actual rainfall events to corroborate the 70 25 rule in this paper the stage approaching to the interception capacity was approximated to a constant yet extension to a subfunction is straightforward future efforts would extend this stage and refine the interception subfunction parameters affected by grate configuration admittedly for any catchment of interest the strategic inlets shall be checked and updated periodically with the changes in microtopography and sewer pipes such updates will not affect the model framework and the procedure rather the 2d or 1d model can be amended accordingly to estimate how frequently the model shall be updated a follow up study may examine the extent to which the initially defined strategic inlets can withstand years of surface deformation credit authorship contribution statement
