12935,the removal of four pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps namely diethyltoluamide deet paracetamol par caffeine caf and triclosan tcs at a spiked concentration of 25 μg l from natural water using the photo uvc fenton powdered zero valent iron pzvi process was investigated the results show that a molar ratio of h2o2 pzvi of 2 0 pzvi concentration of 22 4 mg l and ph of 3 0 maximised the removal of the target compounds at 71 1 100 64 2 and 87 1 for deet par caf and tcs respectively after 30 min in fenton pzvi process when this process was coupled with uvc radiation 29 6 80 3 3 1 and 88 4 of deet par caf and tcs respectively were removed within the first minute and 99 0 100 99 5 and 100 respectively were removed after 30 min the pseudo first order kinetic model best fitted the degradation data of deet par and caf 1 20 min and because 80 of tcs and par degraded within the first minutes it is suggested to explore the kinetics during the initial period characterisations of pzvi after the photo fenton pzvi process indicated the corrosion of the surface of iron powder and the presence of iron oxides and iron hydroxides lower removals of nitrate 35 50 phosphate 35 and total organic carbon toc 18 were observed which may be attributed to the small h2o2 pzvi dosage used results of this investigation show that the photo fenton pzvi process has potential for efficient and cost effective removal of ppcps graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords advanced oxidation process photo fenton ppcps removal zero valent iron 1 introduction in recent years the problem of environmental contamination by pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps has caused increasing concern worldwide 1 2 these emerging contaminants have been detected in wastewater natural water groundwater soil biosolids and other biotopes 3 7 ppcps in the environment may pose risks e g toxicity to human and other creatures and heighten corresponding problems such as the occurrence of antibiotic resistance genes args 8 hence elimination of ppcps from the environment is a pressing concern for environmental researchers and engineers wastewater treatment plants wwtps are considered to be the main sources of ppcps in the environment 9 untreated ppcp compounds from wwtps enter the environment with the effluent discharged various treatment techniques for ppcp removal have been studied including conventional activated sludge coagulation constructed wetland slow sand filtration membrane filtration and others but these treatments vary greatly in their effectiveness in removing ppcp compounds 4 10 13 the fenton reaction an advanced oxidation process aop was discovered in 1894 by h j h fenton who found that tartaric acid could be oxidised by hydrogen peroxide activated by ferrous fe2 salts 14 the fenton reaction is a homogenous process during this reaction the ho radicals produced are a strong oxidising species that are responsible for the oxidation process eq 1 15 17 1 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe 3 ho ho for treating contaminants the ho radicals produced by the fenton reaction oxidise pollutants into small molecule compounds and further into carbon dioxide water and other inorganics 18 the fenton process has been proven to be effective in treating water to remove ppcps 19 20 and the combination of the fenton process with photolysis photo fenton has been reported to enhance the removal efficiency 21 25 although proven to be effective the homogenous fenton reaction is considered to have some inevitable drawbacks such as the requirement for large amounts of fe2 ions usually from feso4 the need for further treatment of iron ions and sludge and the acidification of effluents before decontamination 26 29 in recent years zero valent iron zvi has been employed to induce fenton oxidation and application of zvi fenton for ppcp degradation has been reported in few studies 27 30 31 unlike the traditional fenton process the zvi fenton reaction process is heterogeneous 32 during this process zvi is corroded and produces fe2 ions under the presence of h2o2 and h the fe2 react with h2o2 to produce reactive oxygen species ros such as ho radicals which can degrade ppcp contaminants eqs 2 4 31 33 34 apart from these main reactions the corrosion of the zvi surface in water may also occur under aerobic and or acidic conditions 35 36 2 fe 0 h 2 o 2 2h fe 2 2h 2 o 3 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe 3 ho ho 4 2fe 3 fe 0 3fe 2 unlike in the conventional fenton process both reductive and oxidative reactions can be initiated by the electron transfer on the zvi surface making the zvi fenton reaction process more versatile 37 in addition recycling of ferric fe3 iron into fe2 species at the iron surface can also take place as described by eq 4 27 other advantages of the zvi fenton process include the production of much less residue and the relatively lower cost compared to the use of ferrous salts and the recycling and reuse property of zvi particles 31 38 40 in recent years the photo fenton zvi process has been investigated to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the zvi fenton technique ultraviolet uv light is typically used for this purpose under uv light the following reactions take place 5 fe oh 2 hv fe 2 ho λ 580 nm 6 h 2 o 2 hv 2ho λ 310 nm under uv radiation photolysis of fe3 cations derived as described by eq 3 in acidic media yields fe2 cations eq 5 ho radicals are generated and regenerated fe2 cations can react with hydrogen peroxide again eq 3 33 in addition under radiation at a wavelength of 310 nm photolysis of hydrogen peroxide into ho radicals can also occur eq 6 16 although the overall rates of regeneration and the efficiency of the process described by eq 5 are low under radiation 15 additional ho radicals can be produced which increases the rate of oxidation nanoparticle zero valent iron nzvi has been employed in some studies using photo fenton zvi reaction 28 33 34 41 however apart from the high operational costs involved 42 the use of nano iron particles may also create recycling and after treatment problems since filtration of these nanoparticles is difficult 43 compared with nano iron particles iron powder is cheaper and easier to produce and handle which makes it a promising alternative in addition iron powder was also reported to have good recycling and reuse ability 40 however studies in which powdered zero valent iron pzvi has been used in the photo fenton reaction have typically focused more on removal of traditional pollutants such as solvent and nutrients 38 40 44 48 to the best of our knowledge pzvi has rarely been used in the photo fenton process to remove ppcps and no studies have been published on the use of this technique to treat deet par caf or tcs which are widely detected in the environment and reported to pose potential eco risks 1 6 49 50 therefore the aim of this work was to optimise the fenton pzvi process parameters for the removal of deet par caf and tcs from natural water in addition the removal and degradation kinetic trends during the uvc fenton pzvi process and the characteristics of iron powder before and after reaction were examined using field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials standards and chemicals of deet par caf and tcs were purchased from sigma aldrich uk the properties of the four compounds are shown in table s1 appendix a methanol and acetonitrile hplc grade were purchased from fisher scientific uk a stock solution of 1 mg ml mixed target compounds prepared in methanol was stored at 20 c and added to natural water to reach a spiked concentration of 25 μg l throughout the experiment pzvi 99 5 5 9 μm and a hydrogen peroxide solution 50 wt were purchased from sigma aldrich uk and fisher scientific uk respectively pzvi was not submitted to any treatment prior to the experiments the surface area of pzvi is 0 2988 m2 g determined by brunauer emmett teller bet quantachrome autosorb iq2 usa a working hydrogen peroxide solution was prepared by diluting the stock solution using ultrapure water ondeo purite is uk in this work natural water was collected from the regent s park lake london uk which had an average turbidity 2 ntu a conductivity around 1800 μs cm a ph in the range of 7 3 to 7 6 and a toc concentration of 12 90 0 32 mg l the initial concentrations of deet caf and tcs were 1 85 0 14 μg l 0 15 0 10 μg l and 1 32 0 22 μg l the concentration of par was not detected before the experiment the natural water was filtered through a 0 22 μm cellulose acetate membrane whatman uk 2 2 experimental design and procedure the experiment consisted of the fenton pzvi photo fenton pzvi and control tests fenton pzvi tests comprised the optimisation of the h2o2 pzvi molar ratio h2o2 pzvi concentration and solution ph the fenton pzvi test was conducted in batch mode using a shaker ika ks 260 uk 48 samples of 500 ml of natural water at a ph of 3 adjusted using h2so4 and naoh in all experiments 16 and spiked with the target compounds were put into six 600 ml glass bottles and shaken at 270 rpm to ensure thorough mixing a room temperature of approximately 25 c was maintained the shaking was started immediately after pzvi and h2o2 were added to the water the molar ratio tests were conducted using h2o2 pzvi ratios of 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 and a pzvi concentration of 11 2 mg l 0 2 mmol l the concentration tests were conducted using pzvi concentrations of 2 8 5 6 11 2 16 8 22 4 and 44 8 mg l and an h2o2 pzvi molar ratio of 2 0 for the optimised molar ratio and dosage concentration removal of the target contaminants was explored with the water ph adjusted to 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 and 7 0 the reaction times were all 30 min control tests involved monitoring the degradation of the target compounds under only h2o2 treatment in the dark at molar concentrations of 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 and 0 6 mmol l a schematic representation of the photo fenton pzvi reactor is shown in fig 1 the reactor was similar to the ones used in other photo fenton zvi studies 28 34 but air was used to cool the system to maintain 25 c room temperature instead of water one 800 ml beaker containing 600 ml of natural water at a ph of 3 0 spiked with the target compounds and with the optimised amounts of pzvi and h2o2 was placed in a sealed container made of lightproof plastic one magnet stirrer was placed at the bottom of the beaker and a uvc light tube was inserted vertically into the water air was pumped at 6 4 l min into the lower part of the container and flowed out from the upper part to counteract the water temperature generated by the light tube the reactor was on a magnet stirring machine which stirred at a speed of 120 rpm the uv lamp used was a uvc monochromatic low pressure mercury vapour lamp 11 w 240 v 254 nm wavelength 35 μmol m 2 s 1 light density philips holland 51 the reaction times in the series of photo fenton pzvi tests were 1 3 5 10 15 20 and 30 min for the uvc control tests the experimental solution placed in the beaker without the addition of fenton pzvi was treated under uvc light for 5 15 and 30 min all tests above were conducted in triplicates 2 3 degradation kinetics the degradation kinetics of the four target ppcp compounds during the uvc fenton pzvi process from natural water was modelled using the following pseudo first order eq 7 and second order eq 8 kinetic models 7 ln c t c 0 k 1 t 8 1 c t 1 c 0 k 2 t where k 1 is the observed pseudo first order rate constant min 1 52 k 2 is the observed second order rate constant l μg min 1 53 c t is the concentration μg l of an individual target compound at time t and c 0 is the initial concentration μg l of this compound to select the better model apart from the coefficient of correlation r 2 the sum of the squared errors sse and the chi squared statistic χ2 error functions were also employed 54 56 9 sse

points 2 4 characterization of pzvi after the photo fenton pzvi experiment iron powder was collected in small vials and freeze dried as soon as possible the treated iron powder was stored at 20 c under nitrogen to interrupt the oxidation process the surface morphology of the pzvi before and after the reaction was characterised using field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem secondary

chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms which are described in detail in our previous studies 11 57 were used for extraction and quantification of the four target compounds from the water the total organic carbon toc content was determined using a shimadzu toc l machine uk nitrite nitrate and phosphate concentrations after the pzvi process were measured using ion chromatography ic dionex ics

the added concentration 25 μg l of each compound and c f μg l is the final concentration 3 results and discussion 3 1 fenton pzvi process optimisation the effects of the tested h2o2 pzvi molar ratios h2o2 pzvi concentrations and ph values are shown in fig 2 as the h2o2 pzvi molar ratio increased from 0 5 to 2 0 the removal of the four compounds increased by approximately 30 on average fig 2 a at a molar ratio of 2 0 the removals were 66 3 87 3 48 1 and 90 3 for deet par caf and tcs respectively deet is usually regarded as a more recalcitrant compound than caf in biological treatments 11 58 however the results here indicate that the h2o2 pzvi fenton process may be a better choice for degrading deet than for degrading caf as in the case of the traditional h2o2 fe2 process for which the range of reported optimal ratios is wide 2 5 20 19 59 the reported range of optimal h2o2 zvi molar ratios for treating emerging contaminants and other phenolic compounds is also wide 0 25 10 31 52 60 in the present study the optimal h2o2 pzvi molar ratio was found to be 2 0 however when the molar ratio was increased from 2 0 to 3 0 the removal decreased slightly for all four compounds this may be attributed to the scavenging effects of h2o2 on ho radicals and the formation of radicals with lower oxidative potential eqs 12 and 13 15 12 h 2 o 2 ho ho 2 h 2 o 13 ho 2 ho h 2 o o 2 the scavenging process may consume the ho radicals generated and because ho2 is less reactive this may account for the decreased removal observed furthermore the inhibition of pzvi corrosion by high concentration of h2o2 may also cause the removal decline 26 31 61 the results of the control tests using h2o2 only without light radiation and pzvi are shown in fig s1 appendix a because of the oxidising property of hydrogen peroxide it is also used to treat refractory organic substances in wastewater 62 for various concentrations of hydrogen peroxide no obvious differences in removal were observed with average removal of approximately 20 for both deet and tcs and a removal of approximately 60 for par removal of caf was negligible indicating that caf is difficult to degrade using h2o2 compared to the control tests the h2o2 pzvi tests achieved higher removal especially for caf an increase from 10 to 50 when h2o2 was combined with pzvi fig 2 suggesting that ho radicals generated during the fenton pzvi process played a significant degradation role however the removal of the four compounds did not increase linearly with the h2o2 dose since h2o2 pzvi process is heterogenous limited pzvi surface sites and the inhibition of pzvi corrosion by high concentration of h2o2 may also restrict the overall performance when excessive h2o2 was added into the system leading to inhibition of the oxidative transformation pathways 31 63 in addition h2o2 may also be involved in other parallel reactions such as its self decomposition 64 eq 14 14 2h 2 o 2 o 2 2h 2 o the removal results for various h2o2 pzvi concentrations at a molar ratio of 2 0 are shown in fig 2 b as the concentration of spiked pzvi increased from 2 8 to 44 8 mg l 0 05 to 0 4 mmol l the removal of all four compounds initially increased rapidly and then more slowly this phenomenon has also been reported by other researchers 26 41 as the pzvi concentration increased from 22 4 mg l to 44 8 mg l the removal increased by less than 3 apart from the h2o2 pzvi reaction scavenging of ho radicals by h2o2 eq 12 and decomposition of h2o2 eq 14 can also occur in the aqueous phase simultaneously 65 which means that h2o2 cannot exist in water for a long time in addition whereas the h2o2 fe2 process is homogeneous the h2o2 pzvi reaction is heterogeneous with the oxidation of the target compounds their remaining concentrations gradually decrease leading to slowing of the reaction as the pzvi particles cannot remain uniformly distributed in the water and other substances may compete for the oxidising radicals 34 however the residual h2o2 concentration was not measured in this study and the possible explanation offered above is a speculation that needs to be investigated at a pzvi concentration of 44 8 mg l the final removals of deet par caf and tcs were 72 1 100 66 2 and 87 5 respectively unequal removal for different emerging contaminants have also been reported elsewhere 19 and can be explained by the properties of the compound structure and the competition for reactive zvi sites with other substances in water 16 20 61 although the removal at a pzvi concentration of 44 8 mg l were slightly higher than those at 22 4 mg l exploitation of bulk oxidant can lead to an unnecessary treatment cost increase 66 hence 22 4 mg l was chosen as the optimal pzvi concentration the conventional fenton process is greatly influenced by the reaction ph 15 the optimal initial ph value is typically approximately 3 16 67 69 but some studies have reported achievement of satisfactory results at higher ph values e g approximately 7 70 72 therefore in the present study the removals of the four target compounds at initial ph values of 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 and 7 0 were investigated fig 2 c due to small reagents dosage no obvious ph changes of solution were measured after all reactions as with the aforementioned results higher removals were achieved for par and tcs than for the other two compounds over the full range of ph values considered in general ppcp removals decreased with increasing ph with the highest removals 71 1 100 64 2 and 87 1 for deet par caf and tcs respectively achieved at a ph of 3 0 at a ph of 7 0 removals were much lower 30 4 75 1 11 1 and 66 1 respectively than at ph of 3 the decreased degradation performance at higher ph values may be attributed to the decomposition of h2o2 the lower oxidation potential of ho radicals and the formation of ferric hydroxide complexes 26 in addition the corrosion of iron also decreases with increasing ph and weaker oxidants such as ferryl ion may be generated rather than fe3 eq 15 at ph above 5 which is more selective than ho 26 31 15 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe iv e g feo 2 h 2 o all these possibilities may negatively affect the oxidation process however it should be noted that no significant differences p 0 05 t test in removal were observed for ph values of 2 0 versus 3 0 although at a ph of 3 0 the removals of par and caf were both 6 lower whereas those for deet and tcs were slightly higher 0 8 and 5 5 respectively at a very low ph e g ph 2 concentration decline of the fe oh 2 may negatively affect pzvi performance furthermore h2o2 is more stable at low ph because of the formation of h3o2 which limits the generation of ho radicals 15 for this reason although the removal of the target compounds was similar at ph values of 2 and 3 a ph of 3 was selected as the optimal initial ph 3 2 removal of target ppcp compounds under uvc fenton pzvi process the removal results achieved with the uvc fenton pzvi process are shown in fig 3 oxidation starts to occur immediately upon commencement of the test after only 1 min 29 6 80 3 3 1 and 88 4 of the deet par caf and tcs respectively were removed for the results reported above for the fenton pzvi experiment although the removals of deet and caf were lower than those for par and tcs after 30 min the removals achieved were 99 0 100 99 5 and 100 for deet par caf and tcs respectively demonstrating the excellent performance of the treatment the results of the control tests conducted using only uvc are also shown in fig 3 under uvc higher removals were achieved for par and tcs than for deet and caf after 30 min 50 0 90 0 24 3 and 93 9 removals were observed for deet par caf and tcs respectively the higher removals for par and tcs than for deet and tcs are consistent with results reported for tests conducted under natural light 57 it has also reported that light can favour the photo degradation of par and tcs 73 76 as the uvc has greater energy than natural visible light more ho radicals could be generated according to eq 6 therefore photo degradation of light sensitive compounds should be more rapid under uvc the deet par caf and tcs removals under uvc 35 μmol m 2 s 1 after just 5 min 30 0 74 0 10 3 and 90 3 respectively were notably higher than those observed under natural light 240 μmol m 2 s 1 for 7 days 1 2 46 2 1 1 and 57 6 respectively 57 the pseudo first order kinetic model has been widely reported as describing the degradation process of chemicals in the fenton fenton like and photo fenton processes well 26 77 78 the second order kinetic model has also been used to describe the fenton and photo fenton degradation processes 79 because the total removal of par and tcs at 30 min led to the inapplicability of the two models and above 80 of them were removed within the first minute to ensure the consistency the models were fitted using only observations from 1 to 20 min the results of r 2 sse and χ2 showed the best fitting trends of deet par and caf by pseudo first order models while second order kinetic model best described the tcs degradation trend in the present system tables 1 and s2 appendix a the fitted r 2 values of deet par and caf using pseudo first order models were 0 9963 0 9856 and 0 9876 compared to the second order kinetic models with r 2 values of 0 9255 0 7864 and 0 9005 respectively in contrast the r 2 values of tcs using pseudo first order and second order kinetic models were 0 8732 and 0 9092 respectively and a second order model usually implies that the degradation of a compound is controlled by its initial concentration 79 it should be noted that the kinetic fittings did not include the first minute as fig 3 shows most of the par and tcs 80 were degraded within the first minute indicating the degradation kinetics of them during this period may be different from the latter period however a short reaction period of 1 min makes sampling relatively difficult and less precise therefore further investigation into the very early stage of par and tcs degradation is recommended under other test conditions e g at a very low temperature to obtain a better understanding of the rapid degradation kinetic trends involved field emission scanning electron microscopy sem images obtained before and after the uvc fenton pzvi reaction are shown in fig 4 and confirm the spherical shape of pzvi particle aggregates before the reaction after the reaction corrosion was found on the pzvi surface and aggregation of small scale clusters and cotton like structures were observed the corrosion of the pzvi identified after the pzvi reaction confirms the surface oxidation of pzvi which led to the leaching of fe2 and fe3 from the pzvi surface those iron ions are responsible to react with h2o2 and uv radiation to produce ros for further reactions 31 78 the sem images also demonstrate that corrosion did not deplete all pzvi particles and the pzvi in the tested system was sufficient top left pzvi before uvc fenton process 1500 folds top right pzvi before uvc fenton process 8000 folds bottom left pzvi after uvc fenton process 1500 folds bottom right pzvi after uvc fenton process 8000 folds red circles indicate obvious corrosion x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps was used to study the surface chemical composition of the pzvi after the uvc fenton pzvi reaction the original spectra are shown in fig s2 appendix a fig 5 shows the fe2p core level spectrum the two fe2p3 2 and fe2p1 2 peaks in the fe2p spectrum at binding energies around 710 ev and 724 725 ev with shake up satellite peaks at around 719 1 ev and 733 ev indicate the presence of fe3 ions 80 a peak differentiating analysis was also conducted for the 710 ev binding energy peak which is displayed in the small inset graph in fig 5 after differentiating the peak binding energies of around 709 6 ev 710 8 ev and 711 8 ev corresponding to feo fe2o3 and feooh respectively were found these results are consistent with findings reported elsewhere 81 and the spectrum indicates that iron oxides and iron hydroxides existed which is also consistent with the corrosion phenomenon shown by the sem images 31 44 81 82 to confirm the oxygen species surrounding the iron ions o1s core level spectra were also differentiated fig 6 two peaks at binding energies of around 530 3 ev and 531 5 ev were found demonstrating the presence of lattice oxygen o2 and oh species 80 which further confirms the presence of iron oxides and iron hydroxide 3 3 general water parameters during uvc fenton pzvi process the concentrations of nitrite nitrate phosphate and toc during the uvc fenton pzvi process are shown in table 2 nitrite was totally removed after the treatment the removal of nitrate fluctuated between 35 and 50 which is a lower range than that of 50 68 reported elsewhere for a higher concentration g l level of zvi nanoparticles 83 because nitrate can only be reduced to nitrite while ho radicals can oxidise nitrite into nitrate the decreases in the concentrations of nitrite and nitrate can only be attributed to the reduction reaction by pzvi 45 61 83 in comparison lower phosphate removal was achieved for an initial phosphate concentration of 1 73 0 01 mg l final phosphate concentrations of 1 13 to 1 73 mg l 35 reduction were detected in this process phosphate removal is largely attributed to electrostatic adsorption and surface complexation of phosphate onto the iron powder surface 84 competition for iron active sites and adsorption desorption may lead to this low removal and fluctuation of the concentration the toc concentration decreased gradually from an initial value of 12 90 0 32 mg l to 10 58 0 13 mg l after 30 min or 18 removal other researchers have reported achieving toc removals greater than 60 using photo fenton zvi processes 28 34 38 or solely fenton zvi processes 26 27 80 85 the higher toc removal achieved in other studies can be attributed to the higher h2o2 pzvi doses g l concentration compared to 0 8 mmol l h2o2 longer reaction times 60 min or hours compared to 30 min and or higher reagent concentration ratios e g h2o2 zvi at 60 compared to 2 0 used in those studies in studies in which iron nails cuts have been employed to conduct h2o2 zvi processes up to 100 removal of humic acids from an initial concentration of 10 mg l from pure water within 60 min and around 50 60 removal of dissolved organic carbon from an initial concentration around 5 mg l from natural water within 60 or 75 min have been achieved but the iron dosages were 50 g l 86 88 despite insufficient toc mineralisation observed at a low h2o2 pzvi reagent dosage the high removals of the target ppcp compounds achieved in the present study suggest the suitability of this method for treating water for emerging contaminants nonetheless it is also suggested to investigate the toc mineralisation in the fenton process optimisation period as well as relevant control tests to compare the contributions of various toc removal pathways examination of the degradation products of the tested ppcp compounds created during the photo fenton pzvi process was not within the scope of the present study degradation pathways are typically explored when a single compound is studied although it would be more complex it would also be meaningful to examine the degradation pathways of the by products of mixed target compounds during the photo fenton pzvi process besides other aspects such as the investigation of pzvi adsorption effect for ppcps will further help understanding the mechanisms 4 conclusion in the present study the removal of four ppcp compounds deet par caf and tcs from natural water spiked concentration at 25 μg l using the photo uvc 35 μmol m 2 s 1 light density fenton pzvi process was investigated and optimised a molar ratio of h2o2 pzvi of 2 0 pzvi concentration of 22 4 mg l and sample ph of 3 0 maximised the removal of the target compounds from natural water at 71 1 100 64 2 and 87 1 for deet par caf and tcs respectively when coupled with uvc radiation the process removed 99 0 100 99 5 and 100 of deet par caf and tcs respectively after 30 min after the photo fenton pzvi process corrosion of the surface of iron powder and the presence of iron oxides and iron hydroxides were observed the pseudo first order kinetic model best fitted r 2 0 98 the degradation data of deet par and caf 1 20 min and the rapid elimination of tcs and par during the first minute of the reaction suggested the need for investigation into their behaviours and kinetics during the early degradation stage however lower removals of nitrate phosphate and toc from natural water were detected using the photo fenton pzvi process which may be attributed to the small h2o2 pzvi reagent dosage used in this study funding jianan li was sponsored by the china scholarship council csc no 201406320168 ucl dean s prize uk and qingdao university of technology talent

12935,the removal of four pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps namely diethyltoluamide deet paracetamol par caffeine caf and triclosan tcs at a spiked concentration of 25 μg l from natural water using the photo uvc fenton powdered zero valent iron pzvi process was investigated the results show that a molar ratio of h2o2 pzvi of 2 0 pzvi concentration of 22 4 mg l and ph of 3 0 maximised the removal of the target compounds at 71 1 100 64 2 and 87 1 for deet par caf and tcs respectively after 30 min in fenton pzvi process when this process was coupled with uvc radiation 29 6 80 3 3 1

degradation data of deet par and caf 1 20 min and because 80 of tcs and par degraded within the first minutes it is suggested to explore the kinetics during the initial period characterisations of pzvi after the photo fenton pzvi process indicated the corrosion of the surface of iron powder and the presence of iron oxides and iron hydroxides lower removals of nitrate 35 50 phosphate 35 and total organic carbon toc 18 were observed which may be attributed to the small h2o2 pzvi dosage used results of this investigation show that the photo fenton pzvi process has potential for efficient and cost effective removal of ppcps graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords advanced oxidation process photo fenton ppcps removal zero valent iron 1 introduction in recent years the problem of environmental contamination by pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps has caused increasing concern worldwide 1 2 these emerging contaminants have been detected in wastewater natural water groundwater soil biosolids and other biotopes 3 7 ppcps in the environment may pose risks e g toxicity to human and other creatures and heighten corresponding problems such as the occurrence of antibiotic resistance genes args 8 hence elimination of ppcps from the environment is a pressing concern for environmental researchers and engineers wastewater treatment plants wwtps are considered to be the main sources of ppcps in the environment 9 untreated ppcp compounds from wwtps enter the environment with the effluent discharged various treatment techniques for ppcp removal have been studied including conventional activated sludge coagulation constructed wetland slow sand filtration membrane filtration and others but these treatments vary greatly in their effectiveness in removing ppcp compounds 4 10 13 the fenton reaction an advanced oxidation process aop was discovered in 1894 by h j h fenton who found that tartaric acid could be oxidised by hydrogen peroxide activated by ferrous fe2 salts 14 the fenton reaction is a homogenous process during this reaction the ho radicals produced are a strong oxidising species that are responsible for the oxidation process eq 1 15 17 1 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe 3 ho ho for treating contaminants the ho radicals produced by the fenton reaction oxidise pollutants into small molecule compounds and further into carbon dioxide water and other inorganics 18 the fenton process has been proven to be effective in treating water to remove ppcps 19 20 and the combination of the fenton process with photolysis photo fenton has been reported to enhance the removal efficiency 21 25 although proven to be effective the homogenous fenton reaction is considered to have some inevitable drawbacks such as the requirement for large amounts of fe2 ions usually from feso4 the need for further treatment of iron ions and sludge and the acidification of effluents before decontamination 26 29 in recent years zero valent iron zvi has been employed to induce fenton oxidation and application of zvi fenton for ppcp degradation has been reported in few studies 27 30 31 unlike the traditional fenton process the zvi fenton reaction process is heterogeneous 32 during this process zvi is corroded and produces fe2 ions under the presence of h2o2 and h the fe2 react with h2o2 to produce reactive oxygen species ros such as ho radicals which can degrade ppcp contaminants eqs 2 4 31 33 34 apart from these main reactions the corrosion of the zvi surface in water may also occur under aerobic and or acidic conditions 35 36 2 fe 0 h 2 o 2 2h fe 2 2h 2 o 3 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe 3 ho ho 4 2fe 3 fe 0 3fe 2 unlike in the conventional fenton process both reductive and oxidative reactions can be initiated by the electron transfer on the zvi surface making the zvi fenton reaction process more versatile 37 in addition recycling of ferric fe3 iron into fe2 species at the iron surface can also take place as described by eq 4 27 other advantages of the zvi fenton process include the production of much less residue and the relatively lower cost compared to the use of ferrous salts and the recycling and reuse property of zvi particles 31 38 40 in recent years the photo fenton zvi process has been investigated to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the zvi fenton technique ultraviolet uv light is typically used for this purpose under uv light the following reactions take place 5 fe oh 2 hv fe 2 ho λ 580 nm 6 h 2 o 2 hv 2ho λ 310 nm under uv radiation photolysis of fe3 cations derived as described by eq 3 in acidic media yields fe2 cations eq 5 ho radicals are generated and regenerated fe2 cations can react with hydrogen peroxide again eq 3 33 in addition under radiation at a wavelength of 310 nm photolysis of hydrogen peroxide into ho radicals can also occur eq 6 16 although the overall rates of regeneration and the efficiency of the process described by eq 5 are low under radiation 15 additional ho radicals can be produced which increases the rate of oxidation nanoparticle zero valent iron nzvi has been employed in some studies using photo fenton zvi reaction 28 33 34 41 however apart from the high operational costs involved 42 the use of nano iron particles may also create recycling and after treatment problems since filtration of these nanoparticles is difficult 43 compared with nano iron particles iron powder is cheaper and easier to produce and handle which makes it a promising alternative in addition iron powder was also reported to have good recycling and reuse ability 40 however studies in which powdered zero valent iron pzvi has been used in the photo fenton reaction have typically focused more on removal of traditional pollutants such as solvent and nutrients 38 40 44 48 to the best of our knowledge pzvi has rarely been used in the photo fenton process to remove ppcps and no studies have been published on the use of this technique to treat deet par caf or tcs which are widely detected in the environment and reported to pose potential eco risks 1 6 49 50 therefore the aim of this work was to optimise the fenton pzvi process parameters for the removal of deet par caf and tcs from natural water in addition the removal and degradation kinetic trends during the uvc fenton pzvi process and the characteristics of iron powder before and after reaction were examined using field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials standards and chemicals of deet par caf and tcs were purchased from sigma aldrich uk the properties of the four compounds are shown in table s1 appendix a methanol and acetonitrile hplc grade were purchased from fisher scientific uk a stock solution of 1 mg ml mixed target compounds prepared in methanol was stored at 20 c and added to natural water to reach a spiked concentration of 25 μg l throughout the experiment pzvi 99 5 5 9 μm and a hydrogen peroxide solution 50 wt were purchased from sigma aldrich uk and fisher scientific uk respectively pzvi was not submitted to any treatment prior to the experiments the surface area of pzvi is 0 2988 m2 g determined by brunauer emmett teller bet quantachrome autosorb iq2 usa a working hydrogen peroxide solution was prepared by diluting the stock solution using ultrapure water ondeo purite is uk in this work natural water was collected from the regent s park lake london uk which had an average turbidity 2 ntu a conductivity around 1800 μs cm a ph in the range of 7 3 to 7 6 and a toc concentration of

was filtered through a 0 22 μm cellulose acetate membrane whatman uk 2 2 experimental design and procedure the experiment consisted of the fenton pzvi photo fenton pzvi and control tests fenton pzvi tests comprised the optimisation of the h2o2 pzvi molar ratio h2o2 pzvi concentration and solution ph the fenton pzvi test was conducted in batch mode using a shaker ika ks 260 uk 48 samples of 500 ml of natural water at a ph of 3 adjusted using h2so4 and naoh in all experiments 16 and spiked with the target compounds were put into six 600 ml glass bottles and shaken at 270 rpm to ensure thorough mixing a room temperature of approximately 25 c was maintained the shaking was started immediately after pzvi and h2o2 were added to the water the molar ratio tests were conducted using h2o2 pzvi ratios of 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 and a pzvi concentration of 11 2 mg l 0 2 mmol l the concentration tests were conducted using pzvi concentrations of 2 8 5 6 11 2 16 8 22 4 and 44 8 mg l and an h2o2 pzvi molar ratio of 2 0 for the optimised molar ratio and dosage concentration removal of the target contaminants was explored with the water ph adjusted to 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 and 7 0 the reaction times were all 30 min control tests involved monitoring the degradation of the target compounds under only h2o2 treatment in the dark at molar concentrations of 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 and 0 6 mmol l a schematic representation of the photo fenton pzvi reactor is shown in fig 1 the reactor was similar to the ones used in other photo fenton zvi studies 28 34 but air was used to cool the system to maintain 25 c room temperature instead of water one 800 ml beaker containing 600 ml of natural water at a ph of 3 0 spiked with the target compounds and with the optimised amounts of pzvi and h2o2 was placed in a sealed container made of lightproof plastic one magnet stirrer was placed at the bottom of the beaker and a uvc light tube was inserted vertically into the water air was pumped at 6 4 l min into the lower part of the container and flowed out from the upper part to counteract the water temperature generated by the light tube the reactor was on a magnet stirring machine which stirred at a speed of 120 rpm the uv lamp used was a uvc monochromatic low pressure mercury vapour lamp 11 w 240 v 254 nm wavelength 35 μmol m 2 s 1 light density philips holland 51 the reaction times in the series of photo fenton pzvi tests were 1 3 5 10 15 20 and 30 min for the uvc control tests the experimental solution placed in the beaker without the addition of fenton pzvi was treated under uvc light for 5 15 and 30 min all tests above were conducted in triplicates 2 3 degradation kinetics the degradation kinetics of the four target ppcp compounds during the uvc fenton pzvi process from natural water was modelled using the following pseudo first order eq 7 and second order eq 8 kinetic models 7 ln c t c 0 k 1 t 8 1 c t 1 c 0 k 2 t where k 1 is the observed pseudo first order rate

points 2 4 characterization of pzvi after the photo fenton pzvi experiment iron powder was collected in small vials and freeze dried as soon as possible the treated iron powder was stored at 20 c

the added concentration 25 μg l of each compound and c f μg l is the final concentration 3 results and discussion 3 1 fenton pzvi process optimisation the effects of the tested h2o2 pzvi molar ratios h2o2 pzvi concentrations and ph values are shown in fig 2 as the h2o2 pzvi molar ratio increased from 0 5 to 2 0 the removal of the four compounds increased by approximately 30 on average fig 2 a at a molar ratio of 2 0 the removals were 66 3 87 3 48 1 and 90 3 for deet par caf and tcs respectively deet is usually regarded as a more recalcitrant compound than caf in biological treatments 11 58 however the results here indicate that the h2o2 pzvi fenton process may be a better choice for degrading deet than for degrading caf as in the case of the traditional h2o2 fe2 process for which the range of reported optimal ratios is wide 2 5 20 19 59 the reported range of optimal h2o2 zvi molar ratios for treating emerging contaminants and other phenolic compounds is also wide 0 25 10 31 52 60 in the present study the optimal h2o2 pzvi molar ratio was found to be 2 0 however when the molar ratio was increased from 2 0 to 3 0 the removal decreased slightly for all four compounds this may be attributed to the scavenging effects of h2o2 on ho radicals and the formation of radicals with lower oxidative potential eqs 12 and 13 15 12 h 2 o 2 ho ho 2 h 2 o 13 ho 2 ho h 2 o o 2 the scavenging process may consume the ho radicals generated and because ho2 is less reactive this may account for the decreased removal observed furthermore the inhibition of pzvi corrosion by high concentration of h2o2 may also cause the removal decline 26 31 61 the results of the control tests using h2o2 only without light radiation and pzvi are shown in fig s1 appendix a because of the oxidising property of hydrogen peroxide it is also used to treat refractory organic substances in wastewater 62 for various concentrations of hydrogen peroxide no obvious differences in removal were observed with average removal of approximately 20 for both deet and tcs and a removal of approximately 60 for par removal of caf was negligible indicating that caf is difficult to degrade using h2o2 compared to the control tests the h2o2 pzvi tests achieved higher removal especially for caf an increase from 10 to 50 when h2o2 was combined with pzvi fig 2 suggesting that ho radicals generated during the fenton pzvi process played a significant degradation role however the removal of the four compounds did not increase linearly with the h2o2 dose since h2o2 pzvi process is heterogenous limited pzvi surface sites and the inhibition of pzvi corrosion by high concentration of h2o2 may also restrict the overall performance when excessive h2o2 was added into the system leading to inhibition of the oxidative transformation pathways 31 63 in addition h2o2 may also be involved in other parallel reactions such as its self decomposition 64 eq 14 14 2h 2 o 2 o 2 2h 2 o the removal results for various h2o2 pzvi concentrations at a molar ratio of 2 0 are shown in fig 2 b as the concentration of spiked pzvi increased from 2 8 to 44 8 mg l 0 05 to 0 4 mmol l the removal of all four compounds initially increased rapidly and then more slowly this phenomenon has also been reported by other researchers 26 41 as the pzvi concentration increased from 22 4 mg l to 44 8 mg l the removal increased by less than 3 apart from the h2o2 pzvi reaction scavenging of ho radicals by h2o2 eq 12 and decomposition of h2o2 eq 14 can also occur in the aqueous phase simultaneously 65 which means that h2o2 cannot exist in water for a long time in addition whereas the h2o2 fe2 process is homogeneous the h2o2 pzvi reaction is heterogeneous with the oxidation of the target compounds their remaining concentrations gradually decrease leading to slowing of the reaction as the pzvi particles cannot remain uniformly distributed in the water and other substances may compete for the oxidising radicals 34 however the residual h2o2 concentration was not measured in this study and the possible explanation offered above is a speculation that needs to be investigated at a pzvi concentration of 44 8 mg l the final removals of deet par caf and tcs were 72 1 100 66 2 and 87 5 respectively unequal removal for different emerging contaminants have also been reported elsewhere 19 and can be explained by the properties of the compound structure and the competition for reactive zvi sites with other substances in water 16 20 61 although the removal at a pzvi concentration of 44 8 mg l were slightly higher than those at 22 4 mg l exploitation of bulk oxidant can lead to an unnecessary treatment cost increase 66 hence 22 4 mg l was chosen as the optimal pzvi concentration the conventional fenton process is greatly influenced by the reaction ph 15 the optimal initial ph value is typically approximately 3 16 67 69 but some studies have reported achievement of satisfactory results at higher ph values e g approximately 7 70 72 therefore in the present study the removals of the four target compounds at initial ph values of 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 and 7 0 were investigated fig 2 c due to small reagents dosage no obvious ph changes of solution were measured after all reactions as with the aforementioned results higher removals were achieved for par and tcs than for the other two compounds over the full range of ph values considered in general ppcp removals decreased with increasing ph with the highest removals 71 1 100 64 2 and 87 1 for deet par caf and tcs respectively achieved at a ph of 3 0 at a ph of 7 0 removals were much lower 30 4 75 1 11 1 and 66 1 respectively than at ph of 3 the decreased degradation performance at higher ph values may be attributed to the decomposition of h2o2 the lower oxidation potential of ho radicals and the formation of ferric hydroxide complexes 26 in addition the corrosion of iron also decreases with increasing ph and weaker oxidants such as ferryl ion may be generated rather than fe3 eq 15 at ph above 5 which is more selective than ho 26 31 15 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe iv e g feo 2 h 2 o all these possibilities may negatively affect the oxidation process however it should be noted that no significant differences p 0 05 t test in removal were observed for ph values of 2 0 versus 3 0 although at a ph of 3 0 the removals of par and caf were both 6 lower whereas those for deet and tcs were slightly higher 0 8 and 5 5 respectively at a very low ph e g ph 2 concentration decline of the fe oh 2 may negatively affect pzvi performance furthermore h2o2 is more stable at low ph because of the formation of h3o2 which limits the generation of ho radicals 15 for this reason although the removal of the target compounds was similar at ph values of 2 and 3 a ph of 3 was selected as the optimal initial ph 3 2 removal of target ppcp compounds under uvc fenton pzvi process the removal results achieved with the uvc fenton pzvi process are shown in fig 3 oxidation starts to occur immediately upon commencement of the test after only 1 min 29 6 80 3 3 1 and 88 4 of the deet par caf and tcs respectively were removed for the results reported above for the fenton pzvi experiment although the removals of deet and caf were lower than those for par and tcs after 30 min the removals achieved were 99 0 100 99 5 and 100 for deet par caf and tcs respectively demonstrating the excellent performance of the treatment the results of the control tests conducted using only uvc are also shown in fig 3 under uvc higher removals were achieved for par and tcs than for deet and caf after 30 min 50 0 90 0 24 3 and 93 9 removals were observed for deet par caf and tcs respectively the higher removals for par and tcs than for deet and tcs are consistent with results reported for tests conducted under natural light 57 it has also reported that light can favour the photo degradation of par and tcs 73 76 as the uvc has greater energy than natural visible light more ho radicals could be generated according to eq 6 therefore photo degradation of light sensitive compounds should be more rapid under uvc the deet par caf and tcs removals under uvc 35 μmol m 2 s 1 after just 5 min 30 0 74 0 10 3 and 90 3 respectively were notably higher than those observed under natural light 240 μmol m 2 s 1 for 7 days 1 2 46 2 1 1 and 57 6 respectively 57 the pseudo first order kinetic model has been widely reported as describing the degradation process of chemicals in the fenton fenton like and photo fenton processes well 26 77 78 the second order kinetic model has also been used to describe the fenton and photo fenton degradation processes 79 because the total removal of par and tcs at 30 min led to the inapplicability of the two models and above 80 of them were removed within the first minute to ensure the consistency the models were fitted using only observations from 1 to 20 min the results of r 2 sse and χ2 showed the best fitting trends of deet par and caf by pseudo first order models while second order kinetic model best described the tcs degradation trend in the present system tables 1 and s2 appendix a the fitted r 2 values of deet par and caf using pseudo first order models were 0 9963 0 9856 and 0 9876 compared to the second order kinetic models with r 2 values of 0 9255 0 7864 and 0 9005 respectively in contrast the r 2 values of tcs using pseudo first order and second order kinetic models were 0 8732 and 0 9092 respectively and a second order model usually implies that the degradation of a compound is controlled by its initial concentration 79 it should be noted that the kinetic fittings did not include the first minute as fig 3 shows most of the par and tcs 80 were degraded within the first minute indicating the degradation kinetics of them during this period may be different from the latter period however a short reaction period of 1 min makes sampling relatively difficult and less precise therefore further investigation into the very early stage of par and tcs degradation is recommended under other test conditions e g at a very low temperature to obtain a better understanding of the rapid degradation kinetic trends involved field emission scanning electron microscopy sem images obtained before and after the uvc fenton pzvi reaction are shown in fig 4 and confirm the spherical shape of pzvi particle aggregates before the reaction after the reaction corrosion was found on the pzvi surface and aggregation of small scale clusters and cotton like structures were observed the corrosion of the pzvi identified after the pzvi reaction confirms the surface oxidation of pzvi which led to the leaching of fe2 and fe3 from the pzvi surface those iron ions are responsible to react with h2o2 and uv radiation to produce ros for further reactions 31 78 the sem images also demonstrate that corrosion did not deplete all pzvi particles and the pzvi in the tested system was sufficient top left pzvi

circles indicate obvious corrosion x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps was used to study the surface chemical composition of the pzvi after the uvc fenton pzvi reaction the original spectra are shown in fig s2 appendix a fig 5 shows the fe2p core level spectrum the two fe2p3 2 and fe2p1 2 peaks in the fe2p spectrum at binding energies around 710 ev and 724 725 ev with shake up satellite peaks at around 719 1 ev and 733 ev indicate the presence of fe3 ions 80 a peak differentiating analysis was also conducted for the 710 ev binding energy peak which is displayed in the small inset graph in fig 5 after differentiating the peak binding energies of around 709 6 ev 710 8 ev and 711 8 ev corresponding to feo fe2o3 and feooh respectively were found these results are consistent with findings reported elsewhere 81 and the spectrum indicates that iron oxides and iron hydroxides existed which is also consistent with the corrosion phenomenon shown by the sem images 31 44 81 82 to confirm the oxygen species surrounding the iron ions o1s core level spectra were also differentiated fig 6 two peaks at binding energies of around 530 3 ev and 531 5 ev were found demonstrating the presence of lattice oxygen o2 and oh species 80 which further confirms the presence of iron oxides and iron hydroxide 3 3 general water parameters during uvc fenton pzvi process the concentrations of nitrite nitrate phosphate and toc during the uvc fenton pzvi process are shown in table 2 nitrite was totally removed after the treatment the removal of nitrate fluctuated between 35 and 50 which is a lower range than that of 50 68 reported elsewhere for a higher concentration g l level of zvi nanoparticles 83 because nitrate can only be reduced to nitrite while ho radicals can oxidise nitrite into nitrate the decreases in the concentrations of nitrite and nitrate can only be attributed to the reduction reaction by pzvi 45 61 83 in comparison lower phosphate removal was achieved for an initial phosphate concentration of 1 73 0 01 mg l final phosphate concentrations of 1 13 to 1 73 mg l 35 reduction were detected in this process phosphate removal is largely attributed to electrostatic adsorption and surface complexation of phosphate onto the iron powder surface 84 competition for iron active sites and adsorption desorption may lead to this low removal and fluctuation of the concentration the toc concentration decreased gradually from an initial value of 12 90 0 32 mg l to 10 58 0 13 mg l after 30 min or 18 removal other researchers have reported achieving toc removals greater than 60 using photo fenton zvi processes 28 34 38 or solely fenton zvi processes 26 27 80 85 the higher toc removal achieved in other studies can be attributed to the higher h2o2 pzvi doses g l concentration compared to 0 8 mmol l h2o2 longer reaction times 60 min or hours compared to 30 min and or higher reagent concentration ratios e g h2o2 zvi at 60 compared to 2 0 used in those studies in studies in which iron nails cuts have been employed to conduct h2o2 zvi processes up to 100 removal of humic acids from an initial concentration of 10 mg l from pure water within 60 min and around 50 60 removal of dissolved organic carbon from an initial concentration around 5 mg l from natural water within 60 or 75 min have been achieved but the iron dosages were 50 g l 86 88 despite insufficient toc mineralisation observed at a low h2o2 pzvi reagent dosage the high removals of the target ppcp compounds achieved in the present study suggest the suitability of this method for treating water for emerging contaminants nonetheless it is also suggested to investigate the toc mineralisation in the fenton process optimisation period as well as relevant control tests to compare the contributions of various toc removal pathways examination of the degradation products of the tested ppcp compounds created during the photo fenton pzvi process was not within the scope of the present study degradation pathways are typically explored when a single compound is studied although it would be more complex it would also be meaningful to examine the degradation pathways of the by products of mixed target compounds during the photo fenton pzvi process besides other aspects such as the investigation of pzvi adsorption effect for ppcps will further help understanding the mechanisms 4 conclusion in the present study the removal of four ppcp compounds deet par caf and tcs from natural water spiked concentration at 25 μg l using the photo uvc 35 μmol m 2 s 1 light density fenton pzvi process was investigated and optimised a molar ratio of h2o2 pzvi of 2 0 pzvi concentration of 22 4 mg l and sample ph of 3 0 maximised the removal of the target compounds from natural water at 71 1 100 64 2 and 87 1 for deet par caf and tcs respectively when coupled with uvc radiation the process removed 99 0 100 99 5 and 100 of deet par caf and tcs respectively after 30 min after the photo fenton pzvi process corrosion of the surface of iron powder and the presence of iron oxides and iron hydroxides were observed the pseudo first order kinetic model best fitted r 2 0 98 the degradation data of deet par and caf 1 20 min and the rapid elimination of tcs and par during the first minute of the reaction suggested the need for investigation into their behaviours and kinetics during the early degradation stage however lower removals of nitrate phosphate and toc from natural water were detected using the photo fenton pzvi process which may be attributed to the small h2o2 pzvi reagent dosage used in this study funding jianan li was sponsored by the china scholarship council csc no 201406320168 ucl dean s prize uk and qingdao university of technology talent

for aquaculture effluent treatment and ammonium recovery zeolites mordenite and zeolite y were modified by calcination and or chemical modification with mgcl2 solution resulting in h zeolites and mg zeolites respectively the presence of competing cations na mg2 ca2 and k provides an obstacle for the ion exchange process between zeolites and nh4 mg modified zeolites can handle the interference of

industries have seen growth with increasing product demand over the years food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao reported a whopping 85 3 million tonnes of global fish production solely by aquaculture activities inclusive of both inland and marine waters in 2019 the reported value has contributed to 48 of global fish production in 2019 with an average annual growth rate of 4 4 in the last decade 1 with population growth and increased demand for aquatic products aquaculture activities are predicted to grow along with the volume of effluent generated aquaculture discharge imposes a threat towards water quality of surrounding environment if left untreated due to its complex nature the effluent contains dilute concentration of various nutrients mainly ammonium nh4 and phosphate ions po4 3 that provides the potential to cause eutrophication in discharge sites if not properly handled the source of these nutrients is from excretory products of aquatic species and leeching from leftover feed most aquaculture activities are conducted in stagnant pond culture systems and recirculating aquaculture systems ras 2 these systems are highly susceptible to accumulation of nutrients especially nh4 the accumulation of nh4 is risky because ammonia gas nh3 with concentrations above 1 5 ppm can be toxic to the cultured aquatic species 3 4 in this regard developing a rapid and efficient method in removing nh4 is crucial to improve water quality of aquaculture systems and reduce pollution upon discharged zeolites provides a promising option for handling dilute concentrations of nh4 due to its ion exchange mechanism zeolites are aluminosilicate minerals that has a tetrahedron structure as the primary building block 5 with this unique building block the framework of zeolite is negatively charged which can be stabilized by cations present in water sorption of nh4 by various zeolites natural and synthetic have been studied by many researchers and have proven that zeolites indeed have the capability to sorb nh4 in various concentration levels 6 8 the low cost thermal stability acid resistance and high cation exchange capacity of zeolites enabled them to be widely used in various treatment applications 9 the zeolites sorbed with nh4 can be used as slow releasing fertilizers for agriculture and reduce the leaching of nutrients in soil 10 the drawback of zeolites in sorbing ammonium is its sensitivity towards competing cations present in the wastewater various water sources ranging from freshwater to seawater is used for aquaculture activities as salinity of water increases the concentration of competing cations in wastewater increases drastically this would pose a problem since the presence of other cations during nh4 sorption will hinder its sorption efficiency 11 the presence of various cations in aquaculture wastewater is inevitable even in freshwater systems the zeolite used therefore must have high selectivity towards nh4 ions even in the presence of competing cations with this respect search for a suitable zeolite for aquaculture effluent treatment is crucial zeolites are commonly modified with cations such as sodium ions na magnesium ions mg2 calcium ions ca2 or potassium ions k to improve sorption of nh4 different zeolites have also been proven to exhibit different affinity towards nh4 the selectivity of zeolites for nh4 is affected by si al ratio framework structure types of cages and channels and properties of competing cations 12 soetardji et al studied the nh4 removal of natural and na modified mordenite with initial nh4 concentration of 10 mg l the results obtained by them stated that na modified mordenite had four times better nh4 removal efficiency compared to natural mordenite 8 nacl modification on natural zeolite was researched by alshameri and fellow researchers na modified zeolite was found to achieve equilibrium in a shorter period and also have higher nh4 removal efficiency compared to its unmodified counterpart 6 wang et al proved that synthetic zeolite modification with mgcl2 resulted in higher nh4 removal efficiency when treating solution of 300 mg l initial nh4 concentration 13 another engineered zeolite worth mentioning is zeolite n also known as mesolite according to research done by thornton et al the ammonium exchange capacity of zeolite n is greater than 51 mg nh4 n g of zeolite in solutions containing more than 500 mg l nh4 14 zeolite n possesses si al ratio of 1 and exhibits high retention of nh4 based on molecular dynamics simulation studies 15 16 unfortunately zeolite n is not commercially available and was not used for this research study 17 in this study two commercial zeolites namely mordenite and zeolite y with different framework structure and si al ratios were calcined and modified with mgcl2 solution the performance of the modified zeolites was evaluated in the presence of four competing cations na mg2 ca2 and k sorption and kinetic isotherm were employed for better understanding on the mechanisms of the sorption process real aquaculture wastewater was also used to test the practicality of the modified zeolites regeneration studies for the modified zeolite was also conducted although it is accepted that mg modified zeolites provides better nh4 removal efficiency than unmodified zeolites to our best knowledge none have assessed the hindrance of competing cations on nh4 removal efficiency on mg modified zeolites moreover there is no work being carried out on nh4 sorption and its regeneration based on real aquaculture effluent using mg modified zeolites 2 materials and method 2 1 zeolite modification two different types of commercial zeolites predominantly in the ammonium form were used for this study namely mordenite and zeolite y these zeolites were supplied by alfa aesar thermo scientific nh4 zeolite was modified by two different methods namely calcination and chemical modification with magnesium chloride solution mgcl2 the calcination of nh4 zeolites was performed at 450 c for 4 h in carbolite cwf 1300 chamber furnace this step ensures the desorption of ammonia from zeolites leaving behind h zeolites 18 the calcined zeolites were denoted as h mordenite and h zeolite y for the chemical modification h zeolites were used and further modified by treating them with a solution of 2 0 m mgcl2 solution the chemical treatment was conducted for three days with the introduction of fresh mgcl2 solution each day a volume of 150 ml of mgcl2 solution was used for each batch of modification and the mixture was stirred at 500 rpm after three days the mg modified zeolites were rinsed with deionised water and dried in the oven at 80 c for 1 day chemically modified zeolites were denoted as mg mordenite and mg zeolite y h zeolites and mg zeolites prepared were kept in a desiccator for storage purpose elemental composition of the modified zeolites was evaluated by using energy dispersive x ray edx analyser model quanta 450 feg fei table 1 displays the successful modification of mg2 ions onto h zeolites as shown by the increasing of mg element after the chemical modification with mgcl2 the si al ratio for h mordenite and mg mordenite are 9 09 and 11 02 respectively while h zeolite y and mg zeolite y have similar si al ratio of 2 6 the brunauer emmett teller bet surface area of modified zeolites was determined by using an adsorption analyser model micrometics asap 2020 h mordenite h zeolite y and mg mordenite have lower specific surface area of 361 m2 g 320 m2 g and 328 m2 g respectively while mg zeolite y has the highest specific surface area of 632 m2 g particle size of mg modified zeolites were also sought out using a particle size analyser model cilas 1180 liquid the particle size of mg mordenite and mg zeolite y was 4 75 μm and 3 87 μm respectively zeta potential of mg modified zeolites were tested by using zetasizer malvern zetasizer nano zs90 the zeta potential of mg mordenite and mg zeolite y were 21 58 0 48 mv and 23 94 1 05 mv respectively 2 2 synthetic solution preparation synthetic ammonium solution was prepared using analytical reagent grade of ammonium chloride merck synthetic salt solutions for the study of competitive cations were also prepared with sodium chloride merck potassium chloride merck calcium chloride sigma aldrich and anhydrous magnesium chloride 98 sigma aldrich the solutions were prepared with 18 2 mω deionised water 20 mg l of nh4 solutions were prepared fresh for every batch of experiments stock solutions of sodium chloride nacl potassium chloride kcl calcium chloride cacl2 and magnesium chloride mgcl2 were all prepared at 10 000 mg l by mixing aliquots of respective salt with deionised water 2 3 batch sorption experiment nh4 removal experiments were carried out in 250 ml beakers with fixed initial volume of sample solution at 100 ml initial nh4 concentration was fixed at 20 mg l for all the tests nh4 sorption efficiency was evaluated on several operating parameters including presence of competitive cations effect of contact time and effect of zeolite dosage the contact time was adjusted for each parameter and the agitation speed was fixed at 350 rpm batch sorption studies with the presence of individual competitive cations na k ca2 and mg2 were first performed to evaluate the retardation of nh4 removal efficiency for modified zeolites at zeolite dosage of 9 g l the concentration of these competing cations was varied in a range of 50 to 250 mg l the reaction time used for this study is 60 min for the kinetic study sorbent dosage of 9 g l was used sampling was done in intervals of 2 min for the first 10 min and at every subsequent 60 min mark in a period of 180 min moving on to sorption study the zeolite dosage was varied from 3 g l to 11 g l with a contact time determined from kinetic study concentration of nh4 in the sample solution before and after zeolite sorption was determined by the salicylate hypochlorite method 19 measurement of interfering cations such as na mg2 and ca2 were done using an atomic absorption spectrometer model shimadzu aa6680 while k was measured with lovibond tintometer the removal efficiency of nh4 was calculated using the following equation 1 removal efficiency c o c t c o 100 where c o and c t are the concentration of nh4 of sample solution mg l at initial and time of sampling respectively the amount of nh4 sorbed per gram of zeolite used mg g at equilibrium and time t q e and q t was required for the evaluation of kinetic and sorption isotherms the calculation was done using eqs 2 and 3 2 q e mg g zeolite m c o c e v 3 q t mg g zeolite m c o c t v where c e is the concentration on nh4 at equilibrium stage mg l c t is the concentration of nh4 at time t mg l m is the mass of zeolite used g and v is the volume of sample solution being treated l 2 4 sorption kinetic and isotherm studies 2 4 1 sorption kinetic study kinetic study on zeolite nh4 sorption was performed using four different models namely pseudo first order pfo rate expression pseudo second order pso rate expression elovich model and intraparticle diffusion model ipd by weber morris similar to sorption isotherms sorption kinetic also play a part in providing further insight on the sorption mechanism of sorbate on zeolites out of the four models ipd is the only model dealing with a single parameter while the rest are two parameter equations pfo and pso describe sorption process as chemisorption that involves the exchange or sharing of electrons between cations and zeolites as ion exchange or covalent forces 20 pfo will experience deviation if the sorption process takes longer than 20 to 30 min elovich model describes the sorption as a heterogenous multilayer sorption while ipd is used to determine whether intraparticle diffusion occurred during the sorption of nh4 the expressions related to the kinetic models used in this study is compiled in table 2 2 4 2 sorption isotherm studies for sorption study this research implements five different sorption isotherms to understand the nature of the zeolite sorption process the five sorption isotherms used are langmuir isotherm freundlich isotherm temkin isotherm sips isotherm langmuir freundlich isotherm and toth isotherm the first three isotherms are two parameter equations while the latter two are three parameter equations langmuir isotherm assumes a homogenous monolayer surface with each active sites having identical sorption energy 21 freundlich isotherm is a widely used isotherm that outlines the sorption characteristics on a heterogenous surface whereas temkin model included the sorbent sorbate interaction during modeling of parameters 22 sips isotherm is a combination of langmuir and freundlich isotherm that includes the possibility of a cation occupying two sites while toth isotherm have been proven to be good at describing sorption of heterogenous systems 23 the aforementioned isotherms are summarized in table 3 2 4 3 error analysis for both studies the isotherms were modelled using non linear regression method millar and fellow researchers have implemented this method of error analysis on the nh4 sorption isotherms for zeolites 24 by using non linear regression the error arising from linearization of the isotherm models and the dependence on coefficient of determination r2 can be avoided to obtain more accurate results the abusive use of r2 that is extremely sensitive to outliers and linearizing variables that are not linearly dependent will skew the results obtained by the models 25 ho et al provided a promising solution for error analysis by implementing the sum of normalized errors on several error functions on a given model the error function that shows the lowest sum of normalized error will be chosen as the error function of the isotherm 23 computation of isotherms and error analysis were all conducted in microsoft excel with the solver add on error functions used are listed in table 4 by rejecting the use of r2 it would be difficult to choose the optimum isotherm that best fit the experimental data millar and fellow researchers applied akaikes information criteria aic to quantify and select the best sorption isotherms used 4 aic nln sse n 2 n p 2 n p n p 1 n n p 1 where n is the number of experimental data n p is the number of parameters in isotherm and sse is the sum of squares error for the chosen error function 24 the model that has the lowest aic value is the model that experienced the best fitting with experimental data used 2 5 thermodynamic study thermodynamic parameters namely standard free energy change δg standard enthalpy change δh and standard entropy change δs were sought out based on batch sorption studies at different temperatures of 298 k 308 k and 318 k batch sorption studies were conducted at a constant initial nh4 of 20 mg l and varying zeolite dosage ranging from 3 to 13 g l the relationship of thermodynamic parameters is given by the following equation 5 g h t s where t is the absolute temperature of solution k δg was calculated by using the van t hoff equation 6 g rtln k where r is the universal gas constant j mol k and k is the thermodynamic equilibrium constant l mol the value of thermodynamic equilibrium constant was obtained from the computation of langmuir equilibrium constant kl from langmuir sorption isotherm presented in table 3 26 liu have conducted a comparative study between several equilibrium constants and stated that langmuir equilibrium constant is numerically equal to the thermodynamic equilibrium constant 27 the updated van t hoff equation is expressed below 7 g rtln k rtln k l t γ e rtln k l t where k l t is langmuir equilibrium constant at different temperatures l mol and γ e is the activity coefficient at sorption equilibrium with the current study focused on sorption of dilute nh4 concentrations the activity coefficient of sorbates was assumed to be 1 which further simplifies eq 7 values of δh and δs were computed by using the relation below 8 ln k h rt s r langmuir equilibrium constants were computed using the non linear regression method discussed in section 2 4 and thermodynamic parameters were calculated accordingly 2 6 sorption performance and its evaluation based on real aquaculture effluent practicality of modified zeolites were tested with both pre treated and untreated aquaculture effluent the effluent was collected from a freshwater fish farm pond at simpang lima perak malaysia currently rearing catfish clarias batrachus for pre treated wastewater collected effluent was treated with an ultrafiltration uf membrane vt pes with molecular weight cut off mwco of 3000 da from synder filtration to remove suspended solid and algae with that three water samples are subjected for zeolite removal namely aqueous synthetic solution s freshwater aquaculture effluent ww and ww pre treated by ultrafiltration ww uf synthetic solution with similar concentration of nh4 in the absence of competing cations was implemented as a control for comparison regeneration study of zeolites was conducted for all three water samples used zeolites were regenerated by treating them in 2 0 m mgcl2 solution for 2 h the regenerated zeolite samples were oven dried at 110 c for 4 h before reusing them to treat fresh feed for each cycle the contact time and agitation speed used were similar with batch sorption experiments water quality of ww and ww uf were tested and compiled in table 5 based on table 5 the main composition difference between ww and ww uf is only the turbidity value with pre treatment of uf most suspended solids and algae that might cause interference for nh4 removal efficiency is removed the ammonium concentration in the raw aquaculture effluent is around 24 88 0 31 mg l and it was not able to be retained by the uf membrane nonetheless the phosphate content is meagrely low of 5 mg l the aquaculture effluent contains various cations such as na k ca2 and mg2 which is expected to hinder the nh4 removal efficiency greatly 3 results and discussion 3 1 ammonium removal with the presence of competitive ions the effect of individual competitive cations on nh4 sorption efficiency is illustrated in fig 1 with the addition of competitive cations such as na mg2 ca2 and k the cation ammonium selectivity of mg zeolites and h zeolites were determined this study is crucial for practical application of zeolites since most wastewater exists in a complex nature and contain various cations that will hinder the capture of nh4 by zeolites fig 1 shows that mg zeolites displayed better nh4 removal efficiency compared to h zeolites it was due to the increase of exchangeable cations mg2 that enhances the ion exchange capability 28 as the concentration of individual competitive cations increased h zeolites revealed their limitation in handling complex wastewater by completely desorbing all sorbed nh4 when coexisting competitive cations reaches only 100 mg l in the solution chemically modified mg zeolites have proven to be the superior material in terms of nh4 sorption efficiency and its selectivity towards nh4 mg mordenite displayed higher nh4 affinity in the presence of divalent cations mg2 and ca2 by maintaining its sorption efficiency of 74 48 and 57 47 from initial efficiency of 88 62 even at 250 mg l of mg2 and ca2 respectively however the performance of mg mordenite was greatly retarded when coexist with monovalent ions na and k the sorption efficiency dropped to 4 5 at 250 mg l of na and showed complete desorption with the presence of 200 mg l of k mg zeolite y showed a generally better resistance towards the interference of all four competitive cations the efficiency decreased from 78 52 to 49 56 60 98 51 29 and 42 51 in the presence of na mg2 ca2 and k respectively table 5 shows that ww and ww uf samples consists of a considerable amount of competitive cations despite being from a freshwater source the complexity of aquaculture effluent comes into play as competing cations that cripple the nh4 removal efficiency red dotted lines in fig 1 indicates the concentration of competing cations in ww and ww uf this gives a basic idea on how modified zeolites will perform in the wastewater samples h modified zeolites is expected to show no nh4 sorption since they are incapable of handling competing cations at a concentration above 50 mg l on the other hand mg zeolite y is predicted to provide better nh4 removal efficiency compared to mg mordenite due to the low selectivity of nh4 by mg mordenite in the presence of monovalent cations based on the individual effects of competing cations zeolite that showed the best performance for nh4 sorption can be predicted even before the actual treatment of ww and ww uf was conducted h zeolites have almost zero resistance towards the interference of competitive cations according to townsend and coker the ion exchange process of zeolites is a stoichiometric reaction where the two phases zeolite and sample solution have to maintain electroneutrality based on table 6 charge density of nh4 is the lowest alongside k among all competing cations the substitution of cations with higher charge density on h zeolites is an equilibrium reaction where the net negative charge of tetrahedral framework of zeolites is being balanced out by the metal and alkali metal cations 29 higher concentration of competing cations compared to nh4 in sample solution also played a part on the effect of competitive cations for mg zeolites the nh4 selectivity is affected by properties of competing cations concentration of cations si al ratio of zeolites and its cage and channel system 12 the cation exchange selectivity for both mg zeolites follows the order of k na ca2 mg2 this order is according to the ascending value of pauling electronegativity and descending ionic radii of cations the findings are in line with results reported by fu and fellow researchers 9 11 results from fig 1 illustrates the difference in nh4 selectivity for mg mordenite and mg zeolite y it can be seen that the higher affinity of mg mordenite towards monovalent cations compared to divalent cations is speculated to be attributed to the high si al ratio 11 02 zeolites with high si al ratio favours cation with lower charge density 12 this explains why mg mordenite have better performance for nh4 removal compared to mg zeolite y low si al ratio 2 6 when it was exposed to solution with multivalent ions with increasing concentration of monovalent cations nh4 removal efficiency for mg mordenite drops drastically due to the proximity of charge densities between nh4 k and na this can also explain the diminished mg2 modification based on table 1 experienced by mordenite since it has less affinity towards mg2 that has the highest charge density however mg zeolite y with lower si al ratio did not show increased affinity towards higher charge density cations ca2 and mg2 with lower si al ratio the negative charge sites of zeolites are packed closer together which increases the electrostatic repulsion of interfering cations and magnify the possibility of volume exclusion effect on the zeolite 30 the volume exclusion effect restricts the entry of entering cations and causes only partial exchange between them 29 nakamura and company have performed monte carlo simulations on cation selectivity of zeolites and proved that framework structure also plays an important role in selectivity 31 mordenite and zeolite y possess distinct framework structure with mordenite having 1 orthorhombic cell made from 1 cage mor with 2 channels of 12 membered rings and 8 membered rings while zeolite y consists of a cubic cell made from 2 cages sodalite cage and d6r with only 1 12 membered rings as channel the pore structure of zeolites is attributed by the unit cell of each zeolite the pore opening of zeolite y is estimated to be 24 74 å on all sides of the crystal structure while mordenite have window openings of 18 1 å 20 5 å and 7 5 å for its orthorhombic structure 32 34 watanabe et al have conducted a study on synthetic zeolites with different framework structure and pore openings their findings showed that the zeolite with pore opening smaller than ionic diameter of nh4 exhibited zero nh4 sorption capacity while the rest showed increasing nh4 sorption capacity with increasing pore opening 35 with nh4 having significantly smaller size 2 92 å in ionic diameter than the aforementioned pore openings for both zeolites the pore structure would not have much effect on the sorption of nh4 based on size exclusion from this study it can be concluded that mg modified zeolites have better practicality when dealing with complex wastewater in view of this the following study will focus only on mg mordenite and mg zeolite y 3 2 sorption kinetic of ammonium on mg mordenite and mg zeolite y sorption of nh4 in relation to contact time was displayed in fig 2 both mg mordenite and mg zeolite y presented very rapid sorption and saturation of nh4 by achieving equilibrium and plateaued within 10 min of contact time the rapid saturation of mg modified zeolites implies that the nh4 is sorbed on zeolites by ion exchange process the fast reaction shown by both zeolites is attributed to the small particle size of the commercial zeolites 4 75 μm for mg mordenite and 3 87 μm for mg zeolite y huang et al have proven that a smaller particle size would speed up the time it takes to achieve equilibrium 39 nh4 sorption findings from watanabe et al also showed that several na modified synthetic zeolites reached its equilibrium state within 10 min of contact time 35 the rate of nh4 sorption is similar for both zeolites even though they have shown great differences in specific surface area 328 m2 g for mg mordenite and 632 m2 g for mg zeolite y this implies that specific surface area is not a controlling parameter of sorption with rapid ion exchanges shown for nh4 mg modified zeolites are a great choice for wastewater treatment since it would shorten the whole treatment process and opens up the possibility for continuous wastewater treatment processes with little residence time in sorbing columns kinetic sorption isotherms listed in table 3 were employed and computed to provide detail insight of nh4 sorption on mg modified zeolites non linear least squares plots for kinetic study of mg mordenite and mg zeolite y can be found in fig s3 and s4 based on the isotherm plots pfo pso and elovich model displayed good model fit for both zeolites while ipd by weber morris provided an isotherm plot that did not fit the experimental data at all the model that showed the best representation of experimental data based on aic verification table s3 and s4 is pseudo second order for both zeolites this implies that nh4 sorption is mostly governed by sharing of electrons between sorbent and sorbate our findings of pso as the best fitting model were in line with other researchers such as kameda and company and huang and fellow researchers kameda and company studied nh4 sorption of k modified l type zeolite having 6 1 si al ratio and 290 m2 g specific surface area with initial nh4 concentration of 10 mm 40 huang and fellow researchers implemented a natural zeolite from chende having si al ratio of 5 24 with initial nh4 concentration of 80 mg l 39 although these studies implemented different zeolites and initial nh4 concentration pso was chosen as the best fitting kinetic isotherm 3 3 ammonium sorption isotherm studies zeolite dosage plays an important role in determining the optimum amount of zeolite required for the best performance at a certain initial nh4 concentration based on fig 3 mg mordenite and mg zeolite y both resulted in a plateau of removal efficiency as zeolite dosage goes above 9 g l as zeolite dosage increases from 3 g l to 9 g l the nh4 removal efficiency gradually increased from 59 56 to 89 36 for mg mordenite while mg zeolite y showed increment from 50 67 to 73 69 the addition of zeolite increases the number of available active sites in the solution which facilitate the higher sorption of nh4 10 the plateau at 9 g l and above is likely caused by the particle aggregation with higher solid to liquid ratios which impeded the performance of mg modified zeolites by increasing the diffusional path length of nh4 11 zeta potential of mg modified zeolites were sought out to further clarify this statement the value of zeta potential provides insight for stable and unstable solid suspensions by considering a general dividing line this line states that particles having greater positive value than 30 mv and lower negative value of 30 mv are generally considered stable from results shown in section 3 1 mg mordenite and mg zeolite y are classified as unstable solid suspensions under this statement for having zeta potential of 21 58 0 48 mv and 23 94 1 05 mv respectively with zeta potential closer to zero the repulsive force of zeolite particles will be insufficient to prevent the aggregation of particles especially at higher dosage 41 sorption isotherms were determined for both mg mordenite and mg zeolite y based on the equation outlined in table 2 the sorption isotherms were fitted with obtained experimental data and are displayed in fig s1 and s2 for both mg mordenite and mg zeolite y the aic of each isotherm table s1 and s2 was computed and results showed that freundlich isotherm provided the most optimal fit for both mg mordenite and mg zeolite y this implies that nh4 sorption on both mg modified zeolites is on a heterogenous surface which assumes non uniformity in the sorption heat distribution and affinities of nh4 on the heterogenous zeolite surface 42 zeolites exhibiting surface heterogeneity is reasonable since the active sites for nh4 exchange are mainly on the cages of zeolites with the presence of channels the active sites would not be distributed homogenously across the zeolite surface but rather non uniformly several research on nh4 sorption on different zeolites also reported that freundlich isotherm provided the best fit for their data millar and fellow researchers studied sorption isotherms for both castle mountain zeolite and zeolite australia at initial nh4 concentration of 500 mg l by comparing between langmuir vageler competitive langmuir freundlich and temkin isotherms they concluded that freundlich isotherm showed the best fit and zeolite surface is heterogenous due to presence of different groups of exchange sites 24 wang et al conducted a nh4 sorption study on natural and na modified clinoptilolite with initial nh4 concentration of 250 mg l and realised that freundlich isotherm showed a better fit compared to langmuir isotherm 43 natural and na modified zeolite from china were also studied by fu and fellow researchers they concluded that the na modified zeolite is best modelled by freundlich isotherm compared to langmuir isotherm and inferred that calcination of natural zeolites increased surface heterogeneity 9 he et al also concluded that freundlich isotherm showed better fit compared to langmuir isotherm when conducting nh4 sorption studies on zeolite nax at varying nh4 concentrations 44 3 4 thermodynamic study thermodynamic studies for both mg modified zeolites were conducted and results are tabulated in table 7 with the increase in solution temperature the nh4 sorption by both mg modified zeolites experienced a reduction in removal efficiency the experimental data is presented in fig s5 and s6 our findings were in line with alshameri and fellow researchers which states that the elevated temperature weakens the binding forces between the zeolite framework and nh4 and thus decreases nh4 sorption capacity 6 chen et al studied the effect of solution temperature on nh4 removal efficiency for different zeolites with temperature ranging from 5 c to 50 c their results peaked at 30 c with temperatures higher or lower than room temperature showing decreased sorption performance 45 based on table 7 both mg mordenite zeolites showed negative values for δg this implies that the sorption of nh4 on mg modified zeolites is spontaneous and energetically favourable with higher negative δg values for mg mordenite the sorption process is more favourable compared to mg zeolite y which was reflected in higher nh4 removal efficiency displayed in fig 3 the δh and δs for both zeolites were also found to be negative negative values of δh indicates an exothermic process for the sorption of nh4 an exothermic process implies that an addition of heat increasing solution temperature would cause less nh4 to be sorbed at equilibrium conditions δs having negative values implies that nh4 removal efficiency is hindered by randomness of the system 6 the negative δs values also indicates that sorbed nh4 are distributed with greater order compared to nh4 present in the aqueous solution 46 3 5 ammonium removal from real aquaculture effluent based on water quality of aquaculture effluent reported in table 5 sampled wastewater consists of considerable amount of competing cations by using real wastewater the practicality and capability of mg modified zeolites to remove the ammonium under the influence of competing cations was tested fig 4 a illustrates the nh4 removal efficiency for mg modified zeolites when treating three types of water samples mg mordenite showed zero sorption capabilities for nh4 in handling ww and ww uf despite having 87 96 removal rate for synthetic ammonium solution on the other hand mg zeolite y displayed better performance with ammonium removal rate of 73 38 and 35 24 for synthetic ammonium solution and real effluent respectively based on the study performed in section 3 3 mg mordenite was known to have higher affinity for na and k although concentration of competing cations was lower in ww and ww uf compared to section 3 1 the simultaneous presence of all competing cations resulted in greater hindrance in nh4 sorption compared to their individual presence this can be explained by the equilibrated ion exchange phenomena experienced by zeolites and cations in the solution eq 5 5 9 zeo nnh 4 m n zeo m n nnh 4 when dealing with individual competing cations the ion exchange deals with less than two equilibrium reactions at the same time which are the competing cations and ammonium for treatment of ww and ww uf equilibrium for at least four different cations must be maintained for the ion exchange process although the study on individual competing cations was not capable of predicting the nh4 removal efficiency of mg modified zeolites the expectation that mg zeolite y would outperform mg mordenite was expected so the selection of zeolites could be done by solely analysing their performance towards the individual competing cations and comparing with concentration of competing cations in the wastewater of interest since mg mordenite displayed poor ammonium removal from ww and ww uf mg zeolite y was chosen to carry on with the detail performance evaluation to improve the nh4 removal efficiency dosage of mg zeolite y was increased the increment could be performed in two different ways the first way is by splitting the batch sorption into two steps of 9 g l zeolite dosage while the second sorption test was carried out by using 18 g l of mg zeolite y in a one step sorption process from the results illustrated in fig 4 b the two step sorption 57 33 had better performance compared to the one step sorption 45 60 with an increase in zeolite dosage more sorption site of mg zeolite y is available therefore the removal percentage was increased when the sorption process was split into two steps zeolites in the second stage had to deal with a lower concentration of competing cations since zeolites in the first stage have lowered their concentration by sorbing them besides it might be due to the higher sorption area due to the less aggregated particles in two dosing steps it is important to note that the removal efficiency is the accumulative efficiency of both steps with no significant different between sorption efficiency by two step mg zeolite y for ww and ww uf the direct application and treatment of zeolite on raw wastewater was proven to be feasible 3 6 ion exchange study towards competing ions based on table 4 mordenite consists of a minute amount of na while zeolite y has 1 34 of na element even after mgcl2 modification however na is undetectable in the solution upon equilibrated with ammonium which implies that the na on the zeolite y is non exchangeable this may be attributed to the presence of two different cages within zeolite y it is speculated that one of the cages have strong affinity towards na which explains why cation exchange for na did not occur during nh4 treatment while the other cage facilitated ion exchange between mg2 and nh4 a study conducted by howard presented similar findings where na from 16 out of 50 unit cells of synthetic zeolite y showed no occurrence of cation exchange when exposed to high concentrations of solutions with cs rb tl and nh4 47 similarly both zeolites showed insignificant amount of k and ca2 in the solution when treating the ammonium in the synthetic solution fig 5 shows the distribution of competing ions between the zeolite and solution mg mordenite that showed poorer nh4 sorption exhibited higher sorption towards na and k compared to mg zeolite y by sorbing 39 38 of na and 77 61 of k while mg zeolite y sorbed 26 3 of na and 55 42 of k mg zeolite y was observed to have better sorption percentage for ca2 by sorbing 61 17 of ca2 compared to mg mordenite having 41 88 of ca2 these findings are in line with results in section 3 3 whereby mg mordenite showed higher affinity for both na and k while mg zeolite y showed higher sorption of ca2 by implementing the 2nd step sorption of mg zeolite y the percentage of na k and ca2 sorbed in sample solution is 46 72 of na reduced from initial of 111 67 mg l 73 45 of k reduced from initial of 31 mg l and 92 13 of ca2 reduced from initial of 157 25 mg l these results indicate that mg zeolite y is capable of removing nh4 as well as competing cations especially ca2 at the same time therefore the mg zeolite y sorbent is a non selective sorbent for ammonium the distribution of mg2 for different water samples between zeolites and solution are illustrated in fig 6 since mg2 was used for the chemical modification of zeolites mg2 was expected to leach into the solution upon sorption synthetic solutions have null mg2 content in the solution initially but showed an increment of 31 79 mg l at the end of sorption this proved that the nh4 removal is indeed facilitated by an ion exchange process between the exchangeable cation sorbed on zeolite in this case is mg2 and free cation in synthetic solution in this case is nh4 for ww and ww uf water samples the mg2 concentration was increased from an initial concentration of 76 91 mg l to 154 73 mg l the desorbed amount of mg2 for ww and ww uf is around 77 81 mg l which is increased by two fold compared to synthetic solution the increased value is contributed also by the presence of na k and ca2 in the real solution which exchanged with the mg2 on the zeolite itself with the presence of these competing cations their ion exchange with mg2 are inevitable which results in greater values of mg2 being desorbed compared to solutions without competing cations the capability of mg zeolite y to sorb common cations na k and ca2 and nh4 at the same time reduced its efficiency in nh4 removal and required higher dosage of mg2 modified zeolite during real water sample treatment 3 7 regeneration study the advantage of ammonium removal via ion exchange is its ease of regeneration via simple chemical method in order to prove this hypothesis ten regeneration cycles of two step nh4 sorption process using mg zeolite y was performed as can be observed from fig 7 the batch sorption studies with synthetic aqueous solution exhibited highest sorption capacity compared to the real aquaculture effluent with increasing regeneration cycles the sorption capacity of mg zeolite y for synthetic solution was gradually decreased from 92 06 to 69 68 this is attributed to the incomplete desorption of nh4 during the regeneration process shown in fig s7 which led to a partial regeneration of mg zeolite y a partial regeneration would lower the performance due to a decreased amount of actual mg zeolite y in the solution katsou and fellow researchers stated that inner sphere complexation caused the incomplete desorption due to formation of irreversible covalent bonds 48 with every regeneration cycle a small amount of nh4 would remain on the zeolite which skews the equilibrium reaction and causes less sorption to occur however when mg zeolite y was implemented for ww and ww uf the zeolite showed more stable performance even after 10 cycles of regeneration the removal efficiency of mg zeolite y on ww uf fluctuated between the efficiency of 63 93 to 70 59 while performance on ww showed fluctuated efficiencies within 58 06 to 67 68 it was assumed that the sorption of competing cations from the previous cycle would be exchanged with nh4 on the next cycle thus compensating the decreasing site contributed by mg2 alone the sorption of competing cations from previous water samples would increase the amount of exchangeable cation in zeolite y this explains why mg zeolite y did not experience a significant decrement as regeneration cycles proceeded for ww and uf the regeneration study on mg zeolite y proved that the reuse of these zeolites was possible since the performance was maintained throughout the regeneration cycles some concerns regarding cost efficiency might be raised due to the high dosage of commercial zeolites required alongside with mgcl2 solution as modification and regeneration solution for the sorption process with that being said a simple cost analysis was performed by comparing three different scenarios and their respective cost of operation for 10 sorption cycles for scenario 1 the cost of having fresh zeolites every cycle was computed scenario 2 considered the cost of operation when zeolite was reused for each cycle while using fresh mgcl2 for regeneration the last scenario evaluated the costs of sorption if both zeolite and regeneration solution were reused for all 10 cycles table 8 summarises the comparative cost analysis of each scenario if 9 g l of zeolite y was used the operating cost reduction for scenario 2 and 3 compared to scenario 1 is around 80 and 89 while scenario 3 costs 44 less when compared to scenario 2 regeneration study of mg zeolite y has proven that the reuse of these zeolites after regeneration is practical since the nh4 removal efficiency was maintained even after 10 regeneration cycles for the reuse of regeneration solution fig s8 illustrated that the nh4 removal efficiency of regenerated mg zeolite y for fresh and reused regenerants showed minimal difference throughout the 10 regeneration cycles this proved that the reuse of regeneration solution is feasible and would not decrease the performance of regenerated mg zeolite y by reusing mg zeolite y and regeneration solution the cost of operation is greatly reduced giving it more practicability 4 conclusion this work concluded that the competing ions na mg2 ca2 or k in the aquaculture effluent has significant impact towards zeolite for ammonium removal mg modified zeolites can handle the interference of competing cations better than h modified zeolites the trend for cation selectivity for mg mordenite is k na nh4 ca2 mg2 while mg zeolite y showed greater nh4 affinity with a trend of nh4 k na ca2 mg2 mg mordenite higher si al ratio had better nh4 removal efficiency compared to mg zeolite y lower si al ratio however mg mordenite experienced a greater hindrance compared to mg zeolite y in the presence of monovalent cations sorption kinetic and isotherm studies revealed that the optimum zeolite dosage is 9 g l whereas the contact time required to achieve equilibrium is only 10 min for both mg modified zeolites the sorption study showed that freundlich isotherm and pseudo second order kinetic model were the best fitted models for both mg modified zeolites among the isotherms studied thermodynamic parameters obtained from thermodynamic study on both mg modified zeolites indicated that the nh4 sorption is an exothermic process for real aquaculture effluent treatment mg zeolite y was chosen as the more suitable zeolite compared to mg mordenite by comparing nh4 removal efficiency mg zeolite y showed a 35 removal efficiency while mg mordenite displayed zero removal efficiency for real aquaculture effluent treatment by implementing a two step sorption process the nh4 removal efficiency is able to be increased to 64 the regeneration study of mg zeolite y using mgcl2 modification in wastewater samples also shows that reusability of mg zeolite y is feasible mg zeolite y have shown to have moderate selectivity towards nh4 especially with the presence of multivalent cations but its regeneration is promising the reusability of both zeolites and regeneration solution increases the cost efficiency of the sorption process direct application of mg zeolite y to the raw wastewater with high suspended solid is possible since there was no significant difference between performance on raw wastewater and ultrafiltration treated wastewater credit

12936,aquaculture effluents consist of dilute nutrients such as ammonium nh4 is harmful to the environment and toxic to aquatic species this research investigated the practicality of modified zeolites for aquaculture effluent treatment and ammonium recovery zeolites mordenite and zeolite y were modified by calcination and or chemical modification with mgcl2 solution resulting in h zeolites and mg zeolites respectively the presence of competing cations na mg2 ca2 and k provides an obstacle for the ion exchange process between zeolites and nh4 mg modified zeolites can handle the interference of competing cations better than h modified zeolites with the trend for cation selectivity for mg mordenite is k na nh4 ca2 mg2 the optimum zeolite dosage for both mg modified zeolites was 9 g l both mg modified zeolites showed better fit of freundlich isotherm and pseudo second order kinetic model by conducting thermodynamic studies the nh4 sorption for both mg modified zeolites were found out to be an exothermic process mg zeolite y showed better nh4 removal efficiency compared to mg mordenite for real aquaculture effluent treatment this showed that mg zeolite y exhibited higher nh4 selectivity and was more practical in handling the complex aquaculture effluent a two step sorption process using 9 g l mg zeolite y was proposed which led to an increased nh4 removal efficiency of 64 18 a 10 cycles regeneration study concluded that mg zeolite y have good reusability potential a simple cost analysis showed an 89 reduction in cost by comparing between fresh zeolites every cycle and reusing both zeolites and regeneration solution for 10 cycles graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords aquaculture effluent ammonium sorption zeolites competing ion selectivity 1 introduction aquaculture industries have seen growth with increasing product demand over the years food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao reported a whopping 85 3 million tonnes of global fish production solely by aquaculture activities inclusive of both inland and marine waters in 2019 the reported value has contributed to 48 of global fish production in 2019 with an average annual growth rate of 4 4 in the last decade 1 with population growth and increased demand for aquatic products aquaculture activities are predicted to grow along with the volume of effluent generated aquaculture discharge imposes a threat towards water quality of surrounding environment if left untreated due to its complex nature the effluent contains dilute concentration of various nutrients mainly ammonium nh4 and phosphate ions po4 3 that provides the potential to cause eutrophication in discharge sites if not properly handled the source of these nutrients is from excretory products of aquatic species and leeching from leftover feed most aquaculture activities are conducted in stagnant pond culture systems and recirculating aquaculture systems ras 2 these systems are highly susceptible to accumulation of nutrients especially nh4 the accumulation of nh4 is risky because ammonia gas nh3 with concentrations above 1 5 ppm can be toxic to the cultured aquatic species 3 4 in this regard developing a rapid and efficient method in removing nh4 is crucial to improve water quality of aquaculture systems and reduce pollution upon discharged zeolites provides a promising option for handling dilute concentrations of nh4 due to its ion exchange mechanism zeolites are aluminosilicate minerals that has a tetrahedron structure as the primary building block 5 with this unique building block the framework of zeolite is negatively charged which can be stabilized by cations present in water sorption of nh4 by various zeolites natural and synthetic have been studied by many researchers and have proven that zeolites indeed have the capability to sorb nh4 in various concentration levels 6 8 the low cost thermal stability acid resistance and high cation exchange capacity of zeolites enabled them to be widely used in various treatment applications 9 the zeolites sorbed with nh4 can be used as slow releasing fertilizers for agriculture and reduce the leaching of nutrients in soil 10 the drawback of zeolites in sorbing ammonium is its sensitivity towards competing cations present in the wastewater various water sources ranging from freshwater to seawater is used for aquaculture activities as salinity of water increases the concentration of competing cations in wastewater increases drastically this would pose a problem since the presence of other cations during nh4 sorption will hinder its sorption efficiency 11 the presence of various cations in aquaculture wastewater is inevitable even in freshwater systems the zeolite used therefore must have high selectivity towards nh4 ions even in the presence of competing cations with this respect search for a suitable zeolite for aquaculture effluent treatment is crucial zeolites are commonly modified with cations such as sodium ions na magnesium ions mg2 calcium ions ca2 or potassium ions k to improve sorption of nh4 different zeolites have also been proven to exhibit different affinity towards nh4 the selectivity of zeolites for nh4 is affected by si al ratio framework structure types of cages and channels and properties of competing cations 12 soetardji et al studied the nh4 removal of natural and na modified mordenite with initial nh4 concentration of 10 mg l the results obtained by them stated that na modified mordenite had four times better nh4 removal efficiency compared to natural mordenite 8 nacl modification on natural zeolite was researched by alshameri and fellow researchers na modified zeolite was found to achieve equilibrium in a shorter period and also have higher nh4 removal efficiency compared to its unmodified counterpart 6 wang et al proved that synthetic zeolite modification with mgcl2 resulted in higher nh4 removal efficiency when treating solution of 300 mg l initial nh4 concentration 13 another engineered zeolite worth mentioning is zeolite n also known as mesolite according to research done by thornton et al the ammonium exchange capacity of zeolite n is greater than 51 mg nh4 n g of zeolite in solutions containing more than 500 mg l nh4 14 zeolite n possesses si al ratio of 1 and exhibits high retention of nh4 based on molecular dynamics simulation studies 15 16 unfortunately zeolite n is not commercially available and was not used for this research study 17 in this study two commercial zeolites namely mordenite and zeolite y with different framework structure and si al ratios were calcined and modified with mgcl2 solution the performance of the modified zeolites was evaluated in the presence of four competing cations na mg2 ca2 and k sorption and kinetic isotherm were employed for better understanding on the mechanisms of the sorption process real aquaculture wastewater was also used to test the practicality of the modified zeolites regeneration studies for the modified zeolite was also conducted although it is accepted that mg modified zeolites provides better nh4 removal efficiency than unmodified zeolites to our best knowledge none have assessed the hindrance of competing cations on nh4 removal efficiency on mg modified zeolites moreover there is no work being carried out on nh4 sorption and its regeneration based on real aquaculture effluent using mg modified zeolites 2 materials and method 2 1 zeolite modification two different types of commercial zeolites predominantly in the ammonium form were used for this study namely mordenite and zeolite y these zeolites were supplied by alfa aesar thermo scientific nh4 zeolite was modified by two different methods namely calcination and chemical modification with magnesium chloride solution mgcl2 the calcination of nh4 zeolites was performed at 450 c for 4 h in carbolite cwf 1300 chamber furnace this step ensures the desorption of ammonia from zeolites leaving behind h zeolites 18 the calcined zeolites were denoted as h mordenite and h zeolite y for the chemical modification h zeolites were used and further modified by treating them with a solution of 2 0 m mgcl2 solution the chemical treatment was conducted for three days with the introduction of fresh mgcl2 solution each day a volume of 150 ml of mgcl2 solution was used for each batch of modification and the mixture was stirred at 500 rpm after three days the mg modified zeolites were rinsed with deionised water and dried in the oven at 80 c for 1 day chemically modified zeolites were denoted as mg mordenite and mg zeolite y h zeolites and mg zeolites prepared were kept in a desiccator for storage purpose elemental composition of the modified zeolites was evaluated by using energy dispersive x ray edx analyser model quanta 450 feg fei table 1 displays the successful modification of mg2 ions onto h zeolites as shown by the increasing of mg element after the chemical modification with mgcl2 the si al ratio for h mordenite and mg mordenite are 9 09 and 11 02 respectively while h zeolite y and mg zeolite y have similar si al ratio of 2 6 the brunauer emmett teller bet surface area of modified zeolites was determined by using an adsorption analyser model micrometics asap 2020 h mordenite h zeolite y and mg mordenite have lower specific surface area of 361 m2 g 320 m2 g and 328 m2 g respectively while mg zeolite y has the highest specific surface area of 632 m2 g particle size of mg modified zeolites were also sought out using a particle size analyser model cilas 1180 liquid the particle size of mg mordenite and mg zeolite y was 4 75 μm and 3 87 μm respectively zeta potential of mg modified zeolites were tested by using zetasizer malvern zetasizer nano zs90 the zeta potential of mg mordenite and mg zeolite y were 21 58 0 48 mv and 23 94 1 05 mv respectively 2 2 synthetic solution preparation synthetic ammonium solution was prepared using analytical reagent grade of ammonium chloride merck synthetic salt solutions for the study of competitive cations were also prepared with sodium chloride merck potassium chloride merck calcium chloride sigma aldrich and anhydrous magnesium chloride 98 sigma aldrich the solutions were prepared with 18 2 mω deionised water 20 mg l of nh4 solutions were prepared fresh for every batch of experiments stock solutions of sodium chloride nacl potassium chloride kcl calcium chloride cacl2 and magnesium chloride mgcl2 were all prepared at 10 000 mg l by mixing aliquots of respective salt with deionised water 2 3 batch sorption experiment nh4 removal experiments were carried out in 250 ml beakers with fixed initial volume of sample solution at 100 ml initial nh4 concentration was fixed at 20 mg l for all the tests nh4 sorption efficiency was evaluated on several operating parameters including presence of competitive cations effect of contact time and effect of zeolite dosage the contact time was adjusted for each parameter and the agitation speed was fixed at 350 rpm batch sorption studies with the presence of individual competitive cations na k ca2 and mg2 were first performed to evaluate the retardation of nh4 removal efficiency for modified zeolites at zeolite dosage of 9 g l the concentration of these competing cations was varied in a range of 50 to 250 mg l the reaction time used for this study is 60 min for the kinetic study sorbent dosage of 9 g l was used sampling was done in intervals of 2 min for the first 10 min and at every subsequent 60 min mark in a period of 180 min moving on to sorption study the zeolite dosage was varied from 3 g l to 11 g l with a contact time determined from kinetic study concentration of nh4 in the sample solution before and after zeolite sorption was determined by the salicylate hypochlorite method 19 measurement of interfering cations such as na mg2 and ca2 were done using an atomic absorption spectrometer model shimadzu aa6680 while k was measured with lovibond tintometer the removal efficiency of nh4 was calculated using the following equation 1 removal efficiency c o c t c o 100 where c o and c t are the concentration of nh4 of sample solution mg l at initial and time of sampling respectively the amount of nh4 sorbed per gram of zeolite used mg g at equilibrium and time t q e and q t was required for the evaluation of kinetic and sorption isotherms the calculation was done using eqs 2 and 3 2 q e mg g zeolite m c o c e v 3 q t mg g zeolite m c o c t v where c e is the concentration on nh4 at equilibrium stage mg l c t is the concentration of nh4 at time t mg l m is the mass of zeolite used g and v is the volume of sample solution being treated l 2 4 sorption kinetic and isotherm studies 2 4 1 sorption kinetic study kinetic study on zeolite nh4 sorption was performed using four different models namely pseudo first order pfo rate expression pseudo second order pso rate expression elovich model and intraparticle diffusion model ipd by weber morris similar to sorption isotherms sorption kinetic also play a part in providing further insight on the sorption mechanism of sorbate on zeolites out of the four models ipd is the only model dealing with a single parameter while the rest are two parameter equations pfo and pso describe sorption process as chemisorption that involves the exchange or sharing of electrons between cations and zeolites as ion exchange or covalent forces 20 pfo will experience deviation if the sorption process takes longer than 20 to 30 min elovich model describes the sorption as a heterogenous multilayer sorption while ipd is used to determine whether intraparticle diffusion occurred during the sorption of nh4 the expressions related to the kinetic models used in this study is compiled in table 2 2 4 2 sorption isotherm studies for sorption study this research implements five different sorption isotherms to understand the nature of the zeolite sorption process the five sorption isotherms used are langmuir isotherm freundlich isotherm temkin isotherm sips isotherm langmuir freundlich isotherm and toth isotherm the first three isotherms are two parameter equations while the latter two are three parameter equations langmuir isotherm assumes a homogenous monolayer surface with each active sites having identical sorption energy 21 freundlich isotherm is a widely used isotherm that outlines the sorption characteristics on a heterogenous surface whereas temkin model included the sorbent sorbate interaction during modeling of parameters 22 sips isotherm is a combination of langmuir and freundlich isotherm that includes the possibility of a cation occupying two sites while toth isotherm have been proven to be good at describing sorption of heterogenous systems 23 the aforementioned isotherms are summarized in table 3 2 4 3 error analysis for both studies the isotherms were modelled using non linear regression method millar and fellow researchers have implemented this method of error analysis on the nh4 sorption isotherms for zeolites 24 by using non linear regression the error arising from linearization of the isotherm models and the dependence on coefficient of determination r2 can be avoided to obtain more accurate results the abusive use of r2 that is extremely sensitive to outliers and linearizing variables that are not linearly dependent will skew the results obtained by the models 25 ho et al provided a promising solution for error analysis by implementing the sum of normalized errors on several error functions on a given model the error function that shows the lowest sum of normalized error will be chosen as the error function of the isotherm 23 computation of isotherms and error analysis were all conducted in microsoft excel with the solver add on error functions used are listed in table 4 by rejecting the use of r2 it would be difficult to choose the optimum isotherm that best fit the experimental data millar and fellow researchers applied akaikes information criteria aic to quantify and select the best sorption isotherms used 4 aic nln sse n 2 n p 2 n p n p 1 n n p 1 where n is the number of experimental data n p is the number of parameters in isotherm and sse is the sum of squares error for the chosen error function 24 the model that has the lowest aic value is the model that experienced the best fitting with experimental data used 2 5 thermodynamic study thermodynamic parameters namely standard free energy change δg standard enthalpy change δh and standard entropy change δs were sought out based on batch sorption studies at different temperatures of 298 k 308 k and 318 k batch sorption studies were conducted at a constant initial nh4 of 20 mg l and varying zeolite dosage ranging from 3 to 13 g l the relationship of thermodynamic parameters is given by the following equation 5 g h t s where t is the absolute temperature of solution k δg was calculated by using the van t hoff equation 6 g rtln k where r is the universal gas constant j mol k and k is the thermodynamic equilibrium constant l mol the value of thermodynamic equilibrium constant was obtained from the computation of langmuir equilibrium constant kl from langmuir sorption isotherm presented in table 3 26 liu have conducted a comparative study between several equilibrium constants and stated that langmuir equilibrium constant is numerically equal to the thermodynamic equilibrium constant 27 the updated van t hoff equation is expressed below 7 g rtln k rtln k l t γ e rtln k l t where k l t is langmuir equilibrium constant at different temperatures l mol and γ e is the activity coefficient at sorption equilibrium with the current study focused on sorption of dilute nh4 concentrations the activity coefficient of sorbates was assumed to be 1 which further simplifies eq 7 values of δh and δs were computed by using the relation below 8 ln k h rt s r langmuir equilibrium constants were computed using the non linear regression method discussed in section 2 4 and thermodynamic parameters were calculated accordingly 2 6 sorption performance and its evaluation based on real aquaculture effluent practicality of modified zeolites were tested with both pre treated and untreated aquaculture effluent the effluent was collected from a freshwater fish farm pond at simpang lima perak malaysia currently rearing catfish clarias batrachus for pre treated wastewater collected effluent was treated with an ultrafiltration uf membrane vt pes with molecular weight cut off mwco of 3000 da from synder filtration to remove suspended solid and algae with that three water samples are subjected for zeolite removal namely aqueous synthetic solution s freshwater aquaculture effluent ww and ww pre treated by ultrafiltration ww uf synthetic solution with similar concentration of nh4 in the absence of competing cations was implemented as a control for comparison regeneration study of zeolites was conducted for all three water samples used zeolites were regenerated by treating them in 2 0 m mgcl2 solution for 2 h the regenerated zeolite samples were oven dried at 110 c for 4 h before reusing them to treat fresh feed for each cycle the contact time and agitation speed used were similar with batch sorption experiments water quality of ww and ww uf were tested and compiled in table 5 based on table 5 the main composition difference between ww and ww uf is only the turbidity value with pre treatment of uf most suspended solids and algae that might cause interference for nh4 removal efficiency is removed the ammonium concentration in the raw aquaculture effluent is around 24 88 0 31 mg l and it was not able to be retained by the uf membrane nonetheless the phosphate content is meagrely low of 5 mg l the aquaculture effluent contains various cations such as na k ca2 and mg2 which is expected to hinder the nh4 removal efficiency greatly 3 results and discussion 3 1 ammonium removal with the presence of competitive ions the effect of individual competitive cations on nh4 sorption efficiency is illustrated in fig 1 with the addition of competitive cations such as na mg2 ca2 and k the cation ammonium selectivity of mg zeolites and h zeolites were determined this study is crucial for practical application of zeolites since most wastewater exists in a complex nature and contain various cations that will hinder the capture of nh4 by zeolites fig 1 shows that mg zeolites displayed better nh4 removal efficiency compared to h zeolites it was due to the increase of exchangeable cations mg2 that enhances the ion exchange capability 28 as the concentration of individual competitive cations increased h zeolites revealed their limitation in handling complex wastewater by completely desorbing all sorbed nh4 when coexisting competitive cations reaches only 100 mg l in the solution chemically modified mg zeolites have proven to be the superior material in terms of nh4 sorption efficiency and its selectivity towards nh4 mg mordenite displayed higher nh4 affinity in the presence of divalent cations mg2 and ca2 by maintaining its sorption efficiency of 74 48 and 57 47 from initial efficiency of 88 62 even at 250 mg l of mg2 and ca2 respectively however the performance of mg mordenite was greatly retarded when coexist with monovalent ions na and k the sorption efficiency dropped to 4 5 at 250 mg l of na and showed complete desorption with the presence of 200 mg l of k mg zeolite y showed a generally better resistance towards the interference of all four competitive cations the efficiency decreased from 78 52 to 49 56 60 98 51 29 and 42 51 in the presence of na mg2 ca2 and k respectively table 5 shows that ww and ww uf samples consists of a considerable amount of competitive cations despite being from a freshwater source the complexity of aquaculture effluent comes into play as competing cations that cripple the nh4 removal efficiency red dotted lines in fig 1 indicates the concentration of competing cations in ww and ww uf this gives a basic idea on how modified zeolites will perform in the wastewater samples h modified zeolites is expected to show no nh4 sorption since they are incapable of handling competing cations at a concentration above 50 mg l on the other hand mg zeolite y is predicted to provide better nh4 removal efficiency compared to mg mordenite due to the low selectivity of nh4 by mg mordenite in the presence of monovalent cations based on the individual effects of competing cations zeolite that showed the best performance for nh4 sorption can be predicted even before the actual treatment of ww and ww uf was conducted h zeolites have almost zero resistance towards the interference of competitive cations according to townsend and coker the ion exchange process of zeolites is a stoichiometric reaction where the two phases zeolite and sample solution have to maintain electroneutrality based on table 6 charge density of nh4 is the lowest alongside k among all competing cations the substitution of cations with higher charge density on h zeolites is an equilibrium reaction where the net negative charge of tetrahedral framework of zeolites is being balanced out by the metal and alkali metal cations 29 higher concentration of competing cations compared to nh4 in sample solution also played a part on the effect of competitive cations for mg zeolites the nh4 selectivity is affected by properties of competing cations concentration of cations si al ratio of zeolites and its cage and channel system 12 the cation exchange selectivity for both mg zeolites follows the order of k na ca2 mg2 this order is according to the ascending value of pauling electronegativity and descending ionic radii of cations the findings are in line with results reported by fu and fellow researchers 9 11 results from fig 1 illustrates the difference in nh4 selectivity for mg mordenite and mg zeolite y it can be seen that the higher affinity of mg mordenite towards monovalent cations compared to divalent cations is speculated to be attributed to the high si al ratio 11 02 zeolites with high si al ratio favours cation with lower charge density 12 this explains why mg mordenite have better performance for nh4 removal compared to mg zeolite y low si al ratio 2 6 when it was exposed to solution with multivalent ions with increasing concentration of monovalent cations nh4 removal efficiency for mg mordenite drops drastically due to the proximity of charge densities between nh4 k and na this can also explain the diminished mg2 modification based on table 1 experienced by mordenite since it has less affinity towards mg2 that has the highest charge density however mg zeolite y with lower si al ratio did not show increased affinity towards higher charge density cations ca2 and mg2 with lower si al ratio the negative charge sites of zeolites are packed closer together which increases the electrostatic repulsion of interfering cations and magnify the possibility of volume exclusion effect on the zeolite 30 the volume exclusion effect restricts the entry of entering cations and causes only partial exchange between them 29 nakamura and company have performed monte carlo simulations on cation selectivity of zeolites and proved that framework structure also plays an important role in selectivity 31 mordenite and zeolite y possess distinct framework structure with mordenite having 1 orthorhombic cell made from 1 cage mor with 2 channels of 12 membered rings and 8 membered rings while zeolite y consists of a cubic cell made from 2 cages sodalite cage and d6r with only 1 12 membered rings as channel the pore structure of zeolites is attributed by the unit cell of each zeolite the pore opening of zeolite y is estimated to be 24 74 å on all sides of the crystal structure while mordenite have window openings of 18 1 å 20 5 å and 7 5 å for its orthorhombic structure 32 34 watanabe et al have conducted a study on synthetic zeolites with different framework structure and pore openings their findings showed that the zeolite with pore opening smaller than ionic diameter of nh4 exhibited zero nh4 sorption capacity while the rest showed increasing nh4 sorption capacity with increasing pore opening 35 with nh4 having significantly smaller size 2 92 å in ionic diameter than the aforementioned pore openings for both zeolites the pore structure would not have much effect on the sorption of nh4 based on size exclusion from this study it can be concluded that mg modified zeolites have better practicality when dealing with complex wastewater in view of this the following study will focus only on mg mordenite and mg zeolite y 3 2 sorption kinetic of ammonium on mg mordenite and mg zeolite y sorption of nh4 in relation to contact time was displayed in fig 2 both mg mordenite and mg zeolite y presented very rapid sorption and saturation of nh4 by achieving equilibrium and plateaued within 10 min of contact time the rapid saturation of mg modified zeolites implies that the nh4 is sorbed on zeolites by ion exchange process the fast reaction shown by both zeolites is attributed to the small particle size of the commercial zeolites 4 75 μm for mg mordenite and 3 87 μm for mg zeolite y huang et al have proven that a smaller particle size would speed up the time it takes to achieve equilibrium 39 nh4 sorption findings from watanabe et al also showed that several na modified synthetic zeolites reached its equilibrium state within 10 min of contact time 35 the rate of nh4 sorption is similar for both zeolites even though they have shown great differences in specific surface area 328 m2 g for mg mordenite and 632 m2 g for mg zeolite y this implies that specific surface area is not a controlling parameter of sorption with rapid ion exchanges shown for nh4 mg modified zeolites are a great choice for wastewater treatment since it would shorten the whole treatment process and opens up the possibility for continuous wastewater treatment processes with little residence time in sorbing columns kinetic sorption isotherms listed in table 3 were employed and computed to provide detail insight of nh4 sorption on mg modified zeolites non linear least squares plots for kinetic study of mg mordenite and mg zeolite y can be found in fig s3 and s4 based on the isotherm plots pfo pso and elovich model displayed good model fit for both zeolites while ipd by weber morris provided an isotherm plot that did not fit the experimental data at all the model that showed the best representation of experimental data based on aic verification table s3 and s4 is pseudo second order for both zeolites this implies that nh4 sorption is mostly governed by sharing of electrons between sorbent and sorbate our findings of pso as the best fitting model were in line with other researchers such as kameda and company and huang and fellow researchers kameda and company studied nh4 sorption of k modified l type zeolite having 6 1 si al ratio and 290 m2 g specific surface area with initial nh4 concentration of 10 mm 40 huang and fellow researchers implemented a natural zeolite from chende having si al ratio of 5 24 with initial nh4 concentration of 80 mg l 39 although these studies implemented different zeolites and initial nh4 concentration pso was chosen as the best fitting kinetic isotherm 3 3 ammonium sorption isotherm studies zeolite dosage plays an important role in determining the optimum amount of zeolite required for the best performance at a certain initial nh4 concentration based on fig 3 mg mordenite and mg zeolite y both resulted in a plateau of removal efficiency as zeolite dosage goes above 9 g l as zeolite dosage increases from 3 g l to 9 g l the nh4 removal efficiency gradually increased from 59 56 to 89 36 for mg mordenite while mg zeolite y showed increment from 50 67 to 73 69 the addition of zeolite increases the number of available active sites in the solution which facilitate the higher sorption of nh4 10 the plateau at 9 g l and above is likely caused by the particle aggregation with higher solid to liquid ratios which impeded the performance of mg modified zeolites by increasing the diffusional path length of nh4 11 zeta potential of mg modified zeolites were sought out to further clarify this statement the value of zeta potential provides insight for stable and unstable solid suspensions by considering a general dividing line this line states that particles having greater positive value than 30 mv and lower negative value of 30 mv are generally considered stable from results shown in section 3 1 mg mordenite and mg zeolite y are classified as unstable solid suspensions under this statement for having zeta potential of 21 58 0 48 mv and 23 94 1 05 mv respectively with zeta potential closer to zero the repulsive force of zeolite particles will be insufficient to prevent the aggregation of particles especially at higher dosage 41 sorption isotherms were determined for both mg mordenite and mg zeolite y based on the equation outlined in table 2 the sorption isotherms were fitted with obtained experimental data and are displayed in fig s1 and s2 for both mg mordenite and mg zeolite y the aic of each isotherm table s1 and s2 was computed and results showed that freundlich isotherm provided the most optimal fit for both mg mordenite and mg zeolite y this implies that nh4 sorption on both mg modified zeolites is on a heterogenous surface which assumes non uniformity in the sorption heat distribution and affinities of nh4 on the heterogenous zeolite surface 42 zeolites exhibiting surface heterogeneity is reasonable since the active sites for nh4 exchange are mainly on the cages of zeolites with the presence of channels the active sites would not be distributed homogenously across the zeolite surface but rather non uniformly several research on nh4 sorption on different zeolites also reported that freundlich isotherm provided the best fit for their data millar and fellow researchers studied sorption isotherms for both castle mountain zeolite and zeolite australia at initial nh4 concentration of 500 mg l by comparing between langmuir vageler competitive langmuir freundlich and temkin isotherms they concluded that freundlich isotherm showed the best fit and zeolite surface is heterogenous due to presence of different groups of exchange sites 24 wang et al conducted a nh4 sorption study on natural and na modified clinoptilolite with initial nh4 concentration of 250 mg l and realised that freundlich isotherm showed a better fit compared to langmuir isotherm 43 natural and na modified zeolite from china were also studied by fu and fellow researchers they concluded that the na modified zeolite is best modelled by freundlich isotherm compared to langmuir isotherm and inferred that calcination of natural zeolites increased surface heterogeneity 9 he et al also concluded that freundlich isotherm showed better fit compared to langmuir isotherm when conducting nh4 sorption studies on zeolite nax at varying nh4 concentrations 44 3 4 thermodynamic study thermodynamic studies for both mg modified zeolites were conducted and results are tabulated in table 7 with the increase in solution temperature the nh4 sorption by both mg modified zeolites experienced a reduction in removal efficiency the experimental data is presented in fig s5 and s6 our findings were in line with alshameri and fellow researchers which states that the elevated temperature weakens the binding forces between the zeolite framework and nh4 and thus decreases nh4 sorption capacity 6 chen et al studied the effect of solution temperature on nh4 removal efficiency for different zeolites with temperature ranging from 5 c to 50 c their results peaked at 30 c with temperatures higher or lower than room temperature showing decreased sorption performance 45 based on table 7 both mg mordenite zeolites showed negative values for δg this implies that the sorption of nh4 on mg modified zeolites is spontaneous and energetically favourable with higher negative δg values for mg mordenite the sorption process is more favourable compared to mg zeolite y which was reflected in higher nh4 removal efficiency displayed in fig 3 the δh and δs for both zeolites were also found to be negative negative values of δh indicates an exothermic process for the sorption of nh4 an exothermic process implies that an addition of heat increasing solution temperature would cause less nh4 to be sorbed at equilibrium conditions δs having negative values implies that nh4 removal efficiency is hindered by randomness of the system 6 the negative δs values also indicates that sorbed nh4 are distributed with greater order compared to nh4 present in the aqueous solution 46 3 5 ammonium removal from real aquaculture effluent based on water quality of aquaculture effluent reported in table 5 sampled wastewater consists of considerable amount of competing cations by using real wastewater the practicality and capability of mg modified zeolites to remove the ammonium under the influence of competing cations was tested fig 4 a illustrates the nh4 removal efficiency for mg modified zeolites when treating three types of water samples mg mordenite showed zero sorption capabilities for nh4 in handling ww and ww uf despite having 87 96 removal rate for synthetic ammonium solution on the other hand mg zeolite y displayed better performance with ammonium removal rate of 73 38 and 35 24 for synthetic ammonium solution and real effluent respectively based on the study performed in section 3 3 mg mordenite was known to have higher affinity for na and k although concentration of competing cations was lower in ww and ww uf compared to section 3 1 the simultaneous presence of all competing cations resulted in greater hindrance in nh4 sorption compared to their individual presence this can be explained by the equilibrated ion exchange phenomena experienced by zeolites and cations in the solution eq 5 5 9 zeo nnh 4 m n zeo m n nnh 4 when dealing with individual competing cations the ion exchange deals with less than two equilibrium reactions at the same time which are the competing cations and ammonium for treatment of ww and ww uf equilibrium for at least four different cations must be maintained for the ion exchange process although the study on individual competing cations was not capable of predicting the nh4 removal efficiency of mg modified zeolites the expectation that mg zeolite y would outperform mg mordenite was expected so the selection of zeolites could be done by solely analysing their performance towards the individual competing cations and comparing with concentration of competing cations in the wastewater of interest since mg mordenite displayed poor ammonium removal from ww and ww uf mg zeolite y was chosen to carry on with the detail performance evaluation to improve the nh4 removal efficiency dosage of mg zeolite y was increased the increment could be performed in two different ways the first way is by splitting the batch sorption into two steps of 9 g l zeolite dosage while the second sorption test was carried out by using 18 g l of mg zeolite y in a one step sorption process from the results illustrated in fig 4 b the two step sorption 57 33 had better performance compared to the one step sorption 45 60 with an increase in zeolite dosage more sorption site of mg zeolite y is available therefore the removal percentage was increased when the sorption process was split into two steps zeolites in the second stage had to deal with a lower concentration of competing cations since zeolites in the first stage have lowered their concentration by sorbing them besides it might be due to the higher sorption area due to the less aggregated particles in two dosing steps it is important to note that the removal efficiency is the accumulative efficiency of both steps with no significant different between sorption efficiency by two step mg zeolite y for ww and ww uf the direct application and treatment of zeolite on raw wastewater was proven to be feasible 3 6 ion exchange study towards competing ions based on table 4 mordenite consists of a minute amount of na while zeolite y has 1 34 of na element even after mgcl2 modification however na is undetectable in the solution upon equilibrated with ammonium which implies that the na on the zeolite y is non exchangeable this may be attributed to the presence of two different cages within zeolite y it is speculated that one of the cages have strong affinity towards na which explains why cation exchange for na did not occur during nh4 treatment while the other cage facilitated ion exchange between mg2 and nh4 a study conducted by howard presented similar findings where na from 16 out of 50 unit cells of synthetic zeolite y showed no occurrence of cation exchange when exposed to high concentrations of solutions with cs rb tl and nh4 47 similarly both zeolites showed insignificant amount of k and ca2 in the solution when treating the ammonium in the synthetic solution fig 5 shows the distribution of competing ions between the zeolite and solution mg mordenite that showed poorer nh4 sorption exhibited higher sorption towards na and k compared to mg zeolite y by sorbing 39 38 of na and 77 61 of k while mg zeolite y sorbed 26 3 of na and 55 42 of k mg zeolite y was observed to have better sorption percentage for ca2 by sorbing 61 17 of ca2 compared to mg mordenite having 41 88 of ca2 these findings are in line with results in section 3 3 whereby mg mordenite showed higher affinity for both na and k while mg zeolite y showed higher sorption of ca2 by implementing the 2nd step sorption of mg zeolite y the percentage of na k and ca2 sorbed in sample solution is 46 72 of na reduced from initial of 111 67 mg l 73 45 of k reduced from initial of 31 mg l and 92 13 of ca2 reduced from initial of 157 25 mg l these results indicate that mg zeolite y is capable of removing nh4 as well as competing cations especially ca2 at the same time therefore the mg zeolite y sorbent is a non selective sorbent for ammonium the distribution of mg2 for different water samples between zeolites and solution are illustrated in fig 6 since mg2 was used for the chemical modification of zeolites mg2 was expected to leach into the solution upon sorption synthetic solutions have null mg2 content in the solution initially but showed an increment of 31 79 mg l at the end of sorption this proved that the nh4 removal is indeed facilitated by an ion exchange process between the exchangeable cation sorbed on zeolite in this case is mg2 and free cation in synthetic solution in this case is nh4 for ww and ww uf water samples the mg2 concentration was increased from an initial concentration of 76 91 mg l to 154 73 mg l the desorbed amount of mg2 for ww and ww uf is around 77 81 mg l which is increased by two fold compared to synthetic solution the increased value is contributed also by the presence of na k and ca2 in the real solution which exchanged with the mg2 on the zeolite itself with the presence of these competing cations their ion exchange with mg2 are inevitable which results in greater values of mg2 being desorbed compared to solutions without competing cations the capability of mg zeolite y to sorb common cations na k and ca2 and nh4 at the same time reduced its efficiency in nh4 removal and required higher dosage of mg2 modified zeolite during real water sample treatment 3 7 regeneration study the advantage of ammonium removal via ion exchange is its ease of regeneration via simple chemical method in order to prove this hypothesis ten regeneration cycles of two step nh4 sorption process using mg zeolite y was performed as can be observed from fig 7 the batch sorption studies with synthetic aqueous solution exhibited highest sorption capacity compared to the real aquaculture effluent with increasing regeneration cycles the sorption capacity of mg zeolite y for synthetic solution was gradually decreased from 92 06 to 69 68 this is attributed to the incomplete desorption of nh4 during the regeneration process shown in fig s7 which led to a partial regeneration of mg zeolite y a partial regeneration would lower the performance due to a decreased amount of actual mg zeolite y in the solution katsou and fellow researchers stated that inner sphere complexation caused the incomplete desorption due to formation of irreversible covalent bonds 48 with every regeneration cycle a small amount of nh4 would remain on the zeolite which skews the equilibrium reaction and causes less sorption to occur however when mg zeolite y was implemented for ww and ww uf the zeolite showed more stable performance even after 10 cycles of regeneration the removal efficiency of mg zeolite y on ww uf fluctuated between the efficiency of 63 93 to 70 59 while performance on ww showed fluctuated efficiencies within 58 06 to 67 68 it was assumed that the sorption of competing cations from the previous cycle would be exchanged with nh4 on the next cycle thus compensating the decreasing site contributed by mg2 alone the sorption of competing cations from previous water samples would increase the amount of exchangeable cation in zeolite y this explains why mg zeolite y did not experience a significant decrement as regeneration cycles proceeded for ww and uf the regeneration study on mg zeolite y proved that the reuse of these zeolites was possible since the performance was maintained throughout the regeneration cycles some concerns regarding cost efficiency might be raised due to the high dosage of commercial zeolites required alongside with mgcl2 solution as modification and regeneration solution for the sorption process with that being said a simple cost analysis was performed by comparing three different scenarios and their respective cost of operation for 10 sorption cycles for scenario 1 the cost of having fresh zeolites every cycle was computed scenario 2 considered the cost of operation when zeolite was reused for each cycle while using fresh mgcl2 for regeneration the last scenario evaluated the costs of sorption if both zeolite and regeneration solution were reused for all 10 cycles table 8 summarises the comparative cost analysis of each scenario if 9 g l of zeolite y was used the operating cost reduction for scenario 2 and 3 compared to scenario 1 is around 80 and 89 while scenario 3 costs 44 less when compared to scenario 2 regeneration study of mg zeolite y has proven that the reuse of these zeolites after regeneration is practical since the nh4 removal efficiency was maintained even after 10 regeneration cycles for the reuse of regeneration solution fig s8 illustrated that the nh4 removal efficiency of regenerated mg zeolite y for fresh and reused regenerants showed minimal difference throughout the 10 regeneration cycles this proved that the reuse of regeneration solution is feasible and would not decrease the performance of regenerated mg zeolite y by reusing mg zeolite y and regeneration solution the cost of operation is greatly reduced giving it more practicability 4 conclusion this work concluded that the competing ions na mg2 ca2 or k in the aquaculture effluent has significant impact towards zeolite for ammonium removal mg modified zeolites can handle the interference of competing cations better than h modified zeolites the trend for cation selectivity for mg mordenite is k na nh4 ca2 mg2 while mg zeolite y showed greater nh4 affinity with a trend of nh4 k na ca2 mg2 mg mordenite higher si al ratio had better nh4 removal efficiency compared to mg zeolite y lower si al ratio however mg mordenite experienced a greater hindrance compared to mg zeolite y in the presence of monovalent cations sorption kinetic and isotherm studies revealed that the optimum zeolite dosage is 9 g l whereas the contact time required to achieve equilibrium is only 10 min for both mg modified zeolites the sorption study showed that freundlich isotherm and pseudo second order kinetic model were the best fitted models for both mg modified zeolites among the isotherms studied thermodynamic parameters obtained from thermodynamic study on both mg modified zeolites indicated that the nh4 sorption is an exothermic process for real aquaculture effluent treatment mg zeolite y was chosen as the more suitable zeolite compared to mg mordenite by comparing nh4 removal efficiency mg zeolite y showed a 35 removal efficiency while mg mordenite displayed zero removal efficiency for real aquaculture effluent treatment by implementing a two step sorption process the nh4 removal efficiency is able to be increased to 64 the regeneration study of mg zeolite y using mgcl2 modification in wastewater samples also shows that reusability of mg zeolite y is feasible mg zeolite y have shown to have moderate selectivity towards nh4 especially with the presence of multivalent cations but its regeneration is promising the reusability of both zeolites and regeneration solution increases the cost efficiency of the sorption process direct application of mg zeolite y to the raw wastewater with high suspended solid is possible since there was no significant difference between performance on raw wastewater and ultrafiltration treated wastewater credit

12937,in the present study to remove heavy metal ions cd2 and pb2 from aqueous solution and industrial effluent a new magnetic nanocomposite based on eggshell starch fe3o4 nanoparticles was used as an effective adsorbent ftir analysis showed that the magnetic composite is well synthesized and has different functional groups that can be effective in the adsorption process in addition the vsm test showed that the magnetic nanocomposite had a superparamagnetic property the bet value for magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 nanoparticles was determined to be 35 648 m2 g higher than eggshell nanoparticles the maximum decontamination efficiency of cd2 96 38 and pb2 97 86 was obtained at ph 7 and 6 respectively temperature 25 c contact time of 60 min metal concentration of 10 mg l and adsorbent dose of 1 g l the results showed that the adsorption process of the desired ions using eggshell starch fe3o4 nanoparticles follows a pseudo second order and the langmuir models the langmuir capacity for cd2 and pb2 adsorption using eggshell starch fe3o4 was computed at 48 54 and 57 14 mg g respectively the value of the g parameter for the adsorption process of cd2 and pb2 was determined in the span of 20 g 0 kj mol which suggests that the adsorption process was performed physically and spontaneously the value of the parameter h was also negative which confirms the exothermic of the process and indicates that the increase in temperature harms the adsorption process the adsorbent of this study had vital properties like being economical due to its recyclability and practicality for wastewater treatment keywords aqueous solution eggshell nanoparticles heavy metals kinetic study adsorption 1 introduction industrial development urbanization and global population growth have increased the demand for necessities such as water food agricultural products and other natural resources 1 2 in developing countries due to increased agricultural and industrial activities and improper discharge of industrial wastewater into the environment pollution of water resources with heavy metals has increased 3 4 heavy metals due to toxicity at low concentrations in water and soil and destructive effects on the environment have become a global problem for the general health of humans and other living organisms 5 heavy metals are used in various industries such as mining metal smelting plating nuclear energy petrochemicals and tanning among which the non ferrous smelting industry produces a large amount of wastewater a large part of the release of heavy metals into the environment have been allocated to themselves 6 metal ions in the wastewater of these industries are classified into cationic compounds pb2 cd2 hg2 and oxygenated anionic compounds cro4 2 based on their chemical structure 7 these heavy metals are stable in the environment they can accumulate through physical chemical and physiological processes and enter the body of humans and other living organisms through food chains and disrupt their health 8 for example the presence of lead ions pb2 greater than 0 07 mg l according to the world health organization who in drinking water can cause diseases such as kidney failure nerve damage genital problems and brain injuries 9 also more than 0 005 mg l cadmium ion cd2 in drinking water leads to disorders of protein metabolism kidney and liver damage hypertension lung damage muscle cramps infertility and even cancer 10 11 therefore the effluents of these industries must be treated before entering the environment in recent decades various methods have been used to remove heavy metal ions from aqueous solutions and industrial wastewater including chemical deposition filtration adsorption desorption processes ion exchange electrochemical and reverse osmosis 11 but most of these methods are expensive or consume a lot of energy among the strategies mentioned the adsorption method due to its cheapness easy operation and availability of adsorbents such as zeolites polymers biomass graphene oxide and activated carbon to remove heavy metals from aqueous solutions is very important 12 13 bio adsorbents are among the most widely used adsorbents in recent years due to their biocompatibility low cost degradability and non toxicity 14 starch is one of the most abundant biopolymers with a renewable source due to the presence of hydroxyl groups in its structure biocompatibility degradability and non toxicity have been considered adsorbents 15 however the low mechanical strength of biopolymers has limited their use as adsorbents 16 so physical or chemical modification is needed to improve their strength the presence of carboxyl functional groups in the starch st structure has created active sites on the adsorbent surface that can bind to functional groups and nanoparticles to improve the network 17 the use of nanoparticles can improve the properties of biopolymers due to the increase in the active surface and the increase of the adsorbent interaction with the contaminants 18 recently the production of nanoparticles from eggshells to minimize waste about 8 million tons of eggshell waste is annually produced in the world and their use as adsorbents to clean the environmental pollutants due to the presence of the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups in the structure has been highly regarded by researchers 19 20 the nanoparticle of fe3o4 has been used in water and wastewater research due to its super magnetism environmental friendliness suitable functional groups high surface area and low toxicity 21 in addition magnetic nano adsorbents are easily separated from aqueous solutions using an external magnet therefore the use of magnetic nanoparticles to modify other adsorbents such as adsorbents made from eggshells can create added value both in terms of more effortless operation and increasing work efficiency 22 in this study a nanocomposite particle from eggshell starch and fe3o4 was produced for the first time and investigated to remove cd2 and pb2 from an aqueous solution the performance of the composite efficiency and adsorption capacity the influence of operating parameters the properties of the composite the reuse of the composite the kinetics and isotherms of cadmium and lead adsorption and the actual wastewater treatment were investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 adsorbent synthesis new eggshell starch fe3o4 magnetic nanocomposites were synthesized by chemical deposition for this purpose the prepared eggshell was first washed several times with deionized water and placed at 105 c for 24 h to dry completely dried eggshells were pulverized using a ball mill for 24 h eggshell nanoparticles were mixed with starch in a 1 1 weight ratio they were added to an aqueous solution containing fe3 and fe2 ions in a 1 2 molar ratio and subjected to an ultrasonic process 24 khz 200 w for 60 min at the end of this time the mixture was mixed for 20 min using a magnetic stirrer and naoh solution with a concentration of 3 m was added dropwise after adding naoh the temperature of the mixture was increased to 80 90 c and stirred for 60 min under the desired conditions after the reaction the magnetic nanocomposite was separated from the aqueous solution using an external magnetic field magnet and washed several times ph 6 7 and placed at 90 c for 24 h until ultimately be dried the dried nanocomposite was pulverized using a ball mill and then used as an effective adsorbent in the process of removing heavy metal ions cd2 and pb2 2 2 adsorbent characterization methods after synthesizing the adsorbents their properties were investigated using ftir xrd sem map edx bet vsm and phzpc techniques 23 24 the ftir spectrum was used to investigate and determine the functional group in the structure of eggshell nanoparticles magnetic nanocomposite eggshell starch fe3o4 as well as the interactions between the functional groups in the adsorbent structure with pb2 and cd2 after the adsorption process ftir analysis was performed using broker victor 22 spectrophotometer in 400 4000 cm 1 the x ray diffraction xrd pattern for the adsorbents was determined using a siemens d500 device with cu kα radiation at 35 kv in the range of 5 80 and a scanning speed of 1 min and a wavelength of 1 5048 å a scanning electron microscope sem tescan mira3 feg was used to examine surface changes and determine elements distribution on the surface of eggshell nanoparticles and eggshell starch fe3o4 samples before and after pb2 and cd2 adsorption porosity and surface area analyses were measured according to the bet method asap 2460 micromeritics corporation united states the magnetic properties of fe3o4 and magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 were investigated using a vibrating magnetometer sample lake shore 7400 vsm to test the surface properties of the samples of the used adsorbent in the batch elimination process the adsorbent was tested under optimal conditions the mass was separated and then dried and tested at 105 c 2 3 batch adsorption process investigation and adsorption performance of cd2 and pb2 ions were investigated using a magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 as a batch process and in constant aqueous solution volume 100 ml distilled water was impregnated with certain amounts of cd2 and pb2 ions to prepare a solution at a concentration of 1000 mg l then this solution was diluted and tested again with distilled water to design working solutions in the present study the effect of various parameters such as temperature 25 50 c contact time 5 150 min adsorbent dose 0 25 3 g l ph 2 8 and initial concentration of metal ions 10 80 mg l on the efficiency of the adsorption process was studied the range of these parameters has been based on related published articles 25 27 it is also noteworthy that during the adsorption process hcl and naoh with a concentration of 0 1 1 m were used to adjust the ph of aqueous solutions at each stage after the surface adsorption process of the desired metal ions the number of metal ions in the aqueous solution was determined using a flame atomic absorption device aas with acetylene air fuel aa240fs varian and the amount of efficiency and adsorption capacity was determined the adsorbent was determined using eq 1 and 2 respectively and the maximum efficiency was reported as the optimal value for the desired parameter it is noteworthy that the adsorption process was performed with three repetitions and the average amount of data was presented as the optimal response 1 removal heavy metals i heavy metals e heavy metals i 100 2 q e heavy metals i heavy metals e v l w g after the adsorption process to study the thermodynamic kinetic and equilibrium behavior of the adsorption process the results of the effect of temperature contact time and initial concentration of metal ions on the efficiency of the adsorption process were used respectively to evaluate the adsorption desorption of the magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 after the pb2 and cd2 adsorption process the adsorbent was separated and placed in hcl solution at a concentration of 0 15 m for 2 h at the end of the given time the magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 was washed using distilled water and its ph was adjusted to 6 7 and dried for 24 h at 105 c the magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 was re examined in the adsorption process 3 results and discussion 3 1 properties of adsorbent the ftir spectra of eggshell nanoparticles and magnetic nanocomposite adsorbent of eggshell starch fe3o4 before and after adsorption of cd2 and pb2 metal ions are shown in fig 1a in the ftir spectrum of eggshell nanoparticles a peak in the range of wavenumber of 3427 cm 1 has appeared which could be due to the tensile vibrations of the oh group 28 in addition peaks in the range of 1425 709 and 874 cm 1 have appeared which are due to asymmetric tensile out of plane bending and in plane bending of the carbonate groups in calcium carbonate respectively 29 30 it is also noteworthy that peaks with low intensity in the range of 28 701 cm 1 and 2924 2926 cm 1 have appeared in the structure of eggshell nanoparticles and magnetic nanocomposites which confirms the existence of ch and co groups 19 31 after forming the magnetic nanocomposite a broad absorption peak in the range of 3378 cm 1 was observed in the corresponding ftir spectrum which could be due to the tensile vibrations of the oh group related to starch 32 which due to overlapping with the group of oh in the structure of egg nanoparticles the range is different after the formation of the magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 new peaks appeared in the range of 1023 and 628 cm 1 respectively to the tensile vibrations coh of starch 31 and feo 33 is attributed the intensity and position of the absorption peaks in the magnetic nanocomposite structure of the eggshell starch fe3o4 have changed after the adsorption process of cd2 and pb2 which can indicate the adsorption of cd2 and pb2 ions using the magnetic nanocomposite of the eggshell starch fe3o4 fig 1b shows the xrd pattern for eggshell nanoparticles and magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 the xrd spectrum of eggshell nanoparticles is in good agreement with the calcite calcium carbonate pattern jcpd card number 5 0586 34 and shows that the eggshell is mainly composed of caco3 35 peaks appearing in the 2θ range of 22 86 29 18 42 96 47 3 48 36 56 48 57 3 60 8 61 16 and 65 3 in the xrd pattern of eggshell nanoparticles represent crystalline phases of 012 104 202 0245 112 214 and 300 respectively 19 in the xrd spectrum of the magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 in the range of 15 27 low intensity peaks have been observed attributed to the structure of starch based on previous studies 36 37 also the change in the intensity and position of the peaks in the structure of eggshell nanoparticles after the formation of the desired magnetic nanocomposite can be due to the overlap of some fe3o4 peaks and eggshell particles 10 for example a high intensity peak appears in the structure of the magnetic nanocomposite in the range 2θ 35 68 which is not present in the structure of eggshell nanoparticles the peak in the range of 35 68 is due to a crystalline phase 400 in the structure of fe3o4 nanoparticles 38 as the results show in the structure of the magnetic nanocomposite peaks of eggshell and fe3o4 nanoparticles are visible indicating the synthesis of magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 using the chemical deposition method has been successful and its components have a good interaction together the specific active surface area volume and size of the pores in the adsorbent structure can be an effective parameter in the adsorption process which is investigated using the nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherm fig 2a c according to the results the amount of specific active surface for eggshell nanoparticles fe3o4 nanoparticles and magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 were determined to be 5 591 72 148 and 35 648 m2 g respectively the n2 adsorption desorption diagram of the samples belonged to type iv which shows the mesoporous structure of the samples 39 the magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 has a larger volume than the eggshell nanoparticles alone the mean particle sizes for eggshell powder fe3o4 nanoparticles and magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 were determined to be 29 932 11 701 and 13 052 nm respectively indicating that the samples had a mesoporous structure 40 the eggshell starch fe3o4 sample was not produced by physical mixing and chemical bonds were involved in its formation 41 the total pore volume for eggshell fe3o4 nanoparticles and magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 were 0 0418 0 2111 and 0 1163 cm3 g respectively according to the results determined using the adsorption desorption isotherm of n2 it can be said that modification of eggshell nanoparticles using starch and fe3o4 nanoparticles has improved the specific active surface and its pore volume which can increase the efficiency and performance of the adsorption process of cd2 and pb2 ions fig 2d shows the magnetic spectra of the fe3o4 magnetic nanoparticles and the magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 the magnetic saturation values for fe3o4 and magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 samples were determined to be 84 24 and 39 57 emu g 1 respectively the results showed that the magnetic properties of magnetic nanocomposites compared to fe3o4 nanoparticles have a lower amount of magnetic saturation due to the presence of non magnetic nanoparticles of eggshell and starch in the structure of the nanocomposite in the spectrum presented using vsm analysis for both samples there is no magnetic residue loop which indicates that the samples have super magnetic properties and can be easily separated from aqueous solutions using an external magnetic field fig 3 shows the sem and map edx analysis for samples of eggshell nanoparticles and magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 before and after the adsorption process of cd2 and pb2 ions as the sem results show the holes and pores on the surface of the eggshell nanoparticle structure could be a good place for fe3o4 magnetic nanoparticles starch and metal ions to be placed fig 3a the map edx analysis also showed that a significant part of eggshell nanoparticles is composed of calcium and oxygen fig 3b c and confirms the results of the xrd analysis after the formation of the magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 extensive changes were made in the surface of the eggshell nanoparticles and particles of different sizes covered the surface which could be starch molecules and magnetic fe3o4 nanoparticles fig 3d to confirm the presence of fe3o4 nanoparticles and starch molecules in the structure of the nanocomposite map edx analysis was used which showed that in the composite structure there is a significant amount of fe ions and the amount of c has increased compared to the nanoparticles of the eggshell fig 3e f the presence of fe ions and increasing the amount of c can confirm the presence of magnetic fe3o4 nanoparticles and starch molecules in the nanocomposite structure after the adsorption process of cd2 and pb2 ions using the desired magnetic nanocomposite extensive changes appeared on the surface of the magnetic nanocomposite and map edx analysis also confirmed the presence of cd2 and pb2 ions in the adsorbent structure fig 3g l in addition it should be noted that the magnetic nanocomposite has adsorption more pb2 ions than cd2 ions which is also consistent with the experimental results of the adsorption test according to the mentioned results it can be stated that the magnetic nanocomposite has an excellent ability to remove cd2 and pb2 ions and has a greater tendency to adsorption pb2 ions 3 2 effect of ph and adsorbent dose the ph of the solution is one of the factors affecting the adsorption process because by affecting the surface charge of the adsorbent the degree of protonation of the adsorbent and the degree of separation of the functional group in the active site of the adsorbent affect the electrostatic interaction between the adsorbent and the contaminant 42 to determine the adsorbent surface load characteristics zeta potential analysis was used and its results are presented in fig 4a based on the results the phzpc value for magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 was 6 02 which indicates that the specimens with ph less than phzpc have a positive charge and in ph more than phzpc has a negative surface charge fig 4b shows the effect of ph on the adsorption efficiency of cd2 and pb2 it was observed that with increasing the ph from 2 to 6 for pb2 and 2 7 for cd2 the adsorption efficiency increased but the process efficiency decreased at higher ph the low efficiency of the adsorption process at acidic ph maybe because at low ph the concentration of h ions in solution is so high that these h ions compete with the ions of heavy metals to occupy active adsorbent sites 43 however with increasing ph the concentration of h ions decreases and the functional groups on the adsorbent surface become ionized thus improving the adsorption process based on the presented results the maximum adsorption efficiencies of cd2 and pb2 ions using the magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 were reported at ph 7 and 6 equal to 94 26 and 96 37 respectively the results showed that by increasing the ph more than 7 and 6 for heavy metal ions cd2 and pb2 respectively the efficiency of the adsorption process decreases which can be due to increasing the concentration of oh ions in the solution oh ions in solution can complex with metal ions and precipitate metal ions thus preventing them from contacting the active sites of the adsorbent 44 fig 4c shows the effect of adsorbent dose on the adsorption efficiency of cd2 and pb2 ions on the magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 in the range of 0 25 3 g l according to the results of the figure it was observed that with increasing the adsorbent dose from 0 25 to 1 g l the adsorption efficiency of cd2 and pb2 ions increased from 32 64 and 38 65 to 96 38 and 97 56 respectively and for values greater than 1 g l minor changes in adsorption efficiency was observed increasing the adsorption efficiency by expanding the adsorbent dose can be explained by increasing the adsorbent dose from 0 25 to 1 g l the active surface and active sites on the magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 to adsorb cd2 and pb2 increases dramatically 45 however for values greater than 1 g l the number of unsaturated active sites is greater than the number of metal ions present in the solution so it does not cause significant changes in adsorption efficiency 3 3 investigation of the effect of temperature and thermodynamics another effective parameter in the adsorption process is temperature because temperature affects the viscosity of the solution as well as controls the release rate of contaminant molecules in the outer boundary layer and the inner pores of the adsorbent 46 fig 5a shows the effect of temperature on the adsorption efficiency of cd2 and pb2 ions using a magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 in the temperature range of 25 50 c as the results showed with increasing temperature the adsorption efficiency decreased which could be due to increased mobility of heavy metals molecules and the tendency to separate from the adsorbent surface and structural changes in the adsorbent surface and active adsorbent sites 47 therefore the adsorption process is exothermic and the desired process has better efficiency and performance at low temperatures to determine the free energy values of gibbs δg enthalpy δh and entropy δs in the temperature range of 25 50 c van t hoff relations eqs 3 and 4 were used 3 δg rt ln k d 4 ln k d ln q e c e δs r δh rt here r is the universal constant of gases t is the absolute temperature k and kd is the equilibrium constant kd qe ce the thermodynamic parameters of the δg δh and δs in the adsorption process of cd2 and pb2 ions using a magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 are reported in table 1 the values of h for the adsorption process of cd2 and pb2 ions were reported to be 29 372 and 31 668 kj mol respectively which emphasizes the exothermic of the adsorption process also low values of δh indicate that the adsorption process of cd2 and pb2 ions using the adsorbent is of the physical type 48 negative values of δg in the temperature range of 25 50 c indicate that the adsorption process of cd2 and pb2 is spontaneous and the degree of the spontaneity of the reaction decreases with increasing temperature in addition δs parameter values were also determined for the negative in the adsorption process indicating that irregularities in the system were reduced during the adsorption process 3 4 the effect of contact time and kinetic study fig 6a shows the effect of contact time on the adsorption efficiency of cd2 and pb2 ions in the time range of 5 150 min it was observed that with increasing the contact time in the range of 5 60 min the adsorption efficiency of cd2 and pb2 metal ions using the adsorbent has increased which can be due to the presence of empty active adsorption sites on the surface and the structure of magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 after 60 min a further increase in contact time did not have a significant effect on the removal of heavy metal ions which could be due to the saturation of active sites in the adsorbent structure and repulsion forces between the adsorbed ions on the adsorbent surface and ions it is present in the soluble phase making it challenging to adsorb metal ions remaining in the aqueous solution using the remaining active sites 49 after investigating the effect of contact time on the adsorption process efficiency the kinetic study of the adsorption process was investigated using pseudo first order pseudo second order and intra particle diffusion kinetic models the linear form of the models is described below 5 ln q e q t ln q e cal k 1 t 6 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e cal 7 q t k int t 0 5 i here qe and qt mg g are the numbers of metal ions removed at equilibrium and time t respectively k1 is the constant adsorption of the pseudo first order kinetic model 1 min k2 implies the equilibrium velocity constant of the pseudo second order kinetic is g mg g kint is the intra particle diffusion rate constant mg g min and i is the width of the origin the linear relationship of pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models for the process for pb2 and cd2 ion adsorption is established in fig 6b c respectively and the linear relationship of the intra particle diffusion model for the ion adsorption process is shown in fig 6d and the parameters of the kinetics determined in table 2 are presented as the results show the value of parameter r2 determined using the pseudo second order kinetic model for pb2 and cd2 ion adsorption process was determined to be 0 997 and 0 995 respectively which is higher than other kinetic models and shows the data kinetics follow a pseudo second order also the amount of adsorption capacity determined using the pseudo second order model has a higher value than the pseudo first order kinetic model which confirms the ability to describe the kinetic behavior of the adsorption process using the pseudo second order kinetic model the intra particle diffusion model is another kinetic model that is widely used in the study of the kinetic behavior of the adsorption process of pollutants and can reasonably interpret the mechanism of the adsorption process according to the assumptions of this model the mechanism of removal of metal ions by adsorption by adsorbents has four stages which include a migration and transfer of metal ions from the soluble mass to the adsorbent surface mass penetration b metal ions penetration from the boundary layer to the adsorbent surface by film diffusion c transfer of metal ions from the adsorbent surface to the internal pores of the particles through the intra particle diffusion mechanism and d adsorbent which is caused by chemical reactions with ion change complexation or chelation 50 the results of fig 6d showed that the diagram of the intra particle diffusion model for the adsorption process of pb2 and cd2 ions is not nonlinear and is effective in the adsorption process of more than one type of process the linear part of the first stage has a high slope compared to the second stage which is related to the diffusion of the film in which the desired ions are transferred from the limited layer to the adsorbent surface and this stage is performed at high speed the second linear part which has a lower slope indicates the diffusion of metal ions into the adsorbent layers 51 3 5 the effect of initial concentration of metal ion pollutants and isotherm studies fig 7a examines the ability and performance of the magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 in the initial concentration range of 10 80 mg l the results showed that by increasing the initial concentration of cd2 and pb2 ions in solution from 10 to 80 mg l the adsorption efficiency decreased from 96 38 and 97 86 to 58 76 and 68 34 respectively it can be due to the saturation of the active sites of the adsorbent surface by cd2 and pb2 ions 52 and the creation of repulsive electrostatic force between the metal ions present on the adsorbent surface and the aqueous solution 53 langmuir eq 8 freundlich eq 9 and temkin eq 10 isotherm models were used to investigate the equilibrium behavior of adsorption of cd2 and pb2 ions using a magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 nonlinear regression of the isotherms in fig 7b c and the isotherm constants and variables specified in table 3 were reported 8 langmuir c e q e c e q m 1 q m k l r l 1 1 k l c i q m k c e 1 k l q m 9 freundlich ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e 10 temkin q e b ln k t b ln c e b rt b here

freundlich constant n is adsorption intensity kt is temkin isotherm constant l g r is the universal gas constant kj mol k b is the temkin isotherm constant kj mol is related to the energy parameter and t is the absolute temperature k the results of the isotherm study showed that the experimental data obtained from the adsorption process of cd2 and pb2 ions using the magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 follows the langmuir isotherm model higher values of r2 in table 3 therefore according to the langmuir isotherm model adsorption of cd2 and pb2 ions using a magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 is done as monolayer adsorption and homogeneous surfaces compared to heterogeneous surfaces have essential effects on the adsorption process the maximum efficiency of monolayer adsorption capacity qm of cd2 and pb2 ions was determined to be 48 5437 and 57 1429 mg g respectively using the desired magnetic nanocomposite in addition the values of the rl parameter were in the range between 0 and 1 which indicates that the adsorption process of cd2 and pb2 ions were performed optimally using the adsorbent in addition the value of parameter n was determined using the freundlich isotherm model more than 1 which emphasizes the desirability of the adsorption process of the desired metal ions using the desired magnetic nanocomposite 54 positive values of b for adsorption of cd2 and pb2 ions using magnetic nanocomposites emphasize the exothermic of the adsorption process 55 which is highly consistent with the results of the thermodynamic study 3 6 comparison of adsorption capacity of adsorbents table 4 shows the adsorption capacity of magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 compared to other adsorbents used in the adsorption process of cd2 and pb2 ions from aqueous solution as the results show the adsorbent has a good ability and performance in removing ions of cd2 and pb2 metals from aqueous solution compared to other adsorbents therefore it can be suggested that the magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 can be used as an effective adsorbent to remove heavy metal ions from an aqueous solution 3 7 wastewater treatment of shipbuilding industries today producing adsorbents with good efficiency and performance for industrial wastewater treatment containing heavy metal ions is essential one of the most important commercial industries that contain wastewater containing heavy metal ions and can be dangerous to the environment and other living organisms is the shipbuilding industry in the present study the ability of magnetic nanocomposites to remove heavy metal ions from shipbuilding wastewater was investigated for this purpose first the suspended particles in the prepared wastewater were filtered then wastewater ph was adjusted using hcl and naoh with a concentration of 1 m at a value of 6 0 5 the shipbuilding wastewater treatment process was investigated using a magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 in the batch system for 60 min pre treatment shipbuilding effluent had ph of 6 7 cod of 174 mg l ni2 of 24 56 mg l cd2 of 37 52 mg l pb2 of 12 38 mg l and cu2 of 7 26 mg l after the treatment process the wastewater composition of the shipbuilding industry was significantly reduced and had a ph of 6 83 cod of 61 mg l ni2 of 1 48 mg l cd2 of 1 18 mg l pb2 of 0 76 mg l and cu2 of 0 52 mg l the results show that the magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 has a good ability to remove heavy metal ions from industrial wastewater and can be used as a promising option in industrial wastewater treatment 3 8 adsorption desorption process and stability the adsorption desorption of pb2 and cd2 was determined using a magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 up to 9 steps and the results are presented in fig 8a as the results show with increasing the number of steps of using the magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 the efficiency of pb2 and cd2 removal has decreased the resulting reduction in efficiency of eggshell starch fe3o4 can be due to various factors such as damage or changes in adsorption sites and saturation of related sites 66 67 the results also showed that after several adsorption desorption steps the magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 has a suitable ability to absorb pb2 and cd2 indicating that the magnetic nanocomposite is a viable material for decreasing the heavy metals pollution to show the stability of the magnetic nanocomposite after the adsorption desorption process of pb2 and cd2 ions vsm analysis was used fig 8b as the vsm results show the magnetic saturation values for the magnetic nanocomposites before and after the pb2 and cd2 adsorption process 5 cycles were set at 39 57 emu g 38 79 emu g and 37 57 emu g respectively the results showed that the amount of magnetic saturation for the nanocomposite did not change significantly which could be due to the little leaching of fe3o4 nanoparticles from the structure of the desired nanocomposite which emphasizes the stability of the composite 4 conclusions in this work a magnetic composite made of starch eggshell and iron oxide nanoparticles was introduced the composite had good efficiency and capacity in removing lead and cadmium ions appropriate physical and chemical properties like functional groups and suitable surface area led to such a good efficiency to decontaminate studied contaminants the applicability of the composite adsorbent was revealed by treating a real wastewater sample the introduced material had an acceptable efficiency after several consecutive reuses indicating that it was economical therefore eggshell starch fe3o4 composite can be developed in water and wastewater declaration of

12937,in the present study to remove heavy metal ions cd2 and pb2 from aqueous solution and industrial effluent a new magnetic nanocomposite based on eggshell starch fe3o4 nanoparticles was used as an effective adsorbent ftir analysis showed that the magnetic composite is well synthesized and has different functional groups that can be effective in the adsorption process in addition the vsm test showed that the magnetic nanocomposite had a superparamagnetic property the bet value for magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 nanoparticles was determined to be 35 648 m2 g higher than eggshell nanoparticles the maximum decontamination efficiency of cd2 96 38 and pb2 97 86 was obtained at ph 7 and 6 respectively temperature 25 c contact time of 60 min metal concentration of 10 mg l and adsorbent dose of 1 g l the results showed that the adsorption process of the desired ions using eggshell starch fe3o4 nanoparticles follows a pseudo second order and the langmuir models the langmuir capacity for cd2 and pb2 adsorption using eggshell starch fe3o4 was computed at 48 54 and 57 14 mg g respectively the value of the g parameter for the adsorption process of cd2 and pb2 was determined in the span of 20 g 0 kj mol which suggests that the adsorption process was performed physically and spontaneously the value of the parameter h was also negative which confirms the exothermic of the process and indicates that the increase in temperature harms the adsorption process the adsorbent of this study had vital properties like being economical due to its recyclability and practicality for wastewater treatment keywords aqueous solution eggshell nanoparticles heavy metals kinetic study adsorption 1 introduction industrial development urbanization and global population growth have increased the demand for necessities such as water food agricultural products and other natural resources 1 2 in developing countries due to increased agricultural and industrial activities and improper discharge of industrial wastewater into the environment pollution of water resources with heavy metals has increased 3 4 heavy metals due to toxicity at low concentrations in water and soil and destructive effects on the environment have become a global problem for the general health of humans and other living organisms 5 heavy metals are used in various industries such as mining metal smelting plating nuclear energy petrochemicals and tanning among which the non ferrous smelting industry produces a large amount of wastewater a large part of the release of heavy metals into the environment have been allocated to themselves 6 metal ions in the wastewater of these industries are classified into cationic compounds pb2 cd2 hg2 and oxygenated anionic compounds cro4 2 based on their chemical structure 7 these heavy metals are stable in the environment they can accumulate through physical chemical and physiological processes and enter the body of humans and other living organisms through food chains and disrupt their health 8 for example the presence of lead ions pb2 greater than 0 07 mg l according to the world health organization who in drinking water can cause diseases such as kidney failure nerve damage genital problems and brain injuries 9 also more than 0 005 mg l cadmium ion cd2 in drinking water leads to disorders of protein metabolism kidney and liver damage hypertension lung damage muscle cramps infertility and even cancer 10 11 therefore the effluents of these industries must be treated before entering the environment in recent decades various methods have been used to remove heavy metal ions from aqueous solutions and industrial wastewater including chemical deposition filtration adsorption desorption processes ion exchange electrochemical and reverse osmosis 11 but most of these methods are expensive or consume a lot of energy among the strategies mentioned the adsorption method due to its cheapness easy operation and availability of adsorbents such as zeolites polymers biomass graphene oxide and activated carbon to remove heavy metals from aqueous solutions is very important 12 13 bio adsorbents are among the most widely used adsorbents in recent years due to their biocompatibility low cost degradability and non toxicity 14 starch is one of the most abundant biopolymers with a renewable source due to the presence of hydroxyl groups in its structure biocompatibility degradability and non toxicity have been considered adsorbents 15 however the low mechanical strength of biopolymers has limited their use as adsorbents 16 so physical or chemical modification is needed to improve their strength the presence of carboxyl functional groups in the starch st structure has created active sites on the adsorbent surface that can bind to functional groups and nanoparticles to improve the network 17 the use of nanoparticles can improve the properties of biopolymers due to the increase in the active surface and the increase of the adsorbent interaction with the contaminants 18 recently the production of nanoparticles from eggshells to minimize waste about 8 million tons of eggshell waste is annually produced in the world and their use as adsorbents to clean the environmental pollutants due to the presence of the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups in the structure has been highly regarded by researchers 19 20 the nanoparticle of fe3o4 has been used in water and wastewater research due to its super magnetism environmental friendliness suitable functional groups high surface area and low toxicity 21 in addition magnetic nano adsorbents are easily separated from aqueous solutions using an external magnet therefore the use of magnetic nanoparticles to modify other adsorbents such as adsorbents made from eggshells can create added value both in terms of more effortless operation and increasing work efficiency 22 in this study a nanocomposite particle from eggshell starch and fe3o4 was produced for the first time and investigated to remove cd2 and pb2 from an aqueous solution the performance of the composite efficiency and adsorption capacity the influence of operating parameters the properties of the composite the reuse of the composite the kinetics and isotherms of cadmium and lead adsorption and the actual wastewater treatment were investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 adsorbent synthesis new eggshell starch fe3o4 magnetic nanocomposites were synthesized by chemical deposition for this purpose the prepared eggshell was first washed several times with deionized water and placed at 105 c for 24 h to dry completely dried eggshells were pulverized using a ball mill for 24 h eggshell nanoparticles were mixed with starch in a 1 1 weight ratio they were added to an aqueous solution containing fe3 and fe2 ions in a 1 2 molar ratio and subjected to an ultrasonic process 24 khz 200 w for 60 min at the end of this time the mixture was mixed for 20 min using a magnetic stirrer and naoh solution with a concentration of 3 m was added dropwise after adding naoh the temperature of the mixture was increased to 80 90 c and stirred for 60 min under the desired conditions after the reaction the magnetic nanocomposite was separated from the aqueous solution using an external magnetic field magnet and washed several times ph 6 7 and placed at 90 c for 24 h until ultimately be dried the dried nanocomposite was pulverized using a ball mill and then used as an effective adsorbent in the process of removing heavy metal ions cd2 and pb2 2 2 adsorbent characterization methods after synthesizing the adsorbents their properties were investigated using ftir xrd sem map edx bet vsm and phzpc techniques 23 24 the ftir spectrum was used to investigate and determine the functional group in the structure of eggshell nanoparticles magnetic nanocomposite eggshell starch fe3o4 as well as the interactions between the functional groups in the adsorbent structure with pb2 and cd2 after the adsorption process ftir analysis was performed using broker victor 22 spectrophotometer in 400 4000 cm 1 the x ray diffraction xrd pattern for the adsorbents was determined using a siemens d500 device with cu kα radiation at 35 kv in the range of 5 80 and a scanning speed of 1 min and a wavelength of 1 5048 å a scanning electron microscope sem tescan mira3 feg was used to examine surface changes and determine elements distribution on the surface of eggshell nanoparticles and eggshell starch fe3o4 samples before and after pb2 and cd2 adsorption porosity and surface area analyses were measured according to the bet method asap 2460 micromeritics corporation united states the magnetic properties of fe3o4 and magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 were investigated using a vibrating magnetometer sample lake shore 7400 vsm to test the surface properties of the samples of the used adsorbent in the batch elimination process the adsorbent was tested under optimal conditions the mass was separated and then dried and tested at 105 c 2 3 batch adsorption process investigation and adsorption performance of cd2 and pb2 ions were investigated using a magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 as a batch process and in constant aqueous solution volume 100 ml distilled water was impregnated with certain amounts of cd2 and pb2 ions to prepare a solution at a concentration of 1000 mg l then this solution was diluted and tested again with distilled water to design working solutions in the present study the effect of various parameters such as temperature 25 50 c contact time 5 150 min adsorbent dose 0 25 3 g l ph 2 8 and initial concentration of metal ions 10 80 mg l on the efficiency of the adsorption process was studied the range of these parameters has been based on related published articles 25 27 it is also noteworthy that during the adsorption process hcl and naoh with a concentration of 0 1 1 m were used to adjust the ph of aqueous solutions at each stage after the surface adsorption process of the desired metal ions the number of metal ions in the aqueous solution was determined using a flame atomic absorption device aas with acetylene air fuel aa240fs varian and the amount of efficiency and adsorption capacity was determined the adsorbent was determined using eq 1 and 2 respectively and the maximum efficiency was reported as the optimal value for the desired parameter it is noteworthy that the adsorption process was performed with three repetitions and the average amount of data was presented as the optimal response 1 removal heavy metals i heavy metals e heavy metals i 100 2 q e heavy metals i heavy metals e v l w g after the adsorption process to study the thermodynamic kinetic and equilibrium behavior of the adsorption process the results of the effect of temperature contact time and initial concentration of metal ions on the efficiency of the adsorption process were used respectively to evaluate the adsorption desorption of the magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 after the pb2 and cd2 adsorption process the adsorbent was separated and placed in hcl solution at a concentration of 0 15 m for 2 h at the end of the given time the magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 was washed using distilled water and its ph was adjusted to 6 7 and dried for 24 h at 105 c the magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 was re examined in the adsorption process 3 results and discussion 3 1 properties of adsorbent the ftir spectra of eggshell nanoparticles and magnetic nanocomposite adsorbent of eggshell starch fe3o4 before and after adsorption of cd2 and pb2 metal ions are shown in fig 1a in the ftir spectrum of eggshell nanoparticles a peak in the range of wavenumber of 3427 cm 1 has appeared which could be due to the tensile vibrations of the oh group 28 in addition peaks in the range of 1425 709 and 874 cm 1 have appeared which are due to asymmetric tensile out of plane bending and in plane bending of the carbonate groups in calcium carbonate respectively 29 30 it is also noteworthy that peaks with low intensity in the range of 28 701 cm 1 and 2924 2926 cm 1 have appeared in the structure of eggshell nanoparticles and magnetic nanocomposites which confirms the existence of ch and co groups 19 31 after forming the magnetic nanocomposite a broad absorption peak in the range of 3378 cm 1 was observed in the corresponding ftir spectrum which could be due to the tensile vibrations of the oh group related to starch 32 which due to overlapping with the group of oh in the structure of egg nanoparticles the range is different after the formation of the magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 new peaks appeared in the range of 1023 and 628 cm 1 respectively to the tensile vibrations coh of starch 31 and feo 33 is attributed the intensity and position of the absorption peaks in the magnetic nanocomposite structure of the eggshell starch fe3o4 have changed after the adsorption process of cd2 and pb2 which can indicate the adsorption of cd2 and pb2 ions using the magnetic nanocomposite of the eggshell starch fe3o4 fig 1b shows the xrd pattern for eggshell nanoparticles and magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 the xrd spectrum of eggshell nanoparticles is in good agreement with the calcite calcium carbonate pattern jcpd card number 5 0586 34 and shows that the eggshell is mainly composed of caco3 35 peaks appearing in the 2θ range of 22 86 29 18 42 96 47 3 48 36 56 48 57 3 60 8 61 16 and 65 3 in the xrd pattern of eggshell nanoparticles represent crystalline phases of 012 104 202 0245 112 214 and 300 respectively 19 in the xrd spectrum of the magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 in the range of 15 27 low intensity peaks have been observed attributed to the structure of starch based on previous studies 36 37 also the change in the intensity and position of the peaks in the structure of eggshell nanoparticles after the formation of the desired magnetic nanocomposite can be due to the overlap of some fe3o4 peaks and eggshell particles 10 for example a high intensity peak appears in the structure of the magnetic nanocomposite in the range 2θ 35 68 which is not present in the structure of eggshell nanoparticles the peak in the range of 35 68 is due to a crystalline phase 400 in the structure of fe3o4 nanoparticles 38 as the results show in the structure of the magnetic nanocomposite peaks of eggshell and fe3o4 nanoparticles are visible indicating the synthesis of magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 using the chemical deposition method has been successful and its components have a good interaction together the specific active surface area volume and size of the pores in the adsorbent structure can be an effective parameter in the adsorption process which is investigated using the nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherm fig 2a c according to the results the amount of specific active surface for eggshell nanoparticles fe3o4 nanoparticles and magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 were determined to be 5 591 72 148 and 35 648 m2 g respectively the n2 adsorption desorption diagram of the samples belonged to type iv which shows the mesoporous structure of the samples 39 the magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 has a larger volume than the eggshell nanoparticles alone the mean particle sizes for eggshell powder fe3o4 nanoparticles and magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 were determined to be 29 932 11 701 and 13 052 nm respectively indicating that the samples had a mesoporous structure 40 the eggshell starch fe3o4 sample was not produced by physical mixing and chemical bonds were involved in its formation 41 the total pore volume for eggshell fe3o4 nanoparticles and magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 were 0 0418 0 2111 and 0 1163 cm3 g respectively according to the results determined using the adsorption desorption isotherm of n2 it can be said that modification of eggshell nanoparticles using starch and fe3o4 nanoparticles has improved the specific active surface and its pore volume which can increase the efficiency and performance of the adsorption process of cd2 and pb2 ions fig 2d shows the magnetic spectra of the fe3o4 magnetic nanoparticles and the magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 the magnetic saturation values for fe3o4 and magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 samples were determined to be 84 24 and 39 57 emu g 1 respectively the results showed that the magnetic properties of magnetic nanocomposites compared to fe3o4 nanoparticles have a lower amount of magnetic saturation due to the presence of non magnetic nanoparticles of eggshell and starch in the structure of the nanocomposite in the spectrum presented using vsm analysis for both samples there is no magnetic residue loop which indicates that the samples have super magnetic properties and can be easily separated from aqueous solutions using an external magnetic field fig 3 shows the sem and map edx analysis for samples of eggshell nanoparticles and magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 before and after the adsorption process of cd2 and pb2 ions as the sem results show the holes and pores on the surface of the eggshell nanoparticle structure could be a good place for fe3o4 magnetic nanoparticles starch and metal ions to be placed fig 3a the map edx analysis also showed that a significant part of eggshell nanoparticles is composed of calcium and oxygen fig 3b c and confirms the results of the xrd analysis after the formation of the magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 extensive changes were made in the surface of the eggshell nanoparticles and particles of different sizes covered the surface which could be starch molecules and magnetic fe3o4 nanoparticles fig 3d to confirm the presence of fe3o4 nanoparticles and starch molecules in the structure of the nanocomposite map edx analysis was used which showed that in the composite structure there is a significant amount of fe ions and the amount of c has increased compared to the nanoparticles of the eggshell fig 3e f the presence of fe ions and increasing the amount of c can confirm the presence of magnetic fe3o4 nanoparticles and starch molecules in the nanocomposite structure after the adsorption process of cd2 and pb2 ions using the desired magnetic nanocomposite extensive changes appeared on the surface of the magnetic nanocomposite and map edx analysis also confirmed the presence of cd2 and pb2 ions in the adsorbent structure fig 3g l in addition it should be noted that the magnetic nanocomposite has adsorption more pb2 ions than cd2 ions which is also consistent with the experimental results of the adsorption test according to the mentioned results it can be stated that the magnetic nanocomposite has an excellent ability to remove cd2 and pb2 ions and has a greater tendency to adsorption pb2 ions 3 2 effect of ph and adsorbent dose the ph of the solution is one of the factors affecting the adsorption process because by affecting the surface charge of the adsorbent the degree of protonation of the adsorbent and the degree of separation of the functional group in the active site of the adsorbent affect the electrostatic interaction between the adsorbent and the contaminant 42 to determine the adsorbent surface load characteristics zeta potential analysis was used and its results are presented in fig 4a based on the results the phzpc value for magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 was 6 02 which indicates that the specimens with ph less than phzpc have a positive charge and in ph more than phzpc has a negative surface charge fig 4b shows the effect of ph on the adsorption efficiency of cd2 and pb2 it was observed that with increasing the ph from 2 to 6 for pb2 and 2 7 for cd2 the adsorption efficiency increased but the process efficiency decreased at higher ph the low efficiency of the adsorption process at acidic ph maybe because at low ph the concentration of h ions in solution is so high that these h ions compete with the ions of heavy metals to occupy active adsorbent sites 43 however with increasing ph the concentration of h ions decreases and the functional groups on the adsorbent surface become ionized thus improving the adsorption process based on the presented results the maximum adsorption efficiencies of cd2 and pb2 ions using the magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 were reported at ph 7 and 6 equal to 94 26 and 96 37 respectively the results showed that by increasing the ph more than 7 and 6 for heavy metal ions cd2 and pb2 respectively the efficiency of the adsorption process decreases which can be due to increasing the concentration of oh ions in the solution oh ions in solution can complex with metal ions and precipitate metal ions thus preventing them from contacting the active sites of the adsorbent 44 fig 4c shows the effect of adsorbent dose on the adsorption efficiency of cd2 and pb2 ions on the magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 in the range of 0 25 3 g l according to the results of the figure it was observed that with increasing the adsorbent dose from 0 25 to 1 g l the adsorption efficiency of cd2 and pb2 ions increased from 32 64 and 38 65 to 96 38 and 97 56 respectively and for values greater than 1 g l minor changes in adsorption efficiency was observed increasing the adsorption efficiency by expanding the adsorbent dose can be explained by increasing the adsorbent dose from 0 25 to 1 g l the active surface and active sites on the magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 to adsorb cd2 and pb2 increases dramatically 45 however for values greater than 1 g l the number of unsaturated active sites is greater than the number of metal ions present in the solution so it does not cause significant changes in adsorption efficiency 3 3 investigation of the effect of temperature and thermodynamics another effective parameter in the adsorption process is temperature because temperature affects the viscosity of the solution as well as controls the release rate of contaminant molecules in the outer boundary layer and the inner pores of the adsorbent 46 fig 5a shows the effect of temperature on the adsorption efficiency of cd2 and pb2 ions using a magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 in the temperature range of 25 50 c as the results showed with increasing temperature the adsorption efficiency decreased which could be due to increased mobility of heavy metals molecules and the tendency to separate from the adsorbent surface and structural changes in the adsorbent surface and active adsorbent sites 47 therefore the adsorption process is exothermic and the desired process has better efficiency and performance at low temperatures to determine the free energy values of gibbs δg enthalpy δh and entropy δs in the temperature range of 25 50 c van t hoff relations eqs 3 and 4 were used 3 δg rt ln k d 4 ln k d ln q e c e δs r δh rt here r is the universal constant of gases t is the absolute temperature k and kd is the equilibrium constant kd qe ce the thermodynamic parameters of the δg δh and δs in the adsorption process of cd2 and pb2 ions using a magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 are reported in table 1 the values of h for the adsorption process of cd2 and pb2 ions were reported to be 29 372 and 31 668 kj mol respectively which emphasizes the exothermic of the adsorption process also low values of δh indicate that the adsorption process of cd2 and pb2 ions using the adsorbent is of the physical type 48 negative values of δg in the temperature range of 25 50 c indicate that the adsorption process of cd2 and pb2 is spontaneous and the degree of the spontaneity of the reaction decreases with increasing temperature in addition δs parameter values were also determined for the negative in the adsorption process indicating that irregularities in the system were reduced during the adsorption process 3 4 the effect of contact time and kinetic study fig 6a shows the effect of contact time on the adsorption efficiency of cd2 and pb2 ions in the time range of 5 150 min it was observed that with increasing the contact time in the range of 5 60 min the adsorption efficiency of cd2 and pb2 metal ions using the adsorbent has increased which can be due to the presence of empty active adsorption sites on the surface and the structure of magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 after 60 min a further increase in contact time did not have a significant effect on the removal of heavy metal ions which could be due to the saturation of active sites in the adsorbent structure and repulsion forces between the adsorbed ions on the adsorbent surface and ions it is present in the soluble phase making it challenging to adsorb metal ions remaining in the aqueous solution using the remaining active sites 49 after investigating the effect of contact time on the adsorption process efficiency the kinetic study of the adsorption process was investigated using pseudo first order pseudo second order and intra particle diffusion kinetic models the linear form of the models is described below 5 ln q e q t ln q e cal k 1 t 6 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e cal 7 q t k int t 0 5 i here qe and qt mg g are the numbers of metal ions removed at equilibrium and time t respectively k1 is the constant adsorption of the pseudo first order kinetic model 1 min k2 implies the equilibrium velocity constant of the pseudo second order kinetic is g mg g kint is the intra particle diffusion rate constant mg g min and i is the width of the origin the linear relationship of pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models for the process for pb2 and cd2 ion adsorption is established in fig 6b c respectively and the linear relationship of the intra particle diffusion model for the ion adsorption process is shown in fig 6d and the parameters of the kinetics determined in table 2 are presented as the results show the value of parameter r2 determined using the pseudo second order kinetic model for pb2 and cd2 ion adsorption process was determined to be 0 997 and 0 995 respectively which is higher than other kinetic models and shows the data kinetics follow a pseudo second order also the amount of adsorption capacity determined using the pseudo second order model has a higher value than the pseudo first order kinetic model which confirms the ability to describe the kinetic behavior of the adsorption process using the pseudo second order kinetic model the intra particle diffusion model is another kinetic model that is widely used in the study of the kinetic behavior of the adsorption process of pollutants and can reasonably interpret the mechanism of the adsorption process according to the assumptions of this model the mechanism of removal of metal ions by adsorption by adsorbents has four stages which include a migration and transfer of metal ions from the soluble mass to the adsorbent surface mass penetration b metal ions penetration from the boundary layer to the adsorbent surface by film diffusion c transfer of metal ions from the adsorbent surface to the internal pores of the particles through the intra particle diffusion mechanism and d adsorbent which is caused by chemical reactions with ion change complexation or chelation 50 the results of fig 6d showed that the diagram of the intra particle diffusion model for the adsorption process of pb2 and cd2 ions is not nonlinear and is effective in the adsorption process of more than one type of process the linear part of the first stage has a high slope compared to the second stage which is related to the diffusion of the film in which the desired ions are transferred from the limited layer to the adsorbent surface and this stage is performed at high speed the second linear part which has a lower slope indicates the diffusion of metal ions into the adsorbent layers 51 3 5 the effect of initial concentration of metal ion pollutants and isotherm studies fig 7a examines the ability and performance of the magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 in the initial concentration range of 10 80 mg l the results showed that by increasing the initial concentration of cd2 and pb2 ions in solution from 10 to 80 mg l the adsorption efficiency decreased from 96 38 and 97 86 to 58 76 and 68 34 respectively it can be due to the saturation of the active sites of the adsorbent surface by cd2 and pb2 ions 52 and the creation of repulsive electrostatic force between the metal ions present on the adsorbent surface and the aqueous solution 53 langmuir eq 8 freundlich eq 9 and temkin eq 10 isotherm models were used to investigate the equilibrium behavior of adsorption of cd2 and pb2 ions using a magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 nonlinear regression of the isotherms in fig 7b c and the isotherm constants and variables specified in table 3 were reported 8 langmuir c e q e c e q m 1 q m k l r l 1 1 k l c i q m k c e 1 k l q m 9 freundlich ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e 10 temkin q e b ln k t b ln c e b rt b here

freundlich constant n is adsorption intensity kt is temkin isotherm constant l g r is the universal gas constant kj mol k b is the temkin isotherm constant kj mol is related to the energy parameter and t is the absolute temperature k the results of the isotherm study showed that the experimental data obtained from the adsorption process of cd2 and pb2 ions using the magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 follows the langmuir isotherm model higher values of r2 in table 3 therefore according to the langmuir isotherm model adsorption of cd2 and pb2 ions using a magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 is done as monolayer adsorption and homogeneous surfaces compared to heterogeneous surfaces have essential effects on the adsorption process the maximum efficiency of monolayer adsorption capacity qm of cd2 and pb2 ions was determined to be 48 5437 and 57 1429 mg g respectively using the desired magnetic nanocomposite in addition the values of the rl parameter were in the range between 0 and 1 which indicates that the adsorption process of cd2 and pb2 ions were performed optimally using the adsorbent in addition the value of parameter n was determined using the freundlich isotherm model more than 1 which emphasizes the desirability of the adsorption process of the desired metal ions using the desired magnetic nanocomposite 54 positive values of b for adsorption of cd2 and pb2 ions using magnetic nanocomposites emphasize the exothermic of the adsorption process 55 which is highly consistent with the results of the thermodynamic study 3 6 comparison of adsorption capacity of adsorbents table 4 shows the adsorption capacity of magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 compared to other adsorbents used in the adsorption process of cd2 and pb2 ions from aqueous solution as the results show the adsorbent has a good ability and performance in removing ions of cd2 and pb2 metals from aqueous solution compared to other adsorbents therefore it can be suggested that the magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 can be used as an effective adsorbent to remove heavy metal ions from an aqueous solution 3 7 wastewater treatment of shipbuilding industries today producing adsorbents with good efficiency and performance for industrial wastewater treatment containing heavy metal ions is essential one of the most important commercial industries that contain wastewater containing heavy metal ions and can be dangerous to the environment and other living organisms is the shipbuilding industry in the present study the ability of magnetic nanocomposites to remove heavy metal ions from shipbuilding wastewater was investigated for this purpose first the suspended particles in the prepared wastewater were filtered then wastewater ph was adjusted using hcl and naoh with a concentration of 1 m at a value of 6 0 5 the shipbuilding wastewater treatment process was investigated using a magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 in the batch system for 60 min pre treatment shipbuilding effluent had ph of 6 7 cod of 174 mg l ni2 of 24 56 mg l cd2 of 37 52 mg l pb2 of 12 38 mg l and cu2 of 7 26 mg l after the treatment process the wastewater composition of the shipbuilding industry was significantly reduced and had a ph of 6 83 cod of 61 mg l ni2 of 1 48 mg l cd2 of 1 18 mg l pb2 of 0 76 mg l and cu2 of 0 52 mg l the results show that the magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 has a good ability to remove heavy metal ions from industrial wastewater and can be used as a promising option in industrial wastewater treatment 3 8 adsorption desorption process and stability the adsorption desorption of pb2 and cd2 was determined using a magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 up to 9 steps and the results are presented in fig 8a as the results show with increasing the number of steps of using the magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 the efficiency of pb2 and cd2 removal has decreased the resulting reduction in efficiency of eggshell starch fe3o4 can be due to various factors such as damage or changes in adsorption sites and saturation of related sites 66 67 the results also showed that after several adsorption desorption steps the magnetic nanocomposite of eggshell starch fe3o4 has a suitable ability to absorb pb2 and cd2 indicating that the magnetic nanocomposite is a viable material for decreasing the heavy metals pollution to show the stability of the magnetic nanocomposite after the adsorption desorption process of pb2 and cd2 ions vsm analysis was used fig 8b as the vsm results show the magnetic saturation values for the magnetic nanocomposites before and after the pb2 and cd2 adsorption process 5 cycles were set at 39 57 emu g 38 79 emu g and 37 57 emu g respectively the results showed that the amount of magnetic saturation for the nanocomposite did not change significantly which could be due to the little leaching of fe3o4 nanoparticles from the structure of the desired nanocomposite which emphasizes the stability of the composite 4 conclusions in this work a magnetic composite made of starch eggshell and iron oxide nanoparticles was introduced the composite had good efficiency and capacity in removing lead and cadmium ions appropriate physical and chemical properties like functional groups and suitable surface area led to such a good efficiency to decontaminate studied contaminants the applicability of the composite adsorbent was revealed by treating a real wastewater sample the introduced material had an acceptable efficiency after several consecutive reuses indicating that it was economical therefore eggshell starch fe3o4 composite can be developed in water and wastewater declaration of

12938,hap aerogels with higher adsorption speed and capacity were synthesized through a combination of freeze drying and template way using konjac gum kgm as template among them b hap hap aerogel prepared with 0 25 g kgm as template showed better micromorphology and structure leading to more available sites on b hap which was beneficial for the immobilization of uranium the removal efficiency of uranium by b hap was 99 4 within 10 min and the maximum removal capacity was up to 2055 2 mg g 1 which was larger than other reported adsorbents pseudo second order and langmuir models were better fitted with the adsorption behavior on hap aerogels indicating that uranium ions were immobilized on hap aerogels via chemical adsorption b hap also showed high selectivity stability and durability which was expected to be a feasible candidate for the extraction of uranium from wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords adsorption dissolution precipitation hydroxyapatite aerogel konjac gum uranium 1 introduction heavy metal pollution is one of the problems of the global environment which is more in developing countries due to the increased industrial activities and improper release of toxic metal through effluents 1 2 heavy metals can accumulate in the body of organisms and cause severe problems in the brain liver kidneys and immune systems owing to their high toxicity 3 uranium a radioactive and toxic heavy metal is the major nuclear energy source and the mean content of uranium in the crust of the earth is 2 8 ppm 4 32 with the rapid development of industry more and more uranium pollutants existing in environment have been discharged in water due to mining atomic reactor medical diagnostics nuclear accidents nuclear weapon explosions and so on which could lead to serious damage to the ecological environment and human health 5 7 hence it is emergent to develop a high efficiency method to deal with uranium containing wastewater various methods have been used to remove uranium from aqueous solution such as ion exchange ultrafiltration electrochemical flocculation adsorption and so on 8 9 among them adsorption is considered as a more environmentally friendly safer convenient to operate and higher efficiency method 10 11 for example the multiaperture chitosan carboxylated carbon nanotubes compound aerogels cs ccn with diverse contents of ccn were synthesized by tang et al 12 the maximum mono layer adsorptive capacity of cs ccn2 aerogel was 307 5 mg g 1 when ph was 5 0 and the temperature was 298 k ye et al 13 used luffa rattan lr as raw material to prepare functional biochar f lrbc the results demonstrated that f lrbc was a feasible adsorbent for the removal of uranium from aqueous solution which possessed the maximum removal capacity of 382 mg g 1 when ph was 6 0 at room temperature however above adsorbents still existed many problems like low adsorption capacity and high cost it was still an urgent problem to find an adsorbent with the advantages of high adsorption efficiency large adsorption capacity and low cost hydroxyapatite hap is one of the most attractive materials for uranium removal due to its physical chemical mechanical and biological properties 14 15 the presence of phosphate in hap structure could constrain the mobility and transformation of uranium 16 17 hap could be synthesized via chemical precipitation biological calcination sol gel template freeze drying and so on 18 20 for example han et al 21 used fish bones to prepare bio hydroxyapatite with the maximum adsorption capacity of 384 6 mg g 1 at ph 3 0 while the preparation process was not sufficiently economical because of the large input of energy su et al 22 prepared porous hap to extract uranium from wastewater and its maximum u vi adsorption capacity was 111 4 mg g 1 at ph 3 0 magnetically modified hydroxyapatite nanoparticles mnha synthesized by el maghrabi et al 23 showed a maximum uranium adsorption capacity of 310 mg g 1 at ph 5 0 and it reached uranium adsorption equilibrium within 120 min above reported hap based adsorbents still had some defects including long adsorption equilibrium time low adsorption capacity high cost etc hence it is still necessary to seek an available and low cost way to prepare hap based adsorbents with shorter adsorption equilibrium time and higher adsorption capacity previous studies had demonstrated that freeze drying calcination method a combination of freeze drying and template method was a novel method to synthesize adsorbent with good particle distribution and porous structure which could provide more active sites to remove uranium 24 25 the choice of template was a significant work which could affect the morphology and structure of the products 26 konjac gum kgm a classical polysaccharide derived from the tuber of amorphophallus konjac plant with good reproducibility biocompatibility and degradability is mainly composed of glucose and mannose units via β 1 4 glycosidic bonds in a molar ratio around of 1 1 6 27 28 due to the large quantity existence of hydroxyl and carbonyl groups on the saccharide units the kgm chains could easily form gels with high porosity tunable densities and desirable porous structure through hydrogen bonding interaction making it a good framework material for the preparation of aerogel 29 30 to obtain hap based adsorbents with shorter adsorption equilibrium time and higher adsorption capacity hap aerogels were prepared via freeze drying calcination method using kgm as template the influences of the corresponding factors like the ph of solution the dosage of adsorbent various ions contact time initial uranium concentration selectivity stability recoverability and leaching properties were studied thoroughly the results showed that b hap had an excellent adsorption for uranium with short adsorption equilibrium time 10 min high adsorption capacity 2055 2 mg g 1 and efficiency 99 4 b hap also performed high selectivity stability and durability which was supposed to be an available adsorbent for the treatment of wastewater 2 experimental 2 1 materials hydroxyapatite hap 99 was purchased from guilin hongxing biotechnology co ltd china calcium nitrate tetrahydrate ca no3 2 4h2o 98 and diammonium hydrogen phosphate nh4 2hpo4 98 were provided by shanghai xinyu biotechnology co ltd china and henan xinzhiyuan chemical products co ltd china respectively konjac gum kgm 99 purchased from hebei kelongduo biotechnology co ltd china was considered as the template uranium nitrate uo2 no3 2 6h2o 99

solution provided by chengdu zhongzhi chemical co ltd china were adopted to change the solution ph na2co3 99 8 nano3 99 5 naclo4 h2o 99 5 na2so4 99 5 na3po4 99 5 nacl 99 5 kcl 99 5 cacl2 96 0 mgcl2 99 0 and alcl3 6h2o 97 0 were obtained from chengdu chron chemicals deionized water was adopted to synthesize solution 2 2 preparation of hap aerogels firstly 50 ml deionized water was used to dissolve 2 36 g ca no3 2 4h2o and 0 79 g mol nh4 2hpo4 to obtain ca no3 2 solution and nh4 2hpo4 solution respectively then nh4 2hpo4 solution was gradually put into ca no3 2 solution and then hap appeared in the solution in the form of precipitates eqs s1 3 next 0 125 g kgm was put in the mixed solution and then stirred constantly for 1 h to form uniform gels with high porosity tunable densities and desirable porous structure through hydrogen bonding interaction 30 after that the uniform gels were frozen at 60 c for 72 h to gain hap kgm aerogels finally as prepared composite aerogels were calcined at 650 c for 3 h in muffle furnace to fully dislodge kgm and the final products were hap aerogels 29 the hap kgm aerogels hap aerogels prepared via 0 125 g 0 25 g and 0 5 g kgm as template were named as a hap kgm a hap b hap kgm b hap and c hap kgm c hap respectively the mass ratios of hap and kgm in above mentioned hap kgm aerogels were about 8 1 4 1 and 2 1 respectively the specific process of hap aerogels was shown in the fig 1 2 3 characterization the residual content of uranium in the solution after uranium adsorption was measured by ultraviolet visible spectrum uv vi joscov 650 scanning electron microscopy sem sigma 500 was employed to investigate the micromorphology of hap aerogels fourier transform infrared spectrometer ft ir lida 20 was applied to explore the composition of hap aerogels from 4000 to 400 cm 1 the xrd patterns of hap aerogels were recorded by x ray diffractometer xrd arl equninx 3000 with cu kα irradiation 45 kv 45 ma and λ 1 54056 å x ray photoelectron spectrum xps escalab 250xi was used to measure the elemental content of hap aerogels before and after adsorption and the scanning range was from 0 to 700 ev the thermal performances of specimens were tested via thermo gravimetric analyzer tga tga4000 inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes expec 6500 was used to determine the element components all specimens were needed to be dried before the test and all of the tests were carried out at room temperature 2 4 batch adsorption experiments batch mode technique was carried out to investigate the performances of hap aerogels for uranium removal in each experiment 0 1 g l 1 hap aerogels were stirred with 100 mg l 1 uranium solution for 30 min however the impacts of adsorbent mass and the contact time were exceptional in order to obtain more authentic experimental results all of the experiments were performed for three times and error bars had been provided the adsorption capacity at equilibrium qe mg g 1 and the removal rate r of uranium were computed as follows 31 32 1 q e c 0 c e m v 2 r c 0 c e c 0 100 among them c0 mg l 1 and ce mg l 1 were the original concentration and balance concentration of uranium respectively v was the uranium solution volume l and m was hap aerogel quality g 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization as shown in fig 2 for a hap the particles of different size were observed and most of particles were agglomerated together as for c hap it could be found that the distribution of particles was irregular and a part of particles were gathered together however the particles on the surface of b hap were almost uniformly distributed and clear pore structure could be seen 21 33 those results indicated that varying the amount of kgm could effectively regulate and control the micromorphology and microstructure of hap aerogels and the specific dispersion of hap in kgm with different concentrations were shown in fig s1 according to the results of fig s1 it could be inferred that when the amount of kgm was less the hap particles could not disperse evenly in kgm matrix to form a stable dispersion system resulting in the aggregation of the particles on a large scale when the amount of kgm was too high surplus kgm dosage would decrease its dispersion activity due to the increase of the apparent viscosity leading to the appearance of local agglomeration 27 in terms of previous studies it could be found that there were supposed to be more active sited on the surface of samples with better morphology and microstructure 34 35 which were good for the extraction of uranium from aqueous solution notably the particle distribution of b hap was more uniform and the pore structure was also clearer indicating that b hap possessed better morphology and microstructure which were good for the capture of uranium from aqueous solution to obtain more information about the functional group of samples ft ir spectra were measured in the range of 400 to 4000 cm 1 from fig 3a the stretching vibration and bending vibration absorption peaks of oh were around 3450 and 1645 cm 1 respectively 36 37 the bands at 1103 and 1039 cm 1 were belonged to phosphate acid groups which were related to the triple antisymmetric degeneration of vibration mode ν3 38 the peaks at 604 and 564 cm 1 were due to the degenerate double bond mode ν4 caused by the vibration of o p o band 39 it was worth noting that the peaks observed at 2973 and 2914 cm 1 on the spectra of kgm a hap kgm b hap kgm and c hap kgm were related to the vibration of c h 40 which were not be detected on the ft ir spectra of hap aerogels indicating that kgm had been dislodged after calcination as shown in fig 3b it could be found that the xrd spectra for a hap b hap and c hap were all in good agreement with the standard card for hap ca10 po4 6 oh 2 pdf no 73 173 among them the major peaks at 2θ 25 8 31 7 31 8 32 2 34 3 39 9 and 46 7 were belonged to the 002 211 112 300 212 130 and 222 planes respectively 41 42 the xrd pattern of kgm was shown in fig s2 and there was only a broad peak on kgm indicating that kgm was amorphous 29 significantly the characteristic peak of kgm was not found on hap aerogels which suggested that kgm had been removed in addition there were no secondary phases besides hydroxyapatite such as aragonite pdf no 41 1475 or calcite pdf no 47 1743 further indicating that pure hap aerogels had successfully gained 43 45 xps was used to further analyze the chemical compositions of a hap b hap and c hap as shown in fig 3c the major elements of above samples were ca o p and c and the specific spectra of o 1 s p 2p and ca 2p were shown in figs s3 5 first of all the xps spectra of o 1 s were divided into two peaks which were attributed to hydroxyl groups oh and the anion oxygen o2 respectively then the area of oh for b hap 70 17 was higher than both a hap 64 82 and c hap 68 43 which was in favor of the extraction of uranium from aqueous solution by the formation of uo bands 46 as for the peaks at 347 47 and 351 03 ev they were related to the ca 2p 3 2 and ca 2p 1 2 respectively furthermore the peak at 133 03 ev was assigned to p 2p 47 48 all above results fully demonstrated that pure hap aerogels had successfully gained as shown in fig s6 the weight loss of kgm could be divided into three parts the first part performed at lower than 90 c which was related to the disappearance of physical water the second part was finished during 90 to 250 c which was owing to the disintegration of oxygen containing groups the final part was happened at 250 550 c which was belonged to the fully disintegration of kgm 29 fig 3d displayed the tga curves of a hap kgm b hap kgm c hap kgm a hap b hap and c hap as for a hap kgm b hap kgm and c hap kgm their weight loss still contained three parts the first part was the disappearance of physical water 150 c the second part was happened during 150 to 280 c which was related to the decomposition of oxygen containing groups on kgm meanwhile the completely decomposition of kgm was happened during 280 to 600 c and the residue substance was belonged to hap 49 50 hence it could be inferred that kgm could be fully removed after calcination 25 51 52 for a hap b hap and c hap the weight loss was 5 54 0 03 and 9 35 respectively indicating that hap aerogels possessed good thermal stability which was in good agreement with the conclusions of previous studies 53 54 3 2 adsorption studies 3 2 1 effect of ph adsorption experiments in uranium containing solution with various ph value were carried out to research the impacts of ph value on the existing form of uranium the existing forms of uranium at different ph were shown in fig 4a and the removal rates of uranium by a hap b hap and c hap at different ph values were shown in fig 4b as for all adsorbents the removal efficiency of uranium increased when the ph increased from 1 to 4 and then declined with the increase of ph from 4 to 7 when ph was lower than 4 the greater concentration of h led to a fierce competition between h and uo2 2 ions resulting in low removal efficiency of uranium however while ph was over than 4 the uranyl ions were transformed into uranium hydroxide complexes with the increase of the concentration of oh which possessed lower adsorption affinity to uranium leading to a decrease of adsorption capacity 55 57 at the same time the corresponding chemical equations were listed in supporting information in terms of above conclusions it could be inferred that the most suitable ph value was 4 which was well consistent with the results of zero point potential fig s7 the maximum removal rates of uranium by a hap b hap and c hap at ph 4 were 94 6 99 2 and 97 8 respectively furthermore the adsorption efficiencies of uranium on purchased hap a hap kgm b hap kgm c hap kgm at various ph values were displayed in fig s8 the adsorption efficiencies of uranium on purchased hap a hap kgm b hap kgm c hap kgm arrived the maximum values at ph 4 and the corresponding values were 95 4 73 2 65 9 and 53 7 respectively there was no doubt that b hap showed better uranium adsorption properties due to its uniform particle distribution and porous structure on basis of above results the next adsorption experiments were supposed to be in progress at ph 4 3 2 2 effect of adsorbent dosage as shown in fig 4c the removal capacity of uranium by hap aerogels kept decreasing with the increase of adsorbent which was because that the increase of adsorbent would cause the formation of unsaturated adsorption active sites 35 on the contrary the removal efficiency of uranium on hap aerogels increased with the raising of adsorbent mass in the range of 0 to 0 1 g l 1 which was owing to the constantly increasing opportunities of collisions between hap aerogels and uranium the removal efficiencies reached the maximum values and the maximum removal efficiencies of uranium by a hap b hap and c hap were 95 5 98 9 and 96 4 respectively when adsorbent dosage was 0 1 g l 1 with further increasing the adsorbent dosage 0 1 g l 1 the removal efficiencies reached equilibrium due to the availability of excessive binding sites for uranium 58 as for adsorption capacity it kept decreasing with the increase of adsorbent which was due to the lack of uranium ions in the solution compared to the number of adsorbents 23 59 b hap had higher uranium adsorption capacity and efficiency than either a hap or c hap because of its comparatively uniform particle distribution and pore structure hence b hap would be a potential candidate as adsorbent on uranium removal 3 2 3 effect of co existing ions the removal of uranium ions by adsorbents was not only due to the dosage of adsorbent and the ph value of the solution but also related to the interfering ions in the solution as the ubiquitous cations and anions in natural water or wastewater k na mg2 ca2 al3 no3 clo4 so4 2 co3 2 and po4 3 ions were selected as the typical ions to determine the removal performances of uranium by hap aerogels as for cations it was easy to found that the introduction of cations could inhibit the uranium adsorption on adsorbents in various degrees which was owing to increase of ionic strength 36 among them the presence of al3 had tremendously decreased the adsorption efficiencies of uranium the difference between these cations was mainly due to the size of cations and their charges there was a stronger competition between uranium and cations with higher ion size and valence state leading to a lower adsorption efficiency 60 for anions it could be found that the presence of no3 clo4 and so4 2 hardly affected the uranium adsorption efficiencies yet co3 2 and po4 3 ions would greatly decrease the adsorption efficiencies of uranium this phenomenon was because various complex compounds appeared when uranium contacted with co3 2 and po4 3 leading to the reduction of adsorption efficiency for example electrically neutral species uo2co3 and uo2hpo4 might form when co3 2 and po4 3 ions were existed in the uranium containing solution 61 furthermore the uranium removal rates of a hap b hap and c hap in solution with various ions were not same for instance the uranium adsorption removal efficiencies of uranium by a hap b hap and c hap in aqueous solution containing with al3 were 0 9 10 1 and 5 0 respectively on the whole b hap showed better uranium adsorption performances no matter in the solution containing any co existing ions which was attributed the homogeneous particle distribution and pore structure of b hap 3 2 4 adsorption kinetics as shown in fig s9 the removal rates of uranium on all adsorbents were very fast from the beginning which was because there were a lot of active centers on the surface of adsorbents 62 as time went by the number of active sites on adsorbents gradually reduced leading to the decrease of the adsorption rate after 10 min the adsorption to uranium reached equilibrium the corresponding experimental data of a hap b hap c hap and hap were 949 2 993 9 973 1 and 954 2 mg g 1 respectively compared with others b hap showed higher adsorption performances and was expected to be a feasible adsorbent for the extraction of uranium from aqueous solution to further analyze the removal behavior of uranium on hap aerogels pseudo first order pseudo second order elovich and intra particle diffusion models were adopted and the related information were listed in supporting information 9 63 64 as shown in fig 5 and table 1 the r2 of pseudo second order model for a hap b hap and c hap were 0 9999 0 9999 and 0 9999 respectively which were closer to value 1 than pseudo first order elovich and intra particle diffusion models indicating that pseudo second order model was better fitted with the experimental data and the uranium adsorption process on hap aerogels was chemical adsorption 5 6 from the results of intra particle diffusion model the straight lines did not pass through the origin indicating that the intra particle diffusion was not the only mechanism to control the rate of adsorption 65 the adsorption process could be divided into two stages 66 67 the first stage might be back to the uranium ions adsorption on the surface with macro pore structure and it was the fastest adsorption stage the second stage might be regarded as the intra particle diffusion through the mesopores and micropores which was impeded by the electrostatic repulsion between adsorbents resulting in that the adsorption process slowed down further and the adsorption accessed to equilibrium 3 2 5 adsorption isotherms from fig s10 the equilibrium removal capacities of a hap b hap c hap and hap for uranium were gradually raised with the raising of the initial uranium concentration when the concentration of uranium reached a critical value the adsorption capacity did not rise and reached a maximum value this phenomenon indicated that the active centers on adsorbent were not fully occupied when the concentration of uranium was low with the increase of uranium concentration saturation of available binding sites on the adsorbents surface arrived and the adsorption capacity tended to be stable 68 69 the actually maximum removal capacities of a hap b hap c hap and hap for uranium were 1074 6 2052 1 1680 4 and 1240 7 mg g 1 respectively on the whole b hap performed better uranium removal performances owing to its even particle size distribution and pore structure langmuir freundlich dubinin radushkevich and temkin isotherm models were adopted to match the empirical data to explain the removal behavior of uranium onto hap aerogels and the corresponding equations were shown in supporting information 70 as shown in fig 6 and table 2 the r2 of langmuir freundlich dubinin radushkevich and temkin isotherm models for a hap b hap c hap were 0 9999 0 9999 0 9999 0 7537 0 8008 0 8466 0 9368 0 9195 0 8463 and 0 9303 0 9090 0 9303 respectively obviously the r2 of langmuir isotherm model for all of adsorbents was closer to 1 indicating that the removal behavior of uranium on hap aerogels was a monolayer chemical adsorption 71 in terms of the results of table 2 it could be calculated that the values of 1 nf for a hap b hap and c hap were 0 136 0 210 and 0 213 respectively which were all higher than zero meaning that the adsorption process was chemical adsorption 72 the values of e for a hap b hap and c hap were 20 08 36 76 and 26 17 kj mol 1 respectively which were all higher than 16 kj mol 1 indicating that the uranium adsorption on hap aerogels might be dominated by particle diffusion 73 the values of bt for a hap b hap and c hap were 23 21 9 68 and 11 02 respectively which were all higher than 8 suggesting that the adsorption process was of chemical nature 74 above conclusions further demonstrated that uranium adsorption on hap aerogels was a chemical process to justify the validity of hap aerogels for the uranium removal the maximum removal capacity of b hap was contrasted with other reported adsorbents in table 3 the results fully demonstrated that b hap was an excellent adsorbent for uranium and had great application prospect in uranium containing wastewater to assess the removal performances of uranium by hap aerogels additional performance metrics were used such as the separation factor constant rl langmuir surface coverage rate θ and solid phase distribution coefficient kd 51 52 the corresponding equations were shown in supporting information as shown in fig 6c the values of rl changed from 0 004 to 0 078 suggesting that the hap aerogels were promising adsorbents for the capture of uranium from aqueous solution 75 the relationship between θ and the initial uranium concentration was shown in fig s11 obviously the removal of uranium by hap aerogels was quick at the beginning of reaction which could be explained by lots of free active sites on hap aerogels and then kept stable when the active sites on hap aerogels were almost occupied indicating that langmuir model could be used to describe the removal of uranium on hap aerogels 51 52 besides the most of kd values were more than 1 0 104 fig 6d demonstrating that hap aerogels possessed high affinity to uranium and hap aerogels were considered as ideal and potential adsorbents for the extraction of from aqueous solution 76 3 2 6 thermodynamic analysis there was no doubt that temperature had a vital impact on the adsorption capacities to research the influences of temperature on uranium removal by hap aerogel the thermodynamic study was performed in the temperature range of 298 to 323 k ph 4 contact time of 30 min uranium consistence of 100 mg l 1 and hap aerogel dose of 0 1 g l 1 free energy of gibbs δg0 enthalpy δh0 and entropy δs0 were computed using the following equations 77 78 3 g rt ln k 4 ln k h rt s r where t was the kelvin temperature r 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 was the general constant of the gases and k was the thermodynamic equilibrium constant as shown in fig 7 and table 4 the uranium adsorption efficiencies kept increasing with the increase of temperature indicating that higher temperature was in favor of the removal behavior of uranium ions on hap aerogels the positive values of δs0 were the proofs that there was an increase of randomness during the uranium removal on the adsorbents 79 the values of δh0 for all adsorbents were more than zero demonstrating that the uranium adsorption onto hap aerogels was an endothermic nature process 80 it was worth noting that the value of δh0 for b hap 49 4 kj mol 1 was higher than that of either a hap 26 2 kj mol 1 or c hap 32 2 kj mol 1 indicating that the interaction force between uranium ions and b hap was stronger than that of a hap and c hap 81 negative values for δg meant a spontaneous and feasible thermodynamic adsorption process δg was inversely related to temperature suggesting that the adsorption process was more efficient at higher temperature 82 which was in good agreement with the result of δs0 on the whole higher temperatures could facilitate the removal of u vi ions on hap aerogels and the removal process was of endothermic character 3 2 7 selectivity in order to examine the selective adsorption property of hap aerogels towards to uranium the adsorption selectivity of some common heavy metals such as pb cr cd cu etc was examined as shown in figs 8a and s12 the adsorption efficiencies of uranium by hap aerogels were much higher than those of other common heavy metals which might be owing to the high stability of the uranyl phosphoric bond 83 phosphate groups also showed higher affinity to uranium than other heavy metals leading to higher uranium adsorption efficiency 84 it was worth noting that the adsorption efficiencies of uranium on b hap were even more than 80 in the presence of these heavy metals indicating that b hap possessed higher selectivity for uranium 3 2 8 stability reusability and leaching studies from fig 3d there was nearly no loss of weight indicating hap aerogels possessed good thermal stability 85 according to the results of batch adsorption experiments hap aerogels presented high adsorption efficiency and adsorption for uranium at low ph meaning that hap aerogels had good chemical stability furthermore uranium ions were immobilization on hap aerogels via the formation of ca uo2 2 po4 2 3h2o demonstrating that hap aerogels possessed favorable adsorption capacity to uranium with long term stability 46 to sum up hap aerogels possessed physical and chemical stability the reusability of the hap aerogels was studied by carrying out several times successive adsorption desorption cycles with 0 1 m na2co3 as effluent which were shown in fig 8b it was worth noting that hap aerogels could be partially resolved in na2co3 solution which was because that co3 2 would compete with hap aerogels to form uo2 co3 n 2 2n n 1 3 86 the desorption efficiencies of a hap b hap and c hap were 64 72 and 69 after five consecutive cycles respectively obviously b hap also showed better reusability and was supposed to be an available adsorption material with application potential to learned the leaching behavior of po4 3 in the hap aerogels the solutions after uranium adsorption were characterized by icp oes 87 88 the results demonstrated that there was no po4 3 in the solution meaning that no po4 3 in the hap aerogel leached into the solution and the as prepared hap aerogels possessed high stability and durability during the sorption experiments 3 2 9 mechanism according to the existing form of uranium in 100 mg l 1 uranium solution from ph 1 to 11 fig 4a it could be inferred that when the ph of initial uranium solution was 4 0 uranium could be removed by hap aerogels through the formation of uo2 2 and uo2oh 89 90 the detailed removal mechanism was further demonstrated by the conclusions of bet ft ir xrd and xps after adsorbing uranium on the as prepared samples as shown in fig 9a and b the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm of b hap belonged to type iv with a distinct hysteresis loop suggesting that b hap possessed the typical mesoporous structure properties 91 there were abundant micropores and mesopores in b hap and the average pore diameter was 7 1 nm which was in favor of the uranium adsorption process 92 after adsorption of uranium the specific surface area of b hap decreased from 107 9 to 48 2 m2 g 1 and the average pore diameter changed from 7 1 to 13 4 nm the reason for these phenomena might be related to the formation of new phases on the surface of b hap indicating that uranium had been successfully immobilized on b hap the ft ir spectra of a hap b hap and c hap after removal of uranium were displayed in fig 9c it was easy to found that a new band at 913 cm 1 was detected on adsorbents after removal of uranium which was belonged to the formation of o u o indicating that uranium had successfully combined with hap aerogels furthermore the intensities of po4 3 characteristic peaks at 1139 1103 604 and 564 cm 1 became weak after uranium adsorption demonstrating that po4 3 group would involve in the reaction between hap aerogels with uranium ions 93 according to above results it could be inferred that the uranium ions could be absorbed by hap aerogels as shown in fig 9d the patterns of xrd had changed greatly compared with those before adsorption it could be found that some new bands were found on adsorbents after removal of uranium which were assigned to the formation of a new uranium containing phase the new peaks at 2θ 10 5 16 4 17 9 and 24 5 were related to 001 101 110 and 102 of ca uo2 2 po4 2 3h2o pdf no 39 1351 22 94 the appearance of ca uo2 2 po4 2 3h2o further demonstrated that phosphate and calcium ions had participated in the reaction and uranium had been really combined with hap aerogels the xps spectrums of b hap before and after removal were carried out to provide more details on the chemical changes fig 9e from fig 9f two new peaks were observed at 381 94 ev u 4f 7 2 and 392 75 ev u 4f 5 2 95 as for the xps spectra of o 1 s fig 9g the measure of area for oh had changed from 70 17 to 52 39 after uranium removal due to the reaction between hydroxyl groups and uranium ions for p 2p xps spectra fig 9h the bonding energy of p 2p had changed from 133 03 to 133 28 ev demonstrating that phosphate group would participate in the reaction between adsorbent and uranium ions the xps spectra of ca 2p before uranium adsorption were divided into two peaks ca 2p 3 2 347 47 ev and ca 2p 1 2 351 03 ev which were shown in fig s13 it could be found that the bonding energy of both ca 2p 3 2 and ca 2p 1 2 were shifted to 347 67 ev and 351 22 ev after adsorption of uranium respectively which were because that ca2 was probably combined with uo2 2 96 97 above conclusions were well consistent with the results of ft ir and xrd analysis in sum the uranium removal by hap aerogels was chemical adsorption and the probably adsorption mechanism was dissolution precipitation in other words a spot of hap aerogels dissolved and released ca2 and po4 3 resulting in the production of ca uo2 2 po4 2 3h2o fig 10 4 conclusion hap aerogels synthesized via a combination of freeze drying and template method with kgm as template were adopted to extract uranium from wastewater among them b hap presented better morphology and microstructure than either a hap or c hap which could supply more active adsorption sites enhancing the uranium extraction property from aqueous solution the removal efficiency and capacity of uranium by b hap were 99 4 and 2055 2 mg g 1 respectively experimental results demonstrated that pseudo second order and langmuir models were more suitable for the description of the adsorption behavior on hap aerogels suggesting that uranium ions were loaded on hap aerogels via chemical adsorption b hap also performed high selectivity stability and durability which was supposed to be a feasible and efficient adsorbent for the extraction of uranium from aqueous solution declaration of competing interest the authors

12938,hap aerogels with higher adsorption speed and capacity were synthesized through a combination of freeze drying and template way using konjac gum kgm as template among them b hap hap aerogel prepared with 0 25 g kgm as template showed better micromorphology and structure leading to more available sites on b hap which was beneficial for the immobilization of uranium the removal efficiency of uranium by b hap was 99 4 within 10 min and the maximum removal capacity was up to 2055 2 mg g 1 which was larger than other reported adsorbents pseudo second order and langmuir models were better fitted with the adsorption behavior on hap aerogels indicating that uranium ions were immobilized on hap aerogels via chemical adsorption b hap also showed high selectivity stability and durability which was expected to be a feasible candidate for the extraction of uranium from wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords adsorption dissolution precipitation hydroxyapatite aerogel konjac gum uranium 1 introduction heavy metal pollution is one of the problems of the global environment which is more in developing countries due to the increased industrial activities and improper release of toxic metal through effluents 1 2 heavy metals can accumulate in the body of organisms and cause severe problems in the brain liver kidneys and immune systems owing to their high toxicity 3 uranium a radioactive and toxic heavy metal is the major nuclear energy source and the mean content of uranium in the crust of the earth is 2 8 ppm 4 32 with the rapid development of industry more and more uranium pollutants existing in environment have been discharged in water due to mining atomic reactor medical diagnostics nuclear accidents nuclear weapon explosions and so on which could lead to serious damage to the ecological environment and human health 5 7 hence it is emergent to develop a high efficiency method to deal with uranium containing wastewater various methods have been used to remove uranium from aqueous solution such as ion exchange ultrafiltration electrochemical flocculation adsorption and so on 8 9 among them adsorption is considered as a more environmentally friendly safer convenient to operate and higher efficiency method 10 11 for example the multiaperture chitosan carboxylated carbon nanotubes compound aerogels cs ccn with diverse contents of ccn were synthesized by tang et al 12 the maximum mono layer adsorptive capacity of cs ccn2 aerogel was 307 5 mg g 1 when ph was 5 0 and the temperature was 298 k ye et al 13 used luffa rattan lr as raw material to prepare functional biochar f lrbc the results demonstrated that f lrbc was a feasible adsorbent for the removal of uranium from aqueous solution which possessed the maximum removal capacity of 382 mg g 1 when ph was 6 0 at room temperature however above adsorbents still existed many problems like low adsorption capacity and high cost it was still an urgent problem to find an adsorbent with the advantages of high adsorption efficiency large adsorption capacity and low cost hydroxyapatite hap is one of the most attractive materials for uranium removal due to its physical chemical mechanical and biological properties 14 15 the presence of phosphate in hap structure could constrain the mobility and transformation of uranium 16 17 hap could be synthesized via chemical precipitation biological calcination sol gel template freeze drying and so on 18 20 for example han et al 21 used fish bones to prepare bio hydroxyapatite with the maximum adsorption capacity of 384 6 mg g 1 at ph 3 0 while the preparation process was not sufficiently economical because of the large input of energy su et al 22 prepared porous hap to extract uranium from wastewater and its maximum u vi adsorption capacity was 111 4 mg g 1 at ph 3 0 magnetically modified hydroxyapatite nanoparticles mnha synthesized by el maghrabi et al 23 showed a maximum uranium adsorption capacity of 310 mg g 1 at ph 5 0 and it reached uranium adsorption equilibrium within 120 min above reported hap based adsorbents still had some defects including long adsorption equilibrium time low adsorption capacity high cost etc hence it is still necessary to seek an available and low cost way to prepare hap based adsorbents with shorter adsorption equilibrium time and higher adsorption capacity previous studies had demonstrated that freeze drying calcination method a combination of freeze drying and template method was a novel method to synthesize adsorbent with good particle distribution and porous structure which could provide more active sites to remove uranium 24 25 the choice of template was a significant work which could affect the morphology and structure of the products 26 konjac gum kgm a classical polysaccharide derived from the tuber of amorphophallus konjac plant with good reproducibility biocompatibility and degradability is mainly composed of glucose and mannose units via β 1 4 glycosidic bonds in a molar ratio around of 1 1 6 27 28 due to the large quantity existence of hydroxyl and carbonyl groups on the saccharide units the kgm chains could easily form gels with high porosity tunable densities and desirable porous structure through hydrogen bonding interaction making it a good framework material for the preparation of aerogel 29 30 to obtain hap based adsorbents with shorter adsorption equilibrium time and higher adsorption capacity hap aerogels were prepared via freeze drying calcination method using kgm as template the influences of the corresponding factors like the ph of solution the dosage of adsorbent various ions contact time initial uranium concentration selectivity stability recoverability and leaching properties were studied thoroughly the results showed that b hap had an excellent adsorption for uranium with short adsorption equilibrium time 10 min high adsorption capacity 2055 2 mg g 1 and efficiency 99 4 b hap also performed high selectivity stability and durability which was supposed to be an available adsorbent for the treatment of wastewater 2 experimental 2 1 materials hydroxyapatite hap 99 was purchased from guilin hongxing biotechnology co ltd china calcium nitrate tetrahydrate ca no3 2 4h2o 98 and diammonium hydrogen phosphate nh4 2hpo4 98 were provided by shanghai xinyu biotechnology co ltd china and henan xinzhiyuan chemical products co ltd china respectively konjac gum kgm 99 purchased from hebei kelongduo biotechnology co ltd china was considered as the template uranium nitrate uo2 no3 2 6h2o 99 purchased from hubei guangao biotechnology co ltd was used to prepare low concentration solution with uranium sodium hydroxide naoh 98 aqueous solution and hydrochloric acid hcl 36 0 38 0 aqueous solution provided by chengdu zhongzhi chemical co ltd china were adopted to change the solution ph na2co3 99 8 nano3 99 5 naclo4 h2o 99 5 na2so4 99 5 na3po4 99 5 nacl 99 5 kcl 99 5 cacl2 96 0 mgcl2 99 0 and alcl3 6h2o 97 0 were obtained from chengdu chron chemicals deionized water was adopted to synthesize solution 2 2 preparation of hap aerogels firstly 50 ml deionized water was used to dissolve 2 36 g ca no3 2 4h2o and 0 79 g mol nh4 2hpo4 to obtain ca no3 2 solution and nh4 2hpo4 solution respectively then nh4 2hpo4 solution was gradually put into ca no3 2 solution and then hap appeared in the solution in the form of precipitates eqs s1 3 next 0 125 g kgm was put in the mixed solution and then stirred constantly for 1 h to form uniform gels with high porosity tunable densities and desirable porous structure through hydrogen bonding interaction 30 after that the uniform gels were frozen at 60 c for 72 h to gain hap kgm aerogels finally as prepared composite aerogels were calcined at 650 c for 3 h in muffle furnace to fully dislodge kgm and the final products were hap aerogels 29 the hap kgm aerogels hap aerogels prepared via 0 125 g 0 25 g and 0 5 g kgm as template were named as a hap kgm a hap b hap kgm b hap and c hap kgm c hap respectively the mass ratios of hap and kgm in above mentioned hap kgm aerogels were about 8 1 4 1 and 2 1 respectively the specific process of hap aerogels was shown in the fig 1 2 3 characterization the residual content of uranium in the solution after uranium adsorption was measured by ultraviolet visible spectrum uv vi joscov 650 scanning electron microscopy sem sigma 500 was employed to investigate the micromorphology of hap aerogels fourier transform infrared spectrometer ft ir lida 20 was applied to explore the composition of hap aerogels from 4000 to 400 cm 1 the xrd patterns of hap aerogels were recorded by x ray diffractometer xrd arl equninx 3000 with cu kα irradiation 45 kv 45 ma and λ 1 54056 å x ray photoelectron spectrum xps escalab 250xi was used to measure the elemental content of hap aerogels before and after adsorption and the scanning range was from 0 to 700 ev the thermal performances of specimens were tested via thermo gravimetric analyzer tga tga4000 inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes expec 6500 was used to determine the element components all specimens were needed to be dried before the test and all of the tests were carried out at room temperature 2 4 batch adsorption experiments batch mode technique was carried out to investigate the performances of hap aerogels for uranium removal in each experiment 0 1 g l 1 hap aerogels were stirred with 100 mg l 1 uranium solution for 30 min however the impacts of adsorbent mass and the contact time were exceptional in order to obtain more authentic experimental results all of the experiments were performed for three times and error bars had been provided the adsorption capacity at equilibrium qe mg g 1 and the removal rate r of uranium were computed as follows 31 32 1 q e c 0 c e m v 2 r c 0 c e c 0 100 among them c0 mg l 1 and ce mg l 1 were the original concentration and balance concentration of uranium respectively v was the uranium solution volume l and m was hap aerogel quality g 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization as shown in fig 2 for a hap the particles of different size were observed and most of particles were agglomerated together as for c hap it could be found that the distribution of particles was irregular and a part of particles were gathered together however the particles on the surface of b hap were almost uniformly distributed and clear pore structure could be seen 21 33 those results indicated that varying the amount of kgm could effectively regulate and control the micromorphology and microstructure of hap aerogels and the specific dispersion of hap in kgm with different concentrations were shown in fig s1 according to the results of fig s1 it could be inferred that when the amount of kgm was less the hap particles could not disperse evenly in kgm matrix to form a stable dispersion system resulting in the aggregation of the particles on a large scale when the amount of kgm was too high surplus kgm dosage would decrease its dispersion activity due to the increase of the apparent viscosity leading to the appearance of local agglomeration 27 in terms of previous studies it could be found that there were supposed to be more active sited on the surface of samples with better morphology and microstructure 34 35 which were good for the extraction of uranium from aqueous solution notably the particle distribution of b hap was more uniform and the pore structure was also clearer indicating that b hap possessed better morphology and microstructure which were good for the capture of uranium from aqueous solution to obtain more information about the functional group of samples ft ir spectra were measured in the range of 400 to 4000 cm 1 from fig 3a the stretching vibration and bending vibration absorption peaks of oh were around 3450 and 1645 cm 1 respectively 36 37 the bands at 1103 and 1039 cm 1 were belonged to phosphate acid groups which were related to the triple antisymmetric degeneration of vibration mode ν3 38 the peaks at 604 and 564 cm 1 were due to the degenerate double bond mode ν4 caused by the vibration of o p o band 39 it was worth noting that the peaks observed at 2973 and 2914 cm 1 on the spectra of kgm a hap kgm b hap kgm and c hap kgm were related to the vibration of c h 40 which were not be detected on the ft ir spectra of hap aerogels indicating that kgm had been dislodged after calcination as shown in fig 3b it could be found that the xrd spectra for a hap b hap and c hap were all in good agreement with the standard card for hap ca10 po4 6 oh 2 pdf no 73 173 among them the major peaks at 2θ 25 8 31 7 31 8 32 2 34 3 39 9 and 46 7 were belonged to the 002 211 112 300 212 130 and 222 planes respectively 41 42 the xrd pattern of kgm was shown in fig s2 and there was only a broad peak on kgm indicating that kgm was amorphous 29 significantly the characteristic peak of kgm was not found on hap aerogels which suggested that kgm had been removed in addition there were no secondary phases besides hydroxyapatite such as aragonite pdf no 41 1475 or calcite pdf no 47 1743 further indicating that pure hap aerogels had successfully gained 43 45 xps was used to further analyze the chemical compositions of a hap b hap and c hap as shown in fig 3c the major elements of above samples were ca o p and c and the specific spectra of o 1 s p 2p and ca 2p were shown in figs s3 5 first of all the xps spectra of o 1 s were divided into two peaks which were attributed to hydroxyl groups oh and the anion oxygen o2 respectively then the area of oh for b hap 70 17 was higher than both a hap 64 82 and c hap 68 43 which was in favor of the extraction of uranium from aqueous solution by the formation of uo bands 46 as for the peaks at 347 47 and 351 03 ev they were related to the ca 2p 3 2 and ca 2p 1 2 respectively furthermore the peak at 133 03 ev was assigned to p 2p 47 48 all above results fully demonstrated that pure hap aerogels had successfully gained as shown in fig s6 the weight loss of kgm could be divided into three parts the first part performed at lower than 90 c which was related to the disappearance of physical water the second part was finished during 90 to 250 c which was owing to the disintegration of oxygen containing groups the final part was happened at 250 550 c which was belonged to the fully disintegration of kgm 29 fig 3d displayed the tga curves of a hap kgm b hap kgm c hap kgm a hap b hap and c hap as for a hap kgm b hap kgm and c hap kgm their weight loss still contained three parts the first part was the disappearance of physical water 150 c the second part was happened during 150 to 280 c which was related to the decomposition of oxygen containing groups on kgm meanwhile the completely decomposition of kgm was happened during 280 to 600 c and the residue substance was belonged to hap 49 50 hence it could be inferred that kgm could be fully removed after calcination 25 51 52 for a hap b hap and c hap the weight loss was 5 54 0 03 and 9 35 respectively indicating that hap aerogels possessed good thermal stability which was in good agreement with the conclusions of previous studies 53 54 3 2 adsorption studies 3 2 1 effect of ph adsorption experiments in uranium containing solution with various ph value were carried out to research the impacts of ph value on the existing form of uranium the existing forms of uranium at different ph were shown in fig 4a and the removal rates of uranium by a hap b hap and c hap at different ph values were shown in fig 4b as for all adsorbents the removal efficiency of uranium increased when the ph increased from 1 to 4 and then declined with the increase of ph from 4 to 7 when ph was lower than 4 the greater concentration of h led to a fierce competition between h and uo2 2 ions resulting in low removal efficiency of uranium however while ph was over than 4 the uranyl ions were transformed into uranium hydroxide complexes with the increase of the concentration of oh which possessed lower adsorption affinity to uranium leading to a decrease of adsorption capacity 55 57 at the same time the corresponding chemical equations were listed in supporting information in terms of above conclusions it could be inferred that the most suitable ph value was 4 which was well consistent with the results of zero point potential fig s7 the maximum removal rates of uranium by a hap b hap and c hap at ph 4 were 94 6 99 2 and 97 8 respectively furthermore the adsorption efficiencies of uranium on purchased hap a hap kgm b hap kgm c hap kgm at various ph values were displayed in fig s8 the adsorption efficiencies of uranium on purchased hap a hap kgm b hap kgm c hap kgm arrived the maximum values at ph 4 and the corresponding values were 95 4 73 2 65 9 and 53 7 respectively there was no doubt that b hap showed better uranium adsorption properties due to its uniform particle distribution and porous structure on basis of above results the next adsorption experiments were supposed to be in progress at ph 4 3 2 2 effect of adsorbent dosage as shown in fig 4c the removal capacity of uranium by hap aerogels kept decreasing with the increase of adsorbent which was because that the increase of adsorbent would cause the formation of unsaturated adsorption active sites 35 on the contrary the removal efficiency of uranium on hap aerogels increased with the raising of adsorbent mass in the range of 0 to 0 1 g l 1 which was owing to the constantly increasing opportunities of collisions between hap aerogels and uranium the removal efficiencies reached the maximum values and the maximum removal efficiencies of uranium by a hap b hap and c hap were 95 5 98 9 and 96 4 respectively when adsorbent dosage was 0 1 g l 1 with further increasing the adsorbent dosage 0 1 g l 1 the removal efficiencies reached equilibrium due to the availability of excessive binding sites for uranium 58 as for adsorption capacity it kept decreasing with the increase of adsorbent which was due to the lack of uranium ions in the solution compared to the number of adsorbents 23 59 b hap had higher uranium adsorption capacity and efficiency than either a hap or c hap because of its comparatively uniform particle distribution and pore structure hence b hap would be a potential candidate as adsorbent on uranium removal 3 2 3 effect of co existing ions the removal of uranium ions by adsorbents was not only due to the dosage of adsorbent and the ph value of the solution but also related to the interfering ions in the solution as the ubiquitous cations and anions in natural water or wastewater k na mg2 ca2 al3 no3 clo4 so4 2 co3 2 and po4 3 ions were selected as the typical ions to determine the removal performances of uranium by hap aerogels as for cations it was easy to found that the introduction of cations could inhibit the uranium adsorption on adsorbents in various degrees which was owing to increase of ionic strength 36 among them the presence of al3 had tremendously decreased the adsorption efficiencies of uranium the difference between these cations was mainly due to the size of cations and their charges there was a stronger competition between uranium and cations with higher ion size and valence state leading to a lower adsorption efficiency 60 for anions it could be found that the presence of no3 clo4 and so4 2 hardly affected the uranium adsorption efficiencies yet co3 2 and po4 3 ions would greatly decrease the adsorption efficiencies of uranium this phenomenon was because various complex compounds appeared when uranium contacted with co3 2 and po4 3 leading to the reduction of adsorption efficiency for example electrically neutral species uo2co3 and uo2hpo4 might form when co3 2 and po4 3 ions were existed in the uranium containing solution 61 furthermore the uranium removal rates of a hap b hap and c hap in solution with various ions were not same for instance the uranium adsorption removal efficiencies of uranium by a hap b hap and c hap in aqueous solution containing with al3 were 0 9 10 1 and 5 0 respectively on the whole b hap showed better uranium adsorption performances no matter in the solution containing any co existing ions which was attributed the homogeneous particle distribution and pore structure of b hap 3 2 4 adsorption kinetics as shown in fig s9 the removal rates of uranium on all adsorbents were very fast from the beginning which was because there were a lot of active centers on the surface of adsorbents 62 as time went by the number of active sites on adsorbents gradually reduced leading to the decrease of the adsorption rate after 10 min the adsorption to uranium reached equilibrium the corresponding experimental data of a hap b hap c hap and hap were 949 2 993 9 973 1 and 954 2 mg g 1 respectively compared with others b hap showed higher adsorption performances and was expected to be a feasible adsorbent for the extraction of uranium from aqueous solution to further analyze the removal behavior of uranium on hap aerogels pseudo first order pseudo second order elovich and intra particle diffusion models were adopted and the related information were listed in supporting information 9 63 64 as shown in fig 5 and table 1 the r2 of pseudo second order model for a hap b hap and c hap were 0 9999 0 9999 and 0 9999 respectively which were closer to value 1 than pseudo first order elovich and intra particle diffusion models indicating that pseudo second order model was better fitted with the experimental data and the uranium adsorption process on hap aerogels was chemical adsorption 5 6 from the results of intra particle diffusion model the straight lines did not pass through the origin indicating that the intra particle diffusion was not the only mechanism to control the rate of adsorption 65 the adsorption process could be divided into two stages 66 67 the first stage might be back to the uranium ions adsorption on the surface with macro pore structure and it was the fastest adsorption stage the second stage might be regarded as the intra particle diffusion through the mesopores and micropores which was impeded by the electrostatic repulsion between adsorbents resulting in that the adsorption process slowed down further and the adsorption accessed to equilibrium 3 2 5 adsorption isotherms from fig s10 the equilibrium removal capacities of a hap b hap c hap and hap for uranium were gradually raised with the raising of the initial uranium concentration when the concentration of uranium reached a critical value the adsorption capacity did not rise and reached a maximum value this phenomenon indicated that the active centers on adsorbent were not fully occupied when the concentration of uranium was low with the increase of uranium concentration saturation of available binding sites on the adsorbents surface arrived and the adsorption capacity tended to be stable 68 69 the actually maximum removal capacities of a hap b hap c hap and hap for uranium were 1074 6 2052 1 1680 4 and 1240 7 mg g 1 respectively on the whole b hap performed better uranium removal performances owing to its even particle size distribution and pore structure langmuir freundlich dubinin radushkevich and temkin isotherm models were adopted to match the empirical data to explain the removal behavior of uranium onto hap aerogels and the corresponding equations were shown in supporting information 70 as shown in fig 6 and table 2 the r2 of langmuir freundlich dubinin radushkevich and temkin isotherm models for a hap b hap c hap were 0 9999 0 9999 0 9999 0 7537 0 8008 0 8466 0 9368 0 9195 0 8463 and 0 9303 0 9090 0 9303 respectively obviously the r2 of langmuir isotherm model for all of adsorbents was closer to 1 indicating that the removal behavior of uranium on hap aerogels was a monolayer chemical adsorption 71 in terms of the results of table 2 it could be calculated that the values of 1 nf for a hap b hap and c hap were 0 136 0 210 and 0 213 respectively which were all higher than zero meaning that the adsorption process was chemical adsorption 72 the values of e for a hap b hap and c hap were 20 08 36 76 and 26 17 kj mol 1 respectively which were all higher than 16 kj mol 1 indicating that the uranium adsorption on hap aerogels might be dominated by particle diffusion 73 the values of bt for a hap b hap and c hap were 23 21 9 68 and 11 02 respectively which were all higher than 8 suggesting that the adsorption process was of chemical nature 74 above conclusions further demonstrated that uranium adsorption on hap aerogels was a chemical process to justify the validity of hap aerogels for the uranium removal the maximum removal capacity of b hap was contrasted with other reported adsorbents in table 3 the results fully demonstrated that b hap was an excellent adsorbent for uranium and had great application prospect in uranium containing wastewater to assess the removal performances of uranium by hap aerogels additional performance metrics were used such as the separation factor constant rl langmuir surface coverage rate θ and solid phase distribution coefficient kd 51 52 the corresponding equations were shown in supporting information as shown in fig 6c the values of rl changed from 0 004 to 0 078 suggesting that the hap aerogels were promising adsorbents for the capture of uranium from aqueous solution 75 the relationship between θ and the initial uranium concentration was shown in fig s11 obviously the removal of uranium by hap aerogels was quick at the beginning of reaction which could be explained by lots of free active sites on hap aerogels and then kept stable when the active sites on hap aerogels were almost occupied indicating that langmuir model could be used to describe the removal of uranium on hap aerogels 51 52 besides the most of kd values were more than 1 0 104 fig 6d demonstrating that hap aerogels possessed high affinity to uranium and hap aerogels were considered as ideal and potential adsorbents for the extraction of from aqueous solution 76 3 2 6 thermodynamic analysis there was no doubt that temperature had a vital impact on the adsorption capacities to research the influences of temperature on uranium removal by hap aerogel the thermodynamic study was performed in the temperature range of 298 to 323 k ph 4 contact time of 30 min uranium consistence of 100 mg l 1 and hap aerogel dose of 0 1 g l 1 free energy of gibbs δg0 enthalpy δh0 and entropy δs0 were computed using the following equations 77 78 3 g rt ln k 4 ln k h rt s r where t was the kelvin temperature r 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 was the general constant of the gases and k was the thermodynamic equilibrium constant as shown in fig 7 and table 4 the uranium adsorption efficiencies kept increasing with the increase of temperature indicating that higher temperature was in favor of the removal behavior of uranium ions on hap aerogels the positive values of δs0 were the proofs that there was an increase of randomness during the uranium removal on the adsorbents 79 the values of δh0 for all adsorbents were more than zero demonstrating that the uranium adsorption onto hap aerogels was an endothermic nature process 80 it was worth noting that the value of δh0 for b hap 49 4 kj mol 1 was higher than that of either a hap 26 2 kj mol 1 or c hap 32 2 kj mol 1 indicating that the interaction force between uranium ions and b hap was stronger than that of a hap and c hap 81 negative values for δg meant a spontaneous and feasible thermodynamic adsorption process δg was inversely related to temperature suggesting that the adsorption process was more efficient at higher temperature 82 which was in good agreement with the result of δs0 on the whole higher temperatures could facilitate the removal of u vi ions on hap aerogels and the removal process was of endothermic character 3 2 7 selectivity in order to examine the selective adsorption property of hap aerogels towards to uranium the adsorption selectivity of some common heavy metals such as pb cr cd cu etc was examined as shown in figs 8a and s12 the adsorption efficiencies of uranium by hap aerogels were much higher than those of other common heavy metals which might be owing to the high stability of the uranyl phosphoric bond 83 phosphate groups also showed higher affinity to uranium than other heavy metals leading to higher uranium adsorption efficiency 84 it was worth noting that the adsorption efficiencies of uranium on b hap were even more than 80 in the presence of these heavy metals indicating that b hap possessed higher selectivity for uranium 3 2 8 stability reusability and leaching studies from fig 3d there was nearly no loss of weight indicating hap aerogels possessed good thermal stability 85 according to the results of batch adsorption experiments hap aerogels presented high adsorption efficiency and adsorption for uranium at low ph meaning that hap aerogels had good chemical stability furthermore uranium ions were immobilization on hap aerogels via the formation of ca uo2 2 po4 2 3h2o demonstrating that hap aerogels possessed favorable adsorption capacity to uranium with long term stability 46 to sum up hap aerogels possessed physical and chemical stability the reusability of the hap aerogels was studied by carrying out several times successive adsorption desorption cycles with 0 1 m na2co3 as effluent which were shown in fig 8b it was worth noting that hap aerogels could be partially resolved in na2co3 solution which was because that co3 2 would compete with hap aerogels to form uo2 co3 n 2 2n n 1 3 86 the desorption efficiencies of a hap b hap and c hap were 64 72 and 69 after five consecutive cycles respectively obviously b hap also showed better reusability and was supposed to be an available adsorption material with application potential to learned the leaching behavior of po4 3 in the hap aerogels the solutions after uranium adsorption were characterized by icp oes 87 88 the results demonstrated that there was no po4 3 in the solution meaning that no po4 3 in the hap aerogel leached into the solution and the as prepared hap aerogels possessed high stability and durability during the sorption experiments 3 2 9 mechanism according to the existing form of uranium in 100 mg l 1 uranium solution from ph 1 to 11 fig 4a it could be inferred that when the ph of initial uranium solution was 4 0 uranium could be removed by hap aerogels through the formation of uo2 2 and uo2oh 89 90 the detailed removal mechanism was further demonstrated by the conclusions of bet ft ir xrd and xps after adsorbing uranium on the as prepared samples as shown in fig 9a and b the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm of b hap belonged to type iv with a distinct hysteresis loop suggesting that b hap possessed the typical mesoporous structure properties 91 there were abundant micropores and mesopores in b hap and the average pore diameter was 7 1 nm which was in favor of the uranium adsorption process 92 after adsorption of uranium the specific surface area of b hap decreased from 107 9 to 48 2 m2 g 1 and the average pore diameter changed from 7 1 to 13 4 nm the reason for these phenomena might be related to the formation of new phases on the surface of b hap indicating that uranium had been successfully immobilized on b hap the ft ir spectra of a hap b hap and c hap after removal of uranium were displayed in fig 9c it was easy to found that a new band at 913 cm 1 was detected on adsorbents after removal of uranium which was belonged to the formation of o u o indicating that uranium had successfully combined with hap aerogels furthermore the intensities of po4 3 characteristic peaks at 1139 1103 604 and 564 cm 1 became weak after uranium adsorption demonstrating that po4 3 group would involve in the reaction between hap aerogels with uranium ions 93 according to above results it could be inferred that the uranium ions could be absorbed by hap aerogels as shown in fig 9d the patterns of xrd had changed greatly compared with those before adsorption it could be found that some new bands were found on adsorbents after removal of uranium which were assigned to the formation of a new uranium containing phase the new peaks at 2θ 10 5 16 4 17 9 and 24 5 were related to 001 101 110 and 102 of ca uo2 2 po4 2 3h2o pdf no 39 1351 22 94 the appearance of ca uo2 2 po4 2 3h2o further demonstrated that phosphate and calcium ions had participated in the reaction and uranium had been really combined with hap aerogels the xps spectrums of b hap before and after removal were carried out to provide more details on the chemical changes fig 9e from fig 9f two new peaks were observed at 381 94 ev u 4f 7 2 and 392 75 ev u 4f 5 2 95 as for the xps spectra of o 1 s fig 9g the measure of area for oh had changed from 70 17 to 52 39 after uranium removal due to the reaction between hydroxyl groups and uranium ions for p 2p xps spectra fig 9h the bonding energy of p 2p had changed from 133 03 to 133 28 ev demonstrating that phosphate group would participate in the reaction between adsorbent and uranium ions the xps spectra of ca 2p before uranium adsorption were divided into two peaks ca 2p 3 2 347 47 ev and ca 2p 1 2 351 03 ev which were shown in fig s13 it could be found that the bonding energy of both ca 2p 3 2 and ca 2p 1 2 were shifted to 347 67 ev and 351 22 ev after adsorption of uranium respectively which were because that ca2 was probably combined with uo2 2 96 97 above conclusions were well consistent with the results of ft ir and xrd analysis in sum the uranium removal by hap aerogels was chemical adsorption and the probably adsorption mechanism was dissolution precipitation in other words a spot of hap aerogels dissolved and released ca2 and po4 3 resulting in the production of ca uo2 2 po4 2 3h2o fig 10 4 conclusion hap aerogels synthesized via a combination of freeze drying and template method with kgm as template were adopted to extract uranium from wastewater among them b hap presented better morphology and microstructure than either a hap or c hap which could supply more active adsorption sites enhancing the uranium extraction property from aqueous solution the removal efficiency and capacity of uranium by b hap were 99 4 and 2055 2 mg g 1 respectively experimental results demonstrated that pseudo second order and langmuir models were more suitable for the description of the adsorption behavior on hap aerogels suggesting that uranium ions were loaded on hap aerogels via chemical adsorption b hap also performed high selectivity stability and durability which was supposed to be a feasible and efficient adsorbent for the extraction of uranium from aqueous solution declaration of competing interest the authors

12939,the use of graphene based materials in water purification via adsorption processes has become attractive among the scientific community in the recent decades its high porosity great surface area and especially the available functional groups on its surface and potential for modification with new functional groups make graphene a promising adsorbent among the possible modifications the grafting on n based functional groups in the surface of graphene has gained prominence in the production of adsorbents for water purification since it results in a material with improved properties and high adsorption capacity towards a series of water contaminants this review presents a comprehensive approach of the main n based functionalization techniques namely solvothermal photoelectric reduction in situ polymerization and direct compounding processes as well as a description of a variety of characterization techniques that are commonly applied for these composites furthermore an overview of the recent applications of n functionalized graphene in water purification is presented accompanied by a discussion of the most important influential parameters the main results in terms of adsorption efficiency and reusability as well as future perspectives for the development of this research field graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords graphene composites graphene oxide synthesis water treatment pollutant removal 1 introduction water pollution is one of the most relevant environmental concerns worldwide due to the constant emerging of new compounds and the discovery of its potential toxic effects on the environment and human health the removal of water pollutants is permanently a very important research topic with studies on degradation and or separation of pollutants coming from various sources including pharmaceuticals personal care products pesticides industrial additives dyes and heavy metals through many different processes 1 2 among the water purification techniques adsorption is one of the most used separation methods due to its operational simplicity and wide range of potential applications adsorption is based on the transfer of the target pollutant adsorbate from the fluid phase to the surface of a solid phase adsorbent by chemical and physical interactions among the adsorbents activated carbon ac has been the most extensively used in several water matrices in face of its low production cost and favorable physico chemical properties especially its porous structure and high surface area 3 furthermore the development of new adsorbents with enhanced adsorption capacity towards specific pollutants has also been a topic of interest of researchers and functionalized graphene composites have emerged as promising alternatives for water purification 4 6 graphene is a carbon allotrope composed by sheets of single layer sp2 hybridized carbon atoms configured in honeycomb like structures fig 1 7 8 the carbon atoms within the graphene layers are covalently bonded to each other and the layers can be linked by van der waals forces 9 the specific physico chemical properties graphene and graphene based materials make it suitable for many purposes including drug delivery different kinds of sensors hydrogen storage energy storage photovoltaic energy generation polymer nanocomposites semiconductor materials catalysis and water purification 10 11 graphene can be synthesized by two main routes based in the i construction bottom up of graphene layers or the ii destruction top down of a structure into graphene layers 12 bottom up methods consist in the growth of graphene films in a substrate from atomic size precursors and include epitaxial growth 13 chemical vapor deposition cvd 14 substrate free gas phase synthesis 15 template route 16 and total organic synthesis 17 top down include oxidative exfoliation reduction 18 19 mechanical exfoliation 20 arc discharge 21 and unzipping of cnt 22 these methods aim to overcome van der waals forces and dissociate carbon based precursors into single or multi layer graphene sheets 9 although several methods of graphene synthesis have been developed most of the graphene synthesis still occurs in small amounts for lab applications mainly through the hummers method 19 however in the recent years some industries have started to produce graphene in large scale like versarien and first graphene that have a production capacity up to 100 ton year 23 24 graphene is commonly classified in the literature as i pristine graphene 0 8 5 oxygen ii graphene oxide go 10 4 54 4 oxygen and reduced graphene oxide rgo 17 5 31 3 oxygen and the amount of oxygen groups present in its structure varies according to the synthesis method 25 due to its high hydrophilicity easy modification simple operation lower production cost compared to pristine graphene and potential for large scale production go is the most commonly employed derivative for water purification processes 6 26 27 go is rich in oxygen functional groups such as hydroxyl epoxide on its surface and carboxylic ketone and aldehyde groups on the edges fig 1 its high specific surface area approximately 2630 m2 g 1 low cytotoxicity large amounts of free π π electrons vacant reactive sites at the edges as well as the potential for chemical modifications by reactive functional groups make go an attractive sorbent material 28 30 however the use of non functionalized graphene in water purification has some limitations since its adsorption capacity is limited to the available amount of oxygen functional groups and its sheets tend to aggregate due to interplanar interactions reducing the effective area of the adsorbent 31 32 therefore the application of functionalized graphene for water purification via adsorption has received increased attention in the recent decades in the removal of pollutants including heavy metals 33 pharmaceuticals 34 personal care products 35 dyes 36 pesticides 37 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs 38 among others among the precursors used to functionalize graphene adsorbent composites several n based can be highlighted due to its effectiveness for this purpose with functional groups including amine amide hydrazine imine imidazole and amidoxime which increase the adsorption capacity of graphene by enhancing its affinity towards the adsorbate and preventing agglomeration 39 a few recent review articles have approached up to some extent the application of n functionalized graphene in water purification 39 42 however this work intends to present a deeper assessment focused only in n functionalized graphene composites starting with a detailed report about its functionalization methods with n based precursors and the available characterization techniques for these composites furthermore this paper presents a review of the most relevant recent studies using n functionalized graphene nanocomposites for water purification and an evaluation its main results are presented as well as a discussion of future research perspectives as a final goal the present review intends to point out the lacks of research regarding the use graphene composite in water purification that still represent a challenge for the scaling up of this technology 2 graphene n based functionalization nitrogen based functional groups such as amine amide hydrazine imine imidazole and amidoxime have been one of the main alternatives for graphene functionalization due to its capacity to provide lone electron pairs to coordinate with the target pollutants of the adsorption process 42 among the nitrogen based functional groups amino is by far the most employed due to its capacity to improve the chemical affinity of the graphene towards pollutants and the relatively high variety of available precursors for functionalization 33 43 2 1 functionalization methods since the discovery of graphene several techniques have been developed to graft functional groups to this material and improve its applicability as a sorbent for water purification the functionalization with n based groups has been carried out mainly through solvothermal photoelectric reduction in situ polymerization and direct compounding methods fig 2 39 moreover other techniques have been applied less often to synthetize graphene composites namely coprecipitation and exfoliation restacking 44 2 1 1 solvothermal also known as hydrothermal synthesis this technique normally involves the preparation of a solution with the nitrogen precursor followed by the addition of go and autoclavation solvothermal synthesis is a one step technique that does not require the addition of catalysts and is considered a promising technique to design the morphology of nh2 functionalized graphene composites 39 ammonia assisted hydrothermal synthesis is one of the simplest techniques for n doping of graphene and has been carried out by dispensing graphene in an ammonia water solution in an autoclave at temperatures of 200 c for 10 h 45 and 220 c for a 3 h 46 the same method has been applied using urea as nitrogen source for 3 h at 160 c 47 and 220 c 46 furthermore researchers have produced magnetic graphene using fe3o4 and functionalized with 1 2 ethylenediamine eda 48 and edta 49 dispersing the precursors in ethylene glycol and applying thermal treatment in a teflon autoclave for 8 h at 200 c and 10 h at 180 c respectively additionally lai et al and chen et al proposed the functionalization of go under similar conditions using ammonia water and fecl3 6h2o diethylenetriamine deta respectively as precursors 50 51 2 1 2 photoelectric reduction this method can be used to rapidly and simultaneously reduce and functionalize graphene through and electric discharge or γ ray irradiation in the presence of the precursors 39 researchers have produced graphene composites via photoelectric reduction using the dielectric barrier discharge dbd plasma technique employing polypyrrole ppy as precursor applying a 30 min electric discharge at a voltage of 100 110 v and a power of 200 w using nitrogen as plasma source 31 dbd has also been applied to graft acrylamide in go under 30 min treatment with argon plasma with voltage 120 v and power of 240 w 52 xu et al pre treated go with high purity nitrogen and then grafted acrylamide under γ ray irradiation with a dose rate of 0 8 kgy h 1 53 2 1 3 in situ polymerization also referred as in situ growth this technique widely used in the functionalization of graphene with nitrogen based groups the polymerization process requires the addition of an activator of the go carboxylic functional groups commonly a solution of 1 ethyl 3 3 dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide edc and n hydroxysuccinnimide nhs 32 54 55 in addition some researchers used socl2 56 57 trimesoyl chloride 58 dichloromethane 59 as activators of the carboxylic groups replacing the oh of these groups by cl thus enabling the decoration with nh2 containing compounds these processes have been carried out in different solvents including dmf 55 56 59 methanol 54 and deionized water 32 60 several n based compounds have been grafted to graphene via in situ polymerization namely p phenylendiamine 55 triaminotriazine 56 eda n n bis 2 pyridylmethyl 59 chitosan 54 2 phenylethylamine 60 poly allylamine hydrochloride 32 1 2 diaminocyclohexanetetraacetic acid dcta 61 and m phenylenediamine 58 2 1 4 direct compounding direct compounding is currently simplest most widely applied method of graphene functionalization since it only requires the addition of a nh2 precursor to a graphene solution under mechanical agitation with mild heating or ambient temperature and no need of activators or special reaction conditions 39 a way frequently used to link n based compounds to graphene is the silanization mechanism through the reaction of silane with the hydroxyl groups present on the go surface 62 researchers have used this approach to functionalize graphene with edta silane 63 3 aminopropyltriethoxysilane aptes 64 69 3 trimethoxysilylpropyl ethylenetriamine tmspeda and 3 trimethoxysilylpropyl diethylenetriamine tmspdeta 63 67 in direct compounding synthesis graphene commonly is dispersed in deionized water or ethanol solution via ultrasonication for times up to 2 h and then with the addition of a n based precursor stirred for times varying from 3 to 48 h at room temperature or heating up to 100 c and then washed with deionized water o ethanol solution 31 63 64 66 75 2 2 characterization a variety of physical chemical characterization techniques can be applied to evaluate these composites including fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy uv vis adsorption spectroscopy raman spectroscopy scanning electron microscopy sem field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem transmission electron microscopy tem zeta potential vibrating sample magnetometry vsm x ray diffraction analysis xrd x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps brunauer emmett teller surface area analysis bet atomic force microscopy afm x ray energy dispersive spectroscopy eds and scanning transmission electron microscopy stem 2 2 1 ftir spectrometry ftir spectrometry is one of the most applied analysis for characterization of graphene nanosheets since it can aid the identification of the functional groups present on its structure the technique consists in emitting radiation in the infrared region and detecting absorption peaks caused by alterations in the vibrational levels of these groups 76 typically go presents ftir adsorption peaks at 1047 1228 cm 1 co 1304 1415 cm 1 c o h 1622 1627 cm 1 c c 1646 1738 cm 1 c o and 3268 3417 cm 1 oh and when functionalized with n based compounds peaks at 1544 1565 cm 1 cn and nh and 1630 1647 cm 1 c n arise 56 59 75 77 79 alammar et al observed adsorption peaks of cc cn and cn at 1630 cm 1 1532 cm 1 and 1438 cm 1 wavelength respectively in a polybenzimidazole polydopamine go composite 80 the substitution of oh groups 3500 2500 cm 1 wavelength by conh and nh groups adsorption at 1638 and 1162 cm 1 as well as cn 2070 cm 1 via zinc hexacyanoferrate and n2 functionalization of rgo was also described 4 furthermore in direct compounding functionalization through silanization peaks at 1039 and 1121 cm 1 have been reported corresponding to si o si and si oc bonds 73 2 2 2 uv vis spectroscopy a simple and fast technique to evaluate the composition of graphene nanocomposites and to investigate the functional groups present in go is uv vis spectroscopy this method is based on the emission of radiation in the uv spectral range through a solution suspension of the material for determination of the transmission rate along the spectra the absorption occurs due to the transition of an electron from the lowest energy state to the excited state 81 it has been reported that go has presents an absorption peak at 230 nm with a shoulder in 300 nm related to π π transition from the aromatic cc bonds and the n π transition in the carbonyl bonds c o respectively while rgo the peak is observed at 270 nm ascribed to the n π transition in co bonds 53 82 83 furthermore seenivasan et al reported that the covalent bonding of l cysteine in go generated an uv vis absorption peak at 270 nm and xu et al observed an adsorption peak at 260 nm in go polyacrylamide subjected to induced reduction via γ ray likely associated with the reduction of the composite 53 83 2 2 3 raman spectroscopy raman spectroscopy is a technique used to identify and characterize the lattice structure as well as the optical electronic and phonon properties of carbon materials based on the inelastic scattering of photons emitted towards the analyzed material 84 in graphene nanosheets assessment the composites raman spectra presents a characteristic peak at a g band 1580 1611 cm 1 which is related to the stretching vibration of the sp2 hybridized carbon atoms of its bidimensional hexagonal lattice when graphene has defects and functional groups on its structure such as oxygen and nitrogen based groups a d band 1316 1368 cm 1 is observed that is related to sp3 hybridized carbon atoms 43 52 70 79 85 the intensity ratio of d and g bands id ig is associated with the number of defects in graphene or go when oxygen nitrogen or other functional groups are added the id ig increases 52 55 79 86 furthermore raman spectroscopy of graphene also presents a 2d band which results of phonon lattice vibrational process from an electron hole pair or a single electron hole and differently from the d band it does not need a defect in the structure to activate it the peak of this band lays between 2650 and 2750 cm 1 depending on the thickness of the graphene layer 87 88 2 2 4 sem fesem scanning electron microscopy sem and field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem are versatile techniques for microstructural analysis that enable to investigate topographical features compositional differences phase distribution morphology crystal structure and orientation as well as the presence and location of electrical defects of materials the technique is based on an electron beam emitted towards the sample which is excited releases secondary electrons that can be detected fesem is an enhanced sem method that provides higher resolution images 1 nm using low beam energies 89 go typically displays a smooth surface area with some wrinkles 59 77 and in magnetic graphene composites that have fe3o4 in its composition sem analysis shows the dispersion of these particles with formation of nanoneedles and a rough surface 61 70 it has also been highlighted that grafting amine based compounds to fe3o4 go or go in general makes their surface thicker rougher and more wrinkled 31 35 59 71 77 furthermore aggregated nanosheets layered structure and wrinkling were observed via sem in go functionalization of with amino silane 43 64 and when n based go composites were synthetized via dbd wrinkled and crumpled structures were obtained 52 90 in aerogels containing aminated go sem analysis displays irregular porous 3d structure in the cross section of the composites 91 changes according to the drying method applied in the synthesis of the aerogel 92 similarly sem image of polyacrylamide go hydrogel showed a sponge like structure with 2 to 10 μm diameter holes 93 whose diameter can vary depending on the polymer used in the hydrogel 74 additionally random stacking of rgo sheets in hydrogel was also reported 94 and pore diameters of 10 μm in amine functionalized graphene monoliths 78 sem can also be applied coupled to eds to analyze the presence and distribution of elements such as c o and n on the go composites surface as well as adsorbed components 58 67 72 73 2 2 5 tem in transmission electron microscopy tem an electron beam emitted towards an ultrathin sample and suffers several types of scattering that depend on the characteristics of the material providing information about its chemical and electronic structure 39 in graphene composites characterization tem is applied to identify defects vacancy dislocations and stone wales rotation as well as to determine the thickness of a sheet monolayer sheets present more transparent lines whilst multi layer sheets display darker lines in tem images 9 it has been reported that the n based functionalization of graphene produces corrugated sheets due to interactions between the functional groups which prevent agglomeration 73 80 overlapping and wrinkled crumpled structure is also verified in tem analysis of functionalized go with different precursors such as amino silane 68 and polyacrylamide 52 in bio graphene synthesized from corn stover via thermo chemical reduction process tem images indicated the formation of single and bilayer graphene sheets with smooth and clean edges 95 tem technique is often used associated with sem analysis to provide information about the morphological characteristics of the material like the distribution of fe3o4 in magnetic graphene 61 70 moreover when magnetic graphene was decorated with 2 phenylethylamine and sio2 through in situ polymerization spherical and agglomerated nanoparticles were displayed by tem analysis which was ascribed to the magneto dipole interactions and to the high surface charge of the fe3o4 nanoparticles 60 2 2 6 zeta potential zeta potential also referred as electrokinetic potential is the electrical potential at the slipping shear plane that separates fluid attached to the surface of a particle from mobile fluid 96 in adsorption processes it is an important parameter to investigate the interactions between the adsorbent and adsorbate since it is related to the electrical properties of interfacial layers in dispersion which are affected by various functional groups 97 the zeta potential of go composites decreases with the increase of ph duo to deprotonation pristine go has negative charges at natural environmental conditions ph 6 31 86 93 the point of zero charge pzc that consists of the ph value under which the charge is zero is obtained from zeta potential measurements negative charges favor the adsorption of positively charged contaminants such as heavy metals and cationic dyes via electrostatic interactions in this case alkaline conditions tend to improve the performance of the adsorption process 31 aminated compounds grafted to go tend to increase its pzc due to the positive charge of amines at neutral ph conditions 35 60 researches have verified pzc values of 9 8 6 5 6 6 6 7 and 3 4 for go polyethyleneimine 77 ac go chitosan 35 go fe3o4 sio2 phenylethylamine 60 go hyperbranched polymer tetraethylenepentamine 75 and go fe3o4 deta 50 respectively 2 2 7 vsm vsm is a technique applied to evaluate magnetic composites through the vibration of the sample this vibration induces perturbations in the external magnetic field of the sample which can be measured in terms of magnetic saturation emu g 1 by magnetic field sensors 98 in adsorption processes by graphene magnetic nanocomposites this property is important to determine the possibility of magnetic separation 99 researchers have found magnetic saturation values of 33 0 29 3 and 16 9 emu g 1 for fe3o4 sio2 go 2 phenylethyl amine 60 go fe3o4 deta 50 and go fe3o4 polydopamine 71 respectively according to these authors these values of magnetic saturation were enough for an easy separation of the magnetic composites from the aqueous media 2 2 8 xrd xrd is a technique widely used in the characterization of crystalline materials is general providing information about the crystallinity atomic arrangement crystallite size and imperfections of the material 100 the xrd equipment emits x rays towards the sample which are transmitted absorbed refracted scattered and diffracted at different angles and proportions by the sample 82 in graphene composites the interplanar distance can be determined by applying the bragg s law based on the diffraction angle 9 non functionalized go presents a strong diffraction peak at 2θ 10 with interlaying spacing between 0 77 and 0 95 nm which is significantly higher than the interlayer spacing for pristine graphite 0 34 nm 60 69 86 90 91 this difference is ascribed to the expansion promoted by the insertion of oxygen containing groups in the graphene sheets structures 61 in rgo the diffraction peak is found in 2θ 25 that represents a decrease in the interlayer distance 0 352 nm indicating the restoration of the sp2 carbon structure due to the removal of the oxygen functional groups 80 when functionalized with n based groups the go characteristic diffraction peak 2θ 10 normally disappears or decreases significantly and broad peaks at 2θ 20 to 25 are frequently displayed 52 64 85 86 these changes are attributed to a reduction in the orderliness of the functionalized composite s structure 65 in addition when fe3o4 is added to go composites several 2θ diffraction peaks are generated within the range of 30 1 and 62 5 which correspond to the facets of the cubic spinel crystal planes of fe3o4 54 61 2 2 9 xps xps is a surface sensitive method extensively employed in the study of nanomaterials based on the emission of x rays towards de sample that remove electrons from its surface 101 the kinetic energy of these electrons can be measured and enabling the determination of its binding energy that provides information about atoms or functional groups present on the surface of a material 102 in go nanocomposites xps is one of the most used techniques for surface evaluation being able to provide information on elemental composition bonding relationships and chemical state of the elements 103 several works reported in literature reported specific binding energies for functional groups present in graphene surface namely c c c c c h c n 285 ev c o c o o c o 287 289 ev co nh2 c nh2 c nh3 o c n 398 402 ev 67 86 93 94 104 furthermore the addition of fe3o4 to graphene generates xps peaks at 711 and 725 ev 50 70 thus the xps analysis can provide information about the successful grafting of functional groups onto graphene in addition the spectrum is also changed by the capture of the target pollutants during the adsorption treatment process especially metals that change the binding energy of electrons present in the functional groups 68 73 94 105 2 2 10 bet bet method is used to determine the specific surface area and pore size distribution barrett joyner halenda analysis bjh of materials based on the bet model for gas adsorption desorption onto a solid surface using and inert gas like nitrogen or argon 106 107 graphene has a high surface area that can vary significantly depending on its synthesis method and functionalization which are directly associated with more or less stacking agglomeration effects 9 researchers have reported bet surface areas of go varying from 21 to 272 m2 g 1 4 32 35 56 60 as for functionalized go n based precursors normally increase its surface area with reported values of 421 m2 g 1 for polyamide go 58 214 m2 g 1 for go ac chitosan 35 172 m2 g 1 for go poly allylamine hydrochloride 32 412 2 m2 g 1 for go fe3o4 chitosan 54 and 45 29 for go triaminotriazine alginate 56 similar behavior occurs with the average pore size and pore volume which vary significantly depending on the composites authors have also observed via bet analysis the average pore sizes of n functionalized graphene between 0 82 and 25 nm 4 50 56 58 60 105 and pore volume varying from 0 22 to 0 89 cm3 g 1 4 50 56 60 2 2 11 afm this advanced microscopy technique is based on a sharp tip probe that approaches the sample until tip sample forces start to act on it van der waals electrostatic magnetic and meniscus forces and then scans the sample topography the probe is held by a cantilever that deflects a laser which enables the equipment to read the scan 108 in graphene and its derivatives afm is used to determine the sample thickness and other morphological features 9 100 the theoretical thickness of graphene single layer is 0 334 nm however functional groups on its surface and stacking agglomeration usually increase this value 11 dong et al synthesized go via hummers method and reported sheet thickness of 1 nm which increased to 2 nm when functionalized with polydopamine and to 7 nm with higher surface roughness by adding the polymer polyethylenimine pei 74 another study reported lateral dimension of go sheets varying from 50 to 400 nm and thickness of 1 1 2 nm with little variation 0 2 nm indicating single layer sheet and 1 0 2 5 nm thickness of go poly n isopropylacrylamide showing significant variation on its topography 93 as for amino functionalized magnetic go authors have reported sheet thickness of 2 nm 50 2 2 12 eds energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds also known as xeds edx or edxs is an elemental analysis technique based on x ray excitation of a sample which emits x rays in unique wavelengths for different elements and intensities proportional to the amount the element in the sample 109 eds is commonly used to confirm a successful synthesis of a graphene composite by determining the percentage fe c n o si and other elements on the sample 64 67 71 the technique also enables to display its distribution of several elements on the surface of the graphene composites when coupled to sem 72 73 80 furthermore eds can also be used to determine the adsorption selectivity of graphene composites towards different contaminants by performing analysis after the adsorption of a mix of compounds in this sense zhao et al tested the affinity of go amine and go edta for cu2 ni2 cd2 and fe2 verifying a higher adsorption of cu2 in go amine 52 and ni2 in go edta 48 63 furthermore some researchers have performed eds analysis in n functionalized graphene after the adsorption process of metals 31 32 68 and nutrients 56 to confirm the presence of the adsorbate on the adsorbent 2 2 13 stem stem is a scanning method that can be applied to assess the structure of graphene nanosheets often used to detect and locate heavy elements on their structure 110 the technique consists of the emission of an electron beam towards the sample which is mostly detected by a bright field bf detector plus a part of these electrons that are scattered at small angles and detected by an annular dark field adf detector and a few of these electrons are scattered at high angles and captured by a high angle annular dark field haadf detector additionally the equipment can simultaneously analyze the main beam that crosses the sample using an electron energy loss spectroscopy eels detector 111 authors have applied haadf stem to visualize the presence and distribution of fe 110 co 112 zn co 113 and mn 111 in graphene matrixes which are displayed as bright dots in a dark scan image furthermore baladés et al reported that graphene nanosheets could be identified and located inside organic composites such as tridimensional polymer matrices using haadf stem technique which may be suitable to study graphene adsorbent composites such as aerogels and hydrogels 114 2 3 applications in water purification in the past few years several graphene based composites functionalized with nitrogen have been synthetized and studied as adsorbents for water contaminants removal and in general the functionalization increases significantly the adsorption capacity of graphene tables 1 and 2 most of the recent adsorption studies of n based graphene composites towards water contaminants have been carried out in lab scale batch systems for one or more specific compounds in synthetic matrices which allow preliminary studies on its adsorption capacity and kinetics as well as some influential parameters 65 68 95 105 some authors have produced magnetic go composites by grafting fe3o4 that can be dispersed in the contaminated matrix for adsorption and easily removed afterwards using an external magnet 49 50 54 60 71 73 it has also been reported the possibility of producing graphene composites immobilized in hydrogels using polymers such as poly n isopropylacrylamide 93 polyacrylonitrile 94 polyethyleneimine 77 and aerogels using polyacrylic acid under uv light 91 anionic polyacrylamide 92 ppy 86 and eda 79 in general there is still a relevant lack of research applying these composites in systems that are possible to scale up like fixed bed columns only a few authors have carried out studies with n functionalized graphene with potential for applications in real scale alammar et al fabricated membranes from go rgo and polybenzimidazole which were dip coated with polydopamine for separation of oil from water 80 delhiraja et al supported go in ac before functionalization with chitosan which increases the potential of scale up since ac can be used in membranes in varied particle sizes and at low cost 35 additionally studies carried out by mondal and majumder investigated the adsorption properties and hydrodynamic parameters of a packed bed reactor made of glass beads coated with amine functionalized rgo 115 and contreras ortiz et al assessed a column packed of amino go for separation of crude oil from water 116 2 3 1 inorganic compounds adsorption most studies of water purification using n functionalized graphene composites published to date evaluated metals as target pollutants the adsorption capacity for inorganic compounds can vary within a broad range depending on the adsorbent properties and the background conditions 61 69 for cr iv authors have reported adsorption capacities ranging 80 to 1185 mg g 1 61 68 73 75 77 86 it has been reported that graphene composites functionalized with secondary amines have shown higher adsorption capacity towards cr iv due to possible synergistic between neighboring amines 68 73 furthermore the adsorption capacities vary from 87 to 588 mg g 1 for cu ii 32 43 49 64 74 85 from 35 2 to 819 7 mg g 1 for pb ii 31 49 65 71 74 from 141 2 to 215 2 mg g 1 for u vi 50 55 from 113 to 301 2 mg g 1 for hg ii 49 74 from 56 6 to 106 mg g 1 for cd ii 74 78 103 mg g 1 for ni ii 63 27 64 mg g 1 for sr ii 52 265 5 for cs i 4 and 268 4 mg g 1 for hg ii 49 additionally kumar et al investigated the removal of the nutrients nitrate and phosphate using go triaminotriazine alginate and achieved adsorption capacities of 51 83 and 58 46 mg g 1 respectively 56 from the available literature it can be suggested that graphene composites have a great potential for metals adsorption prevailing among other classes of water pollutants even though in the majority of the studies the n functionalization of graphene significantly improves its adsorption capacity towards metals table 1 this value varies significantly among studies with the same target pollutant which may be related to the quality of the used graphene type of nitrogen precursor used as well as the experimental conditions applied 2 3 2 organic compounds adsorption among organic compounds dyes have a predominance in the adsorption studies using n functionalized graphene sorbents table 2 authors reported adsorption capacities varying from 243 31 to 819 7 mg g 1 for methylene blue 31 54 64 84 mg g 1 for congo red 70 113 5 mg g 1 for malachite green 91 and 982 mg g 1 for a mix of rhodamine b methylene blue and malachite green 93 the study of dyes adsorption by graphene composites has been developed up to some extent by the scientific community and presented an interesting potential however this field still needs more work for scaling up since dyes are major industrial pollutants present in high amounts of effluents produced by pulp paper dye production textile and other industries 36 some authors have also investigated the removal of pharmaceuticals with n functionalized graphene kyzas et al obtained a maximum adsorption capacity of 447 mg g 1 for dorzolamide using go poly acrylic acid decorated with chitosan as adsorbent 117 furthermore researchers verified maximum adsorption capacities of 172 mg g 1 for the antibiotic ciprofloxacin using bio graphene amine 95 as well as 13 7 and 11 2 mg g 1 for the pharmaceuticals acetaminophen and carbamazepine respectively using go ac chitosan 35 regarding the removal of other classes of organic water contaminants by these graphene composites there are only a few reports in the literature including pesticides 60 oil 80 116 personal care products 35 and industrial additives 35 79 2 3 3 adsorption mechanism several mechanisms are reported in the literature as responsible for the adsorption of both organic and inorganic compounds by n functionalized graphene composites fig 3 the adsorption mechanisms of n functionalized graphene composites towards metals are related to electrostatic interactions surface complexation coordination chelation and hydrogen bonding 61 69 as for organic compounds the adsorption typically occurs through hydrogen bonds as well as electrostatic hydrophobic and π π stacking interactions 31 54 91 both physisorption and chemisorption have been suggested in the literature as the main adsorption mechanism of these composites some authors have used the dubinin radushkevich d r isotherms to calculate the adsorption energy e that indicates physisorption when its values are below 8 kj mol 1 and chemisorption for higher values 56 58 60 79 92 additionally an indirect conclusion regarding the adsorption mechanisms could be made when the sorbent material has a good after several adsorption desorption cycles which suggests that the adsorption occurs mainly through weak interactions characterizing physisorption see table 3 regarding the adsorption kinetics graphene composites in general exhibit a pseudo second order rate with higher rates at the beginning of the process and as de the vacant adsorption sites become scarcer the rates decrease exponentially 65 90 94 the controlling mechanisms depend on the contaminant properties and on the characteristics of the adsorbent composites such as surface properties structure and available functional groups 39 2 3 4 adsorption thermodynamics in adsorption studies the thermodynamic parameters gibbs free energy g0 enthalpy h0 and entropy change s0 are often considered in the assessment of the process and calculated by eqs 1 2 and 3 118 1 δ g 0 rtln k 0 2 δ g 0 δ h 0 tδ s 0 3 ln k 0 δ s 0 r δ h 0 rt where k0 is the kinetic equilibrium constant r is the universal gas constant and t is the absolute temperature in general for adsorption of contaminants such as dyes pharmaceuticals and heavy metals graphene composites present negative g0 and positive h0 values which indicate that the adsorption process is spontaneous and endothermic respectively and positive s0 values indicating increased randomness at the solid liquid interface 34 36 100 103 furthermore h0 lower than 50 kj mol 1 normally characterize physisorption while higher values suggest chemisorption 119 2 3 5 influential parameters on the adsorption process the background parameters of the solution that contains the target pollutants and some parameters of the process can affect significantly the adsorption capacity of an adsorbent composite namely ph temperature ionic strength contact time and adsorbent dosage 2 3 5 1 ph the ions speciation complexation surface charge and binding sites of the adsorbent and adsorbate are directly affected by the solution ph making it one of the most important influential parameters on adsorption processes 25 118 in this sense the determination of adsorbent pzc provides relevant information about the ph in the process especially when metal ions are involved 33 120 authors have reported that high ph values may increase the hydrophilicity of organic compounds and increase the deprotonation of oxygen functional groups in go composites causing the formation water clusters in these groups thereby decreasing the adsorption capacity 25 on the other hand under low ph conditions h and h3o present in large amounts in solution may reduce the available adsorption sites in go nanocomposites by competition 39 yet the most favorable condition for adsorption varies significantly depending on the adsorbate mostly due to electrostatic interactions when metals are the target pollutants the solution ph is a key influential parameter in the adsorption capacity of most n functionalized graphene composites for pb ii cations adsorption authors have reported optimal conditions at ph 4 6 highlighting that in stronger acidic conditions the adsorption decreases due to electrostatic repulsion with the protonated functional groups and h h3o competition and that alkaline conditions lead to precipitation of pb oh 2 31 49 65 71 85 similar behavior has been reported for the adsorption of u vi that is favored at ph 5 while at lower ph values the uo2 2 ions compete with h h3o and suffer repulsion from positively charged sorbents and at higher ph the hydrolyzed uranium species uo2 3 oh 7 uo2 oh 3 and the precipitation of uo2 oh 2 reduce its adsorption by n functionalized graphene nanocomposites 54 94 furthermore studies carried out by chen et al indicated that in amino functionalized magnetic graphene composites the influence of the solution ph in the u vi adsorption is lower showing less variation in comparison to other composites within a range of ph 4 5 to 9 50 adsorption studies of other cationic metals by n functionalized graphene composites including sr ii 52 cu ii 32 59 63 64 85 ni ii 59 63 and co ii 59 have also indicated an increase in the adsorption with the increase of ph presenting the best removal rates under strong alkaline conditions due to the electrostatic attraction between negatively charged sorbents and positively charged metal ions on the other hand the adsorption of cr vi is significantly increased in strong acidic media ph 1 5 3 due to the electrostatic attraction between the positively charged nitrogen functional groups and the cr vi anions under these conditions 54 61 69 75 77 86 furthermore studies of dyes adsorption showed that anionic molecules acid blue 92 acid red 14 and direct green 6 are more efficiently adsorbed in acidic conditions 66 and cationic molecules methylene blue are better removed under alkaline ph 31 54 64 in addition other relevant water pollutants including pharmaceuticals and personal care products such as ciprofloxacin acetaminophen carbamazepine bisphenol a caffeine and triclosan have been more efficiently adsorbed by n functionalized graphene composites at neutral and weak acidic conditions 35 95 2 3 5 2 temperature the temperature of the solution can be influential in the adsorption rates according to the nature of the reactions since endothermic reactions are enhanced by increase of temperature and exothermic reactions occur at higher rates at lower temperatures 118 besides that higher temperatures are also associated with increased amounts of available of sorption sites on go nanomaterials the solubility of compounds and molecular interactions as well as higher mass diffusion rates which favors adsorptions processes 103 104 most n functionalized graphene composites reported in literature present endothermic adsorption reactions positive h0 values that become more spontaneous negative g0 values with the increase of temperature which means that the adsorption capacity is enhanced by higher temperatures researchers have reported the positive influence of increased temperature on the adsorption capacity of n functionalized graphene towards ciprofloxacin 95 pb ii 65 rare earth elements 105 cr vi 54 61 methylene blue 54 fuchsin 92 u vi 55 and cu ii 32 on the other hand authors have reported exothermic reactions of go l tryptophan adsorbing cu ii and pb ii 85 and graphene polyamide adsorbing sb iii 58 which lead to a negative influence of increased temperature on the adsorption capacity despite that the effects of temperature are not considered relevant in comparison to other parameters thus the operation of adsorption systems under ambient conditions is normally considered suitable 103 118 2 3 5 3 ionic strength the background electrolyte ions concentration is a relevant influential parameter in adsorption processes especially when the target pollutants are metal ions and it can affect the process efficiency in three ways i background ionic species may compete with the target pollutant for the binding sites in the adsorbent surface ii ionic strength can influence the electrostatic interactions between adsorbate and sorbent and iii it may also impact the activity coefficient of the target pollutants hindering its transfer from the solution to the adsorbent surface 103 104 in general the adsorption process is strongly affected by higher valent electrolytes ions whereas higher valent target pollutants are weakly affected by the background ionic strength 34 103 furthermore ionic salts can also affect positively the adsorption of organic compounds by decreasing their solubility salting out effect but also cause the negative effect of squeeze out on carbonaceous adsorbents such as graphene nanocomposites 25 the salts nacl and nano3 are commonly used to increase the ionic strength of a solution in adsorption investigations and some authors have reported that the adsorption capacity of n functionalized graphene composites decreases with the increase of ionic strength 32 52 61 64 2 3 6 reusability and stability good reusability and stability are essential characteristics of a good adsorbent since it enables its reuse after several adsorption desorption cycles without significant loss of material and structure and especially its adsorption capacity 33 an adsorbent with high stability and good desorption efficiency reduces the operation costs and minimizes secondary waste productions 121 desorption process of n based graphene nanocomposites is normally carried out with acid hno3 hcl acetic acid basic naoh or organic solvent based ethanol eluting agents according to literature these nanocomposites in general present good stability and reusability with elevated remaining adsorption rates after several adsorption desorption cycles see table 3 to the best of our knowledge there are no reports addressing specifically the presence and stability of nitrogen functional groups in graphene composites after adsorption desorption cycles however researches indicate that it is important to investigate the type and dosage of the eluting agent in order to provide a satisfactory desorption without decomposing the adsorbent composite by removing its functional groups which can be verified indirectly due to low reductions in the adsorption capacity after several cycles 49 71 86 furthermore zhao et al reported that go decorated with amine and edta kept a significantly higher adsorption capacity of ni ii in comparison with non functionalized go after 10 desorption cycles using hcl as eluting agent 63 nevertheless further investigations should be carried out to determine a possible reduction of the nitrogen content in these composites after adsorption desorption cycles 3 conclusion and future perspectives graphene and its derivatives are mainly synthesized by the top down method of exfoliation reduction and go is the graphene derivative most widely used for water purification purposes the literature presented in this review shows that the functional groups present in go nanosheets plus the n based groups added via functionalization can provide promising adsorbent properties it has been reported that the functionalization of graphene with groups such as amine amide hydrazine imine imidazole and amidoxime reduce its agglomeration stacking and increase its affinity towards water pollutants thus increasing its adsorption performance graphene n based functionalization occurs through the grafting mechanisms van der waals forces electrostatic interaction hydrogen bonding coordination bonds and π π stacking interactions and the most widely used functionalization technique is direct compounding due to its operational simplicity and low cost the produced graphene nanocomposites have been characterized by researchers through a variety of techniques providing information about the amount and types of functional groups present on its structure morphological features electronic properties elemental composition thickness pore size and distribution lattice structure and interplanar distance furthermore most of the recent applications of n functionalized graphene composites in the removal of pollutants from aqueous matrices via adsorption have shown that the functionalization is beneficial to the adsorption of several pollutants including heavy metals pharmaceuticals personal care products dyes pesticides and pahs the langmuir adsorption isotherm and the pseudo second order kinetics are the models that fit the best to the adsorption behavior of most n functionalized graphene composites authors have also reported that n functionalized graphene tends to have a higher adsorption capacity compared to traditional adsorbents like ac and a good reusability after several adsorption desorption cycles it has also been reported that the solution ph is the most important background parameter to achieve a good adsorption efficiency by these composites which occurs due to the charge of the adsorbents and pollutants that changes and promotes electrostatic attraction or repulsion depending on the ph as for future perspectives based on the published research to date it is possible to remark that n functionalized graphene composites have potential as adsorbents for water purification but further investigation is still needed in order to deepen the knowledge about these materials and enable real scale practical applications as follows i additional characterizations methods should be applied to n decorated graphene adsorbents including the investigations of the stability of n functional groups after desorption processes and assessments of how n doping affects the electronic properties of graphene nanosheets and up to what extent these properties affect the adsorption performance ii there is still a lack of available information about cost effective synthesis methods that able to produce consistent quality and large commercial amounts of graphene composites iii graphene is mostly applied in the form of powder and more investigation is needed regarding its separation from the aqueous matrix which could be overcome with more studies using magnetic or supported composites iv the supportation of graphene composites in materials with larger particle size should be more extensively studied since its extremely small particle size may be the main limitation for its application is fixed bed systems v although there is a relevant number of studies on metals adsorption there is only a few works addressing the adsorption potential of these composites towards emerging concern contaminants such as pharmaceuticals personal care product pesticides industrial additives and others vi applications in real multi components wastewaters are still lacking since to date most researches present investigations using synthetic solutions with only one pollutant vii most studies available to date were performed lab scale batch systems thus pilot plant researches using fixed bed systems should be carried out declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

12939,the use of graphene based materials in water purification via adsorption processes has become attractive among the scientific community in the recent decades its high porosity great surface area and especially the available functional groups on its surface and potential for modification with new functional groups make graphene a promising adsorbent among the possible modifications the grafting on n based functional groups in the surface of graphene has gained prominence in the production of adsorbents for water purification since it results in a material with improved properties and high adsorption capacity towards a series of water contaminants this review presents a comprehensive approach of the main n based functionalization techniques namely solvothermal photoelectric reduction in situ polymerization and direct compounding processes as well as a description of a variety of characterization techniques that are commonly applied for these composites furthermore an overview of the recent applications of n functionalized graphene in water purification is presented accompanied by a discussion of the most important influential parameters the main results in terms of adsorption efficiency and reusability as well as future perspectives for the development of this research field graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords graphene composites graphene oxide synthesis water treatment pollutant removal 1 introduction water pollution is one of the most relevant environmental concerns worldwide due to the constant emerging of new compounds and the discovery of its potential toxic effects on the environment and human health the removal of water pollutants is permanently a very important research topic with studies on degradation and or separation of pollutants coming from various sources including pharmaceuticals personal care products pesticides industrial additives dyes and heavy metals through many different processes 1 2 among the water purification techniques adsorption is one of the most used separation methods due to its operational simplicity and wide range of potential applications adsorption is based on the transfer of the target pollutant adsorbate from the fluid phase to the surface of a solid phase adsorbent by chemical and physical interactions among the adsorbents activated carbon ac has been the most extensively used in several water matrices in face of its low production cost and favorable physico chemical properties especially its porous structure and high surface area 3 furthermore the development of new adsorbents with enhanced adsorption capacity towards specific pollutants has also been a topic of interest of researchers and functionalized graphene composites have emerged as promising alternatives for water purification 4 6 graphene is a carbon allotrope composed by sheets of single layer sp2 hybridized carbon atoms configured in honeycomb like structures fig 1 7 8 the carbon atoms within the graphene layers are covalently bonded to each other and the layers can be linked by van der waals forces 9 the specific physico chemical properties graphene and graphene based materials make it suitable for many purposes including drug delivery different kinds of sensors hydrogen storage energy storage photovoltaic energy generation polymer nanocomposites semiconductor materials catalysis and water purification 10 11 graphene can be synthesized by two main routes based in the i construction bottom up of graphene layers or the ii destruction top down of a structure into graphene layers 12 bottom up methods consist in the growth of graphene films in a substrate from atomic size precursors and include epitaxial growth 13 chemical vapor deposition cvd 14 substrate free gas phase synthesis 15 template route 16 and total organic synthesis 17 top down include oxidative exfoliation reduction 18 19 mechanical exfoliation 20 arc discharge 21 and unzipping of cnt 22 these methods aim to overcome van der waals forces and dissociate carbon based precursors into single or multi layer graphene sheets 9 although several methods of graphene synthesis have been developed most of the graphene synthesis still occurs in small amounts for lab applications mainly through the hummers method 19 however in the recent years some industries have started to produce graphene in large scale like versarien and first graphene that have a production capacity up to 100 ton year 23 24 graphene is commonly classified in the literature as i pristine graphene 0 8 5 oxygen ii graphene oxide go 10 4 54 4 oxygen and reduced graphene oxide rgo 17 5 31 3 oxygen and the amount of oxygen groups present in its structure varies according to the synthesis method 25 due to its high hydrophilicity easy modification simple operation lower production cost compared to pristine graphene and potential for large scale production go is the most commonly employed derivative for water purification processes 6 26 27 go is rich in oxygen functional groups such as hydroxyl epoxide on its surface and carboxylic ketone and aldehyde groups on the edges fig 1 its high specific surface area approximately 2630 m2 g 1 low cytotoxicity large amounts of free π π electrons vacant reactive sites at the edges as well as the potential for chemical modifications by reactive functional groups make go an attractive sorbent material 28 30 however the use of non functionalized graphene in water purification has some limitations since its adsorption capacity is limited to the available amount of oxygen functional groups and its sheets tend to aggregate due to interplanar interactions reducing the effective area of the adsorbent 31 32 therefore the application of functionalized graphene for water purification via adsorption has received increased attention in the recent decades in the removal of pollutants including heavy metals 33 pharmaceuticals 34 personal care products 35 dyes 36 pesticides 37 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs 38 among others among the precursors used to functionalize graphene adsorbent composites several n based can be highlighted due to its effectiveness for this purpose with functional groups including amine amide hydrazine imine imidazole and amidoxime which increase the adsorption capacity of graphene by enhancing its affinity towards the adsorbate and preventing agglomeration 39 a few recent review articles have approached up to some extent the application of n functionalized graphene in water purification 39 42 however this work intends to present a deeper assessment focused only in n functionalized graphene composites starting with a detailed report about its functionalization methods with n based precursors and the available characterization techniques for these composites furthermore this paper presents a review of the most relevant recent studies using n functionalized graphene nanocomposites for water purification and an evaluation its main results are presented as well as a discussion of future research perspectives as a final goal the present review intends to point out the lacks of research regarding the use graphene composite in water purification that still represent a challenge for the scaling up of this technology 2 graphene n based functionalization nitrogen based functional groups such as amine amide hydrazine imine imidazole and amidoxime have been one of the main alternatives for graphene functionalization due to its capacity to provide lone electron pairs to coordinate with the target pollutants of the adsorption process 42 among the nitrogen based functional groups amino is by far the most employed due to its capacity to improve the chemical affinity of the graphene towards pollutants and the relatively high variety of available precursors for functionalization 33 43 2 1 functionalization methods since the discovery of graphene several techniques have been developed to graft functional groups to this material and improve its applicability as a sorbent for water purification the functionalization with n based groups has been carried out mainly through solvothermal photoelectric reduction in situ polymerization and direct compounding methods fig 2 39 moreover other techniques have been applied less often to synthetize graphene composites namely coprecipitation and exfoliation restacking 44 2 1 1 solvothermal also known as hydrothermal synthesis this technique normally involves the preparation of a solution with the nitrogen precursor followed by the addition of go and autoclavation solvothermal synthesis is a one step technique that does not require the addition of catalysts and is considered a promising technique to design the morphology of nh2 functionalized graphene composites 39 ammonia assisted hydrothermal synthesis is one of the simplest techniques for n doping of graphene and has been carried out by dispensing graphene in an ammonia water solution in an autoclave at temperatures of 200 c for 10 h 45 and 220 c for a 3 h 46 the same method has been applied using urea as nitrogen source for 3 h at 160 c 47 and 220 c 46 furthermore researchers have produced magnetic graphene using fe3o4 and functionalized with 1 2 ethylenediamine eda 48 and edta 49 dispersing the precursors in ethylene glycol and applying thermal treatment in a teflon autoclave for 8 h at 200 c and 10 h at 180 c respectively additionally lai et al and chen et al proposed the functionalization of go under similar conditions using ammonia water and fecl3 6h2o diethylenetriamine deta respectively as precursors 50 51 2 1 2 photoelectric reduction this method can be used to rapidly and simultaneously reduce and functionalize graphene through and electric discharge or γ ray irradiation in the presence of the precursors 39 researchers have produced graphene composites via photoelectric reduction using the dielectric barrier discharge dbd plasma technique employing polypyrrole ppy as precursor applying a 30 min electric discharge at a voltage of 100 110 v and a power of 200 w using nitrogen as plasma source 31 dbd has also been applied to graft acrylamide in go under 30 min treatment with argon plasma with voltage 120 v and power of 240 w 52 xu et al pre treated go with high purity nitrogen and then grafted acrylamide under γ ray irradiation with a dose rate of 0 8 kgy h 1 53 2 1 3 in situ polymerization also referred as in situ growth this technique widely used in the functionalization of graphene with nitrogen based groups the polymerization process requires the addition of an activator of the go carboxylic functional groups commonly a solution of 1 ethyl 3 3 dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide edc and n hydroxysuccinnimide nhs 32 54 55 in addition some researchers used socl2 56 57 trimesoyl chloride 58 dichloromethane 59 as activators of the carboxylic groups replacing the oh of these groups by cl thus enabling the decoration with nh2 containing compounds these processes have been carried out in different solvents including dmf 55 56 59 methanol 54 and deionized water 32 60 several n based compounds have been grafted to graphene via in situ polymerization namely p phenylendiamine 55 triaminotriazine 56 eda n n bis 2 pyridylmethyl 59 chitosan 54 2 phenylethylamine 60 poly allylamine hydrochloride 32 1 2 diaminocyclohexanetetraacetic acid dcta 61 and m phenylenediamine 58 2 1 4 direct compounding direct compounding is currently simplest most widely applied method of graphene functionalization since it only requires the addition of a nh2 precursor to a graphene solution under mechanical agitation with mild heating or ambient temperature and no need of activators or special reaction conditions 39 a way frequently used to link n based compounds to graphene is the silanization mechanism through the reaction of silane with the hydroxyl groups present on the go surface 62 researchers have used this approach to functionalize graphene with edta silane 63 3 aminopropyltriethoxysilane aptes 64 69 3 trimethoxysilylpropyl ethylenetriamine tmspeda and 3 trimethoxysilylpropyl diethylenetriamine tmspdeta 63 67 in direct compounding synthesis graphene commonly is dispersed in deionized water or ethanol solution via ultrasonication for times up to 2 h and then with the addition of a n based precursor stirred for times varying from 3 to 48 h at room temperature or heating up to 100 c and then washed with deionized water o ethanol solution 31 63 64 66 75 2 2 characterization a variety of physical chemical characterization techniques can be applied to evaluate these composites including fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy uv vis adsorption spectroscopy raman spectroscopy scanning electron microscopy sem field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem transmission electron microscopy tem zeta potential vibrating sample magnetometry vsm x ray diffraction analysis xrd x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps brunauer emmett teller surface area analysis bet atomic force microscopy afm x ray energy dispersive spectroscopy eds and scanning transmission electron microscopy stem 2 2 1 ftir spectrometry ftir spectrometry is one of the most applied analysis for characterization of graphene nanosheets since it can aid the identification of the functional groups present on its structure the technique consists in emitting radiation in the infrared region and detecting absorption peaks caused by alterations in the vibrational levels of these groups 76 typically go presents ftir adsorption peaks at 1047 1228 cm 1 co 1304 1415 cm 1 c o h 1622 1627 cm 1 c c 1646 1738 cm 1 c o and 3268 3417 cm 1 oh and when functionalized with n based compounds peaks at 1544 1565 cm 1 cn and nh and 1630 1647 cm 1 c n arise 56 59 75 77 79 alammar et al observed adsorption peaks of cc cn and cn at 1630 cm 1 1532 cm 1 and 1438 cm 1 wavelength respectively in a polybenzimidazole polydopamine go composite 80 the substitution of oh groups 3500 2500 cm 1 wavelength by conh and nh groups adsorption at 1638 and 1162 cm 1 as well as cn 2070 cm 1 via zinc hexacyanoferrate and n2 functionalization of rgo was also described 4 furthermore in direct compounding functionalization through silanization peaks at 1039 and 1121 cm 1 have been reported corresponding to si o si and si oc bonds 73 2 2 2 uv vis spectroscopy a simple and fast technique to evaluate the composition of graphene nanocomposites and to investigate the functional groups present in go is uv vis spectroscopy this method is based on the emission of radiation in the uv spectral range through a solution suspension of the material for determination of the transmission rate along the spectra the absorption occurs due to the transition of an electron from the lowest energy state to the excited state 81 it has been reported that go has presents an absorption peak at 230 nm with a shoulder in 300 nm related to π π transition from the aromatic cc bonds and the n π transition in the carbonyl bonds c o respectively while rgo the peak is observed at 270 nm ascribed to the n π transition in co bonds 53 82 83 furthermore seenivasan et al reported that the covalent bonding of l cysteine in go generated an uv vis absorption peak at 270 nm and xu et al observed an adsorption peak at 260 nm in go polyacrylamide subjected to induced reduction via γ ray likely associated with the reduction of the composite 53 83 2 2 3 raman spectroscopy raman spectroscopy is a technique used to identify and characterize the lattice structure as well as the optical electronic and phonon properties of carbon materials based on the inelastic scattering of photons emitted towards the analyzed material 84 in graphene nanosheets assessment the composites raman spectra presents a characteristic peak at a g band 1580 1611 cm 1 which is related to the stretching vibration of the sp2 hybridized carbon atoms of its bidimensional hexagonal lattice when graphene has defects and functional groups on its structure such as oxygen and nitrogen based groups a d band 1316 1368 cm 1 is observed that is related to sp3 hybridized carbon atoms 43 52 70 79 85 the intensity ratio of d and g bands id ig is associated with the number of defects in graphene or go when oxygen nitrogen or other functional groups are added the id ig increases 52 55 79 86 furthermore raman spectroscopy of graphene also presents a 2d band which results of phonon lattice vibrational process from an electron hole pair or a single electron hole and differently from the d band it does not need a defect in the structure to activate it the peak of this band lays between 2650 and 2750 cm 1 depending on the thickness of the graphene layer 87 88 2 2 4 sem fesem scanning electron microscopy sem and field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem are versatile techniques for microstructural analysis that enable to investigate topographical features compositional differences phase distribution morphology crystal structure and orientation as well as the presence and location of electrical defects of materials the technique is based on an electron beam emitted towards the sample which is excited releases secondary electrons that can be detected fesem is an enhanced sem method that provides higher resolution images 1 nm using low beam energies 89 go typically displays a smooth surface area with some wrinkles 59 77 and in magnetic graphene composites that have fe3o4 in its composition sem analysis shows the dispersion of these particles with formation of nanoneedles and a rough surface 61 70 it has also been highlighted that grafting amine based compounds to fe3o4 go or go in general makes their surface thicker rougher and more wrinkled 31 35 59 71 77 furthermore aggregated nanosheets layered structure and wrinkling were observed via sem in go functionalization of with amino silane 43 64 and when n based go composites were synthetized via dbd wrinkled and crumpled structures were obtained 52 90 in aerogels containing aminated go sem analysis displays irregular porous 3d structure in the cross section of the composites 91 changes according to the drying method applied in the synthesis of the aerogel 92 similarly sem image of polyacrylamide go hydrogel showed a sponge like structure with 2 to 10 μm diameter holes 93 whose diameter can vary depending on the polymer used in the hydrogel 74 additionally random stacking of rgo sheets in hydrogel was also reported 94 and pore diameters of 10 μm in amine functionalized graphene monoliths 78 sem can also be applied coupled to eds to analyze the presence and distribution of elements such as c o and n on the go composites surface as well as adsorbed components 58 67 72 73 2 2 5 tem in transmission electron microscopy tem an electron beam emitted towards an ultrathin sample and suffers several types of scattering that depend on the characteristics of the material providing information about its chemical and electronic structure 39 in graphene composites characterization tem is applied to identify defects vacancy dislocations and stone wales rotation as well as to determine the thickness of a sheet monolayer sheets present more transparent lines whilst multi layer sheets display darker lines in tem images 9 it has been reported that the n based functionalization of graphene produces corrugated sheets due to interactions between the functional groups which prevent agglomeration 73 80 overlapping and wrinkled crumpled structure is also verified in tem analysis of functionalized go with different precursors such as amino silane 68 and polyacrylamide 52 in bio graphene synthesized from corn stover via thermo chemical reduction process tem images indicated the formation of single and bilayer graphene sheets with smooth and clean edges 95 tem technique is often used associated with sem analysis to provide information about the morphological characteristics of the material like the distribution of fe3o4 in magnetic graphene 61 70 moreover when magnetic graphene was decorated with 2 phenylethylamine and sio2 through in situ polymerization spherical and agglomerated nanoparticles were displayed by tem analysis which was ascribed to the magneto dipole interactions and to the high surface charge of the fe3o4 nanoparticles 60 2 2 6 zeta potential zeta potential also referred as electrokinetic potential is the electrical potential at the slipping shear plane that separates fluid attached to the surface of a particle from mobile fluid 96 in adsorption processes it is an important parameter to investigate the interactions between the adsorbent and adsorbate since it is related to the electrical properties of interfacial layers in dispersion which are affected by various functional groups 97 the zeta potential of go composites decreases with the increase of ph duo to deprotonation pristine go has negative charges at natural environmental conditions ph 6 31 86 93 the point of zero charge pzc that consists of the ph value under which the charge is zero is obtained from zeta potential measurements negative charges favor the adsorption of positively charged contaminants such as heavy metals and cationic dyes via electrostatic interactions in this case alkaline conditions tend to improve the performance of the adsorption process 31 aminated compounds grafted to go tend to increase its pzc due to the positive charge of amines at neutral ph conditions 35 60 researches have verified pzc values of 9 8 6 5 6 6 6 7 and 3 4 for go polyethyleneimine 77 ac go chitosan 35 go fe3o4 sio2 phenylethylamine 60 go hyperbranched polymer tetraethylenepentamine 75 and go fe3o4 deta 50 respectively 2 2 7 vsm vsm is a technique applied to evaluate magnetic composites through the vibration of the sample this vibration induces perturbations in the external magnetic field of the sample which can be measured in terms of magnetic saturation emu g 1 by magnetic field sensors 98 in adsorption processes by graphene magnetic nanocomposites this property is important to determine the possibility of magnetic separation 99 researchers have found magnetic saturation values of 33 0 29 3 and 16 9 emu g 1 for fe3o4 sio2 go 2 phenylethyl amine 60 go fe3o4 deta 50 and go fe3o4 polydopamine 71 respectively according to these authors these values of magnetic saturation were enough for an easy separation of the magnetic composites from the aqueous media 2 2 8 xrd xrd is a technique widely used in the characterization of crystalline materials is general providing information about the crystallinity atomic arrangement crystallite size and imperfections of the material 100 the xrd equipment emits x rays towards the sample which are transmitted absorbed refracted scattered and diffracted at different angles and proportions by the sample 82 in graphene composites the interplanar distance can be determined by applying the bragg s law based on the diffraction angle 9 non functionalized go presents a strong diffraction peak at 2θ 10 with interlaying spacing between 0 77 and 0 95 nm which is significantly higher than the interlayer spacing for pristine graphite 0 34 nm 60 69 86 90 91 this difference is ascribed to the expansion promoted by the insertion of oxygen containing groups in the graphene sheets structures 61 in rgo the diffraction peak is found in 2θ 25 that represents a decrease in the interlayer distance 0 352 nm indicating the restoration of the sp2 carbon structure due to the removal of the oxygen functional groups 80 when functionalized with n based groups the go characteristic diffraction peak 2θ 10 normally disappears or decreases significantly and broad peaks at 2θ 20 to 25 are frequently displayed 52 64 85 86 these changes are attributed to a reduction in the orderliness of the functionalized composite s structure 65 in addition when fe3o4 is added to go composites several 2θ diffraction peaks are generated within the range of 30 1 and 62 5 which correspond to the facets of the cubic spinel crystal planes of fe3o4 54 61 2 2 9 xps xps is a surface sensitive method extensively employed in the study of nanomaterials based on the emission of x rays towards de sample that remove electrons from its surface 101 the kinetic energy of these electrons can be measured and enabling the determination of its binding energy that provides information about atoms or functional groups present on the surface of a material 102 in go nanocomposites xps is one of the most used techniques for surface evaluation being able to provide information on elemental composition bonding relationships and chemical state of the elements 103 several works reported in literature reported specific binding energies for functional groups present in graphene surface namely c c c c c h c n 285 ev c o c o o c o 287 289 ev co nh2 c nh2 c nh3 o c n 398 402 ev 67 86 93 94 104 furthermore the addition of fe3o4 to graphene generates xps peaks at 711 and 725 ev 50 70 thus the xps analysis can provide information about the successful grafting of functional groups onto graphene in addition the spectrum is also changed by the capture of the target pollutants during the adsorption treatment process especially metals that change the binding energy of electrons present in the functional groups 68 73 94 105 2 2 10 bet bet method is used to determine the specific surface area and pore size distribution barrett joyner halenda analysis bjh of materials based on the bet model for gas adsorption desorption onto a solid surface using and inert gas like nitrogen or argon 106 107 graphene has a high surface area that can vary significantly depending on its synthesis method and functionalization which are directly associated with more or less stacking agglomeration effects 9 researchers have reported bet surface areas of go varying from 21 to 272 m2 g 1 4 32 35 56 60 as for functionalized go n based precursors normally increase its surface area with reported values of 421 m2 g 1 for polyamide go 58 214 m2 g 1 for go ac chitosan 35 172 m2 g 1 for go poly allylamine hydrochloride 32 412 2 m2 g 1 for go fe3o4 chitosan 54 and 45 29 for go triaminotriazine alginate 56 similar behavior occurs with the average pore size and pore volume which vary significantly depending on the composites authors have also observed via bet analysis the average pore sizes of n functionalized graphene between 0 82 and 25 nm 4 50 56 58 60 105 and pore volume varying from 0 22 to 0 89 cm3 g 1 4 50 56 60 2 2 11 afm this advanced microscopy technique is based on a sharp tip probe that approaches the sample until tip sample forces start to act on it van der waals electrostatic magnetic and meniscus forces and then scans the sample topography the probe is held by a cantilever that deflects a laser which enables the equipment to read the scan 108 in graphene and its derivatives afm is used to determine the sample thickness and other morphological features 9 100 the theoretical thickness of graphene single layer is 0 334 nm however functional groups on its surface and stacking agglomeration usually increase this value 11 dong et al synthesized go via hummers method and reported sheet thickness of 1 nm which increased to 2 nm when functionalized with polydopamine and to 7 nm with higher surface roughness by adding the polymer polyethylenimine pei 74 another study reported lateral dimension of go sheets varying from 50 to 400 nm and thickness of 1 1 2 nm with little variation 0 2 nm indicating single layer sheet and 1 0 2 5 nm thickness of go poly n isopropylacrylamide showing significant variation on its topography 93 as for amino functionalized magnetic go authors have reported sheet thickness of 2 nm 50 2 2 12 eds energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds also known as xeds edx or edxs is an elemental analysis technique based on x ray excitation of a sample which emits x rays in unique wavelengths for different elements and intensities proportional to the amount the element in the sample 109 eds is commonly used to confirm a successful synthesis of a graphene composite by determining the percentage fe c n o si and other elements on the sample 64 67 71 the technique also enables to display its distribution of several elements on the surface of the graphene composites when coupled to sem 72 73 80 furthermore eds can also be used to determine the adsorption selectivity of graphene composites towards different contaminants by performing analysis after the adsorption of a mix of compounds in this sense zhao et al tested the affinity of go amine and go edta for cu2 ni2 cd2 and fe2 verifying a higher adsorption of cu2 in go amine 52 and ni2 in go edta 48 63 furthermore some researchers have performed eds analysis in n functionalized graphene after the adsorption process of metals 31 32 68 and nutrients 56 to confirm the presence of the adsorbate on the adsorbent 2 2 13 stem stem is a scanning method that can be applied to assess the structure of graphene nanosheets often used to detect and locate heavy elements on their structure 110 the technique consists of the emission of an electron beam towards the sample which is mostly detected by a bright field bf detector plus a part of these electrons that are scattered at small angles and detected by an annular dark field adf detector and a few of these electrons are scattered at high angles and captured by a high angle annular dark field haadf detector additionally the equipment can simultaneously analyze the main beam that crosses the sample using an electron energy loss spectroscopy eels detector 111 authors have applied haadf stem to visualize the presence and distribution of fe 110 co 112 zn co 113 and mn 111 in graphene matrixes which are displayed as bright dots in a dark scan image furthermore baladés et al reported that graphene nanosheets could be identified and located inside organic composites such as tridimensional polymer matrices using haadf stem technique which may be suitable to study graphene adsorbent composites such as aerogels and hydrogels 114 2 3 applications in water purification in the past few years several graphene based composites functionalized with nitrogen have been synthetized and studied as adsorbents for water contaminants removal and in general the functionalization increases significantly the adsorption capacity of graphene tables 1 and 2 most of the recent adsorption studies of n based graphene composites towards water contaminants have been carried out in lab scale batch systems for one or more specific compounds in synthetic matrices which allow preliminary studies on its adsorption capacity and kinetics as well as some influential parameters 65 68 95 105 some authors have produced magnetic go composites by grafting fe3o4 that can be dispersed in the contaminated matrix for adsorption and easily removed afterwards using an external magnet 49 50 54 60 71 73 it has also been reported the possibility of producing graphene composites immobilized in hydrogels using polymers such as poly n isopropylacrylamide 93 polyacrylonitrile 94 polyethyleneimine 77 and aerogels using polyacrylic acid under uv light 91 anionic polyacrylamide 92 ppy 86 and eda 79 in general there is still a relevant lack of research applying these composites in systems that are possible to scale up like fixed bed columns only a few authors have carried out studies with n functionalized graphene with potential for applications in real scale alammar et al fabricated membranes from go rgo and polybenzimidazole which were dip coated with polydopamine for separation of oil from water 80 delhiraja et al supported go in ac before functionalization with chitosan which increases the potential of scale up since ac can be used in membranes in varied particle sizes and at low cost 35 additionally studies carried out by mondal and majumder investigated the adsorption properties and hydrodynamic parameters of a packed bed reactor made of glass beads coated with amine functionalized rgo 115 and contreras ortiz et al assessed a column packed of amino go for separation of crude oil from water 116 2 3 1 inorganic compounds adsorption most studies of water purification using n functionalized graphene composites published to date evaluated metals as target pollutants the adsorption capacity for inorganic compounds can vary within a broad range depending on the adsorbent properties and the background conditions 61 69 for cr iv authors have reported adsorption capacities ranging 80 to 1185 mg g 1 61 68 73 75 77 86 it has been reported that graphene composites functionalized with secondary amines have shown higher adsorption capacity towards cr iv due to possible synergistic between neighboring amines 68 73 furthermore the adsorption capacities vary from 87 to 588 mg g 1 for cu ii 32 43 49 64 74 85 from 35 2 to 819 7 mg g 1 for pb ii 31 49 65 71 74 from 141 2 to 215 2 mg g 1 for u vi 50 55 from 113 to 301 2 mg g 1 for hg ii 49 74 from 56 6 to 106 mg g 1 for cd ii 74 78 103 mg g 1 for ni ii 63 27 64 mg g 1 for sr ii 52 265 5 for cs i 4 and 268 4 mg g 1 for hg ii 49 additionally kumar et al investigated the removal of the nutrients nitrate and phosphate using go triaminotriazine alginate and achieved adsorption capacities of 51 83 and 58 46 mg g 1 respectively 56 from the available literature it can be suggested that graphene composites have a great potential for metals adsorption prevailing among other classes of water pollutants even though in the majority of the studies the n functionalization of graphene significantly improves its adsorption capacity towards metals table 1 this value varies significantly among studies with the same target pollutant which may be related to the quality of the used graphene type of nitrogen precursor used as well as the experimental conditions applied 2 3 2 organic compounds adsorption among organic compounds dyes have a predominance in the adsorption studies using n functionalized graphene sorbents table 2 authors reported adsorption capacities varying from 243 31 to 819 7 mg g 1 for methylene blue 31 54 64 84 mg g 1 for congo red 70 113 5 mg g 1 for malachite green 91 and 982 mg g 1 for a mix of rhodamine b methylene blue and malachite green 93 the study of dyes adsorption by graphene composites has been developed up to some extent by the scientific community and presented an interesting potential however this field still needs more work for scaling up since dyes are major industrial pollutants present in high amounts of effluents produced by pulp paper dye production textile and other industries 36 some authors have also investigated the removal of pharmaceuticals with n functionalized graphene kyzas et al obtained a maximum adsorption capacity of 447 mg g 1 for dorzolamide using go poly acrylic acid decorated with chitosan as adsorbent 117 furthermore researchers verified maximum adsorption capacities of 172 mg g 1 for the antibiotic ciprofloxacin using bio graphene amine 95 as well as 13 7 and 11 2 mg g 1 for the pharmaceuticals acetaminophen and carbamazepine respectively using go ac chitosan 35 regarding the removal of other classes of organic water contaminants by these graphene composites there are only a few reports in the literature including pesticides 60 oil 80 116 personal care products 35 and industrial additives 35 79 2 3 3 adsorption mechanism several mechanisms are reported in the literature as responsible for the adsorption of both organic and inorganic compounds by n functionalized graphene composites fig 3 the adsorption mechanisms of n functionalized graphene composites towards metals are related to electrostatic interactions surface complexation coordination chelation and hydrogen bonding 61 69 as for organic compounds the adsorption typically occurs through hydrogen bonds as well as electrostatic hydrophobic and π π stacking interactions 31 54 91 both physisorption and chemisorption have been suggested in the literature as the main adsorption mechanism of these composites some authors have used the dubinin radushkevich d r isotherms to calculate the adsorption energy e that indicates physisorption when its values are below 8 kj mol 1 and chemisorption for higher values 56 58 60 79 92 additionally an indirect conclusion regarding the adsorption mechanisms could be made when the sorbent material has a good after several adsorption desorption cycles which suggests that the adsorption occurs mainly through weak interactions characterizing physisorption see table 3 regarding the adsorption kinetics graphene composites in general exhibit a pseudo second order rate with higher rates at the beginning of the process and as de the vacant adsorption sites become scarcer the rates decrease exponentially 65 90 94 the controlling mechanisms depend on the contaminant properties and on the characteristics of the adsorbent composites such as surface properties structure and available functional groups 39 2 3 4 adsorption thermodynamics in adsorption studies the thermodynamic parameters gibbs free energy g0 enthalpy h0 and entropy change s0 are often considered in the assessment of the process and calculated by eqs 1 2 and 3 118 1 δ g 0 rtln k 0 2 δ g 0 δ h 0 tδ s 0 3 ln k 0 δ s 0 r δ h 0 rt where k0 is the kinetic equilibrium constant r is the universal gas constant and t is the absolute temperature in general for adsorption of contaminants such as dyes pharmaceuticals and heavy metals graphene composites present negative g0 and positive h0 values which indicate that the adsorption process is spontaneous and endothermic respectively and positive s0 values indicating increased randomness at the solid liquid interface 34 36 100 103 furthermore h0 lower than 50 kj mol 1 normally characterize physisorption while higher values suggest chemisorption 119 2 3 5 influential parameters on the adsorption process the background parameters of the solution that contains the target pollutants and some parameters of the process can affect significantly the adsorption capacity of an adsorbent composite namely ph temperature ionic strength contact time and adsorbent dosage 2 3 5 1 ph the ions speciation complexation surface charge and binding sites of the adsorbent and adsorbate are directly affected by the solution ph making it one of the most important influential parameters on adsorption processes 25 118 in this sense the determination of adsorbent pzc provides relevant information about the ph in the process especially when metal ions are involved 33 120 authors have reported that high ph values may increase the hydrophilicity of organic compounds and increase the deprotonation of oxygen functional groups in go composites causing the formation water clusters in these groups thereby decreasing the adsorption capacity 25 on the other hand under low ph conditions h and h3o present in large amounts in solution may reduce the available adsorption sites in go nanocomposites by competition 39 yet the most favorable condition for adsorption varies significantly depending on the adsorbate mostly due to electrostatic interactions when metals are the target pollutants the solution ph is a key influential parameter in the adsorption capacity of most n functionalized graphene composites for pb ii cations adsorption authors have reported optimal conditions at ph 4 6 highlighting that in stronger acidic conditions the adsorption decreases due to electrostatic repulsion with the protonated functional groups and h h3o competition and that alkaline conditions lead to precipitation of pb oh 2 31 49 65 71 85 similar behavior has been reported for the adsorption of u vi that is favored at ph 5 while at lower ph values the uo2 2 ions compete with h h3o and suffer repulsion from positively charged sorbents and at higher ph the hydrolyzed uranium species uo2 3 oh 7 uo2 oh 3 and the precipitation of uo2 oh 2 reduce its adsorption by n functionalized graphene nanocomposites 54 94 furthermore studies carried out by chen et al indicated that in amino functionalized magnetic graphene composites the influence of the solution ph in the u vi adsorption is lower showing less variation in comparison to other composites within a range of ph 4 5 to 9 50 adsorption studies of other cationic metals by n functionalized graphene composites including sr ii 52 cu ii 32 59 63 64 85 ni ii 59 63 and co ii 59 have also indicated an increase in the adsorption with the increase of ph presenting the best removal rates under strong alkaline conditions due to the electrostatic attraction between negatively charged sorbents and positively charged metal ions on the other hand the adsorption of cr vi is significantly increased in strong acidic media ph 1 5 3 due to the electrostatic attraction between the positively charged nitrogen functional groups and the cr vi anions under these conditions 54 61 69 75 77 86 furthermore studies of dyes adsorption showed that anionic molecules acid blue 92 acid red 14 and direct green 6 are more efficiently adsorbed in acidic conditions 66 and cationic molecules methylene blue are better removed under alkaline ph 31 54 64 in addition other relevant water pollutants including pharmaceuticals and personal care products such as ciprofloxacin acetaminophen carbamazepine bisphenol a caffeine and triclosan have been more efficiently adsorbed by n functionalized graphene composites at neutral and weak acidic conditions 35 95 2 3 5 2 temperature the temperature of the solution can be influential in the adsorption rates according to the nature of the reactions since endothermic reactions are enhanced by increase of temperature and exothermic reactions occur at higher rates at lower temperatures 118 besides that higher temperatures are also associated with increased amounts of available of sorption sites on go nanomaterials the solubility of compounds and molecular interactions as well as higher mass diffusion rates which favors adsorptions processes 103 104 most n functionalized graphene composites reported in literature present endothermic adsorption reactions positive h0 values that become more spontaneous negative g0 values with the increase of temperature which means that the adsorption capacity is enhanced by higher temperatures researchers have reported the positive influence of increased temperature on the adsorption capacity of n functionalized graphene towards ciprofloxacin 95 pb ii 65 rare earth elements 105 cr vi 54 61 methylene blue 54 fuchsin 92 u vi 55 and cu ii 32 on the other hand authors have reported exothermic reactions of go l tryptophan adsorbing cu ii and pb ii 85 and graphene polyamide adsorbing sb iii 58 which lead to a negative influence of increased temperature on the adsorption capacity despite that the effects of temperature are not considered relevant in comparison to other parameters thus the operation of adsorption systems under ambient conditions is normally considered suitable 103 118 2 3 5 3 ionic strength the background electrolyte ions concentration is a relevant influential parameter in adsorption processes especially when the target pollutants are metal ions and it can affect the process efficiency in three ways i background ionic species may compete with the target pollutant for the binding sites in the adsorbent surface ii ionic strength can influence the electrostatic interactions between adsorbate and sorbent and iii it may also impact the activity coefficient of the target pollutants hindering its transfer from the solution to the adsorbent surface 103 104 in general the adsorption process is strongly affected by higher valent electrolytes ions whereas higher valent target pollutants are weakly affected by the background ionic strength 34 103 furthermore ionic salts can also affect positively the adsorption of organic compounds by decreasing their solubility salting out effect but also cause the negative effect of squeeze out on carbonaceous adsorbents such as graphene nanocomposites 25 the salts nacl and nano3 are commonly used to increase the ionic strength of a solution in adsorption investigations and some authors have reported that the adsorption capacity of n functionalized graphene composites decreases with the increase of ionic strength 32 52 61 64 2 3 6 reusability and stability good reusability and stability are essential characteristics of a good adsorbent since it enables its reuse after several adsorption desorption cycles without significant loss of material and structure and especially its adsorption capacity 33 an adsorbent with high stability and good desorption efficiency reduces the operation costs and minimizes secondary waste productions 121 desorption process of n based graphene nanocomposites is normally carried out with acid hno3 hcl acetic acid basic naoh or organic solvent based ethanol eluting agents according to literature these nanocomposites in general present good stability and reusability with elevated remaining adsorption rates after several adsorption desorption cycles see table 3 to the best of our knowledge there are no reports addressing specifically the presence and stability of nitrogen functional groups in graphene composites after adsorption desorption cycles however researches indicate that it is important to investigate the type and dosage of the eluting agent in order to provide a satisfactory desorption without decomposing the adsorbent composite by removing its functional groups which can be verified indirectly due to low reductions in the adsorption capacity after several cycles 49 71 86 furthermore zhao et al reported that go decorated with amine and edta kept a significantly higher adsorption capacity of ni ii in comparison with non functionalized go after 10 desorption cycles using hcl as eluting agent 63 nevertheless further investigations should be carried out to determine a possible reduction of the nitrogen content in these composites after adsorption desorption cycles 3 conclusion and future perspectives graphene and its derivatives are mainly synthesized by the top down method of exfoliation reduction and go is the graphene derivative most widely used for water purification purposes the literature presented in this review shows that the functional groups present in go nanosheets plus the n based groups added via functionalization can provide promising adsorbent properties it has been reported that the functionalization of graphene with groups such as amine amide hydrazine imine imidazole and amidoxime reduce its agglomeration stacking and increase its affinity towards water pollutants thus increasing its adsorption performance graphene n based functionalization occurs through the grafting mechanisms van der waals forces electrostatic interaction hydrogen bonding coordination bonds and π π stacking interactions and the most widely used functionalization technique is direct compounding due to its operational simplicity and low cost the produced graphene nanocomposites have been characterized by researchers through a variety of techniques providing information about the amount and types of functional groups present on its structure morphological features electronic properties elemental composition thickness pore size and distribution lattice structure and interplanar distance furthermore most of the recent applications of n functionalized graphene composites in the removal of pollutants from aqueous matrices via adsorption have shown that the functionalization is beneficial to the adsorption of several pollutants including heavy metals pharmaceuticals personal care products dyes pesticides and pahs the langmuir adsorption isotherm and the pseudo second order kinetics are the models that fit the best to the adsorption behavior of most n functionalized graphene composites authors have also reported that n functionalized graphene tends to have a higher adsorption capacity compared to traditional adsorbents like ac and a good reusability after several adsorption desorption cycles it has also been reported that the solution ph is the most important background parameter to achieve a good adsorption efficiency by these composites which occurs due to the charge of the adsorbents and pollutants that changes and promotes electrostatic attraction or repulsion depending on the ph as for future perspectives based on the published research to date it is possible to remark that n functionalized graphene composites have potential as adsorbents for water purification but further investigation is still needed in order to deepen the knowledge about these materials and enable real scale practical applications as follows i additional characterizations methods should be applied to n decorated graphene adsorbents including the investigations of the stability of n functional groups after desorption processes and assessments of how n doping affects the electronic properties of graphene nanosheets and up to what extent these properties affect the adsorption performance ii there is still a lack of available information about cost effective synthesis methods that able to produce consistent quality and large commercial amounts of graphene composites iii graphene is mostly applied in the form of powder and more investigation is needed regarding its separation from the aqueous matrix which could be overcome with more studies using magnetic or supported composites iv the supportation of graphene composites in materials with larger particle size should be more extensively studied since its extremely small particle size may be the main limitation for its application is fixed bed systems v although there is a relevant number of studies on metals adsorption there is only a few works addressing the adsorption potential of these composites towards emerging concern contaminants such as pharmaceuticals personal care product pesticides industrial additives and others vi applications in real multi components wastewaters are still lacking since to date most researches present investigations using synthetic solutions with only one pollutant vii most studies available to date were performed lab scale batch systems thus pilot plant researches using fixed bed systems should be carried out declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or
