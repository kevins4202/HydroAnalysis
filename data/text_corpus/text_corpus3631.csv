18155,while anammox is a cost effective nitrogen treatment process for wastewater with high nutrient strength phosphorus remains untouched during this process and needs further treatment in this study the nitrogen removal and phosphorus recovery were achieved simultaneously at 25 c using an anammox expanded bed a stable high nitrogen removal efficiency of 83 7 4 8 at a 1500 mgn l influent total nitrogen concentration and a phosphorus removal efficiency of 94 2 1 2 at 100 mg p l influent total phosphorus were obtained during continuous operation the effects of the nitrogen loading rate hydraulic retention time hrt ph ca2 and po4 3 concentration on the phosphorus removal was verified in the long term operation of the reactor the sludge produced contained a high content of phosphorus

treatment process with a low operation cost since it does not require organic carbon and requires 60 less aeration than conventional nitrification denitrification processes it is therefore the preferred choice for energy intensive nitrogen treatment processes such as the treatment of anaerobic digestate it is reported that 75 of the full scale partial nitritation anammox process is used for a side stream wastewater treatment with high nitrogen strength lackner et al 2014 besides wastewater treatment an integrated system with combined anaerobic digestion ad and anammox process as the post treatment of digestate has been used for other biomass wastes treatment this provides new opportunities for the reuse of biomass wastes towards the development of a sustainable society ma et al 2018a along with nitrogen a considerable amount of phosphorus is released to the liquid phase during the ad process and proper treatment is needed before discharge that is before it is accumulated in the excess sludge phosphorus is recirculated to the main stream and is treated by a physical chemical process such as coagulating sedimentation dosage of al3 fe3 crystallization method or a biological phosphorus removal process although this process effectively reduces the concentration of phosphorus in the effluent the amount of excess sludge to be treated increased and become another economic burden of the operation in recent years the price of phosphorus fertilizer has soared due to a number of different factors including the mining cost and the reduction in the number of major exporter nations as a result phosphorus recovery has become a worldwide issue it has been reported that the potential for phosphorus recovery from the domestic waste stream alone is such that 15 20 of the global demand for phosphorus could be satisfied yuan et al 2012 in other words the effective recovery of phosphorus from the waste stream is considered one of the solutions to the phosphorus problem typically 90 of the influent phosphorus is incorporated in the sludge in a municipal wastewater treatment plant cornel and schaum 2009 because phosphorus is highly concentrated in wastewater sludge and the volume to be treated is limited recovery from the sludge digestion process has become an important approach different processes have been developed to recover phosphorus from the anaerobic digestion process of biomass waste it is possible to recover fertilizer product such as struvite nh4mgpo4 6h2o and hydroxyapatite ca5 po4 3 oh from the wastewater the dewatered filtrate or dewatered cake incineration ash after solubilization ma et al 2018a recovering the phosphorus before the dewatered filtrate returns to the mainstream wastewater treatment process significantly reduces the phosphorus load thus reducing the requirement for the flocculating agent used to remove phosphorus in the mainstream plant recently a new concept combining anammox and phosphorus recovery for the treatment of wastewater was proposed johansson et al 2017 lin et al 2013 ma et al 2018b these reports revealed the mechanism of the simultaneous formation of anammox biofilm and hydroxyapatite hap precipitation in different anammox processes high concentrations of ca2 and po4 3 in the digestate liquid have been shown to promote the spontaneous crystallization of hap with anammox bacteria providing the nucleation sites for further mineral growth the excess sludge with its high content of phosphorus can be harvested from the reactor and then subsequently used as a phosphate fertilizer it has been demonstrated that the formation of granular sludge with high content of inorganic core results in a remarkable enhancement of the settling velocity of granules which in turn improves the retention of slowly growing anammox biomass zhang et al 2018b struvite formation is usually observed in the anaerobic digestion system however in a well operated anammox process the very low levels of nh4 concentration limit the formation of struvite there are several challenges which must be overcome before this new process can be applied in the waste water industry firstly the parameters affecting the phosphorus removal efficiency in the co reaction system of anammox and hap crystallization need to be determined secondly in order to balance the yield of anammox biomass 0 11 gvss gnh4 n and the much higher yield of hap 5 4 ghap gp a strategy to obtain a balance between these two reactions is essential thirdly it is necessary to determine the minimum temperature required for the operation of the process to obtain an appropriate reaction speed the optimal temperature of anammox process is around 35 40 c ma et al 2019 while in this study an operational temperature of 25 c was set a lower operational temperature equates to a lower heating cost for the operation but anammox activity at 25 c decreases to approximately 60 that of 35 c because the saturation index of the crystallization reaction decreases at lower temperature hap formation is more difficult also the stability of the co reaction of anammox together with hap crystallization at lower operation temperatures has not been shown the present study is focused on these aspects and aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the simultaneous nitrogen removal and phosphorus recovery process using an anammox expanded bed reactor 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment set up the configuration of the expanded bed reactor set up is shown in fig 1 the reactor was inoculated with granular anammox sludge operated at 35 c used in a previous study zhang et al 2018a and fed with synthetic wastewater the synthetic wastewater consisted of nh4 n and no2 n molar ratio of 1 1 2 in the form of nh4 2so4 and nano2 and the phosphorus was provided in the form of kh2po4 other compositions consisted of 0 3 g l cacl2 2h2o 0 57 g l kcl 0 2 g l mgso4 7h2o 0 5 g l nahco3 and trace elements were added as recommended in an earlier study ma et al 2017 the effective volume of the reactor was 5 l the operating temperature was controlled at 25 1 c by water recirculation in the water jacket of the reactor the effluent from the top of the reactor was recirculated to the influent at a recirculation ratio of 3 1 to prevent substrate concentration inhibition as well as to maintain the expanded condition of sludge bed for better contact between substrate and biomass ma et al 2017 the nitrogen gas production rate was monitored by a wet gas meter the ph was adjusted by adding naoh or h2so4 solution from the recirculation tube to maintain the ph of the effluent in the range of 8 0 9 0 the higher ph range than the optimal ph of anammox reaction was designed to promote phosphate crystallization during phase 1 to phase5 of continuous experiment a relatively low level of influent phosphorus concentration of 22 8 mg p l was set in phase 6 and 7 the influent total phosphorus was increased 50 mg p l and 100 mg p l separately and cacl2 2h2o was supplied from the recirculation tube to provide sufficient ca2 for hap crystallization the phosphorus concentration in the influent simulated the po4 3 p concentration in the real digestate which is around tens of mgp l to less than 300 mg p l ma et al 2018a the balanced ca2 concentration during phase 1 to phase 5 was around 50 mg l and the ca2 addition concentration was determined by the following equation to obtain a balanced ca2 concentration of 100 mg l in the effluent assuming that the total influent phosphate would react to form hap ca p weight ratio 2 15 1 addition c ca2 2 15 influent c po4 3 p 100 mg l influent c ca2 2 2 reactor operation the reactor was operated continuously for 220 days to verify the effects of different operation parameters on phosphorus removal from phase 1 to phase 3 the effects of nitrogen loading were investigated by increasing the nlr nitrogen loading rate from 5 g n l d to 11 g n l d while the plr phosphorus loading rate kept at 0 18 g p l d from phase 3 to phase 5 the effects of hydraulic retention time hrt were investigated by reducing the hrt from 3 h to 1 8 h while the influent tp total phosphorus concentrate kept at 22 8 mg p l in phase 6 and phase 7 the effects of phosphorus concentration and calcium concentration on phosphorus removal were investigated by increasing the influent tp concentration to 50 mg p l and 100 mg p l meanwhile additional calcium was supplied from recirculation according to eq 1 the operating condition of different phases is shown in table 1 2 3 analysis of liquid samples the influent and effluent were sampled every two days filtered by 0 45 μm pore diameter membrane filter and stored in a refrigerator at 4 c nh4 n no2 n no3 n were analyzed by the agilent 7100 capillary electrophoresis ce system agilent technologies wilmington usa total phosphorus and other inorganic elements mg k fe na ca were analyzed by the agilent 720 inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes system agilent technologies wilmington usa according to the sample pretreatment procedure described in the apha standard methods apha awwa wef 2012 the influent and effluent ph was monitored by a ph meter toa hm 30v 2 4 analyses of sludge characteristics sludge samples were taken from the top middle and bottom sampling port of the reactor for analysis of the vss volatile suspended solid and tss total suspended solid concentration according to the apha methods apha awwa wef 2012 the difference between tss and vss was defined as ash content for inorganic element analysis in different phases the granular sludge sampled from the middle of the reactor were dried at 105 c overnight and then digested by nitric acid using a microwave digestion system start d milestone italy the digested liquid was analyzed by the above mentioned icp oes system to reveal the structure of the formed composite granular sludge granular samples taken from the middle height of the reactor were analyzed to determine the microbial community distribution and distribution of mineral precipitation for microbial community determination the standard fixation and hybridization procedure of fluorescence in situ hybridization fish was conducted as previously described llobet brossa et al 1998 manz et al 1992 the sampled granules were firstly embedded in an o c t compound sakura finetek torrance ca overnight and then cut with a cryostat microtome osk 97lf509 ogawa seiki co ltd japan into 30 μm thick slices the slices were then hybridized with 16s rrna targeted oligonucleotide probe amx820 specific for candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis and candidatus brocadia anammoxidans and eub338 i ii iii iv mix for detecting all bacteria formamide concentration used for hybridization was 40 for all probes the slices were then observed by a carl zeiss lsm 710 zen confocal laser scanning microscope clsm to determine the phosphate content microtome slices were observed by raman spectroscopic mapping jasco nrs 5100 using a 532 nm laser beam and the phosphate distribution was presented by an intensity of 960 cm 1 wavenumbers specific for ν1 vibration domain of the phosphate group to determine the mineral species formed in the reactor granules from different heights of the reactor were dried at 105 c overnight grinded and analyzed by xrd x ray diffraction olympus btx bench x ray diffraction system 2 5 saturation index calculations saturation index si calculation was applied to study the speciation and the driving force of formation of different minerals the si is defined as equation 2 2 si log i a p k s p where iap is the ion activity product and ksp is the solubility product of the precipitate phase when si 0 the solution is supersaturated and precipitation is spontaneous the visual miteq 3 1 was used for si calculation in this study supplementary information 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of nitrogen and phosphorus removal in anammox expanded bed reactor 3 1 1 anammox performance in the reactor according to a previous study the specific anammox activity at 25 c is around half of that at 35 c ma et al 2019 the inoculation sludge of this study operated at a nitrogen loading rate nlr of 10 g n l d at 35 c so the initial nlr at 25 c in phase 1 was set at 5 g n l d with a total nitrogen tn concentration of 625 mgn l a stable nitrogen removal performance was maintained and an average tn removal efficiency of 88 2 1 3 was obtained during an operational period of 31 days in phase 1 fig 2 the effluent no2 n and nh4 n concentrations were very low and the average concentrations were less than 5 mgn l and no3 n was produced at a ratio of 0 24 0 03 of the consumed nh4 n during the phase 1 the nlr was further increased in the following phases from 5 g n l d to 20 g n l d according to the operation conditions shown in table 1 tn concentration was simultaneously increased from 625 mgn l to 1500 mgn l along with the nlr increase which caused a slightly decrease in the tn removal efficiency from around 90 to an average value of 83 7 85 6 when nlr was set at 20 g n l d table 2 this phenomenon was also described in previous study conducted in anammox egsb expanded granular sludge bed reactors mainly because of the relatively higher substrate affinity constant of granular sludge chen et al 2011 the bigger aggregate size limits the mass transfer and a higher substrate concentrate is needed to achieve a high anammox reaction rate lotti et al 2014 consequently a very high nitrogen removal rate of 16 67 17 12 g n l d was observed at 25 c during the continuous reactor operation the half saturation constant calculated for ammonium and nitrite were 34 10 mgn l and 5 59 mgn l respectively which were a little higher compared with the value obtained at 35 c chen et al 2011 3 1 2 the effects of nitrogen loading on phosphorus removal in anammox expanded reactor phase 1 phase 3 in biological systems mineral crystallization occurs in a localized zone where supersaturation is maintained weiner 2003 anammox cells agglomerate into clusters could form a diffusion limited intercellular zone chen et al 2019 according to the anammox reaction formula eq 3 lotti et al 2014 the ph of the intercellular zone increases as the reaction proceeds which favors the crystallization of minerals such as hap 3 n h 4 1 146 n o 2 0 071 h c o 3 0 057 h 0 986 n 2 0 161 n o 3 0 071 c h 1 74 o 0 31 n 0 20 2 002 h 2 o it has also been reported that a microbial aggregate could promote crystal formation even at a lower si value by heterogeneous nucleation on them mañas et al 2012 microbial aggregates function like the seed crystals used in conventional phosphorus crystallization reactors in several previous studies anammox reaction was considered as the trigger of the hap formation in the anammox granules johansson et al 2017 z z zhang et al 2016 the effects of anammox reaction rate on phosphorus removal were investigated by changing the nitrogen loading rate while keeping the phosphorus loading rate at a constant value from phase 1 to phase 3 at an hrt of 3 h the influent tp concentration was set at 22 8 mg p l and the tn concentration was increased from 625 mgn l to 1375 mgn l resulting in an increase in the nlr from 5 g n l d to 11 g n l d accordingly the average ph of the system increased from 8 04 0 22 in phase 1 to 8 79 0 22 in phase 3 due to the anammox reaction fig 3 it was observed that the effect of nlr on the average tp removal efficiency was not significant with only a slight variation from 61 8 to 65 4 during phase 1 to phase 3 even the ph was also increased by post hoc test analysis in a one way anova at the 0 05 significant level no difference in the tp removal efficiency was found for phase 1 phase 2 and phase 3 in the continuous experiments the phosphorus removal rates remained stable during phase 1 phase 2 and phase 3 at 0 12 0 01 g p l d 0 12 0 02 g p l d 0 11 0 01 g p l d respectively on the other hand from the aspect of sludge composition the phosphorus content of the sludge decreased from 15 1 in phase 1 14 3 in phase 3 due to the increased growth rate of anammox biomass with nlr increase consequently while the microenvironment created by anammox cells and the surrounding eps triggered the initial formation of phosphate crystallization z z zhang et al 2016 further crystallization growth should be regarded more as an independent process which is not obviously affected by the anammox process the existence of anammox aggregates mainly increased the kinetic rate by heterogeneous precipitation on them to form nucleation sites mañas et al 2012 3 1 3 the effect of ph and hrt on phosphorus removal phase 3 phase 5 hap crystallization proceeds according to the following reaction 5ca2 3po4 3 oh ca5 po4 3oh this process is mainly affected by the supersaturation index si of hap reaction time reactor type and seeding conditions chen et al 2009 peng et al 2018 ph is one of the most important parameters affecting both the phosphorus crystallization reaction and anammox bacteria because a higher ph induces a higher supersaturation index a slightly alkaline environment is needed to increase the phosphorus removal efficiency peng et al 2018 it has been reported however that the optimal ph range of the anammox process is limited to about 7 0 8 5 jetten et al 2001 ph in the reactor increased according to the nlr increase from phase 1 to phase 3 and even exceeded 9 0 sometimes in phase 3 in the phase 4 and phase 5 the nlr was further increased to 16 g n l d and 20 g n l d with a simultaneous decrease in the hrt from 3 h to 1 8 h in order to avoid seriously inhibition for anammox reaction h2so4 solution was dosed from the recirculation tube continuously in phase 3 5 to control the ph of the reactor between 8 0 and 9 0 in the following phases while the nitrogen removal efficiency remained high at over 85 the phosphorus removal efficiency remarkably decreased from 61 8 5 7 in phase 3 to 46 6 4 5 in phase 4 and 30 7 8 7 in phase 5 ph decrease due to the acid dosage was one of the reasons for phosphorus crystallization efficiency decrease average ph decreased from 8 79 0 22 in phase 3 to 8 48 0 24 in phase 4 and 8 38 0 25 in phase 5 which decreased supersaturation index of hap another possible reason for this decrease was the shortened hrt fig 4 hrt in the crystallization reactor affects the reaction time changes the hydraulic properties and has been reported to have a direct effect on crystallization efficiency as well as the size of crystals pastor et al 2008 to achieve sufficient phosphorus recovery the hrt needed in high mixing intensity reactors such as air agitated reactors is always as short as half an hour dai et al 2016 in less mixed conditions such as fluidized bed reactors however typically several hours is required to obtain a satisfactory level of recovery efficiency peng et al 2018 the result in the continuous experiment supports the conclusion that phosphorus removal efficiency in the anammox expanded bed reactor mainly depends on parameters which directly affect the phosphorus crystallization reaction such as reaction time and the supersaturation index it was also observed that ph in the reactor affected the proportion of different crystallization reactions the consumed ca p ratio from phase 1 to phase 5 during the continuous experiment is summarized in fig 5 at certain influent ca2 and po4 3 concentrations the consumed ca p ratio in the continuous operation showed a positive correlation with the system ph the potential mineral formation in this system was calculated by visual minteq in terms of the supersaturation index the simulation results showed a higher formation potential for carbonate minerals such as caco3 and camg co3 2 when ph increased fig s1 in this study when the system ph exceeded 8 5 the consumed ca p ratio increased to over the theoretical ca p weight ratio of 2 15 of hap indicating the formation of undesirable minerals such as carbonate minerals the formation of such minerals inhibits hap formation by blocking the sites for phosphate nucleation and also reduces the phosphorus content of the final products cao and harris 2008 it is therefore important to avoid excessively high ph in the application of this system the operating ph of this system between 8 0 and 8 5 not only satisfied the anammox process but also reduced the potential formation of undesirable phosphorus minerals 3 1 4 the effect of ca2 and po4 3 concentration on phosphorus removal phase 6 phase 7 the results obtained from phase 1 to phase 5 of the continuous experiment indicate that although anammox biomass induced phosphorus nucleation the efficiency of phosphorus removal integrated in the anammox reactor was still mainly determined by factors which directly affect phosphorus crystallization such as the hrt ph and saturation index compared with previous period a higher concentration of po4 3 p was used in the phase 6 and phase 7 to verify the effects of concentration on phosphorus removal influent tp concentration was increased to 50 mg l in phase 6 and 100 mg l in phase 7 to simulate the po4 3 concentration in real digestate which could be as high as tens of mgp l to less than 300 mg p l ma et al 2018a accordingly the concentrated cacl2 2h2o solution was supplied to the reaction system from the recirculation tube the balanced ca2 concentration from phase 1 to phase 5 was around 50 mg l and was set at 100 mg l according to eq 1 the tp removal efficiency increased rapidly from 29 3 on day 171 to 86 4 on day 175 fig 3 after the tp concentration was increased and concentrated cacl2 2h2o solution was supplied in recirculation system at the start of phase 6 after continuous operation over 40 days an average tp removal efficiency of 87 6 in phase 6 and 94 5 in phase 7 was obtained much higher than that of phase 5 although the influent tp concentration was increased the average tp concentration in the effluent decreased from 15 81 mg p l in phase 5 to 6 22 mg p l in phase 6 and further decreased to 5 50 mg p l in phase 7 the phosphorus removal rate increased to 0 58 g p l d in phase 6 and 1 25 g p l d in phase 7 this is evidence that the higher influent po4 3 p and higher balanced ca2 concentration promoted the phosphate precipitation reaction at the same time the average ratio of consumed ca p in phase 6 and phase 7 was 2 14 and 2 03 which is close to the composition of hap hap precipitation reaction consumes the alkalinity produced by anammox reaction considering the system ph balance anammox reaction and hap reaction could be integrated into the following equation eq 4 4 n h 4 1 146 n o 2 0 071 h c o 3 0 285 c a 2 0 171 p o 4 3 0 986 n 2 0 161 n o 3 0 071 c h 1 74 o 0 31 n 0 20 0 0285 c a 10 o h 2 p o 4 6 2 002 h 2 o according to the stoichiometric relationship in eq 4 the ratio between nitrogen and phosphorus concentration is around 5 67 in weight in a ph balanced reaction system which means the alkalinity provided by 1500 mgtn l nitrogen in anammox reaction could balance the alkalinity consumed by around 265 mg p l phosphorus in hap precipitation reaction with influent phosphorus concentration and phosphorus removal efficiency increase in phase 6 50 mgtp l in influent and phase 7 100 mgtp l in influent the influent ph decreased a little due to the use of kh2po4 as phosphorus resource and higher hap precipitation rate consumed more alkalinity in the reactor as a result the effluent ph dropped from 8 38 0 25 in phase 5 to 8 36 0 25 in phase 6 and 8 13 0 17 in phase 7 although the h2so4 solution dosage stopped the si of potential minerals formation in phase 5 6 7 were calculated by employing visual minteq software table 3 the results show a clear increase in the si values for different forms of calcium phosphate among the different kinds of minerals the si of hap was the highest at 12 9 in phase 5 which increased dramatically to 15 8 in phase 6 and 16 5 in phase 7 when the concentration was changed although a very short hrt of 1 8 h was applied in phase 6 and phase 7 a high removal efficiency of phosphorus was obtained at the tp concentration of 50 mg p l and 100 mg p l significant si increase was considered to be the main reason for achieving such a high rate of phosphate mineral formation 3 2 sludge characteristics 3 2 1 the effect of nlr and plr on the composition of sludge sludge samples of different phases from the reactor were taken out for the analysis of main components according to icp oes analysis results calcium 24 6 32 9 wt and phosphorus 11 4 14 9 were the most abundant elements in the sludge compared with calcium and phosphorus the proportion of the other elements was very small meanwhile the vss proportion of the dry sludge varied from 20 7 to 37 1 during the long term operation according to the elemental analysis of anammox biomass with an anammox enrichment purity of 98 the composition could be expressed as ch1 74o0 31n0 20s0 01p0 01 lotti et al 2014 this means the phosphorus content of the pure anammox biomass was only around 1 40 in weight and most of the measured phosphorus in the sludge samples was in the form of precipitated phosphate in fig 6 a by assuming the phosphorus in the form of po4 3 the sum of vss calcium and po4 3 content of sludge samples in different phases is shown the calcium phosphate content and vss content varied due to the operational conditions but in all phases over 90 of the dry sludge was composed of vss content and calcium phosphate the phosphorus content as p2o5 of granules formed in this reactor was at least higher than 34 9 which was much higher for raw materials required for p industry around 25 tervahauta et al 2014 the ca p weight ratio in the dry sludge ranged from 2 16 to 2 46 the possible reason of this slightly higher ratio than the theoretical ratio of hap can be attributed to the formation of carbonate minerals such as caco3 and camg co3 2 the dry biomass samples taken from different phases during the continuous operation were examined by xrd analysis and the results indicated that the major phase of the biomass was hydroxyapatite with a minor phase of carbonated hydroxyapatite and calcium phosphate hydrate fig s2 the xrd pattern of samples taken from different height in phase 7 showed almost no difference between the samples and indicated efficient hydroxyapatite crystallization at different heights of the reactor even at a prr of 1 25 g p l d the anammox biomass yield and hap yield in this process were shown to depend largely on the nitrogen removal rate and the phosphorus removal rate the composition of sludge was characterized by the ratio between vss and the ash content during the operation of the continuous experiment the ratio between the nlr and plr was first increased from 27 8 in phase 1 to 66 7 in phase 4 and phase 5 and then decreased to 30 3 in phase 6 and 15 2 in phase 7 by taking the average nitrogen removal efficiency and phosphorus removal efficiency into consideration the relationship between sludge compositions vss ash and nitrogen and the phosphorus removal rate nrr prr is plotted in fig 6b a clear positive correlation can be observed when the nrr prr increased from 44 1 in phase 1 to 190 2 in phase 5 the vss ash increased from 0 26 to 0 59 and when the nrr prr decreased from 190 2 in phase 5 to 13 8 in phase 7 the vss ash ratio decreased from 0 59 to 0 26 correspondingly the growth in the anammox biomass can be roughly calculated from the biomass yield according to the stoichiometry reported by lotti et al 2014 the biomass yield of anammox process is 0 11 g mol n h 4 the inorganic part of the sludge is mainly composed of calcium phosphate with the ca p content close to that of hap by assuming that the removed phosphorus from the liquid phase was all consumed to form hap the composition ratio of anammox biomass and hap in this reactor can be roughly speculated using the following equation 5 x i h a p i y x n h 4 i 1 7 n l r i 2 2 n r e i t i x i n i t i a l y h a p p o 4 3 i 1 7 p l r i p r e i t i h a p i n i t i a l where x i is the biomass concentration in each phase y x n h 4 is the biomass yield of anammox n l r i n r e i are the average nitrogen loading rate and nitrogen removal efficiency in each phase t i is the duration time of each phase and x i n i t i a l is the initial biomass concentration h a p i is the accumulated hap concentration in each phase y h a p p o 4 3 is the hap yield p l r i p r e i are the average phosphorus loading rate and phosphorus removal efficiency in each phase and h a p i n i t i a l is the initial hap concentration the equation was used to compare the speculated composition ratio of anammox biomass and hap with the measured vss ash value in each phase fig 7 the composition variation of vss ash during the long term operation was speculated with reasonable accuracy by equation 3 this result indicates that the prospective sludge composition in this system can be obtained by adjusting the ratio between nitrogen and the phosphorus removal rate this equation is also useful to instruct the anammox process operation anammox bacteria is sensitive to many inhibition factors including substrate and the organic matter commonly present in practical wastewater jin et al 2012 it has been reported that large amount of eps are secreted when anammox process is inhibited y zhang et al 2016 and also that the anammox biomass easily forms a gel network due to the high viscosity of the slime eps jia et al 2017 a high concentration of eps could significantly decrease the settling property and result in a serious wash out of the anammox biomass however the settling velocity of the anammox biomass with hap formation has been shown to significantly increase from approximately 50 100 m h to over 300 m h ma et al 2018b z z zhang et al 2016 by applying calcium phosphate mineral formation in the anammox system the hap portion of the sludge would increase according to eq 3 and the biomass wash out problem could be solved by the enhanced settling property of the anammox biomass during the long term operation of the anammox process the ratio between the nitrogen loading rate and phosphorus loading rate can be considered an operational parameter to control the characteristic of produced anammox sludge in a well operated process using the co reaction of anammox and hap crystallization both high efficiency of nitrogen removal and phosphorus recovery can be achieved as stated in the introduction the hap yield is much higher than that of the anammox bacteria also a main concern of integrating phosphate crystallization reaction into the anammox process is its effect on nitrogen removal a high portion of minerals may lead to a reduction in biomass activity due to mass transfer limitation and its effects on anammox should not be ignored chen et al 2008 the total nitrogen tn removal efficiency under different phosphorus loading rates during the continuous experiment is plotted in fig 8 in the long term operation of an anammox expanded bed reactor the plr was increased from 0 18 g p l d in phase 1 to 1 32 in phase 7 by shortening hrt and increasing the influent total phosphorus tp concentration the phosphorus removal rate increased to 1 25 g p l d in phase 7 and the inorganic matter concentration of the sludge increased to 188 15 g l while the vss concentration was only 48 97 g l for the same period however a high tn removal efficiency average value higher than 83 7 was obtained under all plr applied in this study fig 8 according to eq 3 the composition of the sludge varies due to the applied nlr plr as well as initial sludge composition a dynamic balance of the sludge composition could be achieved during the continuous operation the results in this study indicate that a mineral content as high as 80 in weight has no obvious negative effect on the anammox process 3 2 2 composition of granules with different sizes a granular sample taken during phase 7 of the continuous experiment was separated into five different diameter ranges 2 8 mm 2 2 8 mm 1 2 mm 0 5 1 mm and 0 5 mm with a standard sieve the vss tss concentration and the main inorganic elements content were analyzed fig 9 an obvious increase in the vss and tss concentrations was found for the particle size below particle diameter of 2 mm while they were around the same when the particle diameter was over 2 mm on the other hand the vss tss ratio of different size particles was very stable in the 20 22 range particles with small sizes mainly derive from the new formation of flocs consisting of anammox biofilm and minerals as well as the division of mature granules and budding from the mature granules vlaeminck et al 2010 the low vss and tss concentrations indicated a loose coupled structure of both anammox biomass and calcium phosphate in small particles the coupling became compact and dense during the maturation of granules due to the growth of biomass and minerals the main inorganic elements of granules with different diameters were calcium and phosphorus the phosphorus content of granules with a diameter less than 0 5 mm was 14 5 and was a little less at 13 2 when the granule diameter was larger than 2 8 mm the remarkably similar content of inorganic elements of the granules of different sizes indicates the anammox process and hap crystallization reaction were well combined during the granulation process of composite anammox hap granules with increased particle size the ca p ratio increased slightly from 2 24 to 2 38 a higher ca p than the theoretical ratio of hap 2 15 indicated the formation of undesired minerals such as calcium carbonate on the other hand it has been reported that before the formation of stable hap transitional states such as octacalcium phosphate ocp ca8h2 po4 6 5h2o ca p wt 1 72 amorphous calcium phosphate acp ca3 po4 2 xh2o ca p wt 1 94 and calcium deficient hydroxyapatite dcp ca10 z hpo4 z oh 2 z nh2o 0 z 1 with lower ca p ratio form gradually and 24 h is needed to form pure phase hap at 25 c liu et al 2001 compared with the small granules larger granules remained in the reactor for a longer time and it is possible that the existence of transitional states is the reason for the lower ca p ratio in the small granules 3 3 structure of composite granules and the proposed granule formation routes typical composite anammox hap granules were sampled from the reactor and analyzed for their microbial and mineral distribution fig 10 c and fig 10d are photos of a mature granule and its cross section the distinct structure of the anammox biofilm attached to an inorganic core can be observed fish conducted on the cryosection of typical manure granule is shown in fig 10e h an amx820 probe specific for ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis and ca brocadia anammoxidans and eub338 i ii iii iv mix for detecting all bacteria were used to determine the microbial distributions the fish result indicate that the microbes were mainly distributed in the outer layer the density of cells was the highest at the rim of the granules and decreased with the depth based on the results of over twenty granules observed the average thickness of the biofilm was around 200 μm 500 μm in the outer layer of the granules anammox cells aggregated into small flocs and were surrounded by other bacteria fig 10f and h by comparing the fluorescence area of anammox and the total bacteria for over twenty granules it was concluded that anammox bacteria accounted for over 80 of all bacteria in the outer layer of granules laser raman spectroscopy observation was conducted to reveal the distribution of different molecules and ions in the anammox granules the raman spectroscopic mapping of a cryosection of composite anammox hap granules is shown in fig 11 the dark outer layer area and grayish center part in the visible image in fig 11a indicate the granular structure of the biofilm attached to the inner inorganic core the intensity of phosphate in the granule was observed at the ν1 vibration domain 960 cm 1 of po4 3 rey et al 2011 and the intensity of the variation is presented in different colors the results of raman mapping showed that the po4 3 intensity was much higher in the inorganic core than in the biofilm this structure agreed well with the granular structure observed in fish images the clear layered structure of the composite granules makes it easy to remove the organic matters covered in the outer layer and to use the phosphate core as raw materials for phosphorus industry for more detailed composition information raman spectra analysis was also conducted at points located in the inorganic core and biofilm fig 11b the raman spectra in the core showed very high po4 3 ν1 intensity as well as the existent of carbonate 1074 cm 1 although low fluorescence in the core was observed in the fish image there was still amide intensity detected in the core which represented the existent of protein in the core the raman spectra of the biofilm however mainly showed high intensity in the raman shift range of 1200 1500 cm 1 representing the existence of both polysaccharide and protein wagner et al 2009 the high intensity of amide in the core may come from the extracellular polymeric substance eps compared with polysaccharide protein is distributed more in the granular core which is in good agreement with the results obtained from high enriched anammox granules reported previously ni et al 2015 moreover the abundant ca2 in the inorganic core connect both with negatively charged groups of eps and the bacterial surfaces jiang et al 2003 the eps keeps the connection between the core and biofilm stable and it is speculated that the eps remains in the core even after the core mineralized apart from the granules of a typical structure some larger granules were observed to be formed in different structures based on the morphology of the granules obtained during this experiment different granule formation routes in this reactor are proposed in fig 12 the high si value of hap in the object wastewater and micro environment with alkaline condition created by anammox cells aggregate triggered the formation of flocs composed of anammox cells and hap micro crystals eps act as the binding agent between them to promote the formation of dense granule structure as granulation proceeds anammox cells in the inner part of the granules decay due to the substrate shortage and a hard core mainly consisting of hap and eps was formed johansson et al 2017 ma et al 2018b according to the fish results a mature granule was in the structure of anammox biofilm with a thickness of around 200 500 μm attached to the core the surface of a mature granule could also become the attachment site of further hap crystals and anammox cells when the crystallization speed in the reactor is higher newly formed crystals could cover the granule creating a granule with multi layers a lower crystallization speed resulted in scattered crystallization on the granular surface and further led to the formation of multi core granules and new granules could be formed by budding from the older granules the multi layered granules and multi core granules were consistently large which is not preferred from the aspect of mass transfer and specific surface area attention should be payed to the balance between crystal formation and anammox growth and sludge from the lower part of the reactor should be discharged regularly to prevent an excessively long sludge retention time 4 conclusion successful simultaneous nitrogen removal and phosphorus recovery was realized at operational temperature of 25 c using an expanded bed reactor some of the key findings are as follows a phosphorus loading rate up to 1 32 g p l d had no obvious inhibition effect on anammox process an average 83 7 tn removal efficiency at nlr of 20 g n l d and meanwhile average 94 5 tp removal efficiency at plr of 1 32 g p l d was obtained in the continuous experiment the phosphorus removal efficiency was independent of the nitrogen removal rate and was significantly affected by hrt and the supersaturation index of the solution the harvest anammox hap composite sludge was mainly composed of organism and calcium phosphate the composition ratio of vss ash could be speculated from the nitrogen removal rate and the phosphorus removal rate declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

18155,while anammox is a cost effective nitrogen treatment process for wastewater with high nutrient strength phosphorus remains untouched during this process and needs further treatment in this study the nitrogen removal and phosphorus recovery were achieved simultaneously at 25 c using an anammox expanded bed a stable high nitrogen removal efficiency of 83 7 4 8 at a 1500 mgn l influent total nitrogen concentration and a phosphorus removal efficiency of 94 2 1 2 at 100 mg p l influent total phosphorus were obtained during continuous operation the effects of the nitrogen loading rate hydraulic retention time hrt ph ca2 and po4 3 concentration on the phosphorus removal was verified in the long term operation of the reactor the sludge produced contained a high content of phosphorus mainly in the form of hydroxyapatite hap and the sludge composition strongly reflected the nitrogen and phosphorus loading the structure of the anammox hap composite granules was illustrated by the use of fluorescence in situ hybridization fish and raman spectroscopic mapping analysis the results in this study indicate that by controlling the operation parameters it is possible to integrate a

treatment process with a low operation cost since it does not require organic carbon and requires 60 less aeration than conventional nitrification denitrification processes it is therefore the preferred choice for energy intensive nitrogen treatment processes such as the treatment of anaerobic digestate it is reported that 75 of the full scale partial nitritation anammox process is used for a side stream wastewater treatment with high nitrogen strength lackner et al 2014 besides wastewater treatment an integrated system with combined anaerobic digestion ad and anammox process as the post treatment of digestate has been used for other biomass wastes treatment this provides new opportunities for the reuse of biomass wastes towards the development of a sustainable society ma et al 2018a along with nitrogen a considerable amount of phosphorus is released to the liquid phase during the ad process and proper treatment is needed before discharge that is before it is accumulated in the excess sludge phosphorus is recirculated to the main stream and is treated by a physical chemical process such as coagulating sedimentation dosage of al3 fe3 crystallization method or a biological phosphorus removal process although this process effectively reduces the concentration of phosphorus in the effluent the amount of excess sludge to be treated increased and become another economic burden of the operation in recent years the price of phosphorus fertilizer has soared due to a number of different factors including the mining cost and the reduction in the number of major exporter nations as a result phosphorus recovery has become a worldwide issue it has been reported that the potential for phosphorus recovery from the domestic waste stream alone is such that 15 20 of the global demand for phosphorus could be satisfied yuan et al 2012 in other words the effective recovery of phosphorus from the waste stream is considered one of the solutions to the phosphorus problem typically 90 of the influent phosphorus is incorporated in the sludge in a municipal wastewater treatment plant cornel and schaum 2009 because phosphorus is highly concentrated in wastewater sludge and the volume to be treated is limited recovery from the sludge digestion process has become an important approach different processes have been developed to recover phosphorus from the anaerobic digestion process of biomass waste it is possible to recover fertilizer product such as struvite nh4mgpo4 6h2o and hydroxyapatite ca5 po4 3 oh from the wastewater the dewatered filtrate or dewatered cake incineration ash after solubilization ma et al 2018a recovering the phosphorus before the dewatered filtrate returns to the mainstream wastewater treatment process significantly reduces the phosphorus load thus reducing the requirement for the flocculating agent used to remove phosphorus in the mainstream plant recently a new concept combining anammox and phosphorus recovery for the treatment of wastewater was proposed johansson et al 2017 lin et al 2013 ma et al 2018b these reports revealed the mechanism of the simultaneous formation of anammox biofilm and hydroxyapatite hap precipitation in different anammox processes high concentrations of ca2 and po4 3 in the digestate liquid have been shown to promote the spontaneous crystallization of hap with anammox bacteria providing the nucleation sites for further mineral growth the excess sludge with its high content of phosphorus can be harvested from the reactor and then subsequently used as a phosphate fertilizer it has been demonstrated that the formation of granular sludge with high content of inorganic core results in a remarkable enhancement of the settling velocity of granules which in turn improves the retention of slowly growing anammox biomass zhang et al 2018b struvite formation is usually observed in the anaerobic digestion system however in a well operated anammox process the very low levels of nh4 concentration limit the formation of struvite there are several challenges which must be overcome before this new process can be applied in the waste water industry firstly the parameters affecting the phosphorus removal efficiency in the co reaction system of anammox and hap crystallization need to be determined secondly in order to balance the yield of anammox biomass 0 11 gvss gnh4 n and the much higher yield of hap 5 4 ghap gp a strategy to obtain a balance between these two reactions is essential thirdly it is necessary to determine the minimum temperature required for the operation of the process to obtain an appropriate reaction speed the optimal temperature of anammox process is around 35 40 c ma et al 2019 while in this study an operational temperature of 25 c was set a lower operational temperature equates to a lower heating cost for the operation but anammox activity at 25 c decreases to approximately 60 that of 35 c because the saturation index of the crystallization reaction decreases at lower temperature hap formation is more difficult also the stability of the co reaction of anammox together with hap crystallization at lower operation temperatures has not been shown the present study is focused on these aspects and aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the simultaneous nitrogen removal and phosphorus recovery process using an anammox expanded bed reactor 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment set up the configuration of the expanded bed reactor set up is shown in fig 1 the reactor was inoculated with granular anammox sludge operated at 35 c used in a previous study zhang et al 2018a and fed with synthetic wastewater the synthetic wastewater consisted of nh4 n and no2 n molar ratio of 1 1 2 in the form of nh4 2so4 and nano2 and the phosphorus was provided in the form of kh2po4 other compositions consisted of 0 3 g l cacl2 2h2o 0 57 g l kcl 0 2 g l mgso4 7h2o 0 5 g l nahco3 and trace elements were added as recommended in an earlier study ma et al 2017 the effective volume of the reactor was 5 l the operating temperature was controlled at 25 1 c by water recirculation in the water jacket of the reactor the effluent from the top of the reactor was recirculated to the influent at a recirculation ratio of 3 1 to prevent substrate concentration inhibition as well as to maintain the expanded condition of sludge bed for better contact between substrate and biomass ma et al 2017 the nitrogen gas production rate was monitored by a wet gas meter the ph was adjusted by adding naoh or h2so4 solution from the recirculation tube to maintain the ph of the effluent in the range of 8 0 9 0 the higher ph range than the optimal ph of anammox reaction was designed to promote phosphate crystallization during phase 1 to phase5 of continuous experiment a relatively low level of influent phosphorus concentration of 22 8 mg p l was set in phase 6 and 7 the influent total phosphorus was increased 50 mg p l and 100 mg p l separately and cacl2 2h2o was supplied from the recirculation tube to provide sufficient ca2 for hap crystallization the phosphorus concentration in the influent simulated the po4 3 p concentration in the real digestate which is around tens of mgp l to less than 300 mg p l ma et al 2018a the balanced ca2 concentration during phase 1 to phase 5 was around 50 mg l and the ca2 addition concentration was determined by the following equation to obtain a balanced ca2 concentration of 100 mg l in the effluent assuming that the total influent phosphate would react to form hap ca p weight ratio 2 15 1 addition c ca2 2 15 influent c po4 3 p 100 mg l influent c ca2 2 2 reactor operation the reactor was operated continuously for 220 days to verify the effects of different operation parameters on phosphorus removal from phase 1 to phase 3 the effects of nitrogen loading were investigated by increasing the nlr nitrogen loading rate from 5 g n l d to 11 g n l d while the plr phosphorus loading rate kept at 0 18 g p l d from phase 3 to phase 5 the effects of hydraulic retention time hrt were investigated by reducing the hrt from 3 h to 1 8 h while the influent tp total phosphorus concentrate kept at 22 8 mg p l in phase 6 and phase 7 the effects of phosphorus concentration and calcium concentration on phosphorus removal were investigated by increasing the influent tp concentration to 50 mg p l and 100 mg p l meanwhile additional calcium was supplied from recirculation according to eq 1 the operating condition of different phases is shown in table 1 2 3 analysis of liquid samples the influent and effluent were sampled every two days filtered by 0 45 μm pore diameter membrane filter and stored in a refrigerator at 4 c nh4 n no2 n no3 n were analyzed by the agilent 7100 capillary electrophoresis ce system agilent technologies wilmington usa total phosphorus and other inorganic elements mg k fe na ca were analyzed by the agilent 720 inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes system agilent technologies wilmington usa according to the sample pretreatment procedure described in the apha standard methods apha awwa wef 2012 the influent and effluent ph was monitored by a ph meter toa hm 30v 2 4 analyses of sludge characteristics sludge samples were taken from the top middle and bottom sampling port of the reactor for analysis of the vss volatile suspended solid and tss total suspended solid concentration according to the apha methods apha awwa wef 2012 the difference between tss and vss was defined as ash content for inorganic element analysis in different phases the granular sludge sampled from the middle of the reactor were dried at 105 c overnight and then digested by nitric acid using a microwave digestion system start d milestone italy the digested liquid was analyzed by the above mentioned icp oes system to reveal the structure of the formed composite granular sludge granular samples taken from the middle height of the reactor were analyzed to determine the microbial community distribution and distribution of mineral precipitation for microbial community determination the standard fixation and hybridization procedure of fluorescence in situ hybridization fish was conducted as previously described llobet brossa et al 1998 manz et al 1992 the sampled granules were firstly embedded in an o c t compound sakura finetek torrance ca overnight and then cut with a cryostat microtome osk 97lf509 ogawa seiki co ltd japan into 30 μm thick slices the slices were then hybridized with 16s rrna targeted oligonucleotide probe amx820 specific for candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis and candidatus brocadia anammoxidans and eub338 i ii iii iv mix for detecting all bacteria formamide concentration used for hybridization was 40 for all probes the slices were then observed by a carl zeiss lsm 710 zen confocal laser scanning microscope clsm to determine the phosphate content microtome slices were observed by raman spectroscopic mapping jasco nrs 5100 using a 532 nm laser beam and the phosphate distribution was presented by an intensity of 960 cm 1 wavenumbers specific for ν1 vibration domain of the phosphate group to determine the mineral species formed in the reactor granules from different heights of the reactor were dried at 105 c overnight grinded and analyzed by xrd x ray diffraction olympus btx bench x ray diffraction system 2 5 saturation index calculations saturation index si calculation was applied to study the speciation and the driving force of formation of different minerals the si is defined as equation 2 2 si log i a p k s p where iap is the ion activity product and ksp is the solubility product of the precipitate phase when si 0 the solution is supersaturated and precipitation is spontaneous the visual miteq 3 1 was used for si calculation in this study supplementary information 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of nitrogen and phosphorus removal in anammox expanded bed reactor 3 1 1 anammox performance in the reactor according to a previous study the specific anammox activity at 25 c is around half of that at 35 c ma et al 2019 the inoculation sludge of this study operated at a nitrogen loading rate nlr of 10 g n l d at 35 c so the initial nlr at 25 c in phase 1 was set at 5 g n l d with a total nitrogen tn concentration of 625 mgn l a stable nitrogen removal performance was maintained and an average tn removal efficiency of 88 2 1 3 was obtained during an operational period of 31 days in phase 1 fig 2 the effluent no2 n and nh4 n concentrations were very low and the average concentrations were less than 5 mgn l and no3 n was produced at a ratio of 0 24 0 03 of the consumed nh4 n during the phase 1 the nlr was further increased in the following phases from 5 g n l d to 20 g n l d according to the operation conditions shown in table 1 tn concentration was simultaneously increased from 625 mgn l to 1500 mgn l along with the nlr increase which caused a slightly decrease in the tn removal efficiency from around 90 to an average value of 83 7 85 6 when nlr was set at 20 g n l d table 2 this phenomenon was also described in previous study conducted in anammox egsb expanded granular sludge bed reactors mainly because of the relatively higher substrate affinity constant of granular sludge chen et al 2011 the bigger aggregate size limits the mass transfer and a higher substrate concentrate is needed to achieve a high anammox reaction rate lotti et al 2014 consequently a very high nitrogen removal rate of 16 67 17 12 g n l d was observed at 25 c during the continuous reactor operation the half saturation constant calculated for ammonium and nitrite were 34 10 mgn l and 5 59 mgn l respectively which were a little higher compared with the value obtained at 35 c chen et al 2011 3 1 2 the effects of nitrogen loading on phosphorus removal in anammox expanded reactor phase 1 phase 3 in biological systems mineral crystallization occurs in a localized zone where supersaturation is maintained weiner 2003 anammox cells agglomerate into clusters could form a diffusion limited intercellular zone chen et al 2019 according to the anammox reaction formula eq 3 lotti et al 2014 the ph of the intercellular zone increases as the reaction proceeds which favors the crystallization of minerals such as hap 3 n h 4 1 146 n o 2 0 071 h c o 3 0 057 h 0 986 n 2 0 161 n o 3 0 071 c h 1 74 o 0 31 n 0 20 2 002 h 2 o it has also been reported that a microbial aggregate could promote crystal formation even at a lower si value by heterogeneous nucleation on them mañas et al 2012 microbial aggregates function like the seed crystals used in conventional phosphorus crystallization reactors in several previous studies anammox reaction was considered as the trigger of the hap formation in the anammox granules johansson et al 2017 z z zhang et al 2016 the effects of anammox reaction rate on phosphorus removal were investigated by changing the nitrogen loading rate while keeping the phosphorus loading rate at a constant value from phase 1 to phase 3 at an hrt of 3 h the influent tp concentration was set at 22 8 mg p l and the tn concentration was increased from 625 mgn l to 1375 mgn l resulting in an increase in the nlr from 5 g n l d to 11 g n l d accordingly the average ph of the system increased from 8 04 0 22 in phase 1 to 8 79 0 22 in phase 3 due to the anammox reaction fig 3 it was observed that the effect of nlr on the average tp removal efficiency was not significant with only a slight variation from 61 8 to 65 4 during phase 1 to phase 3 even the ph was also increased by post hoc test analysis in a one way anova at the 0 05 significant level no difference in the tp removal efficiency was found for phase 1 phase 2 and phase 3 in the continuous experiments the phosphorus removal rates remained stable during phase 1 phase 2 and phase 3 at 0 12 0 01 g p l d 0 12 0 02 g p l d 0 11 0 01 g p l d respectively on the other hand from the aspect of sludge composition the phosphorus content of the sludge decreased from 15 1 in phase 1 14 3 in phase 3 due to the increased growth rate of anammox biomass with nlr increase consequently while the microenvironment created by anammox cells and the surrounding eps triggered the initial formation of phosphate crystallization z z zhang et al 2016 further crystallization growth should be regarded more as an independent process which is not obviously affected by the anammox process the existence of anammox aggregates mainly increased the kinetic rate by heterogeneous precipitation on them to form nucleation sites mañas et al 2012 3 1 3 the effect of ph and hrt on phosphorus removal phase 3 phase 5 hap crystallization proceeds according to the following reaction 5ca2 3po4 3 oh ca5 po4 3oh this process is mainly affected by the supersaturation index si of hap reaction time reactor type and seeding conditions chen et al 2009 peng et al 2018 ph is one of the most important parameters affecting both the phosphorus crystallization reaction and anammox bacteria because a higher ph induces a higher supersaturation index a slightly alkaline environment is needed to increase the phosphorus removal efficiency peng et al 2018 it has been reported however that the optimal ph range of the anammox process is limited to about 7 0 8 5 jetten et al 2001 ph in the reactor increased according to the nlr increase from phase 1 to phase 3 and even exceeded 9 0 sometimes in phase 3 in the phase 4 and phase 5 the nlr was further increased to 16 g n l d and 20 g n l d with a simultaneous decrease in the hrt from 3 h to 1 8 h in order to avoid seriously inhibition for anammox reaction h2so4 solution was dosed from the recirculation tube continuously in phase 3 5 to control the ph of the reactor between 8 0 and 9 0 in the following phases while the nitrogen removal efficiency remained high at over 85 the phosphorus removal efficiency remarkably decreased from 61 8 5 7 in phase 3 to 46 6 4 5 in phase 4 and 30 7 8 7 in phase 5 ph decrease due to the acid dosage was one of the reasons for phosphorus crystallization efficiency decrease average ph decreased from 8 79 0 22 in phase 3 to 8 48 0 24 in phase 4 and 8 38 0 25 in phase 5 which decreased supersaturation index of hap another possible reason for this decrease was the shortened hrt fig 4 hrt in the crystallization reactor affects the reaction time changes the hydraulic properties and has been reported to have a direct effect on crystallization efficiency as well as the size of crystals pastor et al 2008 to achieve sufficient phosphorus recovery the hrt needed in high mixing intensity reactors such as air agitated reactors is always as short as half an hour dai et al 2016 in less mixed conditions such as fluidized bed reactors however typically several hours is required to obtain a satisfactory level of recovery efficiency peng et al 2018 the result in the continuous experiment supports the conclusion that phosphorus removal efficiency in the anammox expanded bed reactor mainly depends on parameters which directly affect the phosphorus crystallization reaction such as reaction time and the supersaturation index it was also observed that ph in the reactor affected the proportion of different crystallization reactions the consumed ca p ratio from phase 1 to phase 5 during the continuous experiment is summarized in fig 5 at certain influent ca2 and po4 3 concentrations the consumed ca p ratio in the continuous operation showed a positive correlation with the system ph the potential mineral formation in this system was calculated by visual minteq in terms of the supersaturation index the simulation results showed a higher formation potential for carbonate minerals such as caco3 and camg co3 2 when ph increased fig s1 in this study when the system ph exceeded 8 5 the consumed ca p ratio increased to over the theoretical ca p weight ratio of 2 15 of hap indicating the formation of undesirable minerals such as carbonate minerals the formation of such minerals inhibits hap formation by blocking the sites for phosphate nucleation and also reduces the phosphorus content of the final products cao and harris 2008 it is therefore important to avoid excessively high ph in the application of this system the operating ph of this system between 8 0 and 8 5 not only satisfied the anammox process but also reduced the potential formation of undesirable phosphorus minerals 3 1 4 the effect of ca2 and po4 3 concentration on phosphorus removal phase 6 phase 7 the results obtained from phase 1 to phase 5 of the continuous experiment indicate that although anammox biomass induced phosphorus nucleation the efficiency of phosphorus removal integrated in the anammox reactor was still mainly determined by factors which directly affect phosphorus crystallization such as the hrt ph and saturation index compared with previous period a higher concentration of po4 3 p was used in the phase 6 and phase 7 to verify the effects of concentration on phosphorus removal influent tp concentration was increased to 50 mg l in phase 6 and 100 mg l in phase 7 to simulate the po4 3 concentration in real digestate which could be as high as tens of mgp l to less than 300 mg p l ma et al 2018a accordingly the concentrated cacl2 2h2o solution was supplied to the reaction system from the recirculation tube the balanced ca2 concentration from phase 1 to phase 5 was around 50 mg l and was set at 100 mg l according to eq 1 the tp removal efficiency increased rapidly from 29 3 on day 171 to 86 4 on day 175 fig 3 after the tp concentration was increased and concentrated cacl2 2h2o solution was supplied in recirculation system at the start of phase 6 after continuous operation over 40 days an average tp removal efficiency of 87 6 in phase 6 and 94 5 in phase 7 was obtained much higher than that of phase 5 although the influent tp concentration was increased the average tp concentration in the effluent decreased from 15 81 mg p l in phase 5 to 6 22 mg p l in phase 6 and further decreased to 5 50 mg p l in phase 7 the phosphorus removal rate increased to 0 58 g p l d in phase 6 and 1 25 g p l d in phase 7 this is evidence that the higher influent po4 3 p and higher balanced ca2 concentration promoted the phosphate precipitation reaction at the same time the average ratio of consumed ca p in phase 6 and phase 7 was 2 14 and 2 03 which is close to the composition of hap hap precipitation reaction consumes the alkalinity produced by anammox reaction considering the system ph balance anammox reaction and hap reaction could be integrated into the following equation eq 4 4 n h 4 1 146 n o 2 0 071 h c o 3 0 285 c a 2 0 171 p o 4 3 0 986 n 2 0 161 n o 3 0 071 c h 1 74 o 0 31 n 0 20 0 0285 c a 10 o h 2 p o 4 6 2 002 h 2 o according to the stoichiometric relationship in eq 4 the ratio between nitrogen and phosphorus concentration is around 5 67 in weight in a ph balanced reaction system which means the alkalinity provided by 1500 mgtn l nitrogen in anammox reaction could balance the alkalinity consumed by around 265 mg p l phosphorus in hap precipitation reaction with influent phosphorus concentration and phosphorus removal efficiency increase in phase 6 50 mgtp l in influent and phase 7 100 mgtp l in influent the influent ph decreased a little due to the use of kh2po4 as phosphorus resource and higher hap precipitation rate consumed more alkalinity in the reactor as a result the effluent ph dropped from 8 38 0 25 in phase 5 to 8 36 0 25 in phase 6 and 8 13 0 17 in phase 7 although the h2so4 solution dosage stopped the si of potential minerals formation in phase 5 6 7 were calculated by employing visual minteq software table 3 the results show a clear increase in the si values for different forms of calcium phosphate among the different kinds of minerals the si of hap was the highest at 12 9 in phase 5 which increased dramatically to 15 8 in phase 6 and 16 5 in phase 7 when the concentration was changed although a very short hrt of 1 8 h was applied in phase 6 and phase 7 a high removal efficiency of phosphorus was obtained at the tp concentration of 50 mg p l and 100 mg p l significant si increase was considered to be the main reason for achieving such a high rate of phosphate mineral formation 3 2 sludge characteristics 3 2 1 the effect of nlr and plr on the composition of sludge sludge samples of different phases from the reactor were taken out for the analysis of main components according to icp oes analysis results calcium 24 6 32 9 wt and phosphorus 11 4 14 9 were the most abundant elements in the sludge compared with calcium and phosphorus the proportion of the other elements was very small meanwhile the vss proportion of the dry sludge varied from 20 7 to 37 1 during the long term operation according to the elemental analysis of anammox biomass with an anammox enrichment purity of 98 the composition could be expressed as ch1 74o0 31n0 20s0 01p0 01 lotti et al 2014 this means the phosphorus content of the pure anammox biomass was only around 1 40 in weight and most of the measured phosphorus in the sludge samples was in the form of precipitated phosphate in fig 6 a by assuming the phosphorus in the form of po4 3 the sum of vss calcium and po4 3 content of sludge samples in different phases is shown the calcium phosphate content and vss content varied due to the operational conditions but in all phases over 90 of the dry sludge was composed of vss content and calcium phosphate the phosphorus content as p2o5 of granules formed in this reactor was at least higher than 34 9 which was much higher for raw materials required for p industry around 25 tervahauta et al 2014 the ca p weight ratio in the dry sludge ranged from 2 16 to 2 46 the possible reason of this slightly higher ratio than the theoretical ratio of hap can be attributed to the formation of carbonate minerals such as caco3 and camg co3 2 the dry biomass samples taken from different phases during the continuous operation were examined by xrd analysis and the results indicated that the major phase of the biomass was hydroxyapatite with a minor phase of carbonated hydroxyapatite and calcium phosphate hydrate fig s2 the xrd pattern of samples taken from different height in phase 7 showed almost no difference between the samples and indicated efficient hydroxyapatite crystallization at different heights of the reactor even at a prr of 1 25 g p l d the anammox biomass yield and hap yield in this process were shown to depend largely on the nitrogen removal rate and the phosphorus removal rate the composition of sludge was characterized by the ratio between vss and the ash content during the operation of the continuous experiment the ratio between the nlr and plr was first increased from 27 8 in phase 1 to 66 7 in phase 4 and phase 5 and then decreased to 30 3 in phase 6 and 15 2 in phase 7 by taking the average nitrogen removal efficiency and phosphorus removal efficiency into consideration the relationship between sludge compositions vss ash and nitrogen and the phosphorus removal rate nrr prr is plotted in fig 6b a clear positive correlation can be observed when the nrr prr increased from 44 1 in phase 1 to 190 2 in phase 5 the vss ash increased from 0 26 to 0 59 and when the nrr prr decreased from 190 2 in phase 5 to 13 8 in phase 7 the vss ash ratio decreased from 0 59 to 0 26 correspondingly the growth in the anammox biomass can be roughly calculated from the biomass yield according to the stoichiometry reported by lotti et al 2014 the biomass yield of anammox process is 0 11 g mol n h 4 the inorganic part of the sludge is mainly composed of calcium phosphate with the ca p content close to that of hap by assuming that the removed phosphorus from the liquid phase was all consumed to form hap the composition ratio of anammox biomass and hap in this reactor can be roughly speculated using the following equation 5 x i h a p i y x n h 4 i 1 7 n l r i 2 2 n r e i t i x i n i t i a l y h a p p o 4 3 i 1 7 p l r i p r e i t i h a p i n i t i a l where x i is the biomass concentration in each phase y x n h 4 is the biomass yield of anammox n l r i n r e i are the average nitrogen loading rate and nitrogen removal efficiency in each phase t i is the duration time of each phase and x i n i t i a l is the initial biomass concentration h a p i is the accumulated hap concentration in each phase y h a p p o 4 3 is the hap yield p l r i p r e i are the average phosphorus loading rate and phosphorus removal efficiency in each phase and h a p i n i t i a l is the initial hap concentration the equation was used to compare the speculated composition ratio of anammox biomass and hap with the measured vss ash value in each phase fig 7 the composition variation of vss ash during the long term operation was speculated with reasonable accuracy by equation 3 this result indicates that the prospective sludge composition in this system can be obtained by adjusting the ratio between nitrogen and the phosphorus removal rate this equation is also useful to instruct the anammox process operation anammox bacteria is sensitive to many inhibition factors including substrate and the organic matter commonly present in practical wastewater jin et al 2012 it has been reported that large amount of eps are secreted when anammox process is inhibited y zhang et al 2016 and also that the anammox biomass easily forms a gel network due to the high viscosity of the slime eps jia et al 2017 a high concentration of eps could significantly decrease the settling property and result in a serious wash out of the anammox biomass however the settling velocity of the anammox biomass with hap formation has been shown to significantly increase from approximately 50 100 m h to over 300 m h ma et al 2018b z z zhang et al 2016 by applying calcium phosphate mineral formation in the anammox system the hap portion of the sludge would increase according to eq 3 and the biomass wash out problem could be solved by the enhanced settling property of the anammox biomass during the long term operation of the anammox process the ratio between the nitrogen loading rate and phosphorus loading rate can be considered an operational parameter to control the characteristic of produced anammox sludge in a well operated process using the co reaction of anammox and hap crystallization both high efficiency of nitrogen removal and phosphorus recovery can be achieved as stated in the introduction the hap yield is much higher than that of the anammox bacteria also a main concern of integrating phosphate crystallization reaction into the anammox process is its effect on nitrogen removal a high portion of minerals may lead to a reduction in biomass activity due to mass transfer limitation and its effects on anammox should not be ignored chen et al 2008 the total nitrogen tn removal efficiency under different phosphorus loading rates during the continuous experiment is plotted in fig 8 in the long term operation of an anammox expanded bed reactor the plr was increased from 0 18 g p l d in phase 1 to 1 32 in phase 7 by shortening hrt and increasing the influent total phosphorus tp concentration the phosphorus removal rate increased to 1 25 g p l d in phase 7 and the inorganic matter concentration of the sludge increased to 188 15 g l while the vss concentration was only 48 97 g l for the same period however a high tn removal efficiency average value higher than 83 7 was obtained under all plr applied in this study fig 8 according to eq 3 the composition of the sludge varies due to the applied nlr plr as well as initial sludge composition a dynamic balance of the sludge composition could be achieved during the continuous operation the results in this study indicate that a mineral content as high as 80 in weight has no obvious negative effect on the anammox process 3 2 2 composition of granules with different sizes a granular sample taken during phase 7 of the continuous experiment was separated into five different diameter ranges 2 8 mm 2 2 8 mm 1 2 mm 0 5 1 mm and 0 5 mm with a standard sieve the vss tss concentration and the main inorganic elements content were analyzed fig 9 an obvious increase in the vss and tss concentrations was found for the particle size below particle diameter of 2 mm while they were around the same when the particle diameter was over 2 mm on the other hand the vss tss ratio of different size particles was very stable in the 20 22 range particles with small sizes mainly derive from the new formation of flocs consisting of anammox biofilm and minerals as well as the division of mature granules and budding from the mature granules vlaeminck et al 2010 the low vss and tss concentrations indicated a loose coupled structure of both anammox biomass and calcium phosphate in small particles the coupling became compact and dense during the maturation of granules due to the growth of biomass and minerals the main inorganic elements of granules with different diameters were calcium and phosphorus the phosphorus content of granules with a diameter less than 0 5 mm was 14 5 and was a little less at 13 2 when the granule diameter was larger than 2 8 mm the remarkably similar content of inorganic elements of the granules of different sizes indicates the anammox process and hap crystallization reaction were well combined during the granulation process of composite anammox hap granules with increased particle size the ca p ratio increased slightly from 2 24 to 2 38 a higher ca p than the theoretical ratio of hap 2 15 indicated the formation of undesired minerals such as calcium carbonate on the other hand it has been reported that before the formation of stable hap transitional states such as octacalcium phosphate ocp ca8h2 po4 6 5h2o ca p wt 1 72 amorphous calcium phosphate acp ca3 po4 2 xh2o ca p wt 1 94 and calcium deficient hydroxyapatite dcp ca10 z hpo4 z oh 2 z nh2o 0 z 1 with lower ca p ratio form gradually and 24 h is needed to form pure phase hap at 25 c liu et al 2001 compared with the small granules larger granules remained in the reactor for a longer time and it is possible that the existence of transitional states is the reason for the lower ca p ratio in the small granules 3 3 structure of composite granules and the proposed granule formation routes typical composite anammox hap granules were sampled from the reactor and analyzed for their microbial and mineral distribution fig 10 c and fig 10d are photos of a mature granule and its cross section the distinct structure of the anammox biofilm attached to an inorganic core can be observed fish conducted on the cryosection of typical manure granule is shown in fig 10e h an amx820 probe specific for ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis and ca brocadia anammoxidans and eub338 i ii iii iv mix for detecting all bacteria were used to determine the microbial distributions the fish result indicate that the microbes were mainly distributed in the outer layer the density of cells was the highest at the rim of the granules and decreased with the depth based on the results of over twenty granules observed the average thickness of the biofilm was around 200 μm 500 μm in the outer layer of the granules anammox cells aggregated into small flocs and were surrounded by other bacteria fig 10f and h by comparing the fluorescence area of anammox and the total bacteria for over twenty granules it was concluded that anammox bacteria accounted for over 80 of all bacteria in the outer layer of granules laser raman spectroscopy observation was conducted to reveal the distribution of different molecules and ions in the anammox granules the raman spectroscopic mapping of a cryosection of composite anammox hap granules is shown in fig 11 the dark outer layer area and grayish center part in the visible image in fig 11a indicate the granular structure of the biofilm attached to the inner inorganic core the intensity of phosphate in the granule was observed at the ν1 vibration domain 960 cm 1 of po4 3 rey et al 2011 and the intensity of the variation is presented in different colors the results of raman mapping showed that the po4 3 intensity was much higher in the inorganic core than in the biofilm this structure agreed well with the granular structure observed in fish images the clear layered structure of the composite granules makes it easy to remove the organic matters covered in the outer layer and to use the phosphate core as raw materials for phosphorus industry for more detailed composition information raman spectra analysis was also conducted at points located in the inorganic core and biofilm fig 11b the raman spectra in the core showed very high po4 3 ν1 intensity as well as the existent of carbonate 1074 cm 1 although low fluorescence in the core was observed in the fish image there was still amide intensity detected in the core which represented the existent of protein in the core the raman spectra of the biofilm however mainly showed high intensity in the raman shift range of 1200 1500 cm 1 representing the existence of both polysaccharide and protein wagner et al 2009 the high intensity of amide in the core may come from the extracellular polymeric substance eps compared with polysaccharide protein is distributed more in the granular core which is in good agreement with the results obtained from high enriched anammox granules reported previously ni et al 2015 moreover the abundant ca2 in the inorganic core connect both with negatively charged groups of eps and the bacterial surfaces jiang et al 2003 the eps keeps the connection between the core and biofilm stable and it is speculated that the eps remains in the core even after the core mineralized apart from the granules of a typical structure some larger granules were observed to be formed in different structures based on the morphology of the granules obtained during this experiment different granule formation routes in this reactor are proposed in fig 12 the high si value of hap in the object wastewater and micro environment with alkaline condition created by anammox cells aggregate triggered the formation of flocs composed of anammox cells and hap micro crystals eps act as the binding agent between them to promote the formation of dense granule structure as granulation proceeds anammox cells in the inner part of the granules decay due to the substrate shortage and a hard core mainly consisting of hap and eps was formed johansson et al 2017 ma et al 2018b according to the fish results a mature granule was in the structure of anammox biofilm with a thickness of around 200 500 μm attached to the core the surface of a mature granule could also become the attachment site of further hap crystals and anammox cells when the crystallization speed in the reactor is higher newly formed crystals could cover the granule creating a granule with multi layers a lower crystallization speed resulted in scattered crystallization on the granular surface and further led to the formation of multi core granules and new granules could be formed by budding from the older granules the multi layered granules and multi core granules were consistently large which is not preferred from the aspect of mass transfer and specific surface area attention should be payed to the balance between crystal formation and anammox growth and sludge from the lower part of the reactor should be discharged regularly to prevent an excessively long sludge retention time 4 conclusion successful simultaneous nitrogen removal and phosphorus recovery was realized at operational temperature of 25 c using an expanded bed reactor some of the key findings are as follows a phosphorus loading rate up to 1 32 g p l d had no obvious inhibition effect on anammox process an average 83 7 tn removal efficiency at nlr of 20 g n l d and meanwhile average 94 5 tp removal efficiency at plr of 1 32 g p l d was obtained in the continuous experiment the phosphorus removal efficiency was independent of the nitrogen removal rate and was significantly affected by hrt and the supersaturation index of the solution the harvest anammox hap composite sludge was mainly composed of organism and calcium phosphate the composition ratio of vss ash could be speculated from the nitrogen removal rate and the phosphorus removal rate declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

18156,understanding the bacterial dynamics in cooling towers is imperative for the assessment of disinfection efficiency and management of microbial risks linked to aerosol formation the objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of feed water on the cooling water bacterial microbiome and investigate the survival ability of its members when exposed to continuous chlorine disinfection water from an industrial cooling water system 2600 m3 h was collected over a 5 month period at 3 locations along the feed water line and 3 locations in the cooling tower atp measurements suggested that the average atp per cell in the cooling tower evolved independently from the average atp per cell in the feed water flow cytometry and 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing were then combined to quantify the bacterial dynamics in the whole system a mass balance based equation was established to determine net growth and net decay of the cooling tower bacterial communities in order to evaluate the impact of continuous chlorination 0 35 0 41 mg cl2 l residual chlorine the results indicated that cooling tower main community members were determined by the input feed water microbiome and the bacterial community structure was further shaped by varying decay rates of the microorganisms notably the order obscuribacterales showed to be growing in the cooling tower in the presence of residual chlorine up to 0 4 mg cl2 l with a recurrent net growth of 260 95 taking into account the impact of the concentration factor this conclusion was only possible thanks to the systematic analysis described in this paper and generates discussion about the resistance of obscuribacterales to residual chlorine the described mass balance approach provides a high level of understanding on bacterial dynamics and should be considered for future characterization studies of cooling towers in which accurate investigation of microbiome changes is essential graphical abstract image 1 keywords cooling tower chlorine

source for legionnaires disease european commission 2018 llewellyn et al 2017 in order to avoid the proliferation of harmful species such as legionella pneumophila and to reduce the risk of biofilm formation and microbial corrosion in the system the daily operation of cooling towers usually includes continuous or shock dosage of biocide the most common biocide chlorine is often added as sodium hypochlorite naocl or chlorine dioxide clo2 despite continuous chlorine dosage prior research has shown that active bacteria can still be present in cooling tower systems chien et al 2013 helmi et al 2018 and outbreaks keep occurring ecdc 2019 bringing into question the efficacy of this method in managing risks linked to legionella chlorine efficiency can decline by a low quality feed water or side reaction with organic compounds concentrating in the cooling tower hua et al 2015 maintenance and investigation of an appropriate chemical combination for scaling and corrosion inhibition are crucial a few case studies have reported the identification of bacterial communities and microbial interactions in chlorinated cooling towers di gregorio et al 2017 paranjape et al 2019 pereira et al 2017 tsao et al 2019 feed water has been considered as a major factor affecting cooling water microbial communities based on results from 18 cooling towers from 6 geographic locations and using local water sources paranjape et al 2019 another paper pointed out the recurrence of biofilm forming taxa in cooling tower basins tsao et al 2019 however most studies simply report the observed communities without quantifying the contribution of the feed water microbiome or evaluating the impact of biocides on decay or resistance of microorganisms in the cooling water the complexity of evaporative cooling systems makes the study of their microbiome at laboratory scale and the collection of representative results challenging chien et al 2013 therefore the available knowledge on the microbial dynamics in cooling towers is still limited investigating the behaviour of the bacterial populations in long term operated full scale systems is a necessary step in identifying the factors shaping the community compositions and understanding how biocidal treatments impact the cooling tower microbial communities in this study we combined flow cytometry adenosine triphosphate atp and 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing analyses of water samples from an industrial full scale cooling water system 2600 m3 h data collected from the feed line 3 locations and from the cooling tower 3 locations over a 5

draft cooling tower situated on the site of an industrial gases company the freshwater originates from two main sources belgian polder water and surface water from the biesbosch pre treatment involves the dosage of an iron based coagulant then use of bandfilter microstrainer rapid sand filter for removal of suspended solids and dosage of sodium hypochlorite as a biocide the pipe distance of the

evaluate the water flows in the system as it is assumed that no loss of the element would occur in evaporation or precipitation moreover the chemicals added to the cooling tower do not contain potassium in one of the 5 months november analysis of k39 was not available the concentration of strontium sr88 was used as a substitute element for the mass balance calculation for identical reasons as stated for potassium water samples were filtered with 0 45 μm pore size and 33 mm diameter sterile pvdf syringe filters merck germany diluted 10 times with ultrapure water and treated with nitric

the concentration factor was based on the ratio of k39 or sr88 concentration in the cooling tower water by the concentration in the feed water for each sampling date table 2 2 5 mass balance based equation for assessment of net decay or growth of taxonomic orders taking into account the addition of bacterial cells by the feed water and the concentration factor estimated by the potassium or

sequencing ngs analysis was performed on all samples to investigate the spatial and temporal changes in bacterial microbiome a closer look was taken at the cooling tower feed c and the cooling tower samples d e and f to assess the impact of chlorine dosage on the main bacterial communities composing the cooling tower water fig 1 the net decay or net growth of specific orders of bacteria were estimated from a mass balance based equation taking into account the concentration factor 3 1 water composition water parameters collected by online monitoring or with handheld measurement devices are reported in table 1 despite some small variations in ph conductivity and temperature in the feed line the cooling tower parameters were kept stable the samples had a ph between 7 7 and 8 4 in the feed water line a b and c in the cooling tower d e and f the ph was between 7 5 and 7 8 due to the dosage of sulphuric acid to limit scaling and improve sodium hypochlorite disinfection efficiency fig 1 the conductivity in the feed line varied between 600 and 750 μs cm over time while the conductivity in the cooling tower was maintained between 3000 and 3500 μs cm total organic carbon concentrations reached between 34 1 and 55 4 mg l in the cooling tower due to the concentration factor induced by the evaporation residual chlorine concentrations were the highest in location b and d reaching up to 0 42 and 0 41 mg cl2 l respectively due to the dosage of sodium hypochlorite at these locations lower values in c indicate a decay in residual chlorine along the distribution system chlorine concentrations in e and f were not quantified but were expected to contain similar concentration of residual chlorine as d as a result of the high water recirculation rate and continuous dosage ammonia concentration was not analysed in the cooling tower but the feed water supplier reported a low concentration in the incoming water between 0 005 and 0 05 mg l formation of monochloramine in the cooling water cannot be excluded but is assumed to have minor impact on the residual chlorine concentration measured the temperature was highly variable in the feed water gradually decreasing from 20 2 to 5 2 c during the sampling campaign from august to december 2017 on the contrary the cooling water temperature was kept between 15 and 25 c due to the continuous water recirculation through the heat exchangers the results from the icp ms analyses with the corresponding concentration factor are shown in table 2 the concentration factor varied between 3 5 0 1 and 6 6 0 2 3 2 bacterial cell number and atp measurements 3 2 1 spatial changes in the system flow cytometry was applied to measure the total and intact cell counts and atp measurements were performed to quantify the bacterial intracellular and extracellular atp concentrations in the water samples fig 2 shows the results of the analyses performed in september the results from the other months revealed the same trends despite some variations in absolute values the corresponding figures for all monthly samples are available in the supplementary materials figs s1 and s2 sodium hypochlorite was dosed at two locations in the system the first location was before distribution of the feed water to the cooling tower before sampling point b fig 1 the second location was in the basin of the cooling tower point d the intact cell counts and intracellular atp at the inlet of the feed line a were the highest from all samples with 0 4 1 5 x 106 cells ml fig 2a figs s1 and s2 and 80 700 pg atp ml respectively fig 2b figs s1 and s2 the intact cell counts then showed a strong decrease in the concentration range between sampling points a and b where the pre treatment steps and first naocl dosage were applied the reduction varied between 79 and 98 in intact cell count depending on the sampling month the intracellular atp measurements indicated a similar trend with a decrease of 85 98 between sampling points a and b in august and september an increase of 6 7 x 104 in intact cells per ml was measured along the distribution pipe between points b and c higher feed water temperature in this period of the year could have caused regrowth in the distribution line the opposite trend was observed in november and december with a loss of intact cells and intracellular atp no strong difference in the intact cell count and intracellular atp was noticeable between the feed water in point c and the cooling water in points d e and f despite continuous sodium hypochlorite dosage in the basin of the cooling tower the chlorine dosage did not neutralize all cells but it helped to prevent further increase in cell concentration considering the concentration factor table 2 and the water retention time of around 5 days in the system the 3 samples collected in the cooling tower d e and f showed comparable results for each sampling date although point e always exhibited a slightly higher microbial contents of 1 2 x 104 intact cells ml 3 2 2 evolution of atp per cell in time the atp data and intact cell counts were used to identify the spatial and temporal evolution in average atp per cell value the amount of intracellular atp per intact cell count was calculated for each sample and the average values for feed and cooling water samples were plotted in fig 3 together with the feed water temperature on each sampling day the feed water samples showed a strong decrease in atp per cell between august and november from 4 1 10 16 to 6 2 10 17 g atp cell and stabilised between november and december the feed water temperatures also decreased in this period from 20 2 to 5 2 c the amount of atp per intact cell inside the cooling tower was more stable over the observation period between 2 7 10 16 and 6 8 10 16 g atp cell the results suggest that i the average atp per cell in the cooling tower evolved independently from the average atp per cell in the feed water ii the feed water is more affected by the changes in environmental conditions than the cooling water the divergence between the intracellular atp per cell in the feed water and in the cooling tower water could be explained by the better controlled conditions in the cooling tower or by different bacterial communities populating the two sections of the system 3 3 taxonomic diversity and relative abundances the changes in bacterial composition in the feed and cooling water was monitored by 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing the impact of the cooling tower conditions and the continuous chlorine dosage on the microbiome were evaluated the relative abundances of potentially pathogenic genera are available in the supplementary materials table s3 the legionella genus represented only 0 28 of the total number of reads from all samples and did not show an increase in relative abundance between the feed and the cooling tower the bacterial community in the feed water was dominated by sar clade 37 19 and frankiales 16 8 orders fig 4 a and figs s3 s5 from the phyla proteobacteria and actinobacteria respectively only the sample from october diverged by a strong increase in sphingomonadales after the pre treatment steps b of 20 fig s4 a less abundant but recurrent bacterial order was betaproteobacteriales 6 3 sar clade and frankiales abundances dramatically dropped in the cooling tower 2 2 the main taxonomic orders common to all cooling tower samples locations d e and f were caulobacterales 28 12 and obscuribacterales 18 8 followed by rhizobiales 6 2 spingomonadales 6 5 and betaproteobacteriales 5 2 the venn diagrams shown on fig 4b and figs s3 s5 indicate that the taxa shared between the feed water c and the basin of the cooling tower d accounted for 85 94 of the total sequences depending on the month in addition the cooling tower shows less diversity than the feed water with a lower number of taxa hence despite the strong switch observed in relative abundance of microorganisms the cooling tower main bacterial members were already present in the feed when comparing all collected samples only 0 2 of the total number of otus 33 otus were shared between all locations over the 5 months however the 33 shared otus accounted for 46 of the total sequence reads these common taxa representing a large fraction of the total sequences constitutes the core microbiome of our system principal coordinates analysis fig 5 shows the phylogenetic relatedness between communities of all samples based on the generated otus illustrating the changes in bacterial community structures in time and at the different locations the clusters represented with plain and dotted circles reveal structural divergence between the feed and the cooling water samples for each month greater distances are observable between the feed water and cooling tower samples than between the 3 samples from each section in addition the feed water samples clustered more closely than cooling water samples the outlier observed in august and corresponding to the basin sample location d shows strong similarities with the feed water structure suggesting that the feed water valve was open at the time of the sampling in the same figure the monthly clusters formed by the feed water samples do not seem to converge suggesting temporal variations in bacterial community structure in the water source upstream from the studied system the chart with letters corresponding to each location is available in supplementary materials fig s6 to summarize the sequencing results suggest that the cooling tower bacterial composition is continuously determined by the feed water microbiome but is further shaped by the process conditions 3 4 growth and decay of bacterial orders in the cooling tower the strong change in relative abundance of the main bacterial members between the feed water and the cooling tower may be due to differential growth or differential decay of the feed water community members when accessing the basin of the cooling system the sequencing data refers to all intracellular dna both from viable and non viable bacteria to estimate which community members show a net growth or decay the relative abundances were combined with the total cell counts in a mass balance based equation described in section 2 5 a similar approach has been implemented in the past with flocculent sludge and anaerobic digestion systems mei et al 2016 saunders et al 2015 winkler et al 2012 the taxonomic rank order was chosen for visualization of the changes in microbiome and identify trends over the sampling period as no specific functionalities were investigated the results presented in fig 6 show the growth and decay of taxonomic orders in relative fig 6a and absolute numbers fig 6b the data indicates that the majority of the bacterial groups are decaying with less than 10 remaining cells less than 2 for the frankiales and sar11 clade among the dominating organisms from the feed water and the cooling water only the taxonomic order obscuribacterales showed considerable and recurrent increase in the cooling tower microbiome 260 95 fig 6a corresponding to an absolute increase of 104 to 105 cells ml fig 6b depending on the month the strong increase in 2 main otus within the obscuribacterales order were causing this rise caulobacterales 48 30 showed a slower decay than rhizobiales 9 3 and sphingomonadales 8 7 a further look at the most abundant otus of these main taxonomic orders revealed that all main genera contributed to the decay of the orders the doi of the raw sequencing data is indicated in supplementary materials quantification of the changes in microbial structures suggest different decay rates and adaptability of individual bacterial groups under continuous chlorine dosage in the recirculating cooling water from 0 35 to 0 41 mg cl2 l table 2 only the obscuribacterales order was able to significantly increase in cell number in the cooling tower despite the high residual chlorine content of the water the absolute increase in cells taking into account the impact of the concentration factor could only be determined by the use of our mass balance based approach combining flow cytometry and sequencing data 4 discussion 4 1 commonly applied residual chlorine concentration does not allow complete inactivation of cooling tower bacteria the use of surface water as feed water for cooling tower operation requires a powerful biofouling inhibitor to avoid pathogen outbreaks and biofilm formation the high bactericidal efficiency and competitive cost of sodium hypochlorite makes it the most common inhibitor in cooling processes frayne 1999 chlorine dosage in the studied cooling water system i reduced by up to 98 the active bacterial biomass concentration in water when dosed in the feed line fig 2 with a negligible impact on the relative abundance of the microbial community members in the surface water feeding the cooling tower figs 4a and 5 ii limited the bacterial growth in the cooling tower water caused by the increase in nutrient content table s1 and 5 day retention time fig 2 continuous dosage of biocide prevented the growth of pathogenic bacteria including legionella however it was not effective to entirely inactivate the bacterial cells in the water even at residual chlorine concentrations up to 0 4 mg cl2 l resistance of some specific organisms to relatively high residual chlorine concentration 0 6 mg cl2 l has been recently described song et al 2019 sun et al 2013 and previous studies on cooling tower reported that a continuous free chlorine residual of 1 mg cl2 l was optimal to achieve recommended biological control criteria 104 cfu ml with naocl chien et al 2013 helmi et al 2018 however concentrations higher than 0 5 mg cl2 l is usually not a feasible option due to the corrosiveness of the chemical side reaction with other inhibitors and formation of disinfection by products boulay and edwards 2001 hsieh et al 2010 padhi et al 2019 the high total organic carbon concentration in the cooling tower up to 55 mg l may have led to the reaction of organic matter with the sodium hypochlorite dosed in the basin as an additional point the quantification of intact cells at different locations in the cooling tower indicated a higher concentration of viable cells after the heat exchanger suggesting cell growth or release from biofilms in that section of the process the sampling location is therefore of importance for evaluating the microbiome of a cooling tower in the studied cooling tower 16s results showed low abundance of potentially pathogenic genus table s3 however the observation that the chlorine dosage does not completely prevent microbial growth in the heat exchanger could be a concern for other cooling towers since the water from the outlet of the heat exchanger line is sprayed on top of the column this is also the point where pathogens might be spread in the surroundings to reduce the risks of outbreak chlorine dosage could be performed right before the spray nozzles instead of inside the cooling tower basin 4 2 main cooling tower bacterial members originated from the feed water microbiome but the process conditions further influenced the bacterial community structure a substantial core microbiome was shared between all collected samples 46 of the total sequence reads was contained in 33 otus the shared taxa between the feed water and the cooling tower basin water on each month accounted for 85 94 of the sequences fig 4b supporting the idea that the planktonic population present in the cooling tower originated mainly from the feed water the remaining fraction of microorganisms could have originated from different sources such as the ambient air and particles precipitations or biofilm growth rain and cloud waters can contain up to 106 bacterial cells ml hu et al 2018 and the air to water ratio can reach up to 1 5 m3 l in a cooling tower keshtkar 2017 potentially affecting the water community composition of these open recirculating systems although the main cooling tower bacterial members originated from the feed water a strong switch in relative abundance of the microbial community members was observed including a change of the dominant microorganisms figs 4a and 5 main taxonomic orders for the feed water ld12 subclade of sar 11 alphaproteobacteria and hgcl subclade of frankiales actinobacteria are common groups described in freshwater reservoirs and brackish waters henson et al 2018 llirós et al 2014 salcher et al 2011 but not recurrent in cooling towers cooling water bacterial communities on the contrary were dominated by the recurrent orders obscuribacterales melainabacteria and caulobacterales alphaproteobacteria followed by sphingomonadales and rhizobiales alphaproteobacteria a decrease of actinobacteria and rise of proteobacteria have been previously observed in cooling water paranjape et al 2019 corresponding to our findings with the strong decline in frankiales and suggesting a high sensitivity of these organisms to the changes in environmental conditions this shift in relative abundance can be linked to several environmental factors the main one being continuous disinfection continuous chlorine dosage affects bacterial community structure depending on the tolerance of the bacterial species to the biocide or their presence in protective biofilms even though no deposit was visible in the cooling tower basin caulobacterales sphingomonadales and rhizobiales are bacterial orders frequently encountered in biofilms farenhorst et al 2017 pang and liu 2007 and post disinfection samples gomez alvarez et al 2012 shaw et al 2015 of drinking water distribution systems the observed caulobacterales family hyphomonadaceae is known as prosthecate bacteria producing polysaccharide based adhesin called holdfast allowing surface colonization abraham and rohde 2014 dang and lovell 2015 nagaraj et al 2017 some sphingomonas species have also been linked to biofilm initiation through production of water soluble polysaccharides and surface adhesion proteins bereschenko et al 2011 pollock and armentrout 1999 or have shown higher chlorine tolerance sun et al 2013 wang et al 2019 both leading to deteriorations of membrane processes bereschenko et al 2010 de vries et al 2019 to a lesser extent chlorine resistance properties of the rhizobiales order have been discussed in a drinking water distribution system wang et al 2018 the biofilms located on the inner surfaces of these systems constitutes the main reservoirs for bacterial regrowth berry et al 2006 a recent study also reported the presence of these community members in cooling tower biofilms di gregorio et al 2017 suggesting that detached biofilm fragments likely influence cooling water bacterial composition chlorine disinfection can also explain the lower diversity in otus encountered in the cooling tower water compared to the feed water fig 4b and figs s3 s5 to summarize most cooling tower community members originated from the feed water microbiome but the process conditions further influenced the bacterial community structure 4 3 cooling tower community structure is mainly shaped by differences in decay rate of populations caused by residual chlorine since 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing does not differentiate between live dormant and damaged cells li et al 2017 the association of relative abundance with total cell count can help quantify the abundance of bacterial groups and identify growth or decay of specific taxonomic orders combination of flow cytometry with 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing has previously been investigated for drinking water monitoring prest et al 2014 and showed to be a promising method for quantification of bacterial communities in water systems we applied the same method in this study combined with a mass balance to assess the impact of chlorine dosage on each bacterial order composing the cooling tower section 2 5 to our knowledge this is the first paper that describes net growth and decay of cooling tower microorganisms based on our results all dominant feed and cooling water microorganisms showed strong net decay with exception of the obscuribacterales order in the case of caulobacterales sphingomonadales and rhizobiales the high relative abundance in the cooling tower resulted from a slower decay compared to the other microbial community members importantly the potentially pathogenic bacterial group legionella showed negligible abundance in all samples table s3 and demonstrated decay in the studied cooling tower indicating that risks of outbreak were prevented a control study without disinfection would be able to confirm that chlorine is causing these microbial community changes but operation of a full scale cooling tower without biocide dosage is not feasible due to the threat of pathogenic bacteria we can conclude from our study that the decay rate of the different bacterial orders is the main factor shaping the cooling water microbiome not bacterial growth potential this finding implies that the feed water acts as a continuous inoculant highly impacting the cooling tower populations when chlorine is used for disinfection the importance of the feed water composition has been observed by studying the similarities in bacterial members between multiple cooling towers based on their geographic locations paranjape et al 2019 but has never been thoroughly investigated 4 4 the bacterial group obscuribacterales succeeded in growing in the presence of residual chlorine as indicated previously the only microorganism group showing a net growth in the cooling tower was the order obscuribacterales obscuribacterales belong to the phylum melainabacteria a recently discovered phylum closely related to the cyanobacteria but consisting of non photosynthetic members bruno et al 2018 di rienzi et al 2013 although described as a strictly fermentative bacterial phylum a newly identified species has been shown to possess the ability for fermentation as well as aerobic and anaerobic respiration with complete respiratory chain soo et al 2014 to our knowledge the order obscuribacterales has been rarely observed in engineered water systems and never described in biofilms it has however been identified in other cooling tower studies by pereira et al 2017 and paranjape et al 2019 in the latter obscuribacterales was present in 7 out of 18 evaporative cooling towers and represented a substantive portion of the total bacterial community between 10 and 30 relative abundance in 2 of them daily and continuous disinfections were applied and residual chlorine concentrations of 0 32 and 0 27 mg cl2 l were reached in these 2 systems those results are in line with our finding and would suggest that dominance of obscuribacterales is favoured by the presence of continuous high residual dosage however the explanation for the chlorine resistance is so far unknown due to the lack of information available on the microorganisms and biocide s mechanism chlorine disinfection does not require specific target sites to exert a cytotoxic effect higher resistance of cells to chlorine is believed to result from reduced cell membrane permeability or formation of a mucopolysaccharide outer layer bower and daeschel 1999 further characterization would therefore be necessary to understand the metabolism and physiology of the bacteria in order to avoid chlorine resistant organisms to develop a complementary disinfection method could be considered depending on the resistance mechanism such as uv or quaternary ammonium compounds phe et al 2009 sun et al 2013 rahmani et al 2016 in addition to cell resistance the formation of cell aggregates can also provide protection against external stress factors including biocides mir et al 1997 aggregates have not been observed during the study but their presence should not be excluded 4 5 the described mass balance approach allows better characterization of cooling water bacterial changes the use of a mass balance in combination with flow cytometry and sequencing data provided a higher level of understanding of the bacterial dynamics full scale studies often omit to describe the feed water bacterial composition which is essential information when discussing bacterial changes in chlorinated cooling water systems ignoring the feed water microbiome can lead to data misinterpretation e g by assuming that all main cooling water taxa became accustomed to the process conditions and disinfection in this study we included the feed water composition to identify the factors shaping the bacterial communities in the cooling tower the studied cooling tower did not show an increase of potentially pathogenic bacterial groups table s3 however the method would be able to detect an outbreak specifically if legionella continuously shows net growth this would indicate the necessity of implementing alternative disinfection methods in addition approximation of the net growth or net decay of microorganisms is highly valuable to detect chlorine resistant microorganisms with this approach we could prove that the increase in obscuribacterales was not only relative to the other communities nor due to the effect of concentration in the cooling tower but resulted from the absolute growth of this microorganism group in the system containing residual chlorine application of this method to a large cooling tower dataset can identify recurrent and growing bacterial groups and help further optimisation and evaluation of disinfection technique limitations are however present when quantifying absolute abundances based on genomic analyses kleiner et al 2017 specifically regarding the limited resolution poretsky et al 2014 of the method and taxonomic profiling sczyrba et al 2017 the real net growth and net decay can therefore show some deviations from the calculated values improvements can be made in the future by i taking into account copy numbers in the mass balance when the organisms are better identified and ii sampling and analysing the cooling tower surface to identify attached microbial communities and assess the potential impact on the microbial dynamics 5 conclusions the microbiome characterization of a full scale industrial cooling tower 2600 m3 h with residual chlorine between 0 35 and 0 41 mg cl2 l and concentration factor between 3 5 and 6 6 and comparison of bacterial community structures between the water feeding the cooling tower and the cooling tower water led to the following conclusions the bacterial community composition in the cooling tower is driven by the feed water community composition however the structure of the bacterial community is governed by differences in decay rate of the bacterial groups in presence of residual chlorine the characterization of feed water bacterial composition is therefore of great importance when studying microbiome dynamics in cooling towers the taxonomic order obscuribacterales was able to grow in the cooling system despite the presence of up to 0 41 mg cl2 l residual chlorine suggesting potential chlorine resistance ability of this bacterial group this taxonomic order is not commonly found in biofilms as opposed to the other dominant organisms found in the cooling water but has been previously observed in cooling tower studies in presence of residual chlorine the proposed approach based on mass balance combining flow cytometry and 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing is a useful tool to determine net growth and decay of microorganisms and to assess biocide impacts on cooling tower communities this study points out the importance of full scale data for identification of organisms with higher ability to survive disinfection the establishment of a database from industrial scale cooling towers would contribute to determine recurrence of specific organisms in these processes a better understanding of the biological processes and microbiome changes could be used to predict and

18156,understanding the bacterial dynamics in cooling towers is imperative for the assessment of disinfection efficiency and management of microbial risks linked to aerosol formation the objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of feed water on the cooling water bacterial microbiome and investigate the survival ability of its members when exposed to continuous chlorine disinfection water from an industrial cooling water system 2600 m3 h was collected over a 5 month period at 3 locations along the feed water line and 3 locations in the cooling tower atp measurements suggested that the average atp per cell in the cooling tower evolved independently from the average atp per cell in the feed water flow cytometry and 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing were then combined to quantify the bacterial dynamics in the whole system a mass balance based equation was established to determine net growth and net decay of the cooling tower bacterial communities in order to evaluate the impact of continuous chlorination 0 35 0 41 mg cl2 l residual chlorine the results indicated that cooling tower main community members were determined by the input feed water microbiome and the bacterial community structure was further shaped by varying decay rates of the microorganisms notably the order obscuribacterales showed to be growing in the cooling tower in the presence of residual chlorine up to 0 4 mg cl2 l with a recurrent net growth of 260 95 taking into account the impact of the concentration factor this conclusion was only possible thanks to the systematic analysis described in this paper and generates discussion about the resistance of obscuribacterales to residual chlorine the described mass balance approach provides a high level of understanding on bacterial dynamics and should be considered for future characterization studies of cooling towers in which accurate investigation of microbiome changes is essential graphical abstract image 1 keywords cooling tower chlorine

source for legionnaires disease european commission 2018 llewellyn et al 2017 in order to avoid the proliferation of harmful species such as legionella pneumophila and to reduce the risk of biofilm formation and microbial corrosion in the system the daily operation of cooling towers usually includes continuous or shock dosage of biocide the most common biocide chlorine is often added as sodium hypochlorite naocl or chlorine dioxide clo2 despite continuous chlorine dosage prior research has shown that active bacteria can still be present in cooling tower systems chien et al 2013 helmi et al 2018 and outbreaks keep occurring ecdc 2019 bringing into question the efficacy of this method in managing risks linked to legionella chlorine efficiency can decline by a low quality feed water or side reaction with organic compounds concentrating in the cooling tower hua et al 2015 maintenance and investigation of an appropriate chemical combination for scaling and corrosion inhibition are crucial a few case studies have reported the identification of bacterial communities and microbial interactions in chlorinated cooling towers di gregorio et al 2017 paranjape et al 2019 pereira et al 2017 tsao et al 2019 feed water has been considered as a major factor affecting cooling water microbial communities based on results from 18 cooling towers from 6 geographic locations and using local water sources paranjape et al 2019 another paper pointed out the recurrence of biofilm forming taxa in cooling tower basins tsao et al 2019 however most studies simply report the observed communities without quantifying the contribution of the feed water microbiome or evaluating the impact of biocides on decay or resistance of microorganisms in the cooling water the complexity of evaporative cooling systems makes the study of their microbiome at laboratory scale and the collection of representative results challenging chien et al 2013 therefore the available knowledge on the microbial dynamics in cooling towers is still limited investigating the behaviour of the bacterial populations in long term operated full scale systems is a necessary step in identifying the factors shaping the community compositions and understanding how biocidal treatments impact the cooling tower microbial communities in this study we combined flow cytometry adenosine triphosphate atp and 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing analyses of water samples from an industrial full scale cooling water system 2600 m3 h data collected from the feed line 3 locations and from the cooling tower 3 locations over a 5 month period was used to i characterize the microbiome along the system ii evaluate the impact of feed water on cooling water bacterial dynamics iii detect bacteria potentially resistant to continuous chlorine dosage the approach provides qualitative and quantitative information on the temporal and spatial bacterial changes in the cooling water system and on the disinfection efficiency by chlorine dosage 2 materials and methods 2 1 full scale system the studied system is located in zeeland the south west region of the netherlands as shown in fig 1 it consists in two main parts the feed water line and the open recirculating cooling tower the pre treatment of the feed water is performed at the braakman water treatment plant of evides industriewater before being distributed to the induced draft cooling tower situated on the site of an industrial gases company the freshwater originates from two main sources belgian polder water and surface water from the biesbosch pre treatment involves the dosage of an iron based coagulant then use of bandfilter microstrainer rapid sand filter for removal of suspended solids and dosage of sodium hypochlorite as a biocide the pipe distance of the distribution line connecting both sites is approximately 8 km the cooling tower has a capacity of 25 mw and is maintained at a concentration factor i e ratio between basin and feed water conductivities of around 5 based on online conductivity measurements when the conductivity in the basin exceeds 3500 μs cm the discharge valve opens and part of the concentrated water is replaced by new feed water the system recirculates on average 2600 m3 h of cooling water and operates at a temperature difference of 6 8 c between the inlet and outlet of the heat exchanger line location points d and e respectively fig 1 the chemical dosages include mild steel and copper corrosion inhibitors containing respectively phosphoric acid and sodium tolyltriazole caco3 scale inhibitor

performed using the silva database the abundances of potentially pathogenic genera obtained from the drinking water quality guidelines who 2011 have been calculated and added in supplementary materials table s3 2 4 4 alpha and beta diversity analyses diversity analyses were performed on the otus generated after the sequencing and their relative abundances in the samples alpha diversity

the venn command in mothur and venn diagrams were constructed using the software venn diagram plotter beta diversity measurement of the samples was assessed with principal coordinates analysis pcoa in mothur using unweighted unifrac distance matrix analysis was performed with subsampling parameter of 30276 sequences corresponding to the sample with the lowest number of sequences pcoa results provided the phylogenetic relatedness between the bacterial communities retrieved from the different sampling locations and at different sampling times 2 4 5 icp ms analyses potassium k39 was used to evaluate the water flows in the system as it is assumed that no loss of the element would occur in evaporation or precipitation moreover the chemicals added to the cooling tower do not contain potassium in one of the 5 months november analysis of k39 was not available the concentration of strontium sr88 was used as a substitute element for the mass balance calculation for identical reasons as stated for potassium water samples were filtered with 0 45 μm pore size and 33 mm diameter sterile pvdf syringe filters merck germany diluted 10 times with ultrapure water and treated with nitric acid 1 v v prior to the analyses the element was analysed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms plasmaquant analytik jena germany in the analysis method an ar flow of 9 0 l min was used for the plasma with an auxiliary flow of 1 4 l min and nebulizer flow of 1 1 l min the r f was set to 1 3 kw measurements were performed in no gas mode in the calculation described in section 2 5 the concentration factor was based on the ratio of k39 or sr88 concentration in the cooling tower water by the concentration in the feed water for each sampling date table 2 2 5 mass balance based equation for assessment of net decay or growth of taxonomic orders taking into account the addition of bacterial cells by the feed water and the concentration factor estimated by the potassium or

sequencing ngs analysis was performed on all samples to investigate the spatial and temporal changes in bacterial microbiome a closer look was taken at the cooling tower feed c and the cooling tower samples d e and f to assess the impact of chlorine dosage on the main bacterial communities composing the cooling tower water fig 1 the net decay or net growth of specific orders of bacteria were estimated from a mass balance based equation taking into account the concentration factor 3 1 water composition water parameters collected by online monitoring or with handheld measurement devices are reported in table 1 despite some small variations in ph conductivity and temperature in the feed line the cooling tower parameters were kept stable the samples had a ph between 7 7 and 8 4 in the feed water line a b and c in the cooling tower d e and f the ph was between 7 5 and 7 8 due to the dosage of sulphuric acid to limit scaling and improve sodium hypochlorite disinfection efficiency fig 1 the conductivity in the feed line varied between 600 and 750 μs cm over time while the conductivity in the cooling tower was maintained between 3000 and 3500 μs cm total organic carbon concentrations reached between 34 1 and 55 4 mg l in the cooling tower due to the concentration factor induced by the evaporation residual chlorine concentrations were the highest in location b and d reaching up to 0 42 and 0 41 mg cl2 l respectively due to the dosage of sodium hypochlorite at these locations lower values in c indicate a decay in residual chlorine along the distribution system chlorine concentrations in e and f were not quantified but were expected to contain similar concentration of residual chlorine as d as a result of the high water recirculation rate and continuous dosage ammonia concentration was not analysed in the cooling tower but the feed water supplier reported a low concentration in the incoming water between 0 005 and 0 05 mg l formation of monochloramine in the cooling water cannot be excluded but is assumed to have minor impact on the residual chlorine concentration measured the temperature was highly variable in the feed water gradually decreasing from 20 2 to 5 2 c during the sampling campaign from august to december 2017 on the contrary the cooling water temperature was kept between 15 and 25 c due to the continuous water recirculation through the heat exchangers the results from the icp ms analyses with the corresponding concentration factor are shown in table 2 the concentration factor varied between 3 5 0 1 and 6 6 0 2 3 2 bacterial cell number and atp measurements 3 2 1 spatial changes in the system flow cytometry was applied to measure the total and intact cell counts and atp measurements were performed to quantify the bacterial intracellular and extracellular atp concentrations in the water samples fig 2 shows the results of the analyses performed in september the results from the other months revealed the same trends despite some variations in absolute values the corresponding figures for all monthly samples are available in the supplementary materials figs s1 and s2 sodium hypochlorite was dosed at two locations in the system the first location was before distribution of the feed water to the cooling tower before sampling point b fig 1 the second location was in the basin of the cooling tower point d the intact cell counts and intracellular atp at the inlet of the feed line a were the highest from all samples with 0 4 1 5 x 106 cells ml fig 2a figs s1 and s2 and 80 700 pg atp ml respectively fig 2b figs s1 and s2 the intact cell counts then showed a strong decrease in the concentration range between sampling points a and b where the pre treatment steps and first naocl dosage were applied the reduction varied between 79 and 98 in intact cell count depending on the sampling month the intracellular atp measurements indicated a similar trend with a decrease of 85 98 between sampling points a and b in august and september an increase of 6 7 x 104 in intact cells per ml was measured along the distribution pipe between points b and c higher feed water temperature in this period of the year could have caused regrowth in the distribution line the opposite trend was observed in november and december with a loss of intact cells and intracellular atp no strong difference in the intact cell count and intracellular atp was noticeable between the feed water in point c and the cooling water in points d e and f despite continuous sodium hypochlorite dosage in the basin of the cooling tower the chlorine dosage did not neutralize all cells but it helped to prevent further increase in cell concentration considering the concentration factor table 2 and the water retention time of around 5 days in the system the 3 samples collected in the cooling tower d e and f showed comparable results for each sampling date although point e always exhibited a slightly higher microbial contents of 1 2 x 104 intact cells ml 3 2 2 evolution of atp per cell in time the atp data and intact cell counts were used to identify the spatial and temporal evolution in average atp per cell value the amount of intracellular atp per intact cell count was calculated for each sample and the average values for feed and cooling water samples were plotted in fig 3 together with the feed water temperature on each sampling day the feed water samples showed a strong decrease in atp per cell between august and november from 4 1 10 16 to 6 2 10 17 g atp cell and stabilised between november and december the feed water temperatures also decreased in this period from 20 2 to 5 2 c the amount of atp per intact cell inside the cooling tower was more stable over the observation period between 2 7 10 16 and 6 8 10 16 g atp cell the results suggest that i the average atp per cell in the cooling tower evolved independently from the average atp per cell in the feed water ii the feed water is more affected by the changes in environmental conditions than the cooling water the divergence between the intracellular atp per cell in the feed water and in the cooling tower water could be explained by the better controlled conditions in the cooling tower or by different bacterial communities populating the two sections of the system 3 3 taxonomic diversity and relative abundances the changes in bacterial composition in the feed and cooling water was monitored by 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing the impact of the cooling tower conditions and the continuous chlorine dosage on the microbiome were evaluated the relative abundances of potentially pathogenic genera are available in the supplementary materials table s3 the legionella genus represented only 0 28 of the total number of reads from all samples and did not show an increase in relative abundance between the feed and the cooling tower the bacterial community in the feed water was dominated by sar clade 37 19 and frankiales 16 8 orders fig 4 a and figs s3 s5 from the phyla proteobacteria and actinobacteria respectively only the sample from october diverged by a strong increase in sphingomonadales after the pre treatment steps b of 20 fig s4 a less abundant but recurrent bacterial order was betaproteobacteriales 6 3 sar clade and frankiales abundances dramatically dropped in the cooling tower 2 2 the main taxonomic orders common to all cooling tower samples locations d e and f were caulobacterales 28 12 and obscuribacterales 18 8 followed by rhizobiales 6 2 spingomonadales 6 5 and betaproteobacteriales 5 2 the venn diagrams shown on fig 4b and figs s3 s5 indicate that the taxa shared between the feed water c and the basin of the cooling tower d accounted for 85 94 of the total sequences depending on the month in addition the cooling tower shows less diversity than the feed water with a lower number of taxa hence despite the strong switch observed in relative abundance of microorganisms the cooling tower main bacterial members were already present in the feed when comparing all collected samples only 0 2 of the total number of otus 33 otus were shared between all locations over the 5 months however the 33 shared otus accounted for 46 of the total sequence reads these common taxa representing a large fraction of the total sequences constitutes the core microbiome of our system principal coordinates analysis fig 5 shows the phylogenetic relatedness between communities of all samples based on the generated otus illustrating the changes in bacterial community structures in time and at the different locations the clusters represented with plain and dotted circles reveal structural divergence between the feed and the cooling water samples for each month greater distances are observable between the feed water and cooling tower samples than between the 3 samples from each section in addition the feed water samples clustered more closely than cooling water samples the outlier observed in august and corresponding to the basin sample location d shows strong similarities with the feed water structure suggesting that the feed water valve was open at the time of the sampling in the same figure the monthly clusters formed by the feed water samples do not seem to converge suggesting temporal variations in bacterial community structure in the water source upstream from the studied system the chart with letters corresponding to each location is available in supplementary materials fig s6 to summarize the sequencing results suggest that the cooling tower bacterial composition is continuously determined by the feed water microbiome but is further shaped by the process conditions 3 4 growth and decay of bacterial orders in the cooling tower the strong change in relative abundance of the main bacterial members between the feed water and the cooling tower may be due to differential growth or differential decay of the feed water community members when accessing the basin of the cooling system the sequencing data refers to all intracellular dna both from viable and non viable bacteria to estimate which community members show a net growth or decay the relative abundances were combined with the total cell counts in a mass balance based equation described in section 2 5 a similar approach has been implemented in the past with flocculent sludge and anaerobic digestion systems mei et al 2016 saunders et al 2015 winkler et al 2012 the taxonomic rank order was chosen for visualization of the changes in microbiome and identify trends over the sampling period as no specific functionalities were investigated the results presented in fig 6 show the growth and decay of taxonomic orders in relative fig 6a and absolute numbers fig 6b the data indicates that the majority of the bacterial groups are decaying with less than 10 remaining cells less than 2 for the frankiales and sar11 clade among the dominating organisms from the feed water and the cooling water only the taxonomic order obscuribacterales showed considerable and recurrent increase in the cooling tower microbiome 260 95 fig 6a corresponding to an absolute increase of 104 to 105 cells ml fig 6b depending on the month the strong increase in 2 main otus within the obscuribacterales order were causing this rise caulobacterales 48 30 showed a slower decay than rhizobiales 9 3 and sphingomonadales 8 7 a further look at the most abundant otus of these main taxonomic orders revealed that all main genera contributed to the decay of the orders the doi of the raw sequencing data is indicated in supplementary materials quantification of the changes in microbial structures suggest different decay rates and adaptability of individual bacterial groups under continuous chlorine dosage in the recirculating cooling water from 0 35 to 0 41 mg cl2 l table 2 only the obscuribacterales order was able to significantly increase in cell number in the cooling tower despite the high residual chlorine content of the water the absolute increase in cells taking into account the impact of the concentration factor could only be determined by the use of our mass balance based approach combining flow cytometry and sequencing data 4 discussion 4 1 commonly applied residual chlorine concentration does not allow complete inactivation of cooling tower bacteria the use of surface water as feed water for cooling tower operation requires a powerful biofouling inhibitor to avoid pathogen outbreaks and biofilm formation the high bactericidal efficiency and competitive cost of sodium hypochlorite makes it the most common inhibitor in cooling processes frayne 1999 chlorine dosage in the studied cooling water system i reduced by up to 98 the active bacterial biomass concentration in water when dosed in the feed line fig 2 with a negligible impact on the relative abundance of the microbial community members in the surface water feeding the cooling tower figs 4a and 5 ii limited the bacterial growth in the cooling tower water caused by the increase in nutrient content table s1 and 5 day retention time fig 2 continuous dosage of biocide prevented the growth of pathogenic bacteria including legionella however it was not effective to entirely inactivate the bacterial cells in the water even at residual chlorine concentrations up to 0 4 mg cl2 l resistance of some specific organisms to relatively high residual chlorine concentration 0 6 mg cl2 l has been recently described song et al 2019 sun et al 2013 and previous studies on cooling tower reported that a continuous free chlorine residual of 1 mg cl2 l was optimal to achieve recommended biological control criteria 104 cfu ml with naocl chien et al 2013 helmi et al 2018 however concentrations higher than 0 5 mg cl2 l is usually not a feasible option due to the corrosiveness of the chemical side reaction with other inhibitors and formation of disinfection by products boulay and edwards 2001 hsieh et al 2010 padhi et al 2019 the high total organic carbon concentration in the cooling tower up to 55 mg l may have led to the reaction of organic matter with the sodium hypochlorite dosed in the basin as an additional point the quantification of intact cells at different locations in the cooling tower indicated a higher concentration of viable cells after the heat exchanger suggesting cell growth or release from biofilms in that section of the process the sampling location is therefore of importance for evaluating the microbiome of a cooling tower in the studied cooling tower 16s results showed low abundance of potentially pathogenic genus table s3 however the observation that the chlorine dosage does not completely prevent microbial growth in the heat exchanger could be a concern for other cooling towers since the water from the outlet of the heat exchanger line is sprayed on top of the column this is also the point where pathogens might be spread in the surroundings to reduce the risks of outbreak chlorine dosage could be performed right before the spray nozzles instead of inside the cooling tower basin 4 2 main cooling tower bacterial members originated from the feed water microbiome but the process conditions further influenced the bacterial community structure a substantial core microbiome was shared between all collected samples 46 of the total sequence reads was contained in 33 otus the shared taxa between the feed water and the cooling tower basin water on each month accounted for 85 94 of the sequences fig 4b supporting the idea that the planktonic population present in the cooling tower originated mainly from the feed water the remaining fraction of microorganisms could have originated from different sources such as the ambient air and particles precipitations or biofilm growth rain and cloud waters can contain up to 106 bacterial cells ml hu et al 2018 and the air to water ratio can reach up to 1 5 m3 l in a cooling tower keshtkar 2017 potentially affecting the water community composition of these open recirculating systems although the main cooling tower bacterial members originated from the feed water a strong switch in relative abundance of the microbial community members was observed including a change of the dominant microorganisms figs 4a and 5 main taxonomic orders for the feed water ld12 subclade of sar 11 alphaproteobacteria and hgcl subclade of frankiales actinobacteria are common groups described in freshwater reservoirs and brackish waters henson et al 2018 llirós et al 2014 salcher et al 2011 but not recurrent in cooling towers cooling water bacterial communities on the contrary were dominated by the recurrent orders obscuribacterales melainabacteria and caulobacterales alphaproteobacteria followed by sphingomonadales and rhizobiales alphaproteobacteria a decrease of actinobacteria and rise of proteobacteria have been previously observed in cooling water paranjape et al 2019 corresponding to our findings with the strong decline in frankiales and suggesting a high sensitivity of these organisms to the changes in environmental conditions this shift in relative abundance can be linked to several environmental factors the main one being continuous disinfection continuous chlorine dosage affects bacterial community structure depending on the tolerance of the bacterial species to the biocide or their presence in protective biofilms even though no deposit was visible in the cooling tower basin caulobacterales sphingomonadales and rhizobiales are bacterial orders frequently encountered in biofilms farenhorst et al 2017 pang and liu 2007 and post disinfection samples gomez alvarez et al 2012 shaw et al 2015 of drinking water distribution systems the observed caulobacterales family hyphomonadaceae is known as prosthecate bacteria producing polysaccharide based adhesin called holdfast allowing surface colonization abraham and rohde 2014 dang and lovell 2015 nagaraj et al 2017 some sphingomonas species have also been linked to biofilm initiation through production of water soluble polysaccharides and surface adhesion proteins bereschenko et al 2011 pollock and armentrout 1999 or have shown higher chlorine tolerance sun et al 2013 wang et al 2019 both leading to deteriorations of membrane processes bereschenko et al 2010 de vries et al 2019 to a lesser extent chlorine resistance properties of the rhizobiales order have been discussed in a drinking water distribution system wang et al 2018 the biofilms located on the inner surfaces of these systems constitutes the main reservoirs for bacterial regrowth berry et al 2006 a recent study also reported the presence of these community members in cooling tower biofilms di gregorio et al 2017 suggesting that detached biofilm fragments likely influence cooling water bacterial composition chlorine disinfection can also explain the lower diversity in otus encountered in the cooling tower water compared to the feed water fig 4b and figs s3 s5 to summarize most cooling tower community members originated from the feed water microbiome but the process conditions further influenced the bacterial community structure 4 3 cooling tower community structure is mainly shaped by differences in decay rate of populations caused by residual chlorine since 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing does not differentiate between live dormant and damaged cells li et al 2017 the association of relative abundance with total cell count can help quantify the abundance of bacterial groups and identify growth or decay of specific taxonomic orders combination of flow cytometry with 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing has previously been investigated for drinking water monitoring prest et al 2014 and showed to be a promising method for quantification of bacterial communities in water systems we applied the same method in this study combined with a mass balance to assess the impact of chlorine dosage on each bacterial order composing the cooling tower section 2 5 to our knowledge this is the first paper that describes net growth and decay of cooling tower microorganisms based on our results all dominant feed and cooling water microorganisms showed strong net decay with exception of the obscuribacterales order in the case of caulobacterales sphingomonadales and rhizobiales the high relative abundance in the cooling tower resulted from a slower decay compared to the other microbial community members importantly the potentially pathogenic bacterial group legionella showed negligible abundance in all samples table s3 and demonstrated decay in the studied cooling tower indicating that risks of outbreak were prevented a control study without disinfection would be able to confirm that chlorine is causing these microbial community changes but operation of a full scale cooling tower without biocide dosage is not feasible due to the threat of pathogenic bacteria we can conclude from our study that the decay rate of the different bacterial orders is the main factor shaping the cooling water microbiome not bacterial growth potential this finding implies that the feed water acts as a continuous inoculant highly impacting the cooling tower populations when chlorine is used for disinfection the importance of the feed water composition has been observed by studying the similarities in bacterial members between multiple cooling towers based on their geographic locations paranjape et al 2019 but has never been thoroughly investigated 4 4 the bacterial group obscuribacterales succeeded in growing in the presence of residual chlorine as indicated previously the only microorganism group showing a net growth in the cooling tower was the order obscuribacterales obscuribacterales belong to the phylum melainabacteria a recently discovered phylum closely related to the cyanobacteria but consisting of non photosynthetic members bruno et al 2018 di rienzi et al 2013 although described as a strictly fermentative bacterial phylum a newly identified species has been shown to possess the ability for fermentation as well as aerobic and anaerobic respiration with complete respiratory chain soo et al 2014 to our knowledge the order obscuribacterales has been rarely observed in engineered water systems and never described in biofilms it has however been identified in other cooling tower studies by pereira et al 2017 and paranjape et al 2019 in the latter obscuribacterales was present in 7 out of 18 evaporative cooling towers and represented a substantive portion of the total bacterial community between 10 and 30 relative abundance in 2 of them daily and continuous disinfections were applied and residual chlorine concentrations of 0 32 and 0 27 mg cl2 l were reached in these 2 systems those results are in line with our finding and would suggest that dominance of obscuribacterales is favoured by the presence of continuous high residual dosage however the explanation for the chlorine resistance is so far unknown due to the lack of information available on the microorganisms and biocide s mechanism chlorine disinfection does not require specific target sites to exert a cytotoxic effect higher resistance of cells to chlorine is believed to result from reduced cell membrane permeability or formation of a mucopolysaccharide outer layer bower and daeschel 1999 further characterization would therefore be necessary to understand the metabolism and physiology of the bacteria in order to avoid chlorine resistant organisms to develop a complementary disinfection method could be considered depending on the resistance mechanism such as uv or quaternary ammonium compounds phe et al 2009 sun et al 2013 rahmani et al 2016 in addition to cell resistance the formation of cell aggregates can also provide protection against external stress factors including biocides mir et al 1997 aggregates have not been observed during the study but their presence should not be excluded 4 5 the described mass balance approach allows better characterization of cooling water bacterial changes the use of a mass balance in combination with flow cytometry and sequencing data provided a higher level of understanding of the bacterial dynamics full scale studies often omit to describe the feed water bacterial composition which is essential information when discussing bacterial changes in chlorinated cooling water systems ignoring the feed water microbiome can lead to data misinterpretation e g by assuming that all main cooling water taxa became accustomed to the process conditions and disinfection in this study we included the feed water composition to identify the factors shaping the bacterial communities in the cooling tower the studied cooling tower did not show an increase of potentially pathogenic bacterial groups table s3 however the method would be able to detect an outbreak specifically if legionella continuously shows net growth this would indicate the necessity of implementing alternative disinfection methods in addition approximation of the net growth or net decay of microorganisms is highly valuable to detect chlorine resistant microorganisms with this approach we could prove that the increase in obscuribacterales was not only relative to the other communities nor due to the effect of concentration in the cooling tower but resulted from the absolute growth of this microorganism group in the system containing residual chlorine application of this method to a large cooling tower dataset can identify recurrent and growing bacterial groups and help further optimisation and evaluation of disinfection technique limitations are however present when quantifying absolute abundances based on genomic analyses kleiner et al 2017 specifically regarding the limited resolution poretsky et al 2014 of the method and taxonomic profiling sczyrba et al 2017 the real net growth and net decay can therefore show some deviations from the calculated values improvements can be made in the future by i taking into account copy numbers in the mass balance when the organisms are better identified and ii sampling and analysing the cooling tower surface to identify attached microbial communities and assess the potential impact on the microbial dynamics 5 conclusions the microbiome characterization of a full scale industrial cooling tower 2600 m3 h with residual chlorine between 0 35 and 0 41 mg cl2 l and concentration factor between 3 5 and 6 6 and comparison of bacterial community structures between the water feeding the cooling tower and the cooling tower water led to the following conclusions the bacterial community composition in the cooling tower is driven by the feed water community composition however the structure of the bacterial community is governed by differences in decay rate of the bacterial groups in presence of residual chlorine the characterization of feed water bacterial composition is therefore of great importance when studying microbiome dynamics in cooling towers the taxonomic order obscuribacterales was able to grow in the cooling system despite the presence of up to 0 41 mg cl2 l residual chlorine suggesting potential chlorine resistance ability of this bacterial group this taxonomic order is not commonly found in biofilms as opposed to the other dominant organisms found in the cooling water but has been previously observed in cooling tower studies in presence of residual chlorine the proposed approach based on mass balance combining flow cytometry and 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing is a useful tool to determine net growth and decay of microorganisms and to assess biocide impacts on cooling tower communities this study points out the importance of full scale data for identification of organisms with higher ability to survive disinfection the establishment of a database from industrial scale cooling towers would contribute to determine recurrence of specific organisms in these processes a better understanding of the biological processes and microbiome changes could be used to predict and

18157,the effects of aeration and stirring systems on the physical properties of sludge were analyzed using a computational fluid dynamics cfd model the aims of this study were to 1 compare the effects of aeration and stirring on sludge properties using the same turbulent mixing intensity and 2 to reveal the relationship between sludge properties and hydrodynamic indicators to determine how hydrodynamic conditions influence sludge flocculation mixing experiments with stirring and aeration were carried out in 2 l beakers with the average velocity gradient g set to 90 190 or 280 s 1 the sludge flocculation performance zeta potential and gibbs free energy δg were analyzed and the flow velocity turbulence energy turbulence dissipation rate and kolmogorov microscale were calculated as hydrodynamic parameters the average flow velocity and the turbulence dissipation rate were obviously higher in the stirring system than in the aeration system at the same g however the turbulence energy and kolmogorov microscale in the aeration system were much higher than those in the stirring system both the zeta potential and δg were lower in the aeration system than the stirring system the zeta potential and δg results for the two systems suggest that aeration is more beneficial for sludge flocculation than stirring even though the sludge flocculation performance f f 0 in the stirring and aeration systems showed no obvious differences significant relationships between hydrodynamic parameters calculated based on the cfd model and average values of sludge properties in the stable

performance of activated sludge greatly affects the sludge sedimentation process sludge and water separation process and effluent quality it is a key indicator for controlling the activated sludge process li and yang 2007 subramanian et al 2008 the factors affecting the flocculation performance of sludge are complex in terms of the sludge itself the floc size morphology zeta potential and pro hydrophobic surface properties are important the shearing action of hydrodynamics in the reactor directly affects the size and shape of the sludge floc and thus affects the sedimentation performance jin and lant 2004 feng et al 2019 furthermore the mixing effect of turbulence also affects the growth of microorganisms which determines the production and composition of microbial extracellular polymers eps and affects the physical and chemical properties of sludge such as the zeta potential and pro hydrophobic surface properties mikkelsen 2001 hence the sludge flocculation performance is affected indirectly by hydrodynamics therefore an understanding of the influence of reactor hydrodynamic characteristics on sludge flocculation performance and surface characteristics is crucial for design and regulation of the activated sludge process some researchers have studied the effects of aeration intensity and stirring speed on sludge floc size eps content and composition adav et al 2007 chachuat et al 2005 wilén et al 2000 however because of differences in the reactors the turbulence intensity can vary even with the same aeration intensity or agitation speed and the results are not comparable to solve this problem the camp and stein s velocity gradient g and hydraulic retention time hrt which are easy to be calculated have been used to evaluate hydrodynamic intensity das et al 1993 patziger et al 2016 bouyer et al 2004 calculated g values and used them to analyze the sludge floc size distribution under different hydrodynamics in a mixing tank their results showed that the mean floc diameter decreased from 500 μm to 50 μm when the g increased from 5 s 1 300 s 1 spicer et al 1998 demonstrated that sludge flocs grew when g was 50 s 1 but fragmented when g was 100 300 or 500 s 1 wu et al 2009 found that neither strong g 12 s 1 nor gentle shear g 0 04 s 1 conditions promoted floc growth the critical g value varied dramatically among these studies because of scale effects with different processes yielding the same g values similarly patziger et al 2016 pointed out that the removal rate of different primary settling tanks showed a strongly fluctuating pattern even in the same range of the hrt thus it is necessary to carry out more detailed evaluations of hydrodynamic conditions in recent years computational fluid dynamics cfd models have been used frequently to calculate turbulent mixing and mass transport in activated sludge systems karpinska and bridgeman 2015 patziger et al 2012 patziger 2016 this method uses a three dimensional model to calculate several hydrodynamic indicators including the flow velocity turbulence energy turbulence dissipation rate and kolmogorov microscale kolmogorov length scale eddies at this scale are expected to be driven mainly by the energy cascade from larger scales bouyer et al 2001 found that floc size decreased when the average flow velocity in a jar test vessel increased from 3 8 to 12 5 cm s 1 feng et al 2010 analyzed the relationship between the turbulence dissipation rate and sludge volume index and found that the sludge volume index first decreased when the turbulence dissipation rate increased from 0 25 to 2 5 10 3 m2 s 3 and then increased beyond this research few studies have evaluated the relationship between sludge properties and hydrodynamic indicators the lack of knowledge in this area limits the understanding of the influence of hydrodynamic conditions on sludge flocculation spicer et al 1996 found that the impeller type also affected the floc size when the g value was constant furthermore turbulence in an activated sludge system is usually produced by an aeration or stirring system however there has been little research on the effects of aeration and stirring on sludge properties under the same turbulent mixing intensity an understanding of the effects of aeration and stirring could be used to increase the treatment efficiency by adjusting hydrodynamic conditions in the current study the effects on sludge physical properties in aeration and stirring system were analyzed using a cfd model the aims of this study were to 1 compare the effects of aeration and stirring at the same the turbulent mixing intensity on the sludge properties and 2 to reveal the relationship between sludge properties and hydrodynamic indicators calculated by the cfd model to determine the influence of hydrodynamic conditions on sludge flocculation 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design the mixing experiments were carried out in a 2 l beaker with stirring or aeration a rushton turbine impeller with 2 flat blades was used in the stirring experiment as well as the cfd model while a cylindrical aerator was used for the aeration experiment the dimension parameters of the container and device were shown in fig 1 sludge for inoculation was collected from a sewage treatment plant in the jiangning district nanjing china the sludge was rinsed three times before inoculation to remove adsorbed nutrients and organic matter a simulated municipal wastewater sample was prepared with the following composition 404 mg l 1 ch3coona 120 mg l 1 nh4cl 24 mg l 1

experiments were carried at stirring speeds of 125 240 and 320 rad min 1 and at aeration intensities of 30 170 and 360 l h 1 in the second group the sludge concentration was set at 1000 2000 or 3000 mg l 1 the mixing speed was 240 rad min 1 and the aeration intensity was 170 l h 1 each experiment was carried out for 6 h and the sludge properties were analyzed at 5 20 50 80 120 160 and 180 min the temperature was controlled as 20 0 5 c during all runs 2 2 cfd methods 2 2 1 cfd modelling of multi phase flow for stirring reactor based on the assumption that the flocs were mixed well in the water column and the concentration of flocs was low liquid and solid phase were simplified as an integral homogeneous liquid system vof model was used to simulate the hydrodynamic characteristics the tracking of the interfaces between different phases was accomplished by the solution of a continuity equation for the volume fraction of one phase 1 t α q ρ q α q ρ q ν q s α q p 1 n m p q m q p where ρ q is the density the term α q ρ q represents the effective density of the phase q ν q denotes its velocity m q p is the mass transfer from phase q to phase p m p q is the mass transfer from phase p

cfd simulation of multiphase flow in the reactor was performed using fluent 6 3 software ansys canonsburg pa with the euler euler approach the geometry for all simulation was three dimensional however only hydrodynamic characteristics on the axial plane were illustrated in the current study due to the axisymmetric property of the spatial distribution of the flow fields also for clearer presentation in the stirred reactors the volume of the fluid model was adopted to simulate the flow pattern and track the interfaces between the phases and a mixture model was applied for hydrodynamic simulation of the aeration reactor the viscosity of the mixture at varying sludge concentrations was calculated according to guibaud et al 2004 and the value was 1 078 1 106 and 1 150 10 3 pa s when the concentration was 1000 2000 and 3000 mg l 1 respectively the grid mesh was generated using gambit 2 4 6 the final mesh contained 222 956 unstructured grid elements in the stirred reactor while 86 802 structured grid meshes were built for the simulation in the aeration reactor the rotation of the impeller in stirred reactor was modeled with the moving reference frame technique the moving reference frame domain was assigned a rotational speed of 125 240 or 320 rad min 1 which was the same as that in the experiment the top surface was modeled as a wall with a zero shear boundary condition the boundary condition at the walls and bottom surface in the stirred reactor was defined as no slip boundary and the roughness constant is 0 5 the aerator was simplified as a small sparger the gas injection boundary condition was defined as an inlet velocity to give specific air flow rates of 30 170 and 360 l h 1 and the velocity of the air inlet is 0 0208 m s 1 the no slip condition was used for the liquid and gas phases at the reactor walls the outlet boundary pressure condition was set as 1 atm the g was used to characterize the differences in hydrodynamic conditions between the reactors and was calculated as follows according to das et al 1993 13 for stirring reactors g p v μ 14 for aeration reactors g q a γ h v μ where p is the energy power during the stirring process w μ is the dynamic viscosity pa s v is the volume of the mixture m3 q a is the airflow rate m3 s 1 γ is the liquid specific weight n m 3 and h m is the aeration depth in stirring reactor p was determined as follows according to hsu 2000 15 p 14 35 f d 4 38 n 2 69 ρ 0 69 μ 0 31 where d is the diameter of impeller m n is the stirring speed rad s 1 ρ is the density of liquor kg m 3 f is modified

diameter m 2 3 cfd model validation time averaged liquid velocity fields obtained through simulation were compared to measured data using particle image velocimetry piv technology flow fields from our simulation generally fit with piv measurement figs s4 s11 in the supplemental materials part i which confirmed that cfd model was a reasonable predictive tool for to reflect an overall hydrodynamic condition 2 4 analysis method flocculation ability batch tests were performed according to the method of wilén et al 2003 first 80 ml of sludge was placed in a beaker on ice and then ultrasonicated for 15 s at 50 w next 10 ml of the sludge sample was withdrawn from the beaker and centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 2 min the optical density of the supernatant was measured at 650 nm using a spectrophotometer uv 1900 shimadzu kyoto japan to obtain value a for eq 19 then the rest of sonicated suspended sludge was gently mixed for 15 min at room temperature this sludge sample was treated and measured using the spectrophotometer as described above to obtain value b for eq 19 the flocculation ability was then calculated as follows 19 f 1 a b 100 a diversity factor if eq 20 was used to evaluate the difference in the sludge flocculation ability under different hydrodynamic conditions 20 i f f f 0 100 where f 0 is the sludge flocculation ability at the beginning of the experiment and f is the sludge flocculation ability obtained under the studied hydrodynamic conditions the zeta potential was measured with a zeta potential meter nano zetasizer malvern uk according to the method of liu et al 2008 the hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of the activated sludge was calculated from the contact angle the contact angle was measured using a three liquid method and a contact angle measuring instrument the specific operation was as follows a certain amount of activated sludge was suction filtered onto a 0 45 μm acetate fiber membrane washed twice with double distilled water and then placed on a 1 agar plate to keep it moist before the measurement the filter membrane was placed on a glass slide and dried for 10 min then the slide was placed on a static drop platform and water formamide and 1 bromonaphthalene were successively dropped onto the filter membrane the shape of each droplet was immediately captured by ccd finally the sludge contact angle was calculated by the software each type of liquid was measured at least 8 to 10 times and the results were averaged usually the surface free energy of sludge or liquid consists of non polar γ l w and polar γ a b components as follows 21 γ b γ b l w γ b a b 22 γ l γ l l w γ l a b the surface contact angle of the sludge measured as a liquid is expressed as follows 23 1 cos θ γ l 2 γ b l w γ l l w γ b γ l γ b γ l where θ is the contact angle between the activated sludge b and the liquid l γ and γ are the electron acceptor and the electron donor in the polar component respectively and γ a b 2 γ γ distilled water 1 bromonaphthalene and formamide were used as the liquids for measuring the contact angle in the three liquid method the surface free energies and the values of the respective active components of the three liquids are listed in table 1 according to thermodynamic principles if an adsorption process can reduce the free energy of a system the process can be carried out spontaneously that is the adsorption process will be relatively dominant in the process of adsorbing primary particles or bacteria in a medium the change in adsorption free energy per unit area δ g a d h can be calculated as follows 24 δ g a d h γ b s γ b l γ s l where γ b s γ b l and γ s l are the surface free energies between sludge solids sludge liquid and solids liquid respectively in this study we assumed that adsorption occurred only between two identical bacteria such as sludge flocs adsorbing elementary particles therefore the above formula could be simplified using γ b s 0 and γ b l γ s l as follows 25 δ g a d h 2 γ b l 26 γ b l γ b l l w γ b l a b 27 γ b l l w γ b l w γ l l w 2 28 γ b l a b 2 γ b γ b γ l γ l γ b γ l γ b γ l 2 5 data analysis the relationships between sludge performance and hydrodynamic parameters were analyzed by pearson correlation analysis using spss 10 0 levels were considered significant at p 0 01 or 0 05 3 results 3 1 distribution of turbulence parameters steady state flow velocity under the three stirring speeds and three aeration intensities at a sludge concentration of 2000 mg l 1 are shown in fig 2 the flow velocity was highest on the side of the blade and decreased gradually from the blade to the inner wall of the beaker in the aeration system a high flow velocity region was found in the center of the beaker and the flow velocity then decreased out to the sides regions with very low flow velocities were found near the beaker wall as the stirring speed increased the flow velocity in the beaker increased but the blue areas above and below the blade decreased as the aeration intensity increased the flow velocity in the beaker also increased the highest turbulence energy was found in the middle of the reactor and upper vicinity of the blades in the stirring system fig 3 the turbulence energy passed around and decreased near the beaker walls in the aeration system a large zone of high turbulence energy formed in the middle and upper parts of the reactor and low turbulence regions were found on the wall surface and the top of the aeration head as the stirring speed increased in the stirring system the turbulence energy in the bulk increased and the area with high turbulence energy also increased in the vicinity of the impeller in addition the low turbulence energy region on the wall surface decreased in the aeration system the size of the high turbulence energy zone in the middle and upper parts of the reactor increased with increasing aeration intensity in the stirring system the turbulence dissipation rate was more concentrated than the turbulence energy the highest turbulence energy was found in a small m style area around the blade fig 4 the turbulence dissipation rate was evenly distributed in other regions of the reactor the size of the m style area and lowest turbulence dissipation rate increased with increasing stirring speed fig 4 in the aeration system a region of high turbulence dissipation formed in the middle and upper parts of the reactor which basically coincided with the region of high turbulence energy the integral turbulence dissipation rate in the aeration system increased with an increase in the aeration intensity the distribution of the kolmogorov microscale was opposite those of the turbulence energy and turbulence dissipation rate in the stirring system the lowest kolmogorov microscale values were found in the middle and upper parts around the blade fig 5 this area decreased with increasing stirring speed in the aeration system the kolmogorov microscale was highest in the bottom corner of the reactor and decreased toward the middle of the reactor the calculated distributions of flow velocity turbulence energy turbulence dissipation rate and kolmogorov microscale in both the stirring and aeration systems with various sludge concentrations are shown in the supplementary materials part ii figs s12 s15 the sludge concentration had little influence on the distribution of hydrodynamic parameters 3 2 average turbulence parameters the average turbulence parameters based on performed numerical simulations are listed in tables 2 and 3 the g in both the stirring and aeration systems were 90 190 and 280 s 1 reynolds number ranged from 10100 to 25856 in the stirring system but ranged from 1352 to 13958 in the aeration system the turbulence dissipation rate in the stirring system ranged from 7 07 10 3 to 1 08 10 1 m2 s 3 and that in the aeration system ranged from 3 93 10 3 to 5 07 102 m2 s 3 when the sludge concentration was 2000 mg l 1 the flow velocity turbulence energy and turbulence dissipation rate increased along with increases in both the stirring speed and aeration intensity but the kolmogorov microscale decreased the average flow velocity or turbulence dissipation rate at various sludge concentration in the current study was almost similar because there was no order of magnitude difference in concentrations however in the aeration system a sludge concentration of 2000 mg l 1 gave a higher turbulence energy than concentrations of 1000 and 3000 mg l 1 the kolmogorov microscale showed the opposite trend 3 3 flocculation performance the f f 0 value increased dramatically during the first 50 min then decreased slowly and tended to be stable in the last 60 min fig 6 at the end of the experiment the f f 0 value in the stirring system increased from 1 020 to 1 030 when the stirring speed increased from 125 to 320 rpm in the aeration system the f f 0 increased from 1 020 to 1 032 when the aeration intensity increased from 30 to 360 l h 1 the f f 0 value decreased along with increases in the sludge concentration in the second group of experiments in both systems 3 4 surface properties the zeta potential fluctuated obviously during the first 80 min and then stabilized fig 7 at the end of the experiment the zeta potential increased as the turbulence intensity decreased in both systems the sludge concentration had a negative effect on the zeta potential additionally the zeta potentials in the aeration system range 23 8 to 21 7 mv were obviously higher than those in the stirring system range 29 4 to 28 4 mv the δg also tended to be stable in the last 60 min fig 8 at a sludge concentration of 2000 mg l 1 the δg increased from 12 8 to 6 2 kj mol 1 when the stirring speed increased from 125 to 320 rpm in the aeration system the δg increased from 4 0 to 13 8 kj mol 1 when the aeration intensity increased from 30 to 360 l h 1 therefore the sludge concentration had a negative effect on δg 3 5 relationship between hydrodynamics parameters and sludge properties the relationship between hydrodynamic parameters calculated based on the cfd model and average values of sludge properties in the stable phase was shown in fig 9 the flocculation performance parameter f f 0 had a negative relationship with g the flow velocity the turbulence energy and the turbulence dissipation rate but had a positive relationship with the kolmogorov microscale fig 9 only the relationship between f f 0 and the kolmogorov microscale was significant in both the stirring and aeration systems and the integrated results of the two systems the trends of the relationships between the zeta potential and most of the hydrodynamic parameters in the stirring and aeration systems were completely separate except for the average flow velocity a negative exponential relationship between the zeta potential and average flow velocity was found in the integrated results of the two systems a significant linear relationship between g and δg was found in both the stirring and aeration systems but the two trend lines were far apart and the relationship between g and δg in the integrated results of the two systems was not significant however the relationship between δg and the turbulence kinetic energy was significant in both the stirring and aeration systems and the integrated results of the two systems 4 discussion in the current study the g of stirring and aeration systems were adjusted to the same value 90 190 and 280 s 1 with the same g the average flow velocity and the turbulence dissipation rate were obviously higher in the stirring system than in the aeration system however the turbulence energy and kolmogorov microscale in the aeration system were much higher than those in the stirring system these results indicate that stirring induces a high speed flow field and higher strength shear rate than aeration at the same g the fact that the turbulence energy in the aeration system was higher than that in the stirring system suggests that the flow field is more evenly distributed in the stirring system the flow velocity and turbulence intensity were higher in the area around the blade and lower in the area near the beaker wall and under the blade by contrast in the aeration system turbulence intensity was high in the middle and upper part of the reactor in other words the hydrodynamic parameters are more evenly distributed in aeration systems than stirring systems similarly jin and lant 2004 found that the hydrodynamic parameters in activated sludge bubble column air lift and aerated stirred reactors varied greatly our results also showed that the sludge concentration had little influence on the distribution of hydrodynamic parameters in both systems although different processes can yield the same g values few studies have compared hydrodynamic parameters in different reactors at the same g bouyer et al 2001 calculated the g and average flow velocity as 33 s 1 and 0 078 m s 1 respectively in a stirring system when the stirring speed was 150 rpm our lowest stirring speed 125 rpm produced a g of 90 s 1 and an average flow velocity of 0 148 m s 1 in previous studies g of 200 s 1 and 195 s 1 produced turbulence dissipation rates of 4 0 10 2 m2 s 3 bouyer et al 2004 and 3 8 10 2 m2 s 3 coufort et al 2005 respectively these previous results are smaller than the 4 7 10 2 m2 s 3 obtained with a g of 190 s 1 in the current study all the above results show that the same g can produce different hydrodynamic parameters in different reactors additionally spicer et al 1996 reported that sludge floc size varied dramatically when the sludge was treated with various impellers at the same g which suggested that the impeller type affected the hydrodynamic parameters when the g was constant at the same g the sludge flocculation performance f f 0 in the stirring and aeration systems showed no obvious differences however both the zeta potential and δg were lower in the aeration system than in the stirring system one possible reason for this was that the turbulence intensity flow velocity and turbulence dissipation rate in the aeration system was lower than that in the stirring system at the same g within the range of turbulence intensity in the current study decreasing turbulence intensity promoted aggregation of sludge and increased flocculation performance another reason could be that the aeration system had a higher concentration of dissolved oxygen than the stirring system which would affect eps production of activated sludge liao et al 2011 this deduction is supported by the research of adav et al 2007 who found that a low aeration intensity 60 l h 1 induced formation of sludge aggregates the zeta potential and δg results for these two systems indicate that aeration systems are more beneficial for sludge flocculation than stirring systems even though the sludge flocculation performance f f 0 in the stirring and aeration systems showed no obvious differences significant relationships between the sludge properties and hydrodynamic parameters suggested that the kolmogorov microscale average flow velocity and turbulence energy were appropriate hydrodynamic parameters for evaluating the flocculation performance f f 0 zeta potential and δg the results also suggested that the microcosmic hydrodynamic parameters were better than macroscopic hydraulics parameters such as g a negative relationship between the flocculation performance f f 0 and kolmogorov microscale indicated that a larger kolmogorov microscale favored sludge flocculation in our experimental systems when the kolmogorov microscale is much larger than the floc size the sludge floc will move with the flow by contrast when the kolmogorov microscale is much smaller than the floc size the floc will be disaggregated by the shear force when the kolmogorov microscale is similar to the floc size collision coagulation of the sludge flocs will increase and there will be little disaggregation by shear force thus we deduced that the floc size must be similar to the kolmogorov microscale in a stable mixing system this has been proven by feng et al 2019 additionally li et al 2018 demonstrated that the aggregate size of the cyanobacterium microcystis ichthyoblabe was similar to the kolmogorov microscale when the aggregates were treated with turbulent mixing for 30 min this result also supports the above deduction the negative relationship also indicated that the turbulence intensity in the current study was so large that sludge flocs would disaggregate when the turbulence intensity increased according to the dlvo theory van der waals attraction and electrostatic repulsion among particles are important factors affecting the flocculation of activated sludge systems as the electrostatic repulsion increases the stability of the system decreases and flocculation occurs the aggregated flocs are sensitive to environmental changes including shearing therefore the zeta potential plays a key role in sludge flocculation the zeta potential of activated sludge is affected by the eps composition and content and environmental factors e g shearing and ph the eps contains carboxyl groups hydroxyl groups phosphoric acid groups and sulfonic acid groups which make the surface of the floc negatively charged nouha et al 2017 wang et al 2012 and generates electrostatic repulsion among the sludge flocs the presence of shearing either reduces the lb eps content or stimulates its secretion which increases or decreases the zeta potential however if the shearing force is too large the sludge flocs will break and internal charges will be exposed resulting in a decrease in the zeta potential our results showed that the zeta potential had a negative relationship with the average flow velocity fig 9 compared with other hydrodynamic parameters such as the turbulence energy turbulence dissipation rate and kolmogorov microscale the average flow velocity could be used to assess the process that moved the flocs the other parameters could be used to assess the turbulence intensity thus a higher flow velocity will promote sludge floc movement and thereby promote eps production and decrease the zeta potential because the sludge flocs may get more nutrients and carbon resources the interfacial adsorption free energy δg can be used to determine the interaction of sludge flocs hou et al 2015 if δg is positive the interaction between microorganisms and water is stronger than that between water molecules and the flocs repel each other under this condition the sludge water mixture will maintain dispersion stability but the flocculation performance of the sludge will decrease by contrast when δg is negative the flocculation performance of the sludge will improve in the present study the relationship between δg and turbulence energy was positive and a high turbulence intensity would prevent sludge flocculation in our systems 5 conclusions the average flow velocity and the turbulence dissipation rate were obviously higher in the stirring system than in the aeration system at the same g value however the turbulence energy and kolmogorov microscale in the aeration system were much higher than those in the stirring system both the zeta potential and δg were lower in the aeration system than in the stirring system even though the sludge flocculation performance f f 0 in the stirring and aeration systems showed no obvious differences the differences in zeta potential and δg between the two systems suggest that aeration systems are more beneficial for sludge flocculation than stirring systems the significant relationships between the sludge properties and hydrodynamic parameters suggest that the kolmogorov microscale average flow velocity and turbulence energy are appropriate hydrodynamic parameters for evaluating the flocculation performance f f 0 zeta potential and δg declaration of competing interest

18157,the effects of aeration and stirring systems on the physical properties of sludge were analyzed using a computational fluid dynamics cfd model the aims of this study were to 1 compare the effects of aeration and stirring on sludge properties using the same turbulent mixing intensity and 2 to reveal the relationship between sludge properties and hydrodynamic indicators to determine how hydrodynamic conditions influence sludge flocculation mixing experiments with stirring and aeration were carried out in 2 l beakers with the average velocity gradient g set to 90 190 or 280 s 1 the

performance of activated sludge greatly affects the sludge sedimentation process sludge and water separation process and effluent quality it is a key indicator for controlling the activated sludge process li and yang 2007 subramanian et al 2008 the factors affecting the flocculation performance of sludge are complex in terms of the sludge itself the floc size morphology zeta potential and pro hydrophobic surface properties are important the shearing action of hydrodynamics in the reactor directly affects the size and shape of the sludge floc and thus affects the sedimentation performance jin and lant 2004 feng et al 2019 furthermore the mixing effect of turbulence also affects the growth of microorganisms which determines the production and composition of microbial extracellular polymers eps and affects the physical and chemical properties of sludge such as the zeta potential and pro hydrophobic surface properties mikkelsen 2001 hence the sludge flocculation performance is affected indirectly by hydrodynamics therefore an understanding of the influence of reactor hydrodynamic characteristics on sludge flocculation performance and surface characteristics is crucial for design and regulation of the activated sludge process some researchers have studied the effects of aeration intensity and stirring speed on sludge floc size eps content and composition adav et al 2007 chachuat et al 2005 wilén et al 2000 however because of differences in the reactors the turbulence intensity can vary even with the same aeration intensity or agitation speed and the results are not comparable to solve this problem the camp and stein s velocity gradient g and hydraulic retention time hrt which are easy to be calculated have been used to evaluate hydrodynamic intensity das et al 1993 patziger et al 2016 bouyer et al 2004 calculated g values and used them to analyze the sludge floc size distribution under different hydrodynamics in a mixing tank their results showed that the mean floc diameter decreased from 500 μm to 50 μm when the g increased from 5 s 1 300 s 1 spicer et al 1998 demonstrated that sludge flocs grew when g was 50 s 1 but fragmented when g was 100 300 or 500 s 1 wu et al 2009 found that neither strong g 12 s 1 nor gentle shear g 0 04 s 1 conditions promoted floc growth the critical g value varied dramatically among these studies because of scale effects with different processes yielding the same g values similarly patziger et al 2016 pointed out that the removal rate of different primary settling tanks showed a strongly fluctuating pattern even in the same range of the hrt thus it is necessary to carry out more detailed evaluations of hydrodynamic conditions in recent years computational fluid dynamics cfd models have been used frequently to calculate turbulent mixing and mass transport in activated sludge systems karpinska and bridgeman 2015 patziger et al 2012 patziger 2016 this method uses a three dimensional model to calculate several hydrodynamic indicators including the flow velocity turbulence energy turbulence dissipation rate and kolmogorov microscale kolmogorov length scale eddies at this scale are expected to be driven mainly by the energy cascade from larger scales bouyer et al 2001 found that floc size decreased when the average flow velocity in a jar test vessel increased from 3 8 to 12 5 cm s 1 feng et al 2010 analyzed the relationship between the turbulence dissipation rate and sludge volume index and found that the sludge volume index first decreased when the turbulence dissipation rate increased from 0 25 to 2 5 10 3 m2 s 3 and then increased beyond this research few studies have evaluated the relationship between sludge properties and hydrodynamic indicators the lack of knowledge in this area limits the understanding of the influence of hydrodynamic conditions on sludge flocculation spicer et al 1996 found that the impeller type also affected the floc size when the g value was constant furthermore turbulence in an activated sludge system is usually produced by an aeration or stirring system however there has been little research on the effects of aeration and stirring on sludge properties under the same turbulent mixing intensity an understanding of the effects of aeration and stirring could be used to increase the treatment efficiency by adjusting hydrodynamic conditions in the current study the effects on sludge physical properties in aeration and stirring system were analyzed using a cfd model the aims of this study were to 1 compare the effects of aeration and stirring at the same the turbulent mixing intensity on the sludge properties and 2 to reveal the relationship between sludge properties and hydrodynamic indicators calculated by the cfd model to determine the influence of hydrodynamic conditions on sludge flocculation 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design the mixing experiments were carried out in a 2 l beaker with stirring or aeration a rushton turbine impeller with 2 flat blades was used in the stirring experiment as well as the cfd model while a cylindrical aerator was used for the aeration experiment the dimension parameters of the container and device were shown in fig 1 sludge for inoculation was collected from a sewage treatment plant in the jiangning district nanjing china the sludge was rinsed three times before inoculation to remove adsorbed nutrients and organic matter a simulated municipal wastewater sample was prepared with the following composition 404 mg l 1 ch3coona 120 mg l 1 nh4cl 24 mg l 1

experiments were carried at stirring speeds of 125 240 and 320 rad min 1 and at aeration intensities of 30 170 and 360 l h 1 in the second group the sludge concentration was set at 1000 2000 or 3000 mg l 1 the mixing speed was 240 rad min 1 and the aeration intensity was 170 l h 1 each experiment was carried out for 6 h and the sludge properties were analyzed at 5 20 50 80 120 160 and 180 min the temperature was controlled as 20 0 5 c during all runs 2 2 cfd methods 2 2 1 cfd modelling of multi phase flow for stirring reactor based on the assumption that the flocs were mixed well in the water column and the concentration of flocs was low liquid and solid phase were simplified as an integral homogeneous liquid system vof model was used to simulate the hydrodynamic characteristics the tracking of the interfaces between different phases was accomplished by the solution of a continuity equation for the volume fraction of one phase 1 t α q ρ q α q ρ q ν q s α q p 1 n m p q m q p where ρ q is the density the term α q ρ q represents the effective density of the phase q ν q denotes its velocity m q p is the mass transfer from phase q to phase p m p q is the mass transfer from phase p

cfd simulation of multiphase flow in the reactor was performed using fluent 6 3 software ansys canonsburg pa with the euler euler approach the geometry for all simulation was three dimensional however only hydrodynamic characteristics on the axial plane were illustrated in the current study due to the axisymmetric property of the spatial distribution of the flow fields also for clearer presentation in the stirred reactors the volume of the fluid model was adopted to simulate the flow pattern and track the interfaces between the phases and a mixture model was applied for hydrodynamic simulation of the aeration reactor the viscosity of the mixture at varying sludge concentrations was calculated according to guibaud et al 2004 and the value was 1 078 1 106 and 1 150 10 3 pa s when the concentration was 1000 2000 and 3000 mg l 1 respectively the grid mesh was generated using gambit 2 4 6 the final mesh contained 222 956 unstructured grid elements in the stirred reactor while 86 802 structured grid meshes were built for the simulation in the aeration reactor the rotation of the impeller in stirred reactor was modeled with the moving reference frame technique the moving reference frame domain was assigned a rotational speed of 125 240 or 320 rad min 1 which was the same as that in the experiment the top surface was modeled as a wall with a zero shear boundary condition the boundary condition at the walls and bottom surface in the stirred reactor was defined as no slip boundary and the roughness constant is 0 5 the aerator was simplified as a small sparger the gas injection boundary condition was defined as an inlet velocity to give specific air flow rates of 30 170 and 360 l h 1 and the velocity of the air inlet is 0 0208 m s 1 the no slip condition was used for the liquid and gas phases at the reactor walls the outlet boundary pressure condition was set as 1 atm the g was used to characterize the differences in hydrodynamic conditions between the reactors and was calculated as follows according to das et al 1993 13 for stirring reactors g p v μ 14 for aeration reactors g q a γ h v μ where p is the energy power during the stirring process w μ is the dynamic viscosity pa s v is the volume of the mixture m3 q a is the airflow rate m3 s 1 γ is the liquid specific weight n m 3 and h m is the aeration depth in stirring reactor p was determined as follows according to hsu 2000 15 p 14 35 f d 4 38 n 2 69 ρ 0 69 μ 0 31 where d is the diameter of impeller m n is the stirring speed rad s 1 ρ is the density of liquor kg m 3 f is modified

diameter m 2 3 cfd model validation time averaged liquid velocity fields obtained through simulation were compared to measured data using particle image velocimetry piv technology flow fields from our simulation generally fit with piv measurement figs s4 s11 in the supplemental materials part i which confirmed that cfd model was a reasonable predictive tool for to reflect an overall hydrodynamic condition 2 4 analysis method flocculation ability batch tests were performed according to the method of wilén et al 2003 first 80 ml of sludge was placed in a beaker on ice and then ultrasonicated for 15 s at 50 w next 10 ml of the sludge sample was withdrawn from the beaker and centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 2 min the optical density of the supernatant was measured at 650 nm using a spectrophotometer uv 1900 shimadzu kyoto japan to obtain value a for eq 19 then the rest of sonicated suspended sludge was gently mixed for 15 min at room temperature this sludge sample was treated and measured using the spectrophotometer as described above to obtain value b for eq 19 the flocculation ability was then calculated as follows 19 f 1 a b 100 a diversity factor if eq 20 was used to evaluate the difference in the sludge flocculation ability under different hydrodynamic conditions 20 i f f f 0 100 where f 0 is the sludge flocculation ability at the beginning of the experiment and f is the sludge flocculation ability obtained under the studied hydrodynamic conditions the zeta potential was measured with a zeta potential meter nano zetasizer malvern uk according to the method of liu et al 2008 the hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of the activated sludge was calculated from the contact angle the contact angle was measured using a three liquid method and a contact angle measuring instrument the specific operation was as follows a certain amount of activated sludge was suction filtered onto a 0 45 μm acetate fiber membrane washed twice with double distilled water and then placed on a 1 agar plate to keep it moist before the measurement the filter membrane was placed on a glass slide and dried for 10 min then the slide was placed on a static drop platform and water formamide and 1 bromonaphthalene were successively dropped onto the filter membrane the shape of each droplet was immediately captured by ccd finally the sludge contact angle was calculated by the software each type of liquid was measured at least 8 to 10 times and the results were averaged usually the surface free energy of sludge or liquid consists of non polar γ l w and polar γ a b components as follows 21 γ b γ b l w γ b a b 22 γ l γ l l w γ l a b the surface contact angle of the sludge measured as a liquid is expressed as follows 23 1 cos θ γ l 2 γ b l w γ l l w γ b γ l γ b γ l where θ is the contact angle between the activated sludge b and the liquid l γ and γ are the electron acceptor and the electron donor in the polar component respectively and γ a b 2 γ γ distilled water 1 bromonaphthalene and formamide were used as the liquids for measuring the contact angle in the three liquid method the surface free energies and the values of the respective active components of the three liquids are listed in table 1 according to thermodynamic principles if an adsorption process can reduce the free energy of a system the process can be carried out spontaneously that is the adsorption process will be relatively dominant in the process of adsorbing primary particles or bacteria in a medium the change in adsorption free energy per unit area δ g a d h can be calculated as follows 24 δ g a d h γ b s γ b l γ s l where γ b s γ b l and γ s l are the surface free energies between sludge solids sludge liquid and solids liquid respectively in this study we assumed that adsorption occurred only between two identical bacteria such as sludge flocs adsorbing elementary particles therefore the above formula could be simplified using γ b s 0 and γ b l γ s l as follows 25 δ g a d h 2 γ b l 26 γ b l γ b l l w γ b l a b 27 γ b l l w γ b l w γ l l w 2 28 γ b l a b 2 γ b γ b γ l γ l γ b γ l γ b γ l 2 5 data analysis the relationships between sludge performance and hydrodynamic parameters were analyzed by pearson correlation analysis using spss 10 0 levels were considered significant at p 0 01 or 0 05 3 results 3 1 distribution of turbulence parameters steady state flow velocity under the three stirring speeds and three aeration intensities at a sludge concentration of 2000 mg l 1 are shown in fig 2 the flow velocity was highest on the side of the blade and decreased gradually from the blade to the inner wall of the beaker in the aeration system a high flow velocity region was found in the center of the beaker and the flow velocity then decreased out to the sides regions with very low flow velocities were found near the beaker wall as the stirring speed increased the flow velocity in the beaker increased but the blue areas above and below the blade decreased as the aeration intensity increased the flow velocity in the beaker also increased the highest turbulence energy was found in the middle of the reactor and upper vicinity of the blades in the stirring system fig 3 the turbulence energy passed around and decreased near the beaker walls in the aeration system a large zone of high turbulence energy formed in the middle and upper parts of the reactor and low turbulence regions were found on the wall surface and the top of the aeration head as the stirring speed increased in the stirring system the turbulence energy in the bulk increased and the area with high turbulence energy also increased in the vicinity of the impeller in addition the low turbulence energy region on the wall surface decreased in the aeration system the size of the high turbulence energy zone in the middle and upper parts of the reactor increased with increasing aeration intensity in the stirring system the turbulence dissipation rate was more concentrated than the turbulence energy the highest turbulence energy was found in a small m style area around the blade fig 4 the turbulence dissipation rate was evenly distributed in other regions of the reactor the size of the m style area and lowest turbulence dissipation rate increased with increasing stirring speed fig 4 in the aeration system a region of high turbulence dissipation formed in the middle and upper parts of the reactor which basically coincided with the region of high turbulence energy the integral turbulence dissipation rate in the aeration system increased with an increase in the aeration intensity the distribution of the kolmogorov microscale was opposite those of the turbulence energy and turbulence dissipation rate in the stirring system the lowest kolmogorov microscale values were found in the middle and upper parts around the blade fig 5 this area decreased with increasing stirring speed in the aeration system the kolmogorov microscale was highest in the bottom corner of the reactor and decreased toward the middle of the reactor the calculated distributions of flow velocity turbulence energy turbulence dissipation rate and kolmogorov microscale in both the stirring and aeration systems with various sludge concentrations are shown in the supplementary materials part ii figs s12 s15 the sludge concentration had little influence on the distribution of hydrodynamic parameters 3 2 average turbulence parameters the average turbulence parameters based on performed numerical simulations are listed in tables 2 and 3 the g in both the stirring and aeration systems were 90 190 and 280 s 1 reynolds number ranged from 10100 to 25856 in the stirring system but ranged from 1352 to 13958 in the aeration system the turbulence dissipation rate in the stirring system ranged from 7 07 10 3 to 1 08 10 1 m2 s 3 and that in the aeration system ranged from 3 93 10 3 to 5 07 102 m2 s 3 when the sludge concentration was 2000 mg l 1 the flow velocity turbulence energy and turbulence dissipation rate increased along with increases in both the stirring speed and aeration intensity but the kolmogorov microscale decreased the average flow velocity or turbulence dissipation rate at various sludge concentration in the current study was almost similar because there was no order of magnitude difference in concentrations however in the aeration system a sludge concentration of 2000 mg l 1 gave a higher turbulence energy than concentrations of 1000 and 3000 mg l 1 the kolmogorov microscale showed the opposite trend 3 3 flocculation performance the f f 0 value increased dramatically during the first 50 min then decreased slowly and tended to be stable in the last 60 min fig 6 at the end of the experiment the f f 0 value in the stirring system increased from 1 020 to 1 030 when the stirring speed increased from 125 to 320 rpm in the aeration system the f f 0 increased from 1 020 to 1 032 when the aeration intensity increased from 30 to 360 l h 1 the f f 0 value decreased along with increases in the sludge concentration in the second group of experiments in both systems 3 4 surface properties the zeta potential fluctuated obviously during the first 80 min and then stabilized fig 7 at the end of the experiment the zeta potential increased as the turbulence intensity decreased in both systems the sludge concentration had a negative effect on the zeta potential additionally the zeta potentials in the aeration system range 23 8 to 21 7 mv were obviously higher than those in the stirring system range 29 4 to 28 4 mv the δg also tended to be stable in the last 60 min fig 8 at a sludge concentration of 2000 mg l 1 the δg increased from 12 8 to 6 2 kj mol 1 when the stirring speed increased from 125 to 320 rpm in the aeration system the δg increased from 4 0 to 13 8 kj mol 1 when the aeration intensity increased from 30 to 360 l h 1 therefore the sludge concentration had a negative effect on δg 3 5 relationship between hydrodynamics parameters and sludge properties the relationship between hydrodynamic parameters calculated based on the cfd model and average values of sludge properties in the stable phase was shown in fig 9 the flocculation performance parameter f f 0 had a negative relationship with g the flow velocity the turbulence energy and the turbulence dissipation rate but had a positive relationship with the kolmogorov microscale fig 9 only the relationship between f f 0 and the kolmogorov microscale was significant in both the stirring and aeration systems and the integrated results of the two systems the trends of the relationships between the zeta potential and most of the hydrodynamic parameters in the stirring and aeration systems were completely separate except for the average flow velocity a negative exponential relationship between the zeta potential and average flow velocity was found in the integrated results of the two systems a significant linear relationship between g and δg was found in both the stirring and aeration systems but the two trend lines were far apart and the relationship between g and δg in the integrated results of the two systems was not significant however the relationship between δg and the turbulence kinetic energy was significant in both the stirring and aeration systems and the integrated results of the two systems 4 discussion in the current study the g of stirring and aeration systems were adjusted to the same value 90 190 and 280 s 1 with the same g the average flow velocity and the turbulence dissipation rate were obviously higher in the stirring system than in the aeration system however the turbulence energy and kolmogorov microscale in the aeration system were much higher than those in the stirring system these results indicate that stirring induces a high speed flow field and higher strength shear rate than aeration at the same g the fact that the turbulence energy in the aeration system was higher than that in the stirring system suggests that the flow field is more evenly distributed in the stirring system the flow velocity and turbulence intensity were higher in the area around the blade and lower in the area near the beaker wall and under the blade by contrast in the aeration system turbulence intensity was high in the middle and upper part of the reactor in other words the hydrodynamic parameters are more evenly distributed in aeration systems than stirring systems similarly jin and lant 2004 found that the hydrodynamic parameters in activated sludge bubble column air lift and aerated stirred reactors varied greatly our results also showed that the sludge concentration had little influence on the distribution of hydrodynamic parameters in both systems although different processes can yield the same g values few studies have compared hydrodynamic parameters in different reactors at the same g bouyer et al 2001 calculated the g and average flow velocity as 33 s 1 and 0 078 m s 1 respectively in a stirring system when the stirring speed was 150 rpm our lowest stirring speed 125 rpm produced a g of 90 s 1 and an average flow velocity of 0 148 m s 1 in previous studies g of 200 s 1 and 195 s 1 produced turbulence dissipation rates of 4 0 10 2 m2 s 3 bouyer et al 2004 and 3 8 10 2 m2 s 3 coufort et al 2005 respectively these previous results are smaller than the 4 7 10 2 m2 s 3 obtained with a g of 190 s 1 in the current study all the above results show that the same g can produce different hydrodynamic parameters in different reactors additionally spicer et al 1996 reported that sludge floc size varied dramatically when the sludge was treated with various impellers at the same g which suggested that the impeller type affected the hydrodynamic parameters when the g was constant at the same g the sludge flocculation performance f f 0 in the stirring and aeration systems showed no obvious differences however both the zeta potential and δg were lower in the aeration system than in the stirring system one possible reason for this was that the turbulence intensity flow velocity and turbulence dissipation rate in the aeration system was lower than that in the stirring system at the same g within the range of turbulence intensity in the current study decreasing turbulence intensity promoted aggregation of sludge and increased flocculation performance another reason could be that the aeration system had a higher concentration of dissolved oxygen than the stirring system which would affect eps production of activated sludge liao et al 2011 this deduction is supported by the research of adav et al 2007 who found that a low aeration intensity 60 l h 1 induced formation of sludge aggregates the zeta potential and δg results for these two systems indicate that aeration systems are more beneficial for sludge flocculation than stirring systems even though the sludge flocculation performance f f 0 in the stirring and aeration systems showed no obvious differences significant relationships between the sludge properties and hydrodynamic parameters suggested that the kolmogorov microscale average flow velocity and turbulence energy were appropriate hydrodynamic parameters for evaluating the flocculation performance f f 0 zeta potential and δg the results also suggested that the microcosmic hydrodynamic parameters were better than macroscopic hydraulics parameters such as g a negative relationship between the flocculation performance f f 0 and kolmogorov microscale indicated that a larger kolmogorov microscale favored sludge flocculation in our experimental systems when the kolmogorov microscale is much larger than the floc size the sludge floc will move with the flow by contrast when the kolmogorov microscale is much smaller than the floc size the floc will be disaggregated by the shear force when the kolmogorov microscale is similar to the floc size collision coagulation of the sludge flocs will increase and there will be little disaggregation by shear force thus we deduced that the floc size must be similar to the kolmogorov microscale in a stable mixing system this has been proven by feng et al 2019 additionally li et al 2018 demonstrated that the aggregate size of the cyanobacterium microcystis ichthyoblabe was similar to the kolmogorov microscale when the aggregates were treated with turbulent mixing for 30 min this result also supports the above deduction the negative relationship also indicated that the turbulence intensity in the current study was so large that sludge flocs would disaggregate when the turbulence intensity increased according to the dlvo theory van der waals attraction and electrostatic repulsion among particles are important factors affecting the flocculation of activated sludge systems as the electrostatic repulsion increases the stability of the system decreases and flocculation occurs the aggregated flocs are sensitive to environmental changes including shearing therefore the zeta potential plays a key role in sludge flocculation the zeta potential of activated sludge is affected by the eps composition and content and environmental factors e g shearing and ph the eps contains carboxyl groups hydroxyl groups phosphoric acid groups and sulfonic acid groups which make the surface of the floc negatively charged nouha et al 2017 wang et al 2012 and generates electrostatic repulsion among the sludge flocs the presence of shearing either reduces the lb eps content or stimulates its secretion which increases or decreases the zeta potential however if the shearing force is too large the sludge flocs will break and internal charges will be exposed resulting in a decrease in the zeta potential our results showed that the zeta potential had a negative relationship with the average flow velocity fig 9 compared with other hydrodynamic parameters such as the turbulence energy turbulence dissipation rate and kolmogorov microscale the average flow velocity could be used to assess the process that moved the flocs the other parameters could be used to assess the turbulence intensity thus a higher flow velocity will promote sludge floc movement and thereby promote eps production and decrease the zeta potential because the sludge flocs may get more nutrients and carbon resources the interfacial adsorption free energy δg can be used to determine the interaction of sludge flocs hou et al 2015 if δg is positive the interaction between microorganisms and water is stronger than that between water molecules and the flocs repel each other under this condition the sludge water mixture will maintain dispersion stability but the flocculation performance of the sludge will decrease by contrast when δg is negative the flocculation performance of the sludge will improve in the present study the relationship between δg and turbulence energy was positive and a high turbulence intensity would prevent sludge flocculation in our systems 5 conclusions the average flow velocity and the turbulence dissipation rate were obviously higher in the stirring system than in the aeration system at the same g value however the turbulence energy and kolmogorov microscale in the aeration system were much higher than those in the stirring system both the zeta potential and δg were lower in the aeration system than in the stirring system even though the sludge flocculation performance f f 0 in the stirring and aeration systems showed no obvious differences the differences in zeta potential and δg between the two systems suggest that aeration systems are more beneficial for sludge flocculation than stirring systems the significant relationships between the sludge properties and hydrodynamic parameters suggest that the kolmogorov microscale average flow velocity and turbulence energy are appropriate hydrodynamic parameters for evaluating the flocculation performance f f 0 zeta potential and δg declaration of competing interest

18158,the low molar absorption coefficient of h2o2 limits the ultraviolet uv h2o2 process making it a desirable target to enhance the uv h2o2 process for organic micropollutant degradation therefore this study investigated the impact of iron containing coagulants fe coagulants on micropollutant degradation by uv h2o2 process three typical fe coagulants i e polymeric ferric sulfate polymeric aluminum ferric sulfate and fecl3 exhibited the enhancement of sulfamethazine degradation during the uv h2o2 process the maximum increasing ratio of the degradation rate constant reached 40 the ph and fe coagulant concentration effects as well as residual h2o2 were examined the principal mechanism of micropollutant degradation enhancement via the fe coagulants was the photo fenton like reaction between fe iii on the fe coagulant surface and h2o2 under uv irradiation then the influence of fe coagulant particle size was discussed smaller particles 0 22 μm with a lower iron content a larger specific surface area and a stronger optical scattering effect exhibited a greater enhancement on the uv h2o2 process as compared with larger particles 0 22 μm finally the enhancement effect of the fe coagulants was verified on two water samples from a water treatment plant which were either pre coagulation or sand filtered samples this study explored an existing heterogeneous catalysis process in drinking water treatment which provides additional information for coagulant selection and improvements to the treatment process for micropollutant removal graphical abstract image 1 keywords micropollutant uv h2o2 iron containing coagulant scattering particle size 1 introduction most municipal drinking water treatment plants use a combination of preoxidation coagulation sedimentation filtration advanced treatment and disinfection to provide clean safe drinking water to the public advanced oxidation processes aops involving the use of powerful oxidizing intermediates e g hydroxyl radicals ho are used widely as an advanced treatment technology to remove micropollutants during drinking water treatment rizzo et al 2014 mestankova et al 2016 xiang et al 2016 the ultraviolet uv h2o2 process based on the photolysis of h2o2 eq 1 is by far the most common commercial uv based aop shu et al 2013 bagheri and mohseni 2015 miklos et al 2018 as shown by the following equation 1 h2o2 hν 2 ho the merits of this aop include a high quantum yield of generated ho goldstein et al 2007 without the introduction of other chemicals and few by products the uv h2o2 process however suffers from low h2o2 molar absorption coefficients of uv lights which results in a low use efficiency for the photon energy emitted from uv light sources for example the molar absorption coefficient of h2o2 at 254 nm i e the main emission peak of a low pressure lp mercury lamp the most common commercial uv lamp is only 19 0 m 1 cm 1 li et al 2019a this molar absorption coefficient can result in the minimal use of h2o2 during uv irradiation such that the residual h2o2 can have a strong impact on subsequent treatment processes and the pipeline network e g pipeline corrosion if not queched properly therefore the enhancement of uv photon absorption and the use of h2o2 have attracted increasing attention in recent years h2o2 has higher molar absorption coefficients at uv wavelengths below 240 nm compared with those above 240 nm therefore several previous studies have tested the use of novel light sources with various emission wavelengths for the initiation of the uv h2o2 process to achieve a higher photon absorption and pollutant degradation efficiency as compared with processes that use lp mercury lamps naunovic et al 2008 shen et al 2009 however the high efficiency and low cost application of the uv h2o2 process requires the integrated consideration of multiple aspects including photon based fluence kinetics and photoelectric efficiency as well as the lifetime and stability of the uv lamp during long term operation li et al 2019b therefore except for mercury vapor lamps e g lp mercury medium pressure mercury and vacuum uv uv lamps other approaches based on improvements to light sources face major challenges adding iron or copper ions to the uv h2o2 process triggers the photo fenton reaction which can strengthen photon absorption and h2o2 use to improve the efficiency of the uv h2o2 process in the photo fenton reaction soluble ferric ions fe3 are photo reduced to ferrous ions fe2 which can react with h2o2 the fenton reaction to produce ho based on the following equations 2 fe2 h2o2 ho fe3 ho 3 fe3 fe iii oh 2 hv fe2 fe ii ho however the narrow working ph range ph 2 5 3 5 the production of sludge and continual loss of the catalyst limit the widespread application of the photo fenton reaction thus heterogeneous photo fenton like processes have been investigated over a wider ph range previous studies have discovered numerous materials that act as fenton like catalysts as well as discussed the reactive oxygen species ros generation mechanism yang et al 2013 zbiljic et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 however the separation and regeneration of catalysts are the principal limitations concerning the industrial application of heterogeneous catalysts iron is often detected in water during potable water treatment the secondary maximum contaminant limit for total iron is 0 3 mg l 1 set by the environmental protection agency usepa 1979 dietrich and burlingame 2015 and the standards for drinking water quality of china chinese ministry of health 2005 thus previous studies have investigated the effects of natural i e low concentration iron on the uv h2o2 process in practical water treatment processes exposed to neutral ph conditions which do not require the separation and regeneration of iron by adding low concentrations of iron ions stable iron complexes can trigger the photo fenton like reaction to enhance organic pollutant

size distribution and iron concentrations of the fe coagulant solutions were measured with a laser particle sizer mastersizer 3000 malvern and an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes optima 2000 perkinelmer respectively uridine sigma aldrich was used as the actinometer for the fluence measurements its concentration was analyzed by measuring its absorbance at

our previous method li et al 2017 stock solutions of fe coagulants smn and h2o2 were prepared freshly the tested fe coagulant from the stock solution was then spiked into a phosphate buffer 0 50 mm and mixed with a stirring bar for 15 min finally smn and h2o2 were added to the above solution for uv exposure in the mvps 2 3 filtration process after mixing the fe coagulant and phosphate buffer the solution was filtered through 0 22 0 45 0 80 or 10 μm polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe membranes the filtrate along with smn and h2o2 was applied with subsequent uv exposure to examine the influence of fe coagulant particle size on smn degradation which helps clarify the enhancement mechanism of fe coagulants associated with the uv h2o2 process 2 4 real water samples to verify the impact of fe coagulants in real water samples pre coagulation and sand filtered water samples were collected from a drinking water treatment plant in beijing china table s2 lists the water quality parameters of the two real water samples 3 results and discussion 3 1 smn degradation by the uv h2o2 process with fe coagulants fig 1 shows the degradation kinetics of smn smn 0 0 10 mg l 1 in the uv h2o2 process with the addition of 5 0 mg l 1 fe coagulants all smn degradation processes were sufficiently expressed by the pseudo first order kinetics i e photon fluence based the addition of pfs pafs or fecl3 resulted in significant enhancements to the photon fluence based smn degradation rate constant k p during the uv h2o2 process the degradation enhancement by fe coagulants 5 0 mg l 1 had the following order pafs 36 7 pfs 24 2 fecl3 23 0 as a comparison no enhancement on k p was observed with the addition of 5 0 mg l 1 polyaluminium sulfate fig s2 as the coagulation sedimentation filtration and uv h2o2 steps are connected in drinking water treatment systems as well as the common use of fe coagulants these results provide an important reference for a potential strategy to enhance micropollutant removal therefore we further investigated the enhancement mechanism of fe coagulants in greater detail without uv irradiation virtually no smn degradation was observed for the three fe coagulants in the presence of h2o2 fig 1 implying that 1 the fe coagulants did not show observable adsorption of smn under this condition and 2 the fe coagulants did not react with h2o2 in dark conditions to form oxidative species for smn degradation in addition in the absence of h2o2 the k p values 42 2 44 5 m2 einstein 1 associated with smn degradation when exposed to uv irradiation with fe coagulants were slightly higher than those without the fe coagulants i e direct uv photolysis of smn fig s3 this could contribute to the enhancement effect of fe coagulants on smn degradation by the sole uv process in addition the ros formed on the surface of the fe coagulants under uv irradiation could also enhance smn degradation the addition of fe coagulants however competes photons with smn for direct photolysis which can slightly weaken the smn degradation rate 3 2 effects of ph and fe coagulant concentration fig 2 illustrates the effect of ph on smn degradation by the uv h2o2 process with or without fe coagulants the ph dependent k p value showed similar trends for all smn degradation processes with a highest k p value observed at ph 7 0 this could be ascribed to the contributions of ph to the three ionization forms of smn pka 2 07 and 7 49 and the dissociation of ho as discussed in previous studies kutschera et al 2009 ratpukdi et al 2010 li et al 2018 one hypothesis driving the degradation enhancement via the fe coagulants is that slightly soluble fe2 fe3 ions induce the photo fenton reaction with h2o2 under uv irradiation at ph 7 0 the solubility of fe2 fe3 however decreases with increasing ph whereas the decrease in fe2 fe3 solubility with increasing ph did not result in a rapid drop in the k p value fig 2 which does not support this hypothesis the effect of fe coagulant concentration on k p is shown in fig 3 with increasing fe coagulant concentration the k p value first increased and then decreased for all three fe coagulants where the maximum increasing k p ratio reached 40 fecl3 0 0 5 mg l 1 it is reasonable that a higher fe coagulant concentration could lead to a stronger enhancement of the uv h2o2 process yet excessively high concentration of fe coagulants will strongly compete for uv photons and weaken the optical field in the solution inducing a decrease in k p in the high fe coagulant concentration region both pafs and pfs showed peak k p values at a concentration of 2 5 mg l 1 while the peak k p value for fecl3 occurred at 0 5 mg l 1 this is because the three fe coagulants have different nominal iron contents 25 for pafs 26 for pfs 34 5 for fecl3 and different particle sizes that induced different optical fields 3 3 residual h2o2 and enhancement mechanism the h2o2 concentrations were measured during smn degradation in the uv h2o2 process with or without fe coagulants fig 4 greater attenuations of h2o2 concentration were achieved with fe coagulants than in the absence of fe coagulants implying that the addition of fe coagulants can enhance the use of h2o2 during the uv h2o2 process therefore after excluding smn absorption by fe coagulants as well as smn degradation by the ros formed from the dark reactions between the fe coagulants and h2o2 or between soluble fe2 fe3 and h2o2 the principal mechanism by which the fe coagulants enhance the uv h2o2 process should be the photo fenton like reaction between the fe coagulants and h2o2 under uv irradiation this reaction is similar to the heterogeneous photo fenton like reaction using iron containing catalysts this reaction process has been extensively discussed yang et al 2013 zbiljic et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 which can be ascribed to the fe iii on the surface of solid particles being photoreduced into fe ii under uv irradiation the fe ii then accelerates the decomposition of h2o2 in solution to form ros while itself being oxidized to fe iii the principal ros responsible for micropollutant degradation has been verified to be ho zelmanov and semiat 2008 gonzalez olmos et al 2011 faure et al 2012 xu and wang 2011 to further verify this mechanism xps analysis was carried out for the original fe coagulants fe coagulants after uv irradiation and fe coagulants after uv irradiation in the presence of h2o2 for the latter two samples the fe coagulant solutions with or without h2o2 after uv irradiation were filtered by 0 22 μm membranes the filtered substances were dried and collected for xps analysis fig s4 indicates that the binding energies of fe 2p3 2 for all three fe coagulants after uv irradiation in presence of h2o2 were very similar to those of the original fe coagulants but a little higher than those in the absence of h2o2 these demonstrate that the fe iii on the fe coagulant surface was photo reduced to fe ii under uv irradiation based on the standard fe 2p3 2 binding energies of 709 5 ev fe ii and 711 2 ev fe iii wandelt 1982 yet in the presence of h2o2 the fe ii could react with h2o2 rapidly to form fe iii inducing similar binding energies as the original fe coagulants 3 4 particle size distribution considering the effect of particle size could help to further clarify the mechanism associated with the smn degradation enhancement by fe coagulant addition the particle size distributions of the three fe coagulants were measured with a laser particle analyzer fig s5 the three tested fe coagulants had different particle size distributions which could cause different iron contents and specific surface areas i e with surface fe iii in contact with h2o2 molecules to form ho as well as different optical properties i e reflection and scattering of uv photons to generate different optical fields these could lead to complex impacts on smn degradation by the uv h2o2 process therefore it is necessary to analyze the impacts of the iron content and specific surface area of fe coagulant particles with different size ranges as well as the resulting optical field in the solution on the smn degradation 3 5 effect of filtration of fe coagulant solutions the fe coagulant solutions were filtered through membranes with different pore sizes to examine the impact of particle size on smn degradation by the uv h2o2 process table 1 lists the smn degradation rates in the uv h2o2 process with the addition of different fe coagulant filtrates for all three fe coagulants the highest k p values were found for unfiltered solutions with decreasing membrane pore size i e from no filtration to 0 45 μm there was a decrease in the k p value for all three fe coagulants this is reasonable because more fe coagulant particles were filtered through a smaller pore size resulting in smaller enhancements on smn degradation by uv h2o2 the icp oes results fig 5 verified that the iron concentrations of all three fe coagulant filtrates decreased from no filtration to the 0 22 μm membrane although the k p values in all reaction systems with filtrates were lower than those with the unfiltered fe coagulants it is interesting that the k p values for all three 0 22 μm membrane filtrates were significantly higher than those of other filtrates as previously discussed the principal enhancement mechanism was likely the photo fenton like reaction between fe iii on the surface of the fe coagulant particles and h2o2 under uv irradiation thus given a constant h2o2 concentration the enhancement induced by different fe coagulant filtrates should depend on the quantity of fe iii on the coagulant surface and the optical field with decreasing the membrane pore size there was a decrease in the quantity of the fe coagulant particles as verified by the iron concentration measurement via icp oes it is noted that only iron on the particle surface could react with h2o2 to trigger the photon fenton like reaction compared with larger particles smaller particles even colloids have a larger specific surface area therefore given a constant iron concentration in the filtrates smaller particles have more fe iii on the surface resulting in larger enhancements on the uv h2o2 process in other words the fe coagulant enhancement effect is not linearly dependent on the iron concentration although the 0 22 μm membrane filtrate had the lowest iron concentration fig 5 the fe iii on the surface of small coagulant particles and colloids could have a non negligible enhancement effect different size particles with different reflection and scattering properties could induce different optical fields in the filtrates the optical behaviors of a particle suspension at the incident and lateral scattering directions of uv beams could be roughly evaluated using a uv vis spectrometer and a fluorescent spectrometer respectively li et al 2017 in general both a lower absorbance i e a higher transmittance and a higher fluorescent intensity i e a higher lateral scattering intensity could induce a stronger optical field in terms of the photon fluence rate distribution the absorption coefficients and fluorescence intensities of the filtrates are listed in table 2 with decreasing membrane pore size from 10 to 0 45 μm because there were overall fewer particles both the absorbance and fluorescence lateral scattering intensities of all three fe coagulant filtrates decreased when the membrane pore size decreased from 0 45 to 0 22 μm the quantity of fe coagulant particles further decreased leading to a continued decrease in the absorption coefficient and an subsequent increase in the optical field meanwhile the fluorescence intensity increased because smaller particles 0 22 μm can generate a stronger scattering effect the well known tyndall effect introduces a strong scattering if the particle size is similar or lower than the wavelength of the uv light jerlov and kullenberg 1953 beardsley et al 1970 in this study the membrane pore size 0 22 μm was lower than the uv wavelength of 254 nm therefore by removing interference from larger particles 0 22 μm size 0 45 μm an obvious enhancement on the uv optical field by the scattering effect could be observed for the 0 22 μm membrane filtrates compared with the 0 45 μm membrane filtrates therefore smaller particles 0 22 μm could have a lower iron content 0 4 mg l 1 fig 5 a larger specific surface area and a stronger optical scattering effect which could explain the k p acceleration in the 0 22 μm membrane filtrates table 1 3 6 enhancement effect in real water samples two real water samples including the pre coagulation and sand filtered samples from a drinking water treatment plant were employed to examine the practical performance of fe coagulant enhancement on the uv h2o2 process table s2 presents their water quality parameters because of the relatively higher dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations of these samples which strongly competed for ros the smn degradation rates in the uv h2o2 process both with and without fe coagulants in the real water samples fig 6 were lower than those in pure water fig 1 regardless in both real water samples the presence of fe coagulants could induce enhancements on smn degradation in the uv h2o2 process and the degrees of enhancement were similar to those in pure water 3 7 potential applications in this study the heterogeneous photocatalysis by fe coagulants was found to exist in current drinking water treatments this enhanced micropollutant removal by the uv h2o2 process while no catalysis effect was found in common aluminum based coagulants thus this provides additional information for coagulant selection in drinking water treatment previous studies have already investigated the heterogeneous photocatalysis via iron based catalysts i e photon fenton like reaction where difficulties associated with catalyst separation and regeneration limit their practical application in micropollutant removal in drinking water treatment however this limitation can be avoided in this study because fe coagulants are continuously added during drinking water treatment such that the catalyst regeneration is not required 4 conclusions this study investigated the effect of fe coagulants on the degradation of smn a model micropollutant by the uv h2o2 process the experimental results are summarized as follows the addition of fe coagulants pfs pafs and fecl3 significantly enhanced the smn degradation rate constants in the uv h2o2 process the maximum increasing ratio of k p reached 40 fecl3 0 0 5 mg l 1 the enhancement on the uv h2o2 process via fe coagulant addition was ascribed principally to the photo fenton like reaction between fe iii on the surface of fe coagulants and h2o2 under uv irradiation smaller particles 0 22 μm with a lower iron content 0 4 mg l 1 a larger specific surface area and a stronger optical scattering effect yielded stronger enhancements to the uv h2o2 process as compared with larger particles the enhancement effect of fe coagulants was verified in both pre coagulation and sand filtered water samples overall this study explored a green heterogeneous catalysis process that exists in water treatment processes without common catalyst separation and regeneration problems this process has the potential to enhance

18158,the low molar absorption coefficient of h2o2 limits the ultraviolet uv h2o2 process making it a desirable target to enhance the uv h2o2 process for organic micropollutant degradation therefore this study investigated the impact of iron containing coagulants fe coagulants on micropollutant degradation by uv h2o2 process three typical fe coagulants i e polymeric ferric sulfate polymeric aluminum ferric sulfate and fecl3 exhibited the enhancement of sulfamethazine degradation during the uv h2o2 process the maximum increasing ratio of the degradation rate constant reached 40 the ph and fe coagulant concentration effects as well as residual h2o2 were examined the principal mechanism of micropollutant degradation enhancement via the fe coagulants was the photo fenton like reaction between fe iii on the fe coagulant surface and h2o2 under uv irradiation then the influence of fe coagulant particle size was discussed smaller particles 0 22 μm with a lower iron content a larger specific surface area and a stronger optical scattering effect exhibited a greater enhancement on the uv h2o2 process as compared with larger particles 0 22 μm finally the enhancement effect of the fe coagulants was verified on two water samples from a water treatment plant which were either pre coagulation or sand filtered samples this study explored an existing heterogeneous catalysis process in drinking water treatment which provides additional information for coagulant selection and improvements to the treatment process for micropollutant removal graphical abstract image 1 keywords micropollutant uv h2o2 iron containing coagulant scattering particle size 1 introduction most municipal drinking water treatment plants use a combination of preoxidation coagulation sedimentation

radicals ho are used widely as an advanced treatment technology to remove micropollutants during drinking water treatment rizzo et al 2014 mestankova et al 2016 xiang et al 2016 the ultraviolet uv h2o2 process based on the photolysis of h2o2 eq 1 is by far the most common commercial uv based aop shu et al 2013 bagheri and mohseni 2015 miklos et al 2018 as shown by the following equation 1 h2o2 hν 2 ho the merits of this aop include a high quantum yield of generated ho goldstein et al 2007 without the introduction of other chemicals and few by products the uv h2o2 process however suffers from low h2o2 molar absorption coefficients of uv lights which results in a low use efficiency for the photon energy emitted from uv light sources for example the molar absorption coefficient of h2o2 at 254 nm i e the main emission peak of a low pressure lp mercury lamp the most common commercial uv lamp is only 19 0 m 1 cm 1 li et al 2019a this molar absorption coefficient can result in the minimal use of h2o2 during uv irradiation such that the residual h2o2 can have a strong impact on subsequent treatment processes and the pipeline network e g pipeline corrosion if not queched properly therefore the enhancement of uv photon absorption and the use of h2o2 have attracted increasing attention in recent years h2o2 has higher molar absorption coefficients at uv wavelengths below 240 nm compared with those above 240 nm therefore several previous studies have tested the use of novel light sources with various emission wavelengths for the initiation of the uv h2o2 process to achieve a higher photon absorption and pollutant degradation efficiency as compared with processes that use lp mercury lamps naunovic et al 2008 shen et al 2009 however the high efficiency and low cost application of the uv h2o2 process requires the integrated consideration of multiple aspects including photon based fluence kinetics and photoelectric efficiency as well as the lifetime and stability of the uv lamp during long term operation li et al 2019b therefore except for mercury vapor lamps e g lp mercury medium pressure mercury and vacuum uv uv lamps other approaches based on improvements to light sources face major challenges adding iron or copper ions to the uv h2o2 process triggers the photo fenton reaction which can strengthen photon absorption and h2o2 use to improve the efficiency of the uv h2o2 process in the photo fenton reaction soluble ferric ions fe3 are photo reduced to ferrous ions fe2 which can react with h2o2 the fenton reaction to produce ho based on the

act as fenton like catalysts as well as discussed the reactive oxygen species ros generation mechanism yang et al 2013 zbiljic et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 however the separation and regeneration of catalysts are the principal limitations concerning the industrial application of heterogeneous catalysts iron is often detected in water during potable water treatment the secondary maximum contaminant limit for total iron is 0 3 mg l 1 set by the environmental protection agency usepa 1979 dietrich and burlingame 2015 and the standards for drinking water quality of china chinese ministry of health 2005 thus previous studies have investigated the effects of natural i e low concentration iron on the uv h2o2 process in practical water treatment processes exposed to neutral ph conditions which do not require the separation and regeneration of iron by adding low concentrations of iron ions stable iron complexes can trigger the photo fenton like reaction to enhance organic pollutant

5 for fecl3 and different particle sizes that induced different optical fields 3 3 residual h2o2 and enhancement mechanism the h2o2 concentrations were measured during smn degradation in the uv h2o2 process with or without fe coagulants fig 4 greater attenuations of h2o2 concentration were achieved with fe coagulants than in the absence of fe coagulants implying that the addition of fe coagulants can enhance the use of h2o2 during the uv h2o2 process therefore after excluding smn absorption by fe coagulants as well as smn degradation by the ros formed from the dark reactions between the fe coagulants and h2o2 or between soluble fe2 fe3 and h2o2 the principal mechanism by which the fe coagulants enhance the uv h2o2 process should be the photo fenton like reaction between the fe coagulants and h2o2 under uv irradiation this reaction is similar to the heterogeneous photo fenton like reaction using iron containing catalysts this reaction process has been extensively discussed yang et al 2013 zbiljic et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 which can be ascribed to the fe iii on the surface of solid particles being photoreduced into fe ii under uv irradiation the fe ii then accelerates the decomposition of h2o2 in solution to form ros while itself being oxidized to fe iii the principal ros responsible for micropollutant degradation has been verified to be ho zelmanov and semiat 2008 gonzalez olmos et al 2011 faure et al 2012 xu and wang 2011 to further verify this mechanism xps analysis was carried out for the original fe coagulants fe coagulants after uv irradiation and fe coagulants after uv irradiation in the presence of h2o2 for the latter two samples the fe coagulant solutions with or without h2o2 after uv irradiation were filtered by 0 22 μm membranes the filtered substances were dried and collected for xps analysis fig s4 indicates that the binding energies of fe 2p3 2 for all three fe coagulants after uv irradiation in presence of h2o2 were very similar to those of the original fe coagulants but a little higher than those in the absence of h2o2 these demonstrate that the fe iii on the fe coagulant surface was photo reduced to fe ii under uv irradiation based on the standard fe 2p3 2 binding energies of 709 5 ev fe ii and 711 2 ev fe iii wandelt 1982 yet in the presence of h2o2 the fe ii could react with h2o2 rapidly to form fe iii inducing similar binding energies as the original fe coagulants 3 4 particle size distribution considering the effect of particle size could help to further clarify the mechanism associated with the smn degradation enhancement by fe coagulant addition the particle size distributions of the three fe coagulants were measured with a laser particle analyzer fig s5 the three tested fe coagulants had different particle size distributions which could cause different iron contents and specific surface areas i e with surface fe iii in contact with h2o2 molecules to form ho as well as different optical properties i e reflection and scattering of uv photons to generate different optical fields these could lead to complex impacts on smn degradation by the uv h2o2 process therefore it is necessary to analyze the impacts of the iron content and specific surface area of fe coagulant particles with different size ranges as well as the resulting optical field in the solution on the smn degradation 3 5 effect of filtration of fe coagulant solutions the fe coagulant solutions were filtered through membranes with different pore sizes to examine the impact of particle size on smn degradation by the uv h2o2 process table 1 lists the smn degradation rates in the uv h2o2 process with the addition of different fe coagulant filtrates for all three fe coagulants the highest k p values were found for unfiltered solutions with decreasing membrane pore size i e from no filtration to 0 45 μm there was a decrease in the k p value for all three fe coagulants this is reasonable because more fe coagulant particles were filtered through a smaller pore size resulting in smaller enhancements on smn degradation by uv h2o2 the icp oes results fig 5 verified that the iron concentrations of all three fe coagulant filtrates decreased from no filtration to the 0 22 μm membrane although the k p values in all reaction systems with filtrates were lower than those with the unfiltered fe coagulants it is interesting that the k p values for all three 0 22 μm membrane filtrates were significantly higher than those of other filtrates as previously discussed the principal enhancement mechanism was likely the photo fenton like reaction between fe iii on the surface of the fe coagulant particles and h2o2 under uv irradiation thus given a constant h2o2 concentration the enhancement induced by different fe coagulant filtrates should depend on the quantity of fe iii on the coagulant surface and the optical field with decreasing the membrane pore size there was a decrease in the quantity of the fe coagulant particles as verified by the iron concentration measurement via icp oes it is noted that only iron on the particle surface could react with h2o2 to trigger the photon fenton like reaction compared with larger particles smaller particles even colloids have a larger specific surface area therefore given a constant iron concentration in the filtrates smaller particles have more fe iii on the surface resulting in larger enhancements on the uv h2o2 process in other words the fe coagulant enhancement effect is not linearly dependent on the iron concentration although the 0 22 μm membrane filtrate had the lowest iron concentration fig 5 the fe iii on the surface of small coagulant particles and colloids could have a non negligible enhancement effect different size particles with different reflection and scattering properties could induce different optical fields in the filtrates the optical behaviors of a particle suspension at the incident and lateral scattering directions of uv beams could be roughly evaluated using a uv vis spectrometer and a fluorescent spectrometer respectively li et al 2017 in general both a lower absorbance i e a higher transmittance and a higher fluorescent intensity i e a higher lateral scattering intensity could induce a stronger optical field in terms of the photon fluence rate distribution the absorption coefficients and fluorescence intensities of the filtrates are listed in table 2 with decreasing membrane pore size from 10 to 0 45 μm because there were overall fewer particles both the absorbance and fluorescence lateral scattering intensities of all three fe coagulant filtrates decreased when the membrane pore size decreased from 0 45 to 0 22 μm the quantity of fe coagulant particles further decreased leading to a continued decrease in the absorption coefficient and an subsequent increase in the optical field meanwhile the fluorescence intensity increased because smaller particles 0 22 μm can generate a stronger scattering effect the well known tyndall effect introduces a strong scattering if the particle size is similar or lower than the wavelength of the uv light jerlov and kullenberg 1953 beardsley et al 1970 in this study the membrane pore size 0 22 μm was lower than the uv wavelength of 254 nm therefore by removing interference from larger particles 0 22 μm size 0 45 μm an obvious enhancement on the uv optical field by the scattering effect could be observed for the 0 22 μm membrane filtrates compared with the 0 45 μm membrane filtrates therefore smaller particles 0 22 μm could have a lower iron content 0 4 mg l 1 fig 5 a larger specific surface area and a stronger optical scattering effect which could explain the k p acceleration in the 0 22 μm membrane filtrates table 1 3 6 enhancement effect in real water samples two real water samples including the pre coagulation and sand filtered samples from a drinking water treatment plant were employed to examine the practical performance of fe coagulant enhancement on the uv h2o2 process table s2 presents their water quality parameters because of the relatively higher dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations of these samples which strongly competed for ros the smn degradation rates in the uv h2o2 process both with and without fe coagulants in the real water samples fig 6 were lower than those in pure water fig 1 regardless in both real water samples the presence of fe coagulants could induce enhancements on smn degradation in the uv h2o2 process and the degrees of enhancement were similar to those in pure water 3 7 potential applications in this study the heterogeneous photocatalysis by fe coagulants was found to exist in current drinking water treatments this enhanced micropollutant removal by the uv h2o2 process while no catalysis effect was found in common aluminum based coagulants thus this provides additional information for coagulant selection in drinking water treatment previous studies have already investigated the heterogeneous photocatalysis via iron based catalysts i e photon fenton like reaction where difficulties associated with catalyst separation and regeneration limit their practical application in micropollutant removal in drinking water treatment however this limitation can be avoided in this study because fe coagulants are continuously added during drinking water treatment such that the catalyst regeneration is not required 4 conclusions this study investigated the effect of fe coagulants on the degradation of smn a model micropollutant by the uv h2o2 process the experimental results are summarized as follows the addition of fe coagulants pfs pafs and fecl3 significantly enhanced the smn degradation rate constants in the uv h2o2 process the maximum increasing ratio of k p reached 40 fecl3 0 0 5 mg l 1 the enhancement on the uv h2o2 process via fe coagulant addition was ascribed principally to the photo fenton like reaction between fe iii on the surface of fe coagulants and h2o2 under uv irradiation smaller particles 0 22 μm with a lower iron content 0 4 mg l 1 a larger specific surface area and a stronger optical scattering effect yielded stronger enhancements to the uv h2o2 process as compared with larger particles the enhancement effect of fe coagulants was verified in both pre coagulation and sand filtered water samples overall this study explored a green heterogeneous catalysis process that exists in water treatment processes without common catalyst separation and regeneration problems this process has the potential to enhance micropollutant removal during the uv h2o2 advanced treatment of drinking water declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

18159,environmental risk assessment era increasingly relies on speciation modeling of bioavailability heavy metals are the most prevalent pollutants globally and dissolved organic matter dom plays an important role in speciation and bioavailability of heavy metals due to the variation of dom properties in natural aquatic systems improvements to the standard one size fits all approach to modeling metal dom interactions are needed for era in this study we investigate variations in dom and lead pb dom binding in lake tai taihu a large impacted lake in eastern china that is characterized by a complex drainage network and is an important water resource at a regional level and we assess implications of our findings within the context of era needs in our study dom in water samples collected from across the 2 400 km2 area of taihu was characterized using three dimensional excitation emission matrix and synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy spectra the latter being used to calculate conditional stability constants for metal binding parallel factor analysis and peak picking were used to assess contributions of protein and humic like components of dom and fluorescence indices indicative of diagenetic processes were calculated these quantities calculated from spectroscopic studies in addition to water quality parameters were analyzed by bivariate and multivariate analysis results show that different dom components are highly variable across different regions of taihu and bivariate and multivariate analyses confirm that water quality and dom characterization parameters are strongly interrelated this reflects the different inputs diagenetic and transport processes across the large expanse of taihu we find that the conditional stability constant of pb dom binding is strongly affected by the water chemical properties and composition of dom though the conditional stability constant is not itself a parameter that differentiates lake water properties in different regions of the lake the variability of dom composition and pb dom binding strength across taihu is consistent with prior findings that a one size fits all approach to metal dom binding may lead to inaccuracies in commonly used speciation models and therefore such generalized approaches need improvement for regional level era in complex watersheds the approach taken here to obtain site specific metal dom conditional stability constants for use in increasing the accuracy of speciation modeling is fit for purpose for era applications at regional levels because the approach is relatively simple inexpensive and amenable to high throughput analysis graphical abstract image 1 keywords environmental risk assessment dissolved organic carbon pb conditional stability constant taihu fluorescence

harvey 2007 since 2008 according to various reports from the pure earth institute and partners pure earth and green cross 2015 heavy metals topped the list of the world s biggest pollution problems inclusive of health effects with contaminated surface water being a key issue linking pollution to health effects with the increasing levels of contaminants prevalent globally there is an increasing and urgent need to perform accurate era and to be able to set appropriate and site specific or even regional levels for metals that are protective yet not unrealistically conservative fairman et al 1999 janssen et al 2003 ecotoxic response is a consequence of contaminant bioavailability in the environment hence bioavailability has largely become the focus of era particularly for heavy metals avio et al 2015 caussy et al 2003 janssen et al 2003 united states environmental protection agency usepa 2003 speciation modeling is increasingly used to effect streamlined era with the usepa s biotic ligand model now being an accepted approach to heavy metals era niyogi and wood 2004 sander et al 2015 and being used to set water quality criteria i e safe operating levels di toro et al 2001 usepa 2016 the speciation modeling approach is implemented in a number of software packages assessing bioavailability directly through speciation or evaluating toxicity indirectly through speciation e g gustafsson 2014 for many metals complexation which reduces bioavailability and therefore risk is primarily determined by complexation with dissolved organic matter dom in natural systems complexation can be quantified using chemical speciation models baken et al 2011 boggs et al 1985 mostofa et al 2013a yamashita and jaffé 2008 zhang et al 2017 kothawala et al 2014 have summarized the importance of dom s role in biogeochemical processes and the global carbon cycle with particular emphasis on lakes as lakes may be viewed as sinks that may be used as catchment level indicators that receive and process dom from catchment areas substantially greater than the area of any given lake itself there is a growing consensus that speciation models do not always adequately predict metal dom binding due to the variable nature of dom ahmed et al 2014 in this study we investigate the relationships between commonly measured water quality parameters and readily obtainable metrics characterizing dom to better understand the influences on metal dom binding the specific focus is to have an approach that is fit for purpose regarding era in freshwater our study area is lake tai hereafter designated as taihu after 太湖 in chinese a system that is large enough 2 400 km2 to reflect regional scale processes has a complex aquatic ecosystem sun and mao 2008 and a long history of anthropogenic impacts qin et al 2007 within commonly used speciation models dissolved organic carbon doc usually in units of mg l is the primary component that is a model input and is used to represent dom i e dom is quantified as doc chen et al 2003 fundamentally the difficulty in modeling metal dom interactions arises because dom is a heterogeneous mixture of aromatic and aliphatic organic compounds of varied origin leenheer and croué 2003 nebbioso and piccolo 2013 zhang et al 2014 two common approaches to quantify metal dom binding and attendant metal bioavailability include the stockholm humic model shm gustafsson 2001 and the windemere humic acid model wham tipping 1994 and 1998 while the details of these models and model calculations are quite complicated the key point is that these models rely on conditional stability constants k cond which originate from thermodynamic quantities and are a quantity described as a constant that reflects the strength of the interaction between metal and dom in coming together to form a complex see section 2 5 below models such as shm and wham hold the assumption that for humic and fulvic acids ha and fa respectively a single constant describes metal binding with phenolic and carboxylic acid type sites within ha and fa therefore we refer to such an approach as a one size fits all approach the varying characteristics of dom that relate to its origin environmental conditions and aging processes have driven much work devoted to characterizing dom to provide a better understanding of metal dom complexation leenheer and croué 2003 he et al 2015 kikuchi et al 2017 mostofa et al 2013a ren et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 natural waters with dom that deviates in composition or binding strength from current model assumptions and specifications inherent in the one size fits all approach will therefore not be amenable to accurate calculation of speciation and assessment of risk ahmed et al 2014 mostofa et al 2013a in addition to being abundant pollutants heavy metals are among the most toxic lead pb is ranked as the most abundant pollutant in the world today pure earth and green cross 2015 also historically see tong et al 2000 and was selected as a model for our study pb s prevalence is aggravated by its particular toxicity to children grandjean and landrigan 2014 and the global annual costs of childhood pb exposure from cognitive defects alone are estimated to be 1 15 trillion us dollars most of which is borne by low and middle income countries grandjean and bellange 2017 cognitive defects are only one of several cost categories and even for cognitive defects this estimate does not consider cognitive losses within the normal range which a recent sensitivity analysis suggests may result in a 200 fold underestimate for costs of pb exposure from cognitive defects to children attina and trasande 2013 the risk of pb s entering the food chain increases as its concentration rises in water and soil the usepa has set the maximum allowable level for pb in drinking water at a concentration of 15 ppb usepa 2002 and in china the maximum allowable level is 10 ppb mhprc 2006 however though limits are set literature shows that no safe level of pb exposure exists grandjean 2010 pb precipitates to insoluble species under alkaline conditions and conversely the increasing occurrence of acid rain in some areas of the world notably china has enhanced the release of pb into water and soil solution du et al 2014 larssen et al 2006 li et al 2015 studies have shown that dom plays an important role in the fate and biogeochemical cycling of metal ion in the aquatic environment christensen et al 1999 mostofa et al 2013a mueller et al 2012 reuter and perdue 1977 zhang et al 2014 we have previously demonstrated that the effect of ha binding with pb on pb bioavailability may be modeled with high accuracy zhang et al 2017 however we find that when dom compositions deviate from assumptions regarding ha and fa that are implemented in commonly used software packages bioavailability hence risk is under predicted which raises questions about a one size fits all approach to metal dom binding for era the circumstance is generally known and recent studies have noted inadequacies in extant approaches to modeling metal dom binding and call for site specific binding parameters to ensure that era modeling meets environmental management needs ahmed et al 2014 mueller et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 hence we wish to study the interaction between pb and dom to provide a better understanding of pb bioavailability and risk in natural waters common techniques for the characterization of dom and metal dom binding include voltammetry sander et al 2011 2015 fluorescence mostofa et al 2013b uv vis spectroscopy birdwell and engel 2010 fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance ultra high resolution or triple quadrupole mass spectrometry with electrospray ionization boija et al 2014 d andrilli et al 2010 kujawinski et al 2009 and different ultrafiltration and resin fractionation techniques combined with chemical analysis chow et al 2004 among these techniques fluorescence spectroscopy has high sensitivity is rapid and is semi quantitative to quantitative chen et al 2003 marhaba 2000 mostofa et al 2013b sanchez et al 2014 and consequently is increasingly used to characterize properties and provenance of dom in natural waters coble et al 1990 fellman et al 2010 hudson et al 2007 mostofa et al 2013b additionally the fluorescence characterization of metal dom binding has been demonstrated using high throughput analysis neculita et al 2011 which is highly cost effective and would be ideal for the era needs three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3deem fluorescence spectroscopy coble et al 2014 and synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy sfs are two techniques in particular that have been widely used to probe the chemical structure of dom and to investigate water pollution baker 2001 baker et al 2004 manciulea et al 2009 mostofa et al 2013b wu et al 2003 it is well known that dom fluorescence is quenched by heavy metals via both static and dynamic mechanisms lakowicz 2006 often dominated by static quenching for bivalent metals that form strong complexes with organic fluorophores cabaniss 1992 esteves da silva et al 1998 quenching measured by sfs is proportional to metal complexation and this phenomenon has become well established in fluorescence quenching titrations as a method to determine k cond of complexation cabaniss 1992 esteves da silva et al 1998 fu et al 2007 heibati et al 2017 lu and jaffé 2001 ryan and weber 1982a and b in this study we use 3deem fluorescence spectroscopy and sfs to characterize dom and pb dom interactions respectively for water samples across taihu the third largest freshwater lake in china the taihu basin drains an extensively modified and heavily managed catchment of over 36 000 km2 characterized by a complex network of drainage channels dikes flood gates and pumping stations around the lake water draining into taihu reflects inputs from the extensive catchment and the discharge flows into the shanghai area i e one of the largest metropolitan areas on earth meanwhile the lake itself is an important drinking water source for approximately 11 million people xu et al 2017 and is also of importance in flood control for tourism and for aquaculture gong and lin 2009 qin et al 2007 as such taihu holds a crucial place in regional water security with more than 170 rivers and streams draining into taihu there is a substantial exogenous contribution to dom in some parts of the taihu ecological system at the same time the size and relative biological productivity of taihu entails that there is much endogenous contribution to dom as well particularly given that taihu has experienced harmful algal blooms habs every year since the mid 1980s sun and mao 2008 these habs have had a strong influence on the chemical nature and amount of dom particularly in the northern part of the lake zhang et al 2014 in consequence of the highly variable sources of dom across the very large lacustrine system there is potential to observe highly variable dom properties throughout the lake yao et al 2011 and therefore different effects of metal dom binding and conditional stability constants for reasons described above there is a great immediacy and importance to develop streamlined approaches to era particularly for pb with a current impediment being development of a rapid method to obtain site specific k conds for use in era models for regions that exhibit high variability in k cond in this work we 1 characterize the spatial distribution and variability of dom across taihu i e at regional scale 2 study the binding capacity of dom with pb in different parts of the lake to understand regional variability in k cond and 3 explore whether we can elucidate factors controlling pb dom complexation i e whether there are relationships between dom fluorescence properties water quality indicators and k cond that provide insights on variability in k cond we find that k cond varies over two orders of magnitude at the regional level contrary to established assumptions behind one size fits all models of metal dom binding in current era speciation models that hold k cond constant and that k cond varies in a manner that is consistent with other factors affecting dom and water quality unlike other works that have studied metal dom complexation with fluorescence spectroscopic techniques our approach specifically addresses the needs of era in development of more accurate yet rapid streamlined era modeling this work is novel as we do not know of any other studies that have employed such a wide array of indicators that might provide insights into k cond variability or have used the approach that we use in the framework of era our results are proof of principle that the approach we adduce is sufficiently rapid and adaptable to be fit for purpose with respect to era applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area sampling sites and field measurements taihu is a shallow polymictic mean depth 2 m lake located in the yangzte river delta in east china a rapidly developing urban and economic region with 0 4 of the land area of china over 40 million inhabitants and 13 of the nation s gdp qin et al 2010 yang and liu 2010 in result taihu is characterized as hypertrophic qin et al 2007 due to the influx of nutrient rich wastes from urban agricultural and industrial activities within the taihu watershed sun and mao 2008 in addition to the highly variable sources of dom to taihu the characteristics of dom are expected to be affected by the water retention time wrt which has been reported to be on the order of 5 10 months qin et al 2004 2007 as the lake is so large the wrt is also variable in different regions of the lake urban pollutants discharge into northern taihu runoff sources are largely from the western and southwestern mountains and outflows are located throughout east taihu fig 1 a shows the tributaries drainage network for taihu and prevailing summer current pattern qin et al 2007 the greatest inflow rivers are the chendong xitiaoxi west tiaoxi net inflow and yincun in the west southeast though approximately 60 of river water inflow comes from western rivers along the yixing shore fig 1b qin et al 2007 sun and mao 2008 xu and qin 2005 the main outflow rivers are taipu accounting for 50 of the total outflow volume xinyun and xujiang in the east southeast qin et al 2007 by far the largest flow is the taipu river which results in shorter wrt times in the south in consequence of inputs and residence times water quality is better in the south and the southeastern part of lake than in the north qin et al 2007 water samples from 32 monitoring stations in taihu that are monitored by niglas nanjing institute of geography and limnology chinese academy of sciences quarterly zhang and chen 2011 were collected in august 2017 fig 1b this sampling time was chosen to occur at the height of what has become a yearly occurrence of a cyanobacterial hab in the north northwestern part of the lake the yearly hab occurrence commences in the northern part of the lake in the meiliang bay area where stations sts 1 3 4 and 5 are located fig 1b spreading toward the south and east thereafter despite the frequent habs the southeastern region of the lake is typically characterized by relatively clear water with floating and submersed macrophytes qin et al 2007 the inflows and outflows of the lake are complex due to the networked nature of the watercourses connected to the lake sun and mao 2008 however the hab is associated with inflow of nutrient polluted waters and its spread follows the predominant pattern of summer circulation as shown in fig 1a qin et al 2007 at each station a 1 5 l water sample was collected from 0 2 m

a 150 w xenon arc lamp light source and a pmt detector with voltage set at 700 v for 3deem fluorescence spectra 3 d being excitation emission and intensity hereafter eem chen et al 2003 the excitation wavelength range was scanned from 200 to 450 nm at 5 nm intervals and the emission wavelength was scanned from 300 to 550 nm in 2 nm increments for sfs quenching titration experiments to study pb dom complexation esteves da silva et al 1998 fu et al 2007 spectra were recorded scanning the excitation and emission monochromators over a 200 nm range starting at 250 nm with a δλ 20 nm offset using a 5 nm slit width and a scan speed of 1200 nm min 1 titration was carried out by adding a series of pb spikes final concentrations ranging from 9 5 10 7 to 3 8 10 5 m to subsamples from each sample of the 32 stations ph was adjusted to 7 00 0 05 by adding mops buffer zhang et al 2017 prior to analysis all samples were kept 24 h at room temperature in the dark to ensure complexation and avoid photolytic reactions a sample of commercially available ha 8 mg l 1 alfa aesar tianjin china was also analyzed under the same conditions albeit without adding pb in order to have a comparator for spectral features 2 4 parallel factor analysis modeling stedmon et al 2003 demonstrated the use of parallel factor parafac analysis of eem spectra to decompose or unmix the complex mixture of dom fluorophores into contributions from underlying component fractions without any assumptions about the spectral shape or number of contributing components in recent decades this method has been widely used for the characterization of dom doc from both freshwater and marine aquatic environments cory and mcknight 2005 kowalczuk et al 2009 yamashita et al 2008 with regard to lakes in particular parafac has been used to study land use change environmental processing of dom ecological processes taking place within and among lakes and lake stratification and spatial variation in dom sources within lakes jaffé et al 2004 the parafac model decomposes an eem spectrum as follows 1 x i j k f 1 f a i f b j f c k f e i j k where x ijk is an array with the fluorescence intensity for the ith sample at emission wavelength j and excitation wavelength k the summation includes a set of trilinear terms a if directly proportional to the concentration of the fth analyte in the ith sample b jf is linearly related to the emission spectra at wavelengths j for the fth analyte and c kf is linearly proportional to the specific absorption coefficient at excitation wavelength k the term e ijk represents an array containing the model residuals for samples that have a wide range of doc concentrations a correlation of components may arise artefactually in proportion to doc to avoid that the computational package used to perform parafac analysis stardom pucher et al 2019 is implemented so that samples may be normalized to doc for determination of components with normalization being later reversed by multiplying samples loadings for each component with normalization factors 2 5 theory of fluorescence quenching titrations fluorescence quenching is defined as any process that decreases the fluorescence intensity of a sample lakowicz 2006 there are many mechanisms by which quenching occurs e g excited state reactions inner filter effect autoabsorption proportional to the optical density of the sample at excitation and emission wavelengths self and or intramolecular absorbance collisional dynamic quenching and static quenching collisional dynamic quenching occurs when an excited state fluorophore experiences non reactive contact with a species in solution e g chloride oxygen that facilitates non radiative relaxation to ground state static quenching occurs when for example complexation between a metal ion and the main binding sites of dom occurs and causes non radiative relaxation studies have shown that both fluorescence lifetime lakowicz 2006 and thermal quenching carstea et al 2014 are useful in elucidating more definitive information on quenching mechanisms and properties of macromolecular organic fluorophores due to the manifold processes that may be affecting fluorescence the use of quenching titrations is operationally bolstered by common matrix i e when spiking metal into a sample solution the only thing that is changing is metal concentration the complexation reaction is described by charges omitted 2a m l m l where m is the metal pb here l represents a complexing ligand in this case dom and ml is the complex pb dom this chemical reaction is governed by the equilibrium expression 2b k c o n d m l m l where binding is assumed to form 1 1 complexes and brackets denote concentrations of the ml complex uncomplexed metal ion and uncomplexed ligand respectively the quenching of dom fluorescence by complexation with a metal ion can be described by the modified stern volmer equation esteves da silva et al 1998 according to 3 i 0 δ i 1 f k c o n d c m 1 f where δi i 0 i i 0 and i are the fluorescence intensities of the sample with and without m pb present f is the fraction of i 0 that corresponds to the fluorescent portion of dom that participates in binding k cond is the conditional stability constant for the reaction shown in 2 and c m is the total metal pb concentration equation 3 may be plotted as a line for which i 0 δi c m 1 f k cond and 1 f are the ordinate abscissa slope and intercept respectively thus k cond and f are estimated from the slope and intercept of the linear plot an alternate expression for static quenching ryan and weber 1982b is 4 i i m l 100 2 k c o n d c l k c o n d c l k c o n d c m 1 k c o n d c l k c o n d c m 1 2 4 k c o n d 2 c l c m 100 where i ml is the fluorescence intensity in i e when data is expressed such that i 0 100 at which further addition of quencher produces no further diminution of fluorescence intensity and c l is the total concentration of ligand this expression has two new parameters however the parameter i ml is related to the parameter f in equation 3 since when i ml is expressed in decimal percent i ml f 1 hence equation 4 is used in problems seeking to understand complexing capacity in addition to the magnitude of conditional stability constants boguta et al 2016 esteves da silva et al 1998 for 4 parameter solutions are determined using non linear regression analysis plotting i versus c m expression 3 was developed to capture non idealities deviations from linearity in stern volmer plots another commonly used expression to address this issue that also relies on non linear regression is 5 i 0 i 1 f 1 k c o n d c m i m l where i ml is decimal carraway et al 1991 and non linear regression is performed on an i 0 i versus c m plot comparison of results from different equations are useful due to the variability in error structure arising from different functional forms when collisional dynamic quenching occurs simultaneously to complexation between a metal and dom nonlinearity of i 0 i versus c m plots away from x axis is observed the expression used in this case is carraway et al 1991 6 i 0 i 1 k c o n d d c m 1 k c o n d c m where k c o n d d is the constant for collisional or dynamic quenching and parameters are determined via nonlinear regression carraway et al 1991 2 6 data treatment and calculations the r r core team 2019 package stardom pucher et al 2019 with associated packages in r helwig 2019 massicotte 2019 wickham et al 2019 wickham and henry 2019 was used for analysis of eem spectra fluorescence peaks and indices calculated

peaks see vignette pucher 2019 raman normalization was not performed in accordance with findings of mostofa mostofa et al 2013b for readers who would like to have the data or the data in raman units we include raw eem spectra in the supplementary material sm parafac analysis was also conducted and provides similar but different data as from peak picking coble peaks namely that decomposition of spectral components via parafac analysis avoids spectral overlap and can provide exploratory results beyond the pre determined coble peaks murphy et al 2013 normalization and subsequent inverse normalization section 2 4 was performed for parafac analysis and results were subsequently validated via analysis of residuals split half analysis and comparison with similar systems bro 1997 openfluor was used for the latter murphy et al 2014 sfs data were analyzed by linear excel and nonlinear origin regression analysis using 3 4 5 and 6 additional data analysis included pair wise correlation analysis multiple regression and principle component analysis pca these were performed using the corrplot factominer factoextra fields leaps plot3d rcorr and stats calculation and visualization packages in r alboukadel and fabian 2017 harrell et al 2015 karline 2017 lumley 2017 nychka et al 2017 r core team 2019 sebastien et al 2008 taiyun and viliam 2017 to perform these calculations results from physical and chemical analysis of water samples were combined with results from analysis of eem data and results for k cond into a single multivariate data set additional details on calculations are given in the sm under the section headings for each different type of data 3 results and discussion 3 1 water quality and conditions results for individual measurements of 22 physical and chemical parameters for the 32 samples in different regions of taihu are given in the sm table s1 along with results for total dissolved pb and for brevity are summarized here the ph in the lake was somewhat high ranging from 7 90 to 8 35 which has been attributed to inorganic carbon scavenging by phytoplankton as a result of habs fang et al 2018 ma et al 2014 2015 the chl a concentrations ranged from 8 to 240 μg l 1 with higher chl a concentrations occurring in hab impacted areas of the lake and a number of parameters follow the general motif of being higher in hab impacted areas and vice versa fig 2 shows selected contour maps for chl a doc cod tn tp and tn tp to illustrate these general trends the higher concentration of the nutrients is the main driver that leads to habs which in turn may be associated with elevated chl a cod and doc concentrations chl a has a higher correlation with cod than bod which is likely a result of processes that affect the reworking of organic matter from habs note we treat bod cod doc and chl as indicators of om primary productivity indicators correlations are discussed in more detail in section 3 6 the regions that suffered from hab are not entirely co located with the distribution of tn and tp this is an outcome of transport hydrodynamics in the lake the predominant inflow of river water from the west northwest and outflow of water to the east ensures a trend of mass movement counterclockwise from the northern part of taihu to the locale of the largest outflow at the taipu river additionally in summer the prevailing winds from the southeast or southwest generate surface currents that manifest in localized counter clock wise rotation fig 1a see arrows pointing northeast and northwest to the north and south of the island in the lake qin et al 2000 qin et al 2007 these simultaneous phenomena have a strong impact on the distribution of hab and hab associated water quality parameters in the northern and western areas of the lake 3 2 fluorescence properties of taihu dom a variety of approaches have been used to analyze eem data and we consider results for three of these here 1 an early approach adduced by coble involving quantifying the intensity of local maxima of fluorescence corresponding to different components of dom eem peak picking 2 calculation of fluorescent indices flind 3 use of parafac analysis to decompose eem matrices into different spectral components the last decade has seen an increasing shift to parafac analysis of eems jaffé et al 2014 murphy et al 2013 this approach is analogous to quantification of coble peaks however it can reveal the presence of additional local maxima as well as provide improved resolution of the peaks found in analysis of raw eems data see sm for additional information on parafac analysis based on several decades of work on the characterization of dom the common fluorophores in dom that are identifiable by fluorescence peaks in different regions of eems are classified into tyrosine like amino sugar tryptophan like proteins and peptides and ha fa like materials mostofa et al 2013b peak nomenclatures typically follow either the early nomenclature of coble or the more recent terminology of mostofa coble 1996 mostofa et al 2013b in the mostofa terminology regions a and c are associated with humic substances with fas having lower emission wavelengths than has for any given sample and the t and tuv regions are associated with protein like dom with the lower emission wavelengths for each region being tyrosine like and higher emission wavelengths being tryptophan like as shown in fig 3 for the coble terminology coble 1996 coble peaks a and c are coincident with mostofa s peak a and peak c respectively coble terminology does not encompass tuv peaks and in coble terminology the mostofa t peaks are subdivided into t higher emission wavelength tryptophan like and b lower emission wavelength tyrosine like peaks coble terminology also distinguishes an m peak that is a subclass of mostofa s peak c region designating a peak that occurs at a slightly lower excitation wavelength than the primary c like peak mostofa recognizes subclasses of the peak c region m mp and w see mostofa et al 2013b for further details the eems for the 32 stations are given in the sm fig s1 and selected examples are shown in fig 4 in fig s1 the eems samples from all stations display peak t and peak tuv protein like dom and generally the highest intensities are seen for these peaks though even visually it is apparent that for sts 9 and 15 these contributions are low particularly in the tyrosine like portion of the eem spectrum see eem for st 9 in fig 4 sts 9 and 15 are the only two stations that are technically not in taihu these stations are in wuli bay which was an arm of taihu until a gate was built to separate it from taihu wuli bay is now not considered as a watercourse connected to taihu all the samples also had a peak a contribution of varying intensity e g contrast st 9 and st 13 in fig 4 however peak c is weak or absent from visual inspection of the eems for around a third of the samples e g st 13 in fig 4 strong protein like fluorescence has often been reported in water bodies that experienced habs haas and wild 2010 moffett 1995 and protein like fluorescence is also associated with wastewater i e from wastewater treatment plants wwtps e g see sorensen et al 2018 many studies have demonstrated that excretion by habs may contribute significantly to the dom pool bertilsson and jones 2003 moffett 1995 yao et al 2011 zhang et al 2007 2009 since the highly labile dom leached from algae is consumed very rapidly the algae produced dom is not likely to persist in the environment and thus except under specific conditions this bioavailable pool of algae produced dom that predominates in the hab dominated summer environment of taihu is not expected to make up a significant fraction of the dom in natural unimpacted waters chen and wangersky 1996 hansen et al 2016 moreira et al 2011 a shift in composition violating this assumption would be one reason for speciation models to fail to predict bioavailability 3 3 coble peaks and fluorescence indices table s2 sm contains results for quantification of coble peaks and the flind for 27 of 32 samples the quantification of coble peaks a b c m and t shows the order b t a m c for fluorescence intensity indicating that protein like b and t tyrosine and tryptophan compounds are the important components of dom in taihu at the time of sampling two of the five exceptions are sts 9 and 15 which have the lowest and second lowest respectively intensities for t and tuv of all stations the other exceptions are sts 10 16 and 17 along the western yixin shoreline where the greatest density of water from the massif region in the western taihu basin feeds into taihu these stations all have slightly differing relative proportions of b and t and still show the trend a m c the metrics hix bix and fi have been developed to characterize the origin and transformation degree of dom huguet et al 2009 mcknight et al 2001 hix is based on the concept that emission spectra will shift toward longer wavelengths as humification of dom proceeds fellman et al 2010 the hix values for all the samples from taihu are below 1 which indicates this dom is mainly associated with biological or autochthonous material with a quite low humification degree huguet et al 2009 and is consistent with findings for coble peaks and our parafac model vide infra the average hix value is 0 52 and only sts 9 10 15 16 and 17 have a hix value greater than 0 6 st 17 is near sts 10 and 16 where there is greater influx hence a slightly greater allochthonous contribution to dom may be anticipated at these stations zhang et al 2012 the bix index was calculated as a characteristic of autochthonous biological activity in water samples the bix values in our study range from 0 87 to 1 13 huguet et al 2009 showed that values from 0 8 to 1 represent the dom associated with a strong autochthonous component and values greater than 1 are indicative of biological production of strongly labile organic matter of 32 stations all have a bix higher than 0 8 and 24 display a bix value higher than 1 indicating the presence of freshly released dom huguet et al 2009 in this study the bix and hix indices show a small range of values and a negative correlation indicating that the dom in taihu was strongly affected by autochthonous contributions freshly released in origin and likely caused by the hab in the lake these findings might be subject to debate however for instance microcystis spp are typically the dominant genus found in taihu habs and yang et al 2016 found that when growing microcystis aeruginosa in lab culture bix values may drop from 1 to 0 2 in early exponential phase growth yang et al 2016 similar comments pertain to our results for fi mcknight et al 2001 developed the fi for predicting the precursor source and chemical properties of fa for our samples the fi values range from 1 39 to 1 71 fi values of 1 9 consistently appear in dom from rivers that have terrestrially derived dom sources mcknight et al 2001 taihu is a very large lake with many inflowing rivers that may transport ha fa components of dom into the lake however the fi may not be representative of the source of non ha fa components of the dom 3 4 eem parafac components of taihu dom parafac analysis was used to decompose eems into components corresponding to dom fluorophores bro 1997 murphy et al 2013 fig 5 panels a to d display four different components designated as comp1 to comp4 which are the composite components obtained from parafac analysis see sm for details the component breakdowns for each sample are given in table s3 of the sm in fig 5 panels e to h we compare composite spectra from our results to representative results from the literature obtained from the openfluor database murphy et al 2014 and to a composite for each component obtained from the data in the extensive review published by mostofa et al 2013b details concerning mostofa composites the full suite of openfluor results and individual results for eems from each of the 32 samples are given in the sm fig s2 and s3 the spectra of the four components in our study agree very well to those of dom reported in other aquatic environments based on comparison to published data see extended data in sm also see results for split half analysis fig s4 the eem for comp1 show peaks at λ ex 223 and 280 nm λ em 320 nm corresponding to the tuv and t peaks with aromatic protein tyrosine like fluorescence mostofa et al 2013b this component has been reported to arise from the degradation products of autochthonously produced dom such as phytoplankton catalán et al 2013 yao et al 2011 zhang et al 2009 and the short wrt for taihu coupled with cyclic habs is one reason why the ratio of protein like to fa ha like dom might be overall higher in taihu in the eem of comp2 there were two excitation maxima λ ex 230 nm and 285 nm at λ em 347 nm consistent with tryptophan like fluorescence in peak tuv and peak t mostofa et al 2010 yamashita et al 2008 reported that comp2 is comprised of labile components produced by autochthonous biological production comp3 has λ ex 210 240 and 315 nm and λ em 408 nm corresponding to the fa like fluorescence of peak a and peak c respectively fu et al 2010 parlanti et al 2000 zhang et al 2009 comp4 is also composed of two peaks with λ ex 261 and 364 nm λ em 465 nm the first peak lies within the spectral area of peak a and the second one peak c region both peaks fall into the category of ha like fluorescence mostofa et al 2005 ohno and bro 2006 unlike the coble peaks we do not see a consistent pattern of progression for the different components to the relative composition of the eems in common with findings for coble peaks sts 9 10 15 16 and 17 have the lowest contributions from the tyrosine like component and tryptophan like components sts 10 16 and 17 located at and below the outflow of zhushan bay a polluted bay chen 2008 have cumulatively the highest amounts of the ha like component other extrema differ from those seen in the coble peaks for instance st 13 has the greatest amount of the tyrosine like component and st 6 has the highest amount of both tryptophan like dom st 13 is closest to the city of wuxi having a population of 4 9 million people and st 6 is near the mouth of a tributary and in meiliang bay which is typically the area of taihu most polluted affected by habs 3 5 complexation of pb by taihu dom compared with eem sfs shows narrower peak widths is easier to use for identification and minimizes the chance for false determinations or omissions of specific spectral features meanwhile the process of obtaining sfs is much faster than eem dreischuh et al 2015 sfs is a simple sensitive and nondestructive technique that has been successfully used to rapidly characterize the interactions between heavy metals and dom esteves da silva et al 1998 ryan and weber 1982b zhang et al 2014 numerous studies have used fluorescence quenching titrations to investigate the binding properties of heavy metals with dom e g fu et al 2007 manciulea et al 2009 wu et al 2011 yamashita and jaffé 2008 preliminary evaluation confirmed that the samples used for this study were suitable for quenching titration studies fluorescence quenching was observed after the addition of pb and no fluorescence enhancement was observed under the experimental conditions fig 6 a shows an example of fluorescence quenching of dom by pb as a function of pb concentration for st 1 sfs spectra for the 32 samples are all characterized by a similar spectral shape but by differences in relative intensity see fig s5 in sm all sfs spectra for this study showed two peaks at wavelengths of λ 290 nm peak i and λ 414 nm peak ii fig 6b displays a sfs spectrum for commercially purchased ha in which we see that the sfs for ha is considerably more complex than the sfss for our samples however peaks i and ii from our samples have corresponding features in the ha sfs marked by arrows in each plot fig 6c shows the modified stern volmer plot for data extracted from fig 6a the sfs spectra for 32 stations were analyzed using stern volmer analysis as described in sections 2 5 and 2 6 to obtain f k cond and c l the binding strength for these fluorophores with metals may vary according to dom composition ryan and weber 1982a zhang et al 2014 resulting in variations of k cond for different samples values of k cond and f based on data from sfs quenching titrations for the samples from 32 stations of taihu are summarized in table 1 for peak ii note see table s4 and discussion in the sm for information regarding peak i for the majority of samples the intensity of peak i or the magnitude of change during quenching titration was too small for estimation of k cond the peak ii k cond values vary over a range of 4 64 6 50 these results indicate that pb has a complexation affinity for dom that varies by approximately two orders of magnitude far from fitting the assumption that k cond is effectively invariant and that therefore a constant k cond is universally suitable for speciation models used in era see table s5 in the sm for literature k conds of some dom components in the present study we also calculated c l however in many cases the expression used for this was over parameterized e g see esteves da silva et al 1998 hence values for those samples are not reported 3 6 relationships between water quality dom properties and conditional stability constants fig 7 shows results for spearman s ρ from pairwise correlation analysis for parameters including water quality parameters of dom characterization and logk cond for pb dom complexation results are plotted in clusters according to a matrix hierarchical clustering algorithm implemented in r the p value levels associated with each ρ are given in table s6 of the sm for all but two pairs ρ 0 55 are all associated with p values 0 001 for the two exceptions 0 001 p value 0 05 we expect there may be some trends based on end member mixing from various sources of conservative quantities e g ions that are not reactive or less reactive coupled with the imprint of changes in reactive species that reflect dynamic processes in the water column e g changes in nutrients and chl a accordingly there are strong relationships between na k cl and so4 2 bottom right corner fig 7 a retrospective study of water in taihu spanning six decades yu et al 2013 reports that inputs from these ions have changed greatly as a result of increases to the surrounding population base and concomitant pollution to the lake increases in k have occurred in part due to the large fertilizer load and so4 2 due to atmospheric deposition of so2 as h2so4 from coal and combustion byproducts the ions na and cl are partly linked to outflow from domestic wwtps though cl is also input from industrial pollution and wastewater treatment yu et al 2013 and to some extent all of these ions are associated with mixed pollution sources while ions represent more conservative tracers of water source and mixing they are not independent of other quantities and there are strong relationships between na and cl with doc in part consistent with wwtp sources and to a lesser extent bod cod and chl a habs while so4 2 na and cl all have negative associations with no2 bottom right and left of fig 7 respectively no2 is one of the most highly correlated parameters with significant relationships p value 0 01 to all dissolved nutrients positive as well as cod and do left edge fig 7 one report indicates that no2 concentrations from runoff from the western mountains can be exceptionally high consistent with the idea that no2 is not associated with ion pollutant signatures hampel et al 2018 there are strong positive relationships between various indicators of dom productivity with total nutrients and k all of which are consistent with expectations of organic matter and agricultural runoff serving as a source of needed carbon and nutrients that drive habs bottom left and right fig 7 for comparison see for instance paerl et al 2011 xu et al 2010 zhang et al 2019 total and dissolved forms of nutrients generally have strong relationships with each other top and bottom right fig 7 respectively in some cases i e no2 correlates with no3 the two quantities are different however correlation is consistent with common provenance in other cases the correlation is obviously spurious as for instance no2 and no3 are both constituents of tdn the theme of common provenance may also be invoked in considering some relationships between parafac components coble peaks and fluorescence indices though there also begins to be a clear indication of different types of dom comp4 hix and coble peaks a c and m and to a lesser extent comp3 all show positive relationships with each other and are indicators of fa and ha dominated dom upper right fig 7 whereas comp1 comp2 bix and coble peaks b and t show positive relationships with each other and are indicators of protein dominated dom middle right fig 7 see for instance coble 1996 stedmon et al 2003 the weak positive relationships of protein like indicators with bix is consistent with an autochthonous contribution of these quantities to dom while the stronger relationship of hix with fa ha like indicators is more consistent with allochthonous contributions to dom the middle portion of fig 7 has a cluster of largely negative relationships wherein fa ha dominated dom is inversely correlated with protein dominated dom doc does not correlate with any parafac components coble peaks or fluorescence indices if considering doc as a heterogeneous and macromolecular system that is generalizable in chemical behavior i e fixed reactivity in respect of metal complexation as is the case for the era speciation models in common use this might be a surprising result in contrast if doc is considered more in the framework of an assemblage possibly with separate fa ha versus aromatic protein like constituents or possibly a wider variation of functional group compositions associated with macromolecules it is not surprising that doc does not correlate with any of those parameters in the latter case there is no reason why fa ha composition should be perforce linked to protein like dom indicators and therefore different substituents of dom would not necessarily correlate with doc itself additionally reactivity of dom with metals might vary greatly as well in keeping with this supposition logk cond has among the fewest correlations ranked in the bottom octile with ρ only exceeding 0 4 for comp1 0 41 and hix 0 45 as k cond is the primary parameter of focus for use in speciation models that support era we were interested to further explore any relationships that might exist between the other parameters and k cond we performed multiple regression analysis and were not able to find a predictive model for k cond using the entire dataset due to collinearities reduction of the dataset resulted in optimal predictivity at 24 parameters fig 8 a past this optimum further reduction in parameters resulted in inferior correlation and increase in p values as the number of parameters used in prediction was reduced the number of permutations of parameters that would produce a model of equally good correlation ρ and p value increases permutational analysis performed using the leaps function in r we find that depending on the level of accuracy desired eight parameters provide an adequate predictor of k cond as shown in fig 8a from permutational analysis of subsets of the data we find a reasonable degree of variability in the multiple regression equation that will predict k cond though we consistently find that parameters including a mixture of water chemistry coble peaks parafac components and flind provide similar predictions of k cond as to those shown in fig 8a the process of examining multiple regression is useful to support an understanding that k cond depends on water quality parameters and doc fraction in a rational manner that as with pairwise correlation results in fig 7 speak to the different water inputs to the lake as well as processes affecting the diagenesis of dom fig 8b shows the variation of logk cond across taihu the highest values for logk cond are associated with sites that have strong allochthonous contributions natural and anthropogenic meiliang bay the taige caoqiao rivers the changxingxin river and the xitiaoxi river mouths there is also an area of elevated values near the taipu river mouth the taipu river is the location of taihu s main outflow however this region of the shoreline also historically was the site of extensive and long standing aquaculture activity cao et al 2007 pca is often used to analyze multivariate data as this approach to maximization of inherent data set variance in some cases allows discrimination of different groupings or patterns in the data along with indications of which individual parameters most influence same three main principal components pc1 pc2 and pc3 account for the majority of the variance in the original data set see sm rather than being constituted of a few contributing parameters pc1 pc3 each have a relatively large number of contributing parameters see fig s7 in the sm pc1 accounts for 24 of the total data set variance and is characterized by low contributions 4 to 10 of 12 parameters nutrients and ions among 35 parameters pc2 explains 19 of the total variance and is mainly associated with low contributions 3 8 of 14 parameters some dom components flind dom productivity indicators total nutrients pc3 accounts for 13 of the total variance and is again comprised of low contributions 3 10 of 15 parameters similar to pc2 however with different degrees of contribution see sm for further details on pca fig 9 is a 3 dimensional plot of pc1 pc3 with the 32 stations labelled there is one main cluster that is ellipsoidal vertices of the major axis of the ellipse may be thought of as endpoints reflecting circulation patterns in taihu based on the stations nearest to each i e sts 1 and 4 at one vertex and sts 26 28 at the other some stations nearest to inputs of large rivers are off axis to or highly separated from the main cluster these include st 6 near a river mouth in meiliang bay sts 9 and 15 in wuli bay and sts 10 16 and 17 which are all adjacent to the shoreline where the rivers from the northwestern highlands feed into the lake most of the parameters in the dataset contribute overall to one or more of the three pcs and these parameters therefore constitute a relatively large group of indicators that cumulatively characterize different areas of the lake a notable exception is k cond for all three pcs the contribution of k cond is either one of the lowest or the lowest of all parameters based on analysis of preliminary data prior to performing the present study and a limited elementary effects sensitivity analysis that we performed on the data reported here we find that results obtained from the methods of multi variate analysis that we describe are generally highly sensitive to minor variations in inputs as such we do not think that for instance a single governing formula for prediction of k cond even in taihu would be robust to changing field conditions at the regional level what we also find from this analysis is that there are general trends as follows 1 correlations between water quality indicators parafac components coble peaks and fluorescence indicators vary in a logical manner 2 subsets of these different types of parameters seem to consistently produce a multiple regression model that is an adequate predictor of k cond 3 pca produces groupings that are reflective of processes in different parts of the lake with some isolated areas or source inputs being more distinct in terms of multivariate distance 4 there are no strong correlations of any single component with k cond and 5 k cond is not a significant contributor to the major pcs summarizing k cond might be described as an outcome of water composition in the sense that water chemical properties and dom indices may serve as predictors of k cond however unlike many other parameters k cond is not a characteristic differentiating water from one station to another we do not know of another study that has approached the issues here with such a comprehensive data set and from the standpoint of a rapid method for determination of k cond that is practically extensible to era during the time that this work was under review we have completed a detailed study of how parameters and k conds reported here could be best incorporated in era models and we find that the average relative error for prediction of bioavailable pb using k conds reported here is 4 as opposed to 70 underprediction when performing speciation modeling using what we describe here as a one size fits all model 4 conclusions dom and pb dom binding and relationships of these to water quality in taihu have been investigated in this study to understand implications for building better speciation models for era key points are as follows dom is highly variable across the large regional expanse of taihu and reflects different inputs from different regions as well as processes within the lake temporal variability is presumably high as well since we find that during the time of our study there is a strong hab contribution to dom and habs are associated with summer conditions this study finds that k conds for pb dom binding vary by approximately two orders of magnitude across taihu and in many cases there is a strong proteinaceous contribution to dom such variable composition and binding strength is consistent with prior findings that a one size fits all approach to metal dom binding leads to inaccuracies in commonly used speciation models therefore such generalized approaches need improvement for regional level era in complex watersheds the k cond of pb dom binding can be predicted using the chemical properties of the water together with parameters extracted from fluorescence studies of the dom present this approach aids our understanding of conceptual models regarding the provenance and diagenesis of dom results from pca confirm the finding that water quality and dom composition parameters are strongly interrelated and reflect different inputs diagenetic and transport processes across the large expanse of taihu the approach taken here is extensible to any regional setting for freshwater studies and with particular relevance to bioavailability modeling and era this work we report here is part of an important step forward in addressing urgent needs to develop streamlined approaches to regional era overall results herein show that the values of k cond that we have obtained are in accord with our understanding of processes occurring across the lake and as affected by upstream hydrological inputs and regional scale transport the ability to use the fluorescence methods here in high throughput applications fluorescence measurement titration and data analysis pipelines is highly attractive for era applications and we do not know of another report that has been as comprehensive and resulted in simultaneously good internal agreement with understanding of the field site and results k cond that are obtained in a manner practical enough to implement in era studies we have recently completed a detailed study using the k conds reported here in era models and we find that the average relative error is vastly improved we hope to report on that soon

18159,environmental risk assessment era increasingly relies on speciation modeling of bioavailability heavy metals are the most prevalent pollutants globally and dissolved organic matter dom plays an important role in speciation and bioavailability of heavy metals due to the variation of dom properties in natural aquatic systems improvements to the standard one size fits all approach to modeling metal dom interactions are needed for era in this study we investigate variations in dom and lead pb dom binding in lake tai taihu a large impacted lake in eastern china that is characterized by a complex drainage network and is an important water resource at a regional level and we assess implications of our findings within the context of era needs in our study dom in water samples collected from across the 2 400 km2 area of taihu was characterized using three dimensional excitation emission matrix and synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy spectra the latter being used to calculate conditional stability constants for metal binding parallel factor analysis and peak picking were used to assess contributions of protein and humic like components of dom and fluorescence indices indicative of diagenetic processes were calculated these quantities calculated from spectroscopic studies in addition to water quality parameters were analyzed by bivariate and multivariate analysis results show that different dom components are highly variable across different regions of taihu and bivariate and multivariate analyses confirm that water quality and dom characterization parameters are strongly interrelated this reflects the different inputs diagenetic and transport processes across the large expanse of taihu we find that the conditional stability constant of pb dom binding is strongly affected by the water chemical properties and composition of dom though the conditional stability constant is not itself a parameter that differentiates lake water properties in different regions of the lake the variability of dom composition and pb dom binding strength across taihu is consistent with prior findings that a one size fits all approach to metal dom binding may lead to inaccuracies in commonly used speciation models and therefore such generalized approaches need improvement for regional level era in complex watersheds the approach taken here to obtain site specific metal dom conditional stability constants for use in increasing the accuracy of speciation modeling is fit for purpose for era applications at regional levels because the approach is relatively simple inexpensive and amenable to high throughput analysis graphical abstract image 1 keywords environmental risk assessment dissolved organic carbon pb conditional stability constant taihu fluorescence spectroscopy 1 introduction as a seminal text on environmental risk assessment era states the world is a dirty place and getting dirtier all the time lerche and glaesser 2006 also see biello 2009 harvey 2007 since 2008 according to various reports from the pure earth institute and partners pure earth and green cross 2015 heavy metals topped the list of the world s biggest pollution problems inclusive of health effects with contaminated surface water being a key issue linking pollution to health effects with the increasing levels of contaminants prevalent globally there is an increasing and urgent need to perform accurate era and to be able to set appropriate and site specific or even regional levels for metals that are protective yet not unrealistically conservative fairman et al 1999 janssen et al 2003 ecotoxic response is a consequence of contaminant bioavailability in the environment hence bioavailability has largely become the focus of era particularly for heavy metals avio et al 2015 caussy et al 2003 janssen et al 2003 united states environmental protection agency usepa 2003 speciation modeling is increasingly used to effect streamlined era with the usepa s biotic ligand model now being an accepted approach to heavy metals era niyogi and wood 2004 sander et al 2015 and being used to set water quality criteria i e safe operating levels di toro et al 2001 usepa 2016 the speciation modeling approach is implemented in a number of software packages assessing bioavailability directly through speciation or evaluating toxicity indirectly through speciation e g gustafsson 2014 for many metals complexation which reduces bioavailability and therefore risk is primarily determined by complexation with dissolved organic matter dom in natural systems complexation can be quantified using chemical speciation models baken et al 2011 boggs et al 1985 mostofa et al 2013a yamashita and jaffé 2008 zhang et al 2017 kothawala et al 2014 have summarized the importance of dom s role in biogeochemical processes and the global carbon cycle with particular emphasis on lakes as lakes may be viewed as sinks that may be used as catchment level indicators that receive and process dom from catchment areas substantially greater than the area of any given lake itself there is a growing consensus that speciation models do not always adequately predict metal dom binding due to the variable nature of dom ahmed et al 2014 in this study we investigate the relationships between commonly measured water quality parameters and readily obtainable metrics characterizing dom to better understand the influences on metal dom binding the specific focus is to have an approach that is fit for purpose regarding era in freshwater our study area is lake tai hereafter designated as taihu after 太湖 in chinese a system that is large enough 2 400 km2 to reflect regional scale processes has a complex aquatic ecosystem sun and mao 2008 and a long history of anthropogenic impacts qin et al 2007 within commonly used speciation models dissolved organic carbon doc usually in units of mg l is the primary component that is a model input and is used to represent dom i e dom is quantified as doc chen et al 2003 fundamentally the difficulty in modeling metal dom interactions arises because dom is a heterogeneous mixture of aromatic and aliphatic organic compounds of varied origin leenheer and croué 2003 nebbioso and piccolo 2013 zhang et al 2014 two common approaches to quantify metal dom binding and attendant metal bioavailability include the stockholm humic model shm gustafsson 2001 and the windemere humic acid model wham tipping 1994 and 1998 while the details of these models and model calculations are quite complicated the key point is that these models rely on conditional stability constants k cond which originate from thermodynamic quantities and are a quantity described as a constant that reflects the strength of the interaction between metal and dom in coming together to form a complex see section 2 5 below models such as shm and wham hold the assumption that for humic and fulvic acids ha and fa respectively a single constant describes metal binding with phenolic and carboxylic acid type sites within ha and fa therefore we refer to such an approach as a one size fits all approach the varying characteristics of dom that relate to its origin environmental conditions and aging processes have driven much work devoted to characterizing dom to provide a better understanding of metal dom complexation leenheer and croué 2003 he et al 2015 kikuchi et al 2017 mostofa et al 2013a ren et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 natural waters with dom that deviates in composition or binding strength from current model assumptions and specifications inherent in the one size fits all approach will therefore not be amenable to accurate calculation of speciation and assessment of risk ahmed et al 2014 mostofa et al 2013a in addition to being abundant pollutants heavy metals are among the most toxic lead pb is ranked as the most abundant pollutant in the world today pure earth and green cross 2015 also historically see tong et al 2000 and was selected as a model for our study pb s prevalence is aggravated by its particular toxicity to children grandjean and landrigan 2014 and the global annual costs of childhood pb exposure from cognitive defects alone are estimated to be 1 15 trillion us dollars most of which is borne by low and middle income countries grandjean and bellange 2017 cognitive defects are only one of several cost categories and even for cognitive defects this estimate does not consider cognitive losses within the normal range which a recent sensitivity analysis suggests may result in a 200 fold underestimate for costs of pb exposure from cognitive defects to children attina and trasande 2013 the risk of pb s entering the food chain increases as its concentration rises in water and soil the usepa has set the maximum allowable level for pb in drinking water at a concentration of 15 ppb usepa 2002 and in china the maximum allowable level is 10 ppb mhprc 2006 however though limits are set literature shows that no safe level of pb exposure exists grandjean 2010 pb precipitates to insoluble species under alkaline conditions and conversely the increasing occurrence of acid rain in some areas of the world notably china has enhanced the release of pb into water and soil solution du et al 2014 larssen et al 2006 li et al 2015 studies have shown that dom plays an important role in the fate and biogeochemical cycling of metal ion in the aquatic environment christensen et al 1999 mostofa et al 2013a mueller et al 2012 reuter and perdue 1977 zhang et al 2014 we have previously demonstrated that the effect of ha binding with pb on pb bioavailability may be modeled with high accuracy zhang et al 2017 however we find that when dom compositions deviate from assumptions regarding ha and fa that are implemented in commonly used software packages bioavailability hence risk is under predicted which raises questions about a one size fits all approach to metal dom binding for era the circumstance is generally known and recent studies have noted inadequacies in extant approaches to modeling metal dom binding and call for site specific binding parameters to ensure that era modeling meets environmental management needs ahmed et al 2014 mueller et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 hence we wish to study the interaction between pb and dom to provide a better understanding of pb bioavailability and risk in natural waters common techniques for the characterization of dom and metal dom binding include voltammetry sander et al 2011 2015 fluorescence mostofa et al 2013b uv vis spectroscopy birdwell and engel 2010 fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance ultra high resolution or triple quadrupole mass spectrometry with electrospray ionization boija et al 2014 d andrilli et al 2010 kujawinski et al 2009 and different ultrafiltration and resin fractionation techniques combined with chemical analysis chow et al 2004 among these techniques fluorescence spectroscopy has high sensitivity is rapid and is semi quantitative to quantitative chen et al 2003 marhaba 2000 mostofa et al 2013b sanchez et al 2014 and consequently is increasingly used to characterize properties and provenance of dom in natural waters coble et al 1990 fellman et al 2010 hudson et al 2007 mostofa et al 2013b additionally the fluorescence characterization of metal dom binding has been demonstrated using high throughput analysis neculita et al 2011 which is highly cost effective and would be ideal for the era needs three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3deem fluorescence spectroscopy coble et al 2014 and synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy sfs are two techniques in particular that have been widely used to probe the chemical structure of dom and to investigate water pollution baker 2001 baker et al 2004 manciulea et al 2009 mostofa et al 2013b wu et al 2003 it is well known that dom fluorescence is quenched by heavy metals via both static and dynamic mechanisms lakowicz 2006 often dominated by static quenching for bivalent metals that form strong complexes with organic fluorophores cabaniss 1992 esteves da silva et al 1998 quenching measured by sfs is proportional to metal complexation and this phenomenon has become well established in fluorescence quenching titrations as a method to determine k cond of complexation cabaniss 1992 esteves da silva et al 1998 fu et al 2007 heibati et al 2017 lu and jaffé 2001 ryan and weber 1982a and b in this study we use 3deem fluorescence spectroscopy and sfs to characterize dom and pb dom interactions respectively for water samples across taihu the third largest freshwater lake in china the taihu basin drains an extensively modified and heavily managed catchment of over 36 000 km2 characterized by a complex network of drainage channels dikes flood gates and pumping stations around the lake water draining into taihu reflects inputs from the extensive catchment and the discharge flows into the shanghai area i e one of the largest metropolitan areas on earth meanwhile the lake itself is an important drinking water source for approximately 11 million people xu et al 2017 and is also of importance in flood control for tourism and for aquaculture gong and lin 2009 qin et al 2007 as such taihu holds a crucial place in regional water security with more than 170 rivers and streams draining into taihu there is a substantial exogenous contribution to dom in some parts of the taihu ecological system at the same time the size and relative biological productivity of taihu entails that there is much endogenous contribution to dom as well particularly given that taihu has experienced harmful algal blooms habs every year since the mid 1980s sun and mao 2008 these habs have had a strong influence on the chemical nature and amount of dom particularly in the northern part of the lake zhang et al 2014 in consequence of the highly variable sources of dom across the very large lacustrine system there is potential to observe highly variable dom properties throughout the lake yao et al 2011 and therefore different effects of metal dom binding and conditional stability constants for reasons described above there is a great immediacy and importance to develop streamlined approaches to era particularly for pb with a current impediment being development of a rapid method to obtain site specific k conds for use in era models for regions that exhibit high variability in k cond in this work we 1 characterize the spatial distribution and variability of dom across taihu i e at regional scale 2 study the binding capacity of dom with pb in different parts of the lake to understand regional variability in k cond and 3 explore whether we can elucidate factors controlling pb dom complexation i e whether there are relationships between dom fluorescence properties water quality indicators and k cond that provide insights on variability in k cond we find that k cond varies over two orders of magnitude at the regional level contrary to established assumptions behind one size fits all models of metal dom binding in current era speciation models that hold k cond constant and that k cond varies in a manner that is consistent with other factors affecting dom and water quality unlike other works that have studied metal dom complexation with fluorescence spectroscopic techniques our approach specifically addresses the needs of era in development of more accurate yet rapid streamlined era modeling this work is novel as we do not know of any other studies that have employed such a wide array of indicators that might provide insights into k cond variability or have used the approach that we use in the framework of era our results are proof of principle that the approach we adduce is sufficiently rapid and adaptable to be fit for purpose with respect to era applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area sampling sites and field measurements taihu is a shallow polymictic mean depth 2 m lake located in the yangzte river delta in east china a rapidly developing urban and economic region with 0 4 of the land area of china over 40 million inhabitants and 13 of the nation s gdp qin et al 2010 yang and liu 2010 in result taihu is characterized as hypertrophic qin et al 2007 due to the influx of nutrient rich wastes from urban agricultural and industrial activities within the taihu watershed sun and mao 2008 in addition to the highly variable sources of dom to taihu the characteristics of dom are expected to be affected by the water retention time wrt which has been reported to be on the order of 5 10 months qin et al 2004 2007 as the lake is so large the wrt is also variable in different regions of the lake urban pollutants discharge into northern taihu runoff sources are largely from the western and southwestern mountains and outflows are located throughout east taihu fig 1 a shows the tributaries drainage network for taihu and prevailing summer current pattern qin et al 2007 the greatest inflow rivers are the chendong xitiaoxi west tiaoxi net inflow and yincun in the west southeast though approximately 60 of river water inflow comes from western rivers along the yixing shore fig 1b qin et al 2007 sun and mao 2008 xu and qin 2005 the main outflow rivers are taipu accounting for 50 of the total outflow volume xinyun and xujiang in the east southeast qin et al 2007 by far the largest flow is the taipu river which results in shorter wrt times in the south in consequence of inputs and residence times water quality is better in the south and the southeastern part of lake than in the north qin et al 2007 water samples from 32 monitoring stations in taihu that are monitored by niglas nanjing institute of geography and limnology chinese academy of sciences quarterly zhang and chen 2011 were collected in august 2017 fig 1b this sampling time was chosen to occur at the height of what has become a yearly occurrence of a cyanobacterial hab in the north northwestern part of the lake the yearly hab occurrence commences in the northern part of the lake in the meiliang bay area where stations sts 1 3 4 and 5 are located fig 1b spreading toward the south and east thereafter despite the frequent habs the southeastern region of the lake is typically characterized by relatively clear water with floating and submersed macrophytes qin et al 2007 the inflows and outflows of the lake are complex due to the networked nature of the watercourses connected to the lake sun and mao 2008 however the hab is associated with inflow of nutrient polluted waters and its spread follows the predominant pattern of summer circulation as shown in fig 1a qin et al 2007 at each station a 1 5 l water sample was collected from 0 2 m below the water surface in a trace metal clean polyethylene bottle and water sample physical parameters including surface water temperature secchi disk transparency transp ph electrical conductivity cond and dissolved oxygen do were measured using a ysi 6600 multisensor sonde water samples were returned to the laboratory within 6 h and 0 75 l of each sample was filtered through a pre combusted 45 mm whatman gf f glass fiber filters nominal pore size 0 7 μm and kept at 4 c in the dark until analysis for dissolved quantities the remainder of each sample was subject to analysis of other water quality parameters 2 2 water quality analyses all chemicals used were analytical reagent grade and milli q water 18 2 mω cm millipore was used in all experiments chemical properties were measured in the lab and included doc chlorophyll a chl a total phosphorus tp total dissolved phosphorus tdp phosphate po4 3 total nitrogen tn total dissolved nitrogen tdn ammoniacal nitrogen nh4 nitrate no3 and nitrite no2 doc was determined using the high temperature combustion method with a dohrmann dc 190 total organic carbon analyzer rosemont analytical inc calif usepa 1979 for the determination of chl a water samples were filtered through whatman gf f glass fiber filters then the concentration of chl a was determined by the hot ethanol method iso 1992 no3 and no2 were measured using the cadmium reduction method and nh4 was determined using the indophenol blue method apha 1995 phosphate was determined by the molybdenum blue method apha 1995 the concentrations of tn tdn tp and tdp were determined using the combined persulphate digestion method as described by ebina et al 1983 the concentrations of five day biological oxygen demand bod and chemical oxygen demand cod were determined according to the corresponding standard methods apha 1995 cations na k ca2 mg2 and anions cl and so4 2 were analyzed using ion chromatography following the national standards of the people s republic of china mhprc 2016a b 2 3 fluorescence spectroscopy fluorescence spectra for the 32 stations were obtained in a 1 cm quartz cuvette using a cary eclipse fluorimeter agilent technologies equipped with a 150 w xenon arc lamp light source and a pmt detector with voltage set at 700 v for 3deem fluorescence spectra 3 d being excitation emission and intensity hereafter eem chen et al 2003 the excitation wavelength range was scanned from 200 to 450 nm at 5 nm intervals and the emission wavelength was scanned from 300 to 550 nm in 2 nm increments for sfs quenching titration experiments to study pb dom complexation esteves da silva et al 1998 fu et al 2007 spectra were recorded scanning the excitation and emission monochromators over a 200 nm range starting at 250 nm with a δλ 20 nm offset using a 5 nm slit width and a scan speed of 1200 nm min 1 titration was carried out by adding a series of pb spikes final concentrations ranging from 9 5 10 7 to 3 8 10 5 m to subsamples from each sample of the 32 stations ph was adjusted to 7 00 0 05 by adding mops buffer zhang et al 2017 prior to analysis all samples were kept 24 h at room temperature in the dark to ensure complexation and avoid photolytic reactions a sample of commercially available ha 8 mg l 1 alfa aesar tianjin china was also analyzed under the same conditions albeit without adding pb in order to have a comparator for spectral features 2 4 parallel factor analysis modeling stedmon et al 2003 demonstrated the use of parallel factor parafac analysis of eem spectra to decompose or unmix the complex mixture of dom fluorophores into contributions from underlying component fractions without any assumptions about the spectral shape or number of contributing components in recent decades this method has been widely used for the characterization of dom doc from both freshwater and marine aquatic environments cory and mcknight 2005 kowalczuk et al 2009 yamashita et al 2008 with regard to lakes in particular parafac has been used to study land use change environmental processing of dom ecological processes taking place within and among lakes and lake stratification and spatial variation in dom sources within lakes jaffé et al 2004 the parafac model decomposes an eem spectrum as follows 1 x i j k f 1 f a i f b j f c k f e i j k where x ijk is an array with the fluorescence intensity for the ith sample at emission wavelength j and excitation wavelength k the summation includes a set of trilinear terms a if directly proportional to the concentration of the fth analyte in the ith sample b jf is linearly related to the emission spectra at wavelengths j for the fth analyte and c kf is linearly proportional to the specific absorption coefficient at excitation wavelength k the term e ijk represents an array containing the model residuals for samples that have a wide range of doc concentrations a correlation of components may arise artefactually in proportion to doc to avoid that the computational package used to perform parafac analysis stardom pucher et al 2019 is implemented so that samples may be normalized to doc for determination of components with normalization being later reversed by multiplying samples loadings for each component with normalization factors 2 5 theory of fluorescence quenching titrations fluorescence quenching is defined as any process that decreases the fluorescence intensity of a sample lakowicz 2006 there are many mechanisms by which quenching occurs e g excited state reactions inner filter effect autoabsorption proportional to the optical density of the sample at excitation and emission wavelengths self and or intramolecular absorbance collisional dynamic quenching and static quenching collisional dynamic quenching occurs when an excited state fluorophore experiences non reactive contact with a species in solution e g chloride oxygen that facilitates non radiative relaxation to ground state static quenching occurs when for example complexation between a metal ion and the main binding sites of dom occurs and causes non radiative relaxation studies have shown that both fluorescence lifetime lakowicz 2006 and thermal quenching carstea et al 2014 are useful in elucidating more definitive information on quenching mechanisms and properties of macromolecular organic fluorophores due to the manifold processes that may be affecting fluorescence the use of quenching titrations is operationally bolstered by common matrix i e when spiking metal into a sample solution the only thing that is changing is metal concentration the complexation reaction is described by charges omitted 2a m l m l where m is the metal pb here l represents a complexing ligand in this case dom and ml is the complex pb dom this chemical reaction is governed by the equilibrium expression 2b k c o n d m l m l where binding is assumed to form 1 1 complexes and brackets denote concentrations of the ml complex uncomplexed metal ion and uncomplexed ligand respectively the quenching of dom fluorescence by complexation with a metal ion can be described by the modified stern volmer equation esteves da silva et al 1998 according to 3 i 0 δ i 1 f k c o n d c m 1 f where δi i 0 i i 0 and i are the fluorescence intensities of the sample with and without m pb present f is the fraction of i 0 that corresponds to the fluorescent portion of dom that participates in binding k cond is the conditional stability constant for the reaction shown in 2 and c m is the total metal pb concentration equation 3 may be plotted as a line for which i 0 δi c m 1 f k cond and 1 f are the ordinate abscissa slope and intercept respectively thus k cond and f are estimated from the slope and intercept of the linear plot an alternate expression for static quenching ryan and weber 1982b is 4 i i m l 100 2 k c o n d c l k c o n d c l k c o n d c m 1 k c o n d c l k c o n d c m 1 2 4 k c o n d 2 c l c m 100 where i ml is the fluorescence intensity in i e when data is expressed such that i 0 100 at which further addition of quencher produces no further diminution of fluorescence intensity and c l is the total concentration of ligand this expression has two new parameters however the parameter i ml is related to the parameter f in equation 3 since when i ml is expressed in decimal percent i ml f 1 hence equation 4 is used in problems seeking to understand complexing capacity in addition to the magnitude of conditional stability constants boguta et al 2016 esteves da silva et al 1998 for 4 parameter solutions are determined using non linear regression analysis plotting i versus c m expression 3 was developed to capture non idealities deviations from linearity in stern volmer plots another commonly used expression to address this issue that also relies on non linear regression is 5 i 0 i 1 f 1 k c o n d c m i m l where i ml is decimal carraway et al 1991 and non linear regression is performed on an i 0 i versus c m plot comparison of results from different equations are useful due to the variability in error structure arising from different functional forms when collisional dynamic quenching occurs simultaneously to complexation between a metal and dom nonlinearity of i 0 i versus c m plots away from x axis is observed the expression used in this case is carraway et al 1991 6 i 0 i 1 k c o n d d c m 1 k c o n d c m where k c o n d d is the constant for collisional or dynamic quenching and parameters are determined via nonlinear regression carraway et al 1991 2 6 data treatment and calculations the r r core team 2019 package stardom pucher et al 2019 with associated packages in r helwig 2019 massicotte 2019 wickham et al 2019 wickham and henry 2019 was used for analysis of eem spectra fluorescence peaks and indices calculated

peaks see vignette pucher 2019 raman normalization was not performed in accordance with findings of mostofa mostofa et al 2013b for readers who would like to have the data or the data in raman units we include raw eem spectra in the supplementary material sm parafac analysis was also conducted and provides similar but different data as from peak picking coble peaks namely that decomposition of spectral components via parafac analysis avoids spectral overlap and can provide exploratory results beyond the pre determined coble peaks murphy et al 2013 normalization and subsequent inverse normalization section 2 4 was performed for parafac analysis and results were subsequently validated via analysis of residuals split half analysis and comparison with similar systems bro 1997 openfluor was used for the latter murphy et al 2014 sfs data were analyzed by linear excel and nonlinear origin regression analysis using 3 4 5 and 6 additional data analysis included pair wise correlation analysis multiple regression and principle component analysis pca these were performed using the corrplot factominer factoextra fields leaps plot3d rcorr and stats calculation and visualization packages in r alboukadel and fabian 2017 harrell et al 2015 karline 2017 lumley 2017 nychka et al 2017 r core team 2019 sebastien et al 2008 taiyun and viliam 2017 to perform these calculations results from physical and chemical analysis of water samples were combined with results from analysis of eem data and results for k cond into a single multivariate data set additional details on calculations are given in the sm under the section headings for each different type of data 3 results and discussion 3 1 water quality and conditions results for individual measurements of 22 physical and chemical parameters for the 32 samples in different regions of taihu are given in the sm table s1 along with results for total dissolved pb and for brevity are summarized here the ph in the lake was somewhat high ranging from 7 90 to 8 35 which has been attributed to inorganic carbon scavenging by phytoplankton as a result of habs fang et al 2018 ma et al 2014 2015 the chl a concentrations ranged from 8 to 240 μg l 1 with higher chl a concentrations occurring in hab impacted areas of the lake and a number of parameters follow the general motif of being higher in hab impacted areas and vice versa fig 2 shows selected contour maps for chl a doc cod tn tp and tn tp to illustrate these general trends the higher concentration of the nutrients is the main driver that leads to habs which in turn may be associated with elevated chl a cod and doc concentrations chl a has a higher correlation with cod than bod which is likely a result of processes that affect the reworking of organic matter from habs note we treat bod cod doc and chl as indicators of om primary productivity indicators correlations are discussed in more detail in section 3 6 the regions that suffered from hab are not entirely co located with the distribution of tn and tp this is an outcome of transport hydrodynamics in the lake the predominant inflow of river water from the west northwest and outflow of water to the east ensures a trend of mass movement counterclockwise from the northern part of taihu to the locale of the largest outflow at the taipu river additionally in summer the prevailing winds from the southeast or southwest generate surface currents that manifest in localized counter clock wise rotation fig 1a see arrows pointing northeast and northwest to the north and south of the island in the lake qin et al 2000 qin et al 2007 these simultaneous phenomena have a strong impact on the distribution of hab and hab associated water quality parameters in the northern and western areas of the lake 3 2 fluorescence properties of taihu dom a variety of approaches have been used to analyze eem data and we consider results for three of these here 1 an early approach adduced by coble involving quantifying the intensity of local maxima of fluorescence corresponding to different components of dom eem peak picking 2 calculation of fluorescent indices flind 3 use of parafac analysis to decompose eem matrices into different spectral components the last decade has seen an increasing shift to parafac analysis of eems jaffé et al 2014 murphy et al 2013 this approach is analogous to quantification of coble peaks however it can reveal the presence of additional local maxima as well as provide improved resolution of the peaks found in analysis of raw eems data see sm for additional information on parafac analysis based on several decades of work on the characterization of dom the common fluorophores in dom that are identifiable by fluorescence peaks in different regions of eems are classified into tyrosine like amino sugar tryptophan like proteins and peptides and ha fa like materials mostofa et al 2013b peak nomenclatures typically follow either the early nomenclature of coble or the more recent terminology of mostofa coble 1996 mostofa et al 2013b in the mostofa terminology regions a and c are associated with humic substances with fas having lower emission wavelengths than has for any given sample and the t and tuv regions are associated with protein like dom with the lower emission wavelengths for each region being tyrosine like and higher emission wavelengths being tryptophan like as shown in fig 3 for the coble terminology coble 1996 coble peaks a and c are coincident with mostofa s peak a and peak c respectively coble terminology does not encompass tuv peaks and in coble terminology the mostofa t peaks are subdivided into t higher emission wavelength tryptophan like and b lower emission wavelength tyrosine like peaks coble terminology also distinguishes an m peak that is a subclass of mostofa s peak c region designating a peak that occurs at a slightly lower excitation wavelength than the primary c like peak mostofa recognizes subclasses of the peak c region m mp and w see mostofa et al 2013b for further details the eems for the 32 stations are given in the sm fig s1 and selected examples are shown in fig 4 in fig s1 the eems samples from all stations display peak t and peak tuv protein like dom and generally the highest intensities are seen for these peaks though even visually it is apparent that for sts 9 and 15 these contributions are low particularly in the tyrosine like portion of the eem spectrum see eem for st 9 in fig 4 sts 9 and 15 are the only two stations that are technically not in taihu these stations are in wuli bay which was an arm of taihu until a gate was built to separate it from taihu wuli bay is now not considered as a watercourse connected to taihu all the samples also had a peak a contribution of varying intensity e g contrast st 9 and st 13 in fig 4 however peak c is weak or absent from visual inspection of the eems for around a third of the samples e g st 13 in fig 4 strong protein like fluorescence has often been reported in water bodies that experienced habs haas and wild 2010 moffett 1995 and protein like fluorescence is also associated with wastewater i e from wastewater treatment plants wwtps e g see sorensen et al 2018 many studies have demonstrated that excretion by habs may contribute significantly to the dom pool bertilsson and jones 2003 moffett 1995 yao et al 2011 zhang et al 2007 2009 since the highly labile dom leached from algae is consumed very rapidly the algae produced dom is not likely to persist in the environment and thus except under specific conditions this bioavailable pool of algae produced dom that predominates in the hab dominated summer environment of taihu is not expected to make up a significant fraction of the dom in natural unimpacted waters chen and wangersky 1996 hansen et al 2016 moreira et al 2011 a shift in composition violating this assumption would be one reason for speciation models to fail to predict bioavailability 3 3 coble peaks and fluorescence indices table s2 sm contains results for quantification of coble peaks and the flind for 27 of 32 samples the quantification of coble peaks a b c m and t shows the order b t a m c for fluorescence intensity indicating that protein like b and t tyrosine and tryptophan compounds are the important components of dom in taihu at the time of sampling two of the five exceptions are sts 9 and 15 which have the lowest and second lowest respectively intensities for t and tuv of all stations the other exceptions are sts 10 16 and 17 along the western yixin shoreline where the greatest density of water from the massif region in the western taihu basin feeds into taihu these stations all have slightly differing relative proportions of b and t and still show the trend a m c the metrics hix bix and fi have been developed to characterize the origin and transformation degree of dom huguet et al 2009 mcknight et al 2001 hix is based on the concept that emission spectra will shift toward longer wavelengths as humification of dom proceeds fellman et al 2010 the hix values for all the samples from taihu are below 1 which indicates this dom is mainly associated with biological or autochthonous material with a quite low humification degree huguet et al 2009 and is consistent with findings for coble peaks and our parafac model vide infra the average hix value is 0 52 and only sts 9 10 15 16 and 17 have a hix value greater than 0 6 st 17 is near sts 10 and 16 where there is greater influx hence a slightly greater allochthonous contribution to dom may be anticipated at these stations zhang et al 2012 the bix index was calculated as a characteristic of autochthonous biological activity in water samples the bix values in our study range from 0 87 to 1 13 huguet et al 2009 showed that values from 0 8 to 1 represent the dom associated with a strong autochthonous component and values greater than 1 are indicative of biological production of strongly labile organic matter of 32 stations all have a bix higher than 0 8 and 24 display a bix value higher than 1 indicating the presence of freshly released dom huguet et al 2009 in this study the bix and hix indices show a small range of values and a negative correlation indicating that the dom in taihu was strongly affected by autochthonous contributions freshly released in origin and likely caused by the hab in the lake these findings might be subject to debate however for instance microcystis spp are typically the dominant genus found in taihu habs and yang et al 2016 found that when growing microcystis aeruginosa in lab culture bix values may drop from 1 to 0 2 in early exponential phase growth yang et al 2016 similar comments pertain to our results for fi mcknight et al 2001 developed the fi for predicting the precursor source and chemical properties of fa for our samples the fi values range from 1 39 to 1 71 fi values of 1 9 consistently appear in dom from rivers that have terrestrially derived dom sources mcknight et al 2001 taihu is a very large lake with many inflowing rivers that may transport ha fa components of dom into the lake however the fi may not be representative of the source of non ha fa components of the dom 3 4 eem parafac components of taihu dom parafac analysis was used to decompose eems into components corresponding to dom fluorophores bro 1997 murphy et al 2013 fig 5 panels a to d display four different components designated as comp1 to comp4 which are the composite components obtained from parafac analysis see sm for details the component breakdowns for each sample are given in table s3 of the sm in fig 5 panels e to h we compare composite spectra from our results to representative results from the literature obtained from the openfluor database murphy et al 2014 and to a composite for each component obtained from the data in the extensive review published by mostofa et al 2013b details concerning mostofa composites the full suite of openfluor results and individual results for eems from each of the 32 samples are given in the sm fig s2 and s3 the spectra of the four components in our study agree very well to those of dom reported in other aquatic environments based on comparison to published data see extended data in sm also see results for split half analysis fig s4 the eem for comp1 show peaks at λ ex 223 and 280 nm λ em 320 nm corresponding to the tuv and t peaks with aromatic protein tyrosine like fluorescence mostofa et al 2013b this component has been reported to arise from the degradation products of autochthonously produced dom such as phytoplankton catalán et al 2013 yao et al 2011 zhang et al 2009 and the short wrt for taihu coupled with cyclic habs is one reason why the ratio of protein like to fa ha like dom might be overall higher in taihu in the eem of comp2 there were two excitation maxima λ ex 230 nm and 285 nm at λ em 347 nm consistent with tryptophan like fluorescence in peak tuv and peak t mostofa et al 2010 yamashita et al 2008 reported that comp2 is comprised of labile components produced by autochthonous biological production comp3 has λ ex 210 240 and 315 nm and λ em 408 nm corresponding to the fa like fluorescence of peak a and peak c respectively fu et al 2010 parlanti et al 2000 zhang et al 2009 comp4 is also composed of two peaks with λ ex 261 and 364 nm λ em 465 nm the first peak lies within the spectral area of peak a and the second one peak c region both peaks fall into the category of ha like fluorescence mostofa et al 2005 ohno and bro 2006 unlike the coble peaks we do not see a consistent pattern of progression for the different components to the relative composition of the eems in common with findings for coble peaks sts 9 10 15 16 and 17 have the lowest contributions from the tyrosine like component and tryptophan like components sts 10 16 and 17 located at and below the outflow of zhushan bay a polluted bay chen 2008 have cumulatively the highest amounts of the ha like component other extrema differ from those seen in the coble peaks for instance st 13 has the greatest amount of the tyrosine like component and st 6 has the highest amount of both tryptophan like dom st 13 is closest to the city of wuxi having a population of 4 9 million people and st 6 is near the mouth of a tributary and in meiliang bay which is typically the area of taihu most polluted affected by habs 3 5 complexation of pb by taihu dom compared with eem sfs shows narrower peak widths is easier to use for identification and minimizes the chance for false determinations or omissions of specific spectral features meanwhile the process of obtaining sfs is much faster than eem dreischuh et al 2015 sfs is a simple sensitive and nondestructive technique that has been successfully used to rapidly characterize the interactions between heavy metals and dom esteves da silva et al 1998 ryan and weber 1982b zhang et al 2014 numerous studies have used fluorescence quenching titrations to investigate the binding properties of heavy metals with dom e g fu et al 2007 manciulea et al 2009 wu et al 2011 yamashita and jaffé 2008 preliminary evaluation confirmed that the samples used for this study were suitable for quenching titration studies fluorescence quenching was observed after the addition of pb and no fluorescence enhancement was observed under the experimental conditions fig 6 a shows an example of fluorescence quenching of dom by pb as a function of pb concentration for st 1 sfs spectra for the 32 samples are all characterized by a similar spectral shape but by differences in relative intensity see fig s5 in sm all sfs spectra for this study showed two peaks at wavelengths of λ 290 nm peak i and λ 414 nm peak ii fig 6b displays a sfs spectrum for commercially purchased ha in which we see that the sfs for ha is considerably more complex than the sfss for our samples however peaks i and ii from our samples have corresponding features in the ha sfs marked by arrows in each plot fig 6c shows the modified stern volmer plot for data extracted from fig 6a the sfs spectra for 32 stations were analyzed using stern volmer analysis as described in sections 2 5 and 2 6 to obtain f k cond and c l the binding strength for these fluorophores with metals may vary according to dom composition ryan and weber 1982a zhang et al 2014 resulting in variations of k cond for different samples values of k cond and f based on data from sfs quenching titrations for the samples from 32 stations of taihu are summarized in table 1 for peak ii note see table s4 and discussion in the sm for information regarding peak i for the majority of samples the intensity of peak i or the magnitude of change during quenching titration was too small for estimation of k cond the peak ii k cond values vary over a range of 4 64 6 50 these results indicate that pb has a complexation affinity for dom that varies by approximately two orders of magnitude far from fitting the assumption that k cond is effectively invariant and that therefore a constant k cond is universally suitable for speciation models used in era see table s5 in the sm for literature k conds of some dom components in the present study we also calculated c l however in many cases the expression used for this was over parameterized e g see esteves da silva et al 1998 hence values for those samples are not reported 3 6 relationships between water quality dom properties and conditional stability constants fig 7 shows results for spearman s ρ from pairwise correlation analysis for parameters including water quality parameters of dom characterization and logk cond for pb dom complexation results are plotted in clusters according to a matrix hierarchical clustering algorithm implemented in r the p value levels associated with each ρ are given in table s6 of the sm for all but two pairs ρ 0 55 are all associated with p values 0 001 for the two exceptions 0 001 p value 0 05 we expect there may be some trends based on end member mixing from various sources of conservative quantities e g ions that are not reactive or less reactive coupled with the imprint of changes in reactive species that reflect dynamic processes in the water column e g changes in nutrients and chl a accordingly there are strong relationships between na k cl and so4 2 bottom right corner fig 7 a retrospective study of water in taihu spanning six decades yu et al 2013 reports that inputs from these ions have changed greatly as a result of increases to the surrounding population base and concomitant pollution to the lake increases in k have occurred in part due to the large fertilizer load and so4 2 due to atmospheric deposition of so2 as h2so4 from coal and combustion byproducts the ions na and cl are partly linked to outflow from domestic wwtps though cl is also input from industrial pollution and wastewater treatment yu et al 2013 and to some extent all of these ions are associated with mixed pollution sources while ions represent more conservative tracers of water source and mixing they are not independent of other quantities and there are strong relationships between na and cl with doc in part consistent with wwtp sources and to a lesser extent bod cod and chl a habs while so4 2 na and cl all have negative associations with no2 bottom right and left of fig 7 respectively no2 is one of the most highly correlated parameters with significant relationships p value 0 01 to all dissolved nutrients positive as well as cod and do left edge fig 7 one report indicates that no2 concentrations from runoff from the western mountains can be exceptionally high consistent with the idea that no2 is not associated with ion pollutant signatures hampel et al 2018 there are strong positive relationships between various indicators of dom productivity with total nutrients and k all of which are consistent with expectations of organic matter and agricultural runoff serving as a source of needed carbon and nutrients that drive habs bottom left and right fig 7 for comparison see for instance paerl et al 2011 xu et al 2010 zhang et al 2019 total and dissolved forms of nutrients generally have strong relationships with each other top and bottom right fig 7 respectively in some cases i e no2 correlates with no3 the two quantities are different however correlation is consistent with common provenance in other cases the correlation is obviously spurious as for instance no2 and no3 are both constituents of tdn the theme of common provenance may also be invoked in considering some relationships between parafac components coble peaks and fluorescence indices though there also begins to be a clear indication of different types of dom comp4 hix and coble peaks a c and m and to a lesser extent comp3 all show positive relationships with each other and are indicators of fa and ha dominated dom upper right fig 7 whereas comp1 comp2 bix and coble peaks b and t show positive relationships with each other and are indicators of protein dominated dom middle right fig 7 see for instance coble 1996 stedmon et al 2003 the weak positive relationships of protein like indicators with bix is consistent with an autochthonous contribution of these quantities to dom while the stronger relationship of hix with fa ha like indicators is more consistent with allochthonous contributions to dom the middle portion of fig 7 has a cluster of largely negative relationships wherein fa ha dominated dom is inversely correlated with protein dominated dom doc does not correlate with any parafac components coble peaks or fluorescence indices if considering doc as a heterogeneous and macromolecular system that is generalizable in chemical behavior i e fixed reactivity in respect of metal complexation as is the case for the era speciation models in common use this might be a surprising result in contrast if doc is considered more in the framework of an assemblage possibly with separate fa ha versus aromatic protein like constituents or possibly a wider variation of functional group compositions associated with macromolecules it is not surprising that doc does not correlate with any of those parameters in the latter case there is no reason why fa ha composition should be perforce linked to protein like dom indicators and therefore different substituents of dom would not necessarily correlate with doc itself additionally reactivity of dom with metals might vary greatly as well in keeping with this supposition logk cond has among the fewest correlations ranked in the bottom octile with ρ only exceeding 0 4 for comp1 0 41 and hix 0 45 as k cond is the primary parameter of focus for use in speciation models that support era we were interested to further explore any relationships that might exist between the other parameters and k cond we performed multiple regression analysis and were not able to find a predictive model for k cond using the entire dataset due to collinearities reduction of the dataset resulted in optimal predictivity at 24 parameters fig 8 a past this optimum further reduction in parameters resulted in inferior correlation and increase in p values as the number of parameters used in prediction was reduced the number of permutations of parameters that would produce a model of equally good correlation ρ and p value increases permutational analysis performed using the leaps function in r we find that depending on the level of accuracy desired eight parameters provide an adequate predictor of k cond as shown in fig 8a from permutational analysis of subsets of the data we find a reasonable degree of variability in the multiple regression equation that will predict k cond though we consistently find that parameters including a mixture of water chemistry coble peaks parafac components and flind provide similar predictions of k cond as to those shown in fig 8a the process of examining multiple regression is useful to support an understanding that k cond depends on water quality parameters and doc fraction in a rational manner that as with pairwise correlation results in fig 7 speak to the different water inputs to the lake as well as processes affecting the diagenesis of dom fig 8b shows the variation of logk cond across taihu the highest values for logk cond are associated with sites that have strong allochthonous contributions natural and anthropogenic meiliang bay the taige caoqiao rivers the changxingxin river and the xitiaoxi river mouths there is also an area of elevated values near the taipu river mouth the taipu river is the location of taihu s main outflow however this region of the shoreline also historically was the site of extensive and long standing aquaculture activity cao et al 2007 pca is often used to analyze multivariate data as this approach to maximization of inherent data set variance in some cases allows discrimination of different groupings or patterns in the data along with indications of which individual parameters most influence same three main principal components pc1 pc2 and pc3 account for the majority of the variance in the original data set see sm rather than being constituted of a few contributing parameters pc1 pc3 each have a relatively large number of contributing parameters see fig s7 in the sm pc1 accounts for 24 of the total data set variance and is characterized by low contributions 4 to 10 of 12 parameters nutrients and ions among 35 parameters pc2 explains 19 of the total variance and is mainly associated with low contributions 3 8 of 14 parameters some dom components flind dom productivity indicators total nutrients pc3 accounts for 13 of the total variance and is again comprised of low contributions 3 10 of 15 parameters similar to pc2 however with different degrees of contribution see sm for further details on pca fig 9 is a 3 dimensional plot of pc1 pc3 with the 32 stations labelled there is one main cluster that is ellipsoidal vertices of the major axis of the ellipse may be thought of as endpoints reflecting circulation patterns in taihu based on the stations nearest to each i e sts 1 and 4 at one vertex and sts 26 28 at the other some stations nearest to inputs of large rivers are off axis to or highly separated from the main cluster these include st 6 near a river mouth in meiliang bay sts 9 and 15 in wuli bay and sts 10 16 and 17 which are all adjacent to the shoreline where the rivers from the northwestern highlands feed into the lake most of the parameters in the dataset contribute overall to one or more of the three pcs and these parameters therefore constitute a relatively large group of indicators that cumulatively characterize different areas of the lake a notable exception is k cond for all three pcs the contribution of k cond is either one of the lowest or the lowest of all parameters based on analysis of preliminary data prior to performing the present study and a limited elementary effects sensitivity analysis that we performed on the data reported here we find that results obtained from the methods of multi variate analysis that we describe are generally highly sensitive to minor variations in inputs as such we do not think that for instance a single governing formula for prediction of k cond even in taihu would be robust to changing field conditions at the regional level what we also find from this analysis is that there are general trends as follows 1 correlations between water quality indicators parafac components coble peaks and fluorescence indicators vary in a logical manner 2 subsets of these different types of parameters seem to consistently produce a multiple regression model that is an adequate predictor of k cond 3 pca produces groupings that are reflective of processes in different parts of the lake with some isolated areas or source inputs being more distinct in terms of multivariate distance 4 there are no strong correlations of any single component with k cond and 5 k cond is not a significant contributor to the major pcs summarizing k cond might be described as an outcome of water composition in the sense that water chemical properties and dom indices may serve as predictors of k cond however unlike many other parameters k cond is not a characteristic differentiating water from one station to another we do not know of another study that has approached the issues here with such a comprehensive data set and from the standpoint of a rapid method for determination of k cond that is practically extensible to era during the time that this work was under review we have completed a detailed study of how parameters and k conds reported here could be best incorporated in era models and we find that the average relative error for prediction of bioavailable pb using k conds reported here is 4 as opposed to 70 underprediction when performing speciation modeling using what we describe here as a one size fits all model 4 conclusions dom and pb dom binding and relationships of these to water quality in taihu have been investigated in this study to understand implications for building better speciation models for era key points are as follows dom is highly variable across the large regional expanse of taihu and reflects different inputs from different regions as well as processes within the lake temporal variability is presumably high as well since we find that during the time of our study there is a strong hab contribution to dom and habs are associated with summer conditions this study finds that k conds for pb dom binding vary by approximately two orders of magnitude across taihu and in many cases there is a strong proteinaceous contribution to dom such variable composition and binding strength is consistent with prior findings that a one size fits all approach to metal dom binding leads to inaccuracies in commonly used speciation models therefore such generalized approaches need improvement for regional level era in complex watersheds the k cond of pb dom binding can be predicted using the chemical properties of the water together with parameters extracted from fluorescence studies of the dom present this approach aids our understanding of conceptual models regarding the provenance and diagenesis of dom results from pca confirm the finding that water quality and dom composition parameters are strongly interrelated and reflect different inputs diagenetic and transport processes across the large expanse of taihu the approach taken here is extensible to any regional setting for freshwater studies and with particular relevance to bioavailability modeling and era this work we report here is part of an important step forward in addressing urgent needs to develop streamlined approaches to regional era overall results herein show that the values of k cond that we have obtained are in accord with our understanding of processes occurring across the lake and as affected by upstream hydrological inputs and regional scale transport the ability to use the fluorescence methods here in high throughput applications fluorescence measurement titration and data analysis pipelines is highly attractive for era applications and we do not know of another report that has been as comprehensive and resulted in simultaneously good internal agreement with understanding of the field site and results k cond that are obtained in a manner practical enough to implement in era studies we have recently completed a detailed study using the k conds reported here in era models and we find that the average relative error is vastly improved we hope to report on that soon
