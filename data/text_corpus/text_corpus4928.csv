24640,reconciliation between water uses and sustaining aquatic species populations requires an effort to identify and quantify essential habitat characteristics for ecosystem health and valuation methods to predict ecosystem response to restoration actions this process is particularly challenging for anadromous fish species such as california s sacramento river winter run chinook salmon due to their limited geographic range and diverse life history habitat requirements tools such as life cycle models are needed to manage population dynamics and quantify the composite effects of processes across space and time nevertheless complex institutions can hinder result interpretation and communication and limit model use in decision making this paper focuses on the federally endangered and endemic sacramento river winter run chinook oncorhynchus tshawytscha by developing a winter run habitat based population model wrhap wrhap is a conceptual freshwater rearing stage model that includes alternative rearing habitats reported in the literature e g floodplains off channel and tributaries defines rules of habitat use based on instream conditions and incorporates a juvenile growth module that combines bioenergetics modeling with empirical growth rates model outputs reasonably follow observed out migration patterns and provide a realistic smolt size distribution arriving at the san francisco bay this effort demonstrates the importance of currently non critical habitats as defined by the endangered species act for juvenile development with floodplain habitat contributing to a quarter of out migrating biomass despite 18 availability and 10 of total rearing days and off channel growth being one of the most sensitive parameters explaining 13 of average juvenile weight variance the model shows the utility of a simple population model to explore relationships between habitat quality quantity and juvenile development and to assist water environmental management and decision making processes focused on species recovery keywords sacramento river chinook salmon juvenile rearing modeling bioenergetics modeling ecological valuation endangered species 1 introduction over the past century humans developed an extensive water management system in california s sacramento river basin this system is managed for multiple and sometimes competing objectives including irrigated agriculture flood control hydropower water supply and ecosystems in the past priority was given to human water uses producing sharp declines in anadromous fishes and other native species this in turn led to increased political legal and resource management efforts to enhance aquatic ecosystems and native fishes however despite substantial investments yoshiyama et al 1998 these efforts have been insufficient to sustain sacramento river winter run chinook salmon evolutionary significant unit esu waples 1991 this endemic population has declined dramatically from the 1970s to the present with fewer than 975 adults returning in 2017 84 5 from hatchery origin usfws 2019 four runs of chinook salmon named after the season adults return to spawn occur in the california central valley cvv basin each with unique life histories sacramento river winter run chinook adults migrate during winter and spawn during late spring and early summer moyle 2002 below keswick dam on the sacramento river after reaching maturity typically after two years in the ocean juveniles rear in freshwater habitats for 5 10 months before out migrating to the ocean they exhibit a diverse rearing history with habitats that include the sacramento river mainstem sutter and yolo bypasses jones and stokes associates 1993 sommer et al 2001 and other off channel habitats recently winter run chinook have also been found to rear in non natal tributaries such as the lassen tributaries i e deer mill and battle creeks and the feather and american rivers phillis et al 2018 winter run declines are strongly driven by the closure of shasta and keswick dams and near elimination of lateral habitat connectivity in the lower watershed from leveeing floodplain habitat and water diversions thus winter run chinook have been cut off from 100 of their historical spawning habitat along the mccloud and pit rivers cold volcanic spring fed rivers and currently only spawn in non natal habitats sacramento river below keswick dam yoshiyama et al 1998 lusardi and moyle 2017 the esu is vulnerable to extinction principally because it is restricted to a single spawning area between red bluff and keswick dam between late april and august nmfs 2014 as such the esu relies on cold water releases from keswick dam since winter run embryos are the most sensitive life stage to higher temperatures and require temperatures less than 12ºc in the field several degrees lower than those reported by laboratory studies 15 4ºc usfws 1999 martin et al 2017 although temperature related regulations to govern dam operations were established to protect endangered winter run salmon eggs during incubation nmfs 2009 such regulations have been insufficient for critically high temperatures during extended droughts williams et al 2016 adams 2018 likely to become more common as the climate warms martin et al 2017 despite a long history of awareness of the decline of winter run chinook and the mechanisms of decline few studies combine human water and land uses with explicit ecological objectives horne et al 2016 reconciling water uses and sustainable ecological goals requires identifying habitat characteristics essential for ecosystem health and developing effective methods to predict ecosystem response to water control decisions jager and smith 2008 this is particularly challenging for migratory and multi life stage species exhibiting broader geographic ranges and complex habitat shifts from evolved life histories affecting survivorship over time and space phillis et al 2018 freshwater habitat designated under esa as critically important for long term persistence of winter run is limited to the out migration corridor i e mainstem sacramento river below keswick dam to the golden gate bridge and excludes tributaries and seasonally inundated floodplain habitats however recent research shows non natal tributaries are important for winter run chinook rearing and development with 44 65 of returning adults having used these areas for at least three weeks during their juvenile life stage phillis et al 2018 such habitats likely provide diverse rearing conditions and possibly support growth and survival during out migration maslin et al 1996 limm and marchetti 2009 similarly seasonal floodplains such as the yolo and sutter bypasses provide critical rearing habitat where the growth of juvenile salmonids has outperformed congeners reared in the mainstem sacramento river during the same period sommer et al 2001 2020 jeffres et al 2008 2020 katz et al 2017 sacramento river winter run chinook salmon appear to rely on a more diverse set of rearing habitats than previously acknowledged suggesting expanded conservation opportunities for species recovery phillis et al 2018 population dynamic models show linkages between salmon survival and ecosystem variables such as temperature and flow and are often related to infrastructure control decisions in regulated systems they are insightful mathematical tools for evaluating the complex effects of water project operations and restoration on salmon population dynamics e g jager and rose 2003 such models offer a flexible conceptual structure and are defined and parametrized by expert knowledge empirical and laboratory studies and tested against ecological field observations dilão 2006 however complex institutions and methods often hinder result interpretability and communication hindering decision making based on their output horne et al 2016 most existing models do not represent the diverse rearing habitats within large river systems such as the sacramento valley recent modeling efforts e g beer et al 2017 hendrix et al 2017 also lack representation of juvenile growth in available rearing habitat despite its relationship to expected survival during out migration and in the marine environment claiborne et al 2011 iglesias et al 2017 here we present a conceptual population dynamic model integrating existing knowledge of early life stages of winter run chinook salmon e g growth survival rates egg critical water temperature from empirical data and previous modeling efforts the intent is to more systematically examine how off mainstem habitats may be better represented and managed for salmon conservation as such a simple conceptual structure and output interpretability was stipulated as a main goal for this modeling effort to improve communication of results to decision makers and for scientific synthesis this model the winter run habitat based population model wrhap i includes in its structure four alternative available habitats floodplain tributaries off channel and mainstem expanding the geographic extent represented in previous efforts and ii formulates the value of each available habitat for the number and size of out migrating salmon populations 2 methods 2 1 model description and structure wrhap is a simplified model to estimate the number and biomass of juveniles out migrating from california s sacramento valley to the sacramento san joaquin delta hereafter denoted as delta in a given year as a function of estimated winter run spawners and physical habitat variables along the sacramento river fig 1 the model structure consists of four modules arranged sequentially fig 2 each representing a coarse discretization in space and time to account for the different life stages and to follow the rearing movements of juveniles through the system as described in the literature grover et al 2004 del rosario et al 2013 see table 1 experienced growth and survival are applied on a daily time step within each module the delta stage is greatly simplified and ocean stages are excluded from the model structure to focus on year to year variability in freshwater habitat quantity and quality as such wrhap is not a full life cycle model this avoids exogenous sources of uncertainty that could hinder the interpretability of results 2 2 winter run juvenile habitat selection and out migration 2 2 1 spawning area this first module estimates the number of juveniles leaving spawning grounds below keswick dam to rear and move downstream along the sacramento river system during each year the number of spawners nspawn was obtained from the grandtab database azat 2019 which already accounts for adult pre spawn mortality we considered the annual proportion of females rfem and fecundity f reported by poytress 2016 and voss and poytress 2020 derived from carcass surveys and annual average of egg counts of winter run brood stock spawned at the livingston stone national fish hatchery respectively egg to fry survival was computed as a combination of natural βfry n without habitat effects density dependent and temperature induced mortality rates over the incubation period density dependent effects are expected due to the greater concentration of spawners on the uppermost river segment since the completion of the reengineered anderson cottonwood irrigation district acid fish ladders in 2001 poytress et al 2014 we evaluated the impact on egg to fry survival including the beverton holt density dependent term fitted by martin et al 2017 temperature induced mortality was simulated using the phenomenological model for winter run chinook salmon embryos developed by martin et al 2017 this model determines the instantaneous mortality rate hd d 1 that an embryo experiences during the dth day of its development with temperature tkwk d downstream keswick dam the model is parametrized with tcrit the temperature below which there is no temperature related mortality and bt the slope at which mortality rate increases with temperature 1 h d b t max t k w k d t c r i t 0 the length of this development period n days was modeled using a temperature dependent maturation function zeug et al 2012 then the temperature dependent survival for each year β t is computed as the average survival for all redds within every brood year by 2 β t 1 n redds d 1 n e h d the spawning dates and number of redds nredds were estimated from aerial redd surveys cdfw 2020 winter run juvenile production pj 0 is estimated using the following equation 3 p j 0 β fry n 1 n spawn r fem k n spawn r fem f β t where k is the capacity parameter of the beverton holt term parameter values description and sources are summarized in table 2 2 2 2 upper sacramento river rearing this module represents the dispersal of juveniles from natal reaches to rearing habitats within the upper sacramento river phillis et al 2018 using otolith analysis found that several mount lassen tributaries e g battle mill and deer creeks are primary non natal rearing habitats phillis et al 2018 suitable habitat availability atrib m2 was estimated for mill mc and deer creek dc from weighted usable area wua relationships bartholow 2004 derived from stage discharge curves and average cross sections kondolff et al 2001 cdfw 2017a 2017b to define the percentage of preferred rearing areas i e depths between 0 5 2 m nmfs 2014 a constant available habitat area was considered for battle creek bc representing the preferred alternative flows scenario defined in the battle creek restoration program appendix b icf international 2016 then the maximum percentage of juveniles accessing tributary habitat is computed following 4 γ trib ρ trib us p j 0 a trib mc h trib mc a trib dc h trib dc a trib bc where ρ trib us fish m2 is the juvenile density at tributary habitats table 2 and htrib t is the stage at tributary t retrieved from cdec daily data off channel habitat was defined as pools and areas adjacent to the sacramento mainstem that become active above specific flow thresholds maslin et al 1996 and limm and marchetti 2009 documented the use and importance of off channel habitat for juvenile rearing total inundated area aoff acres was estimated for different flow conditions in the sacramento river q sac fig 3 based on the modified normalized difference water index mndwi first proposed by mcfeeters 1996 to allow for the measurement of surface water extent this index was derived from multi spectral remote sensing imagery produced by the landsat multispectral scanner 2013 2020 period since its finer resolution allows to map smaller flood events chen et al 2014 generally the values of mndwi range from 1 to 1 with values over 0 representing surface water however a slight calibration in the threshold value was needed to result accuracy ji et al 2009 chen et al 2014 using surveyed off channel habitats between bend bridge and colusa kondolf and stillwater sciences 2007 a value of 0 05 was established as the cut off point the mndwi values under dense vegetation and or high cloud cover may be misrepresented mcfeeters 1996 leading to potential underestimation of total inundated area finally habitat capacity estimates to determine the maximum proportion of juveniles rearing in a habitat γ off were based on density estimates of 3 juveniles per unit of suitable habitat ρ off us m2 bartholow 2004 hendrix et al 2017 5 γ o f f 4046 86 a o f f q s a c ρ o f f u s p j 0 the model assumes that juveniles rear in one of two alternative habitats or that fish do not rear in either habitat i e a single individual does not move between tributaries and off channel areas the number of juveniles pj k that leave the upper sacramento river after rearing in habitat k off off channel trib tributary and main mainstem exclusively for d k u s days is given by 6 p j k γ k p j 0 β main us d us d k us β k d k us 1 1 1 e b j t k

rate at habitat k temperature related survival was fitted to weekly estimates therefore tk is the average weekly temperature at habitat k and a factor of 7 is required additional parameters are defined in table 2 2 2 3 juvenile migration to the lower sacramento river after rearing in the upper sacramento river area all surviving juveniles move downstream where rearing continues until smoltification peak migration through knights landing to the lower sacramento river occurs during high flow events i e at least 400 m3s 1 at wilkins slough rkm 190 del rosario et al 2013 with success rate strongly increasing with event flow rates michel et al 2015 furthermore iglesias et al 2017 showed a significant correlation between out migration mortality and poor fish condition i e a proxy of overall health of individual fish this is characterized using fulton s k factor which describes the ratio of fish weight g to fish length mm therefore migration survival βm k is modeled using a generalized linear model eq 6 fitted with a gaussian distribution and a logarithmic link to 2007 2012 tagged fish survival estimates iglesias et al 2017 with peak flows qout and juvenile condition from each rearing history kk as covariates both predictors are related to smolt passage time which determines exposure to mortality risks 7 log β m k 3 9031 q o u t 1000 1 8680 k k 6 1049 the number of juveniles reared in habitat k that reaches the lower sacramento river p j k s is then computed as 8 p j k s β m k q o u t k k p j k 2 2 4 lower sacramento river rearing this module distributes the remaining age 0 population into available rearing habitats and estimates the number ready to out migrate to the ocean juveniles spend on average nearly three months rearing in the lower sacramento before their departure at chipps island del rosario et al 2013 residence time at this river segment dls was estimated from the 50 passage date at chipps island iep 2020 as in the previous module juveniles may rear in a maximum of one alternative rearing area off channel habitat in the lower sacramento is greatly restricted by intense channelization downstream of colusa ca flow habitat relationships were computed following the same procedure described for the upper sacramento river tributaries used by juveniles for rearing and development include the feather and american rivers phillis et al 2018 suitable habitat availability was determined based on stage discharge and wua relationships using the same procedure as the previous module estimates where compared with usage percentages for the 2004 2006 brood years from phillis et al 2018 the primary floodplains considered in the model are sutter and yolo bypasses which become active when high flows overtop tisdale and fremont weirs respectively nevertheless fish move into the floodplains exclusively when overtopping occurs concurrently or shortly after 1 2 weeks fish migration across knights landing the proportion of the population entering the bypasses αflood was modeled following the formulation of acierto et al 2014 which assumes juveniles are evenly distributed in the water column and enter the bypasses proportionally to flow 9 α flood ρ sutt er 1 ρ sutt er ρ yolo ρ sutt er q tis q tis q wlk ρ yolo q fre q fre q von where qst is the flow at cdec station st the proportion entering sutter bypass is subtracted before considering yolo bypass due to its upstream location residence time in floodplain habitat was defined as a function of the overtopping event length number of days and an average bypass draining period of three weeks takata et al 2017 the number of juveniles pj ki that reared in habitat k in the upper sacramento and now leave the lower sacramento river after rearing in habitat i for d i l s days is given by 10 p j ki α i p j k s β main ls d ls d i ls β i d i ls 1 1 1 e b j t i t 50 j d i ls 7 1 1 1 e b j t main t 50 j d ls d i ls 7 where dls is the residence time days in the lower sacramento αi is the proportion that reared in habitat i βi is the daily rearing survival rate at habitat i and ti is the average weekly temperature at habitat i additional parameters are defined in table 1 before reaching chipps island smolts out migrate either along yolo bypass or through the delta complex channel system experiencing an additional source of mortality these values are considered constant across years to avoid additional sources of uncertainty introduced by smolt route selection a function of water management in the delta perry et al 2010 furthermore michel et al 2015 found that the best model to represent out migration survival for the complete sacramento river system held delta and san francisco bay survival constant through time therefore the number of smolts reaching chipps island is given by parameters defined in table 2 11 p j o u t β s y o l o k p j k f l o o d β s d e l t a i f l o o d k p j k i 2 3 winter run juvenile development 2 3 1 spawning area initial juvenile biomass was based on the average weight of fry during emergence from gravel kent 1999 and titus et al 2004 estimate a value of 0 410 g w0 equivalent to a 36 mm fish this is also supported by data from vogel and marine 1991 showing millimeter deviation from this value 2 3 2 upper and lower sacramento river growth of juveniles in mainstem and tributary habitats was modeled as a constant percent increase in weight per day due to the lack of field studies documenting prey composition and prey density data growth rates were obtained using an average of reported values by scarce existing field studies sommer et al 2001 jeffres 2016 these studies were based on fall run chinook juveniles from end of january to mid march when coexisting winter run juveniles are greater in length since daily length increase rates are a function of juvenile length with decreasing marginal increments the expected rates for winter run should be less than those reported in the literature nevertheless the weight increase rate is expected to be similar under the same conditions and could be extrapolated to winter run juveniles jeffres 2019 the main drawback of using constant growth rates is the lack of representation of changing conditions in the sacramento river system between years however since growth in floodplains has been more extensively reported katz et al 2013 katz et al 2014 a bioenergetics model was implemented using the fish bioenergetics model 4 0 deslauriers et al 2017 for this and off channel rearing habitats as the latter is considered similar in characteristics intermittent wetted areas simulated daily growth δg depend on habitat conditions e g temperature and prey availability 12 δ g c r a s d a f u where c is the energy input consumption r is the metabolism a is the activity sda is the energy required to digest food f represents egestion and u excretion within the model consumption was modeled as a satiation percentage p 13 c p c m a x where the maximum consumption cmax is a function of temperature and juvenile weight table 3 summarizes the bioenergetics parameters and their sources the model was tested against four years of recorded growth data 2014 2017 for fall run chinook salmon at knaggs ranch yolo bypass katz unpublished data a detailed review of empirical experiments at knaggs ranch was compiled by sommer et al 2020 the model used satiation percentages within 0 4 1 0 as daily values were not reported to estimate growth rate ranges along the experiment duration daily temperature was available from field measurements and the energy density of the prey was defined based on diet composition from stomach content data on average the diet included cladocerans 95 chiromidae 2 and copepods 3 with energy densities of 3960 j g 3248 j g and 4500 j g respectively luecke and brandt 1993 tiffan et al 2014 haskell et al 2017 the computed daily growth bands were then compared with the experienced growth of juveniles leaving the testing site at successive days due to sparse temperature data availability at yolo and sutter bypasses after historical overtopping events we also analyzed the differences in end of period simulated daily growth rates using daily versus averaged temperatures during the field experiment to assess if the latter provide a reasonable approximation the weight of a surviving juvenile after rearing in the upper sacramento for d k u s days in habitat k and growth rate rg k was computed as 14 w k u s w 0 r g m a i n d u s d k u s r g k d k u s while the weight of a juvenile that reared in habitat k in the upper sacramento and in habitat i in the lower sacramento for d i l s days and growth rate rg i is 15 w k i l s w k u s r g m a i n d l s d i l s r g i d i l s 2 3 3

sensitivity of model outputs to every input parameter these indices are used for a mathematical and more precise estimation of the influence of individual variables or groups of variables on model output here we focused on the first and total order indices s1 st which indicates the proportion of total variance explained by the specific parameter by itself and the proportion not explained by all terms individual parameters and their n order interactions with other input parameters excluding those from the parameter analyzed respectively this method is superior when relationships between model outputs and input parameters are nonlinear or nonmonotonic iooss and lemaître 2015 for the analysis a sample size n of 35 000 was selected following saltelli et al 2010 within predefined ranges for all 21 model parameters based on observed ranges in field studies expert knowledge and feasible values e g 0 1 for habitat use parameters defined from observed data such us ratio of females rfem or fecundity f were not considered because they are regarded as observed inputs analogous to temperature or flow likewise the parameters of the bioenergetics model were not included in the analysis but the bioenergetics output growth at the floodplains rg flood and off channel areas rg off was considered in order to analyze their relative importance on juvenile development when compared to remaining rearing habitats the number and biomass of out migrants were computed for each of 1 540 000 2n p 1 model evaluations to calculate the first and total order sensitivity index and their 95 confidence interval using the salib library in python herman and usher 2017 this sample size n was needed to assure convergence in the sensitivity indices computation input parameters were ranked based on total order index value and considered non sensitive if their confidence intervals included zero this information helps identify habitat conditions availability and or quality which increase variance in successful juvenile development and can suggest habitat targets for potential management and recovery actions to improve juvenile production in the sacramento valley 3 results 3 1 field data comparison computed outputs were compared to recorded winter run indices of abundance throughout the life cycle red bluff juvenile counts brood years 1995 1999 and 2002 2017 martin et al 2001 poytress et al 2014 voss and poytress 2019 allowed comparison of in river juvenile production that reared in the upper sacramento river wrhap estimates closely follow the observed patterns r2 0 94 fig 4 d generally lying within their 90 confidence interval fig 4a as expected from using martin et al 2017 fitted biophysical model during previous model iterations outputs from brood years 1997 1998 differed in more than three times the standard deviation of the data distribution the discrepancy was from differences in spawner values provided by grandtab and cdfg carcass surveys killam 2006 with values of 836 and 2053 for 1998 respectively the latter values were adopted as more realistic estimates of fry production compared with red bluff records drought years with warm releases from shasta e g 2014 2016 were especially well represented as shown by the narrower uncertainty in the observed passage suggesting that egg to fry temperature mortality was adequately captured knights landing catches snider and titus 1998 2000ab c vincik et al 2006 roberts 2007 roberts et al 2013 unpublished data julienne 2016 mckibbin 2016 columbia basin research 2018 provided the observed record to verify the estimated number of migrants to the lower sacramento river a poorer fit was obtained r2 0 58 fig 4e expected from the more complex interactions occurring along the upper sacramento river with model estimates generally overestimating catch based abundances nevertheless annual migration patterns were reasonably reproduced e g by2012 2013 with output values largely within 95 confidence intervals of catch based estimates fig 4b finally model output was compared with abundance estimates at chipps island pyper et al 2013b iep 2020 for the 1995 2010 period three alternative midwater trawl efficiency values pittsburg jersey point and paired release were considered to estimate uncertainty bounds because a single best estimate has not been selected pyper et al 2013a these values were also considered constant through time as recommended by pyper et al 2013a the pittsburgh efficiency value was used to analyze model fitness since the remaining efficiencies led to unrealistic catch based estimates greater than abundancy numbers at knights landing e g by1999 2000 simulated abundances are a reasonable approximation of the historical pattern despite a low coefficient of determination r2 0 44 fig 4f as simulated values generally lie within the uncertainty bounds fig 4c deeming acceptable the simplification of delta out migration survival as a constant through time these comparisons showed inconsistencies between catch based estimates at knights landing rotary trap and chipps island mid water trawl requiring unrealistic survival values 1 to explain the change in population numbers between these two locations wrhap estimates lie within the uncertainty bounds at one of the locations when such discrepancies exist e g bys1999 2008 fig 4bc suggesting a better representation than the coefficient of determination values indicate to evaluate juvenile growth and migration timing we compared migrants fork lengths with reported ranges at knights landing snider and titus 1998 2000a b c vincik et al 2006 roberts 2007 mckibbin 2016 and chipps island iep 2020 since wrhap computes individual weight an empirical relationship l mm 48w0 3 g hinkelman et al 2017 was used to transform the estimates for their comparison simulated fork lengths of migrating juveniles to the lower sacramento river matched reasonably well for the reported brood years by 1995 1999 2001 and 2011 2012 with a simulated range of 64 109 mm against the recorded 45 119 mm in most years the smallest simulated juveniles 65 mm were larger than the range of shortest captured winter run i e 45 56 mm since these values correspond to later fry emergence times than those considered in the model structure average fork lengths were well captured with simulated fork lengths of 89 and 68 mm for by 2011 2012 against observed 88 and 60 mm for instance model output reasonably approximates recorded fork lengths at chipps island especially maximum fork lengths during brood years with floodplain habitat available e g by 1998 1999 2005 2007 2009 fig 5 similar to knights landing data smallest fork lengths were usually longer than reported sizes due to captured individuals with later emergence times than those considered in the model structure the greatest differences between modelled and observed length distributions were during low flow years with short residence periods at lower sacramento river e g by 2000 2004 3 2 fish bioenergetics model observed growth rates throughout all experiments show diminishing growth rates for longer residence times expected from decreasing percentage increases in weight for increasingly larger juveniles this temporal pattern was captured by the bioenergetics model bands fig 6 indicating a correct representation of the temperature effects on juvenile development modeling results accurately reproduced observed juvenile development with observed growth rates within a single satiation percentage range especially from 5 6 days before the experiment completion when greater numbers of juveniles 80 left the rearing area juveniles out migrating during the experiment s first half 10 of total showed poorer growth rates as expected since experiencing suboptimal rearing conditions could trigger early movement observed growth rates were the lowest during the 2017 experiment when extensive overtopping at fremont weir occurred and optimal conditions at floodplain habitats were not present i e shallow and warm waters for zooplankton production corline et al 2017 jeffres et al 2020 as such a satiation percentage under 50 was required to simulate the observed growth rates fig 6 which agree with existing conditions i e lower prey density in contrast knaggs ranch was disconnected from the sacramento river during the 2014 2016 experiments when controlled inundation was implemented providing optimal or near optimal zooplankton production and rearing conditions hence simulated satiation percentages were consistently over 60 70 with almost full satiation during 2016 90 differences in p values also could be related to annual changes in daphnia energy density as it conforms the greatest dietary component 90 and their specific caloric value was not recorded during the field study therefore bioenergetics model outputs presented a correct coherence with prey densities rearing conditions and recorded growth rates end of experiment growth rates estimated using a constant averaged temperature differed in less than 3 5 on average from the fluctuating temperature results fig 6 as such average temperatures in yolo and sutter bypasses after flooding events were used to simulate growth to adjust for sparse temperature data availability in those areas since they provide a reasonable approximation 3 3 sensitivity analysis sobol sensitivity indices showed rearing survival at the mainstem β main as the most sensitive parameter for total number of smolts reaching san francisco bay explaining a 50 5 of total variance first order index s1 and 58 when its parameter interactions are considered total order index st table 4 as such the influence on model output variance is at least three times greater than any other model parameter and mainly caused by the first order effect nossent et al 2011 this was an expected outcome as the complete cohort rears within the mainstem for prolonged periods 77 of total rearing time on average table 5 when off mainstem habitats are both available and unavailable for instance juveniles that reared in off channel habitats for two weeks spent their remaining rearing stage within the mainstem river fig 2 such rearing behavior coupled with the positive relationship between fish condition fulton s k and migration success βm eq 7 explains i the influence of upper sacramento river growth related parameters and ii mainstem growth rg main total effect being three fold greater than growth rates at alternative habitats rg trib and rg off despite their improved rearing conditions maslin 1996 limm and marchetti 2009 nevertheless the latter and off channel habitat use γflood being the fourth sixth ranked parameters suggest that juveniles taking advantage of these areas have greater chances of successfully out migrating lifting their relative importance in the upper sacramento river total out migrants show high sensitivity to egg to fry survival without temperature effects βfry n as its interaction with fecundity f and proportion of females rfem determines the initial number of juveniles out migration survival through the delta and yolo bypass do not significantly influence the variability of smolt abundance 3 1 of total variance indicating that mainstem conditions and available rearing habitats arose as the most limiting factor on chinook salmon production bartholow 2001 beer et al 2017 nevertheless rearing survival in the alternative habitats show low sensitivity sti 0 015 reflecting similar rearing mortalities independent of the choice of rearing path as indicated in the literature katz et al 2017 model outputs were not sensitive to parameters with negative indices values within confidence intervals nossent et al 2011 as expected smolt biomass was most influenced by growth related parameters growth rates and residence times and proportion of juveniles rearing at supplemental habitats the analysis shows floodplains as the most influential rearing habitat in the valley with its growth rate rg flood residence time d f l o o d l s and proportion of juveniles αflood as the first second and fourth most sensitive parameters for out migrating smolt biomass respectively the difference between their first and total order indices indicate their influence is mainly from interactions among these parameters for instance the interaction between rg flood and dflood explains a 17 of the total variance greater than either of them individually 12 and 9 5 respectively the total effect of floodplain growth rates is around three and six times greater than those associated with mainstem and remaining supplemental habitats respectively this agrees with field studies on the importance of floodplain habitat on smolt body condition and hence on initial ocean survival i e smolt to age 2 survival claiborne et al 2011 by providing enhanced rearing conditions sommer et al 2001 katz et al 2017 jeffres et al 2020 as could be expected the second ranked habitat is the sacramento mainstem rg main since juveniles spend prolonged periods rearing in this habitat even juveniles using off mainstem habitats along the upper and lower sacramento river table 5 however some of its influence on individual biomass total biomass over out migrant numbers is not related to growth conditions but rather its effect on migration survival βm eq 7 and smolt numbers second highest rank for total out migrants in table 4 the third ranked habitat is off channel areas explaining 13 of total variance its growth rate total order effect is just half that of mainstem habitat despite averaging 31 of mainstem residence times this shows that this supplemental habitat provides superior rearing conditions and so becomes an important driver on individual success during the marine stage agreeing with published literature maslin 1996 limm and marchetti 2009 finally the lowest ranked habitat by influence on average individual biomass is tributaries explaining 6 1 of total variance this was somewhat expected since tributary residence time is shorter than that of mainstem habitats and growth rates were inferior when compared with off channel habitats table 4 as such its total effect is nearly two four and ten fold less than off channel mainstem and floodplain areas respectively 4 discussion wrhap outputs result from mechanistic understanding of fish survival and growth and agree reasonably well with observed records of winter run abundances fig 4 nevertheless the model greatly simplifies fish ecology and population dynamics the coarse temporal and spatial discretization neglect some important fish habitat criteria such as peak and minimum water temperatures nrc 2004 furthermore not all instream habitat parameters except flow and temperature were directly represented due to data unavailability instead they were aggregated in the rearing survival estimate although other water quality parameters e g turbidity and predation dynamics greatly influence survival and rearing success national research council nrc 2004 the greatest uncertainty is related to several parameters e g tributary growth rates and estimates of rearing habitat usage survival and residence time due to the lack of available empirical and behavioral studies despite the importance of these estimates in understanding juvenile life stage limitations as illustrated by associated high total sensitivity indices sti table 4 a significant data gap exists because there is a lack of explicit monitoring for the winter run johnson et al 2017 as such only two studies provided mainstem growth rates and both were limited to three years of data 1998 1999 and 2016 sommer et al 2001 jeffres 2016 further only one study provided a comparison of tributary growth rates to mainstem conditions limm and marchetti 2009 and only three brood years 2004 2006 of otolith growth data were available for estimating tributary rearing phillis et al 2017 otolith growth data also are based on returning adults which potentially misrepresent actual habitat use by either underestimating actual numbers from the loss of individuals occurring between juvenile out migration and adult return or by overstating tributary use due to improved survival relative to the mainstem phillis et al 2017 these studies also cover only a small proportion of the extensive range of potential conditions experienced by juveniles during rearing and out migration a more intensive monitoring program is needed to better understand habitat availability and juvenile development tradeoffs and more accurately simulate the different life stages of winter run chinook salmon despite challenges from a lack of observational data model development was motivated by the neglect or misrepresentation of supplemental rearing habitats in existing modeling efforts partly due to their previous conception of a single habitat below a dam e g jager et al 1997 bartholow 2004 only hendrix et al 2017 included more disaggregation of rearing habitats for winter run chinook life stages but omitted tributaries and off channel areas shown to be important for chinook salmon juvenile growth and survival maslin et al 1996 limm and marchetti 2009 other modeling efforts for winter run chinook in the sacramento river only considered esa designated critical habitat e g zeug et al 2012 beer et al 2017 for such models fish survival depended exclusively on temperature during early life stages varying with distance and time of travel function of flows and smolt swimming speed e g x t model anderson et al 2005 although smolt swimming speed also is subject to its body condition no simulation of growth during the rearing stage of in river produced winter run chinook was included in any model structure the expanded conceptual structure of wrhap allows analysis of the effects of rearing history and alternative habitat constraints availability on juvenile growth and out migration success for instance model output from brood years with existing floodplain habitat show a consistent high proportion of biomass generated in this rearing area fig 7 as summarized in table 5 floodplains contribute the second most to total simulated out migration biomass approximately 29 30 less than mainstem fig 7 despite only 15 20 of total out migrants being able to access yolo and sutter bypasses and a rearing duration averaging only 7 8 of the total rearing period for instance several brood years present greater out migrating biomass despite having fewer individuals reaching san francisco bay e g 2002 and 2003 2006 and 2009 fig 7 thus wrhap successfully represents floodplains as providing enhanced rearing conditions compared to adjacent river channels sommer et al 2001 katz et al 2017 jeffres et al 2020 when adequate flows occur the importance of this habitat is also stated by the sensitivity analysis recognizing floodplain related parameters growth rate residence time and proportion of juveniles as the most sensitive for out migrating biomass table 4 similarly average winter run chinook fork lengths for during rearing under mainstem sacramento river conditions were 94 mm compared to 130 mm for juveniles that reared within floodplain habitat during periods with frequent high flows overtopping fremont weir floodplain habitat quality was more similar to mainstem habitat due to a decline in optimal environmental conditions shallow and warmer water for zooplankton production corline et al 2017 jeffres et al 2020 thus poorer growth rates were expected as shown by katz unpublished data fig 6 the model captured this tradeoff with daily growth rates of 1 5 2 5 day e g by 2005 2016 compared to 5 7 day under optimal floodplain conditions e g by 2009 2010 the timing of downstream migration and weir overtopping events were crucial for juvenile development since floodplain habitat was only available when both occurred concurrently for instance during brood year 2001 mainstem migration was triggered by high flows exceeding 400 m3 s at wilkins slough between late november through mid december del rosario et al 2013 but fremont weir overtopping commenced in mid january as such the bulk of the winter run population migrated downstream of fremont weir prior to floodplain activation precluding juveniles from taking advantage of enhanced rearing conditions tributaries and off channel habitats account for 19 9 and 9 9 respectively of total generated biomass fig 7 at first glance off channel habitats may appear as the least productive rearing habitat due to its low contribution despite approximately a third of total out migrants used these intermittent habitats table 5 however off channel habitats are active for shorter durations one to three weeks as shown by remote sensing imagery compared with tributaries e g 28 days phillis et al 2018 and mainstem habitats as such off channel rearing when compared to tributaries showed a residence time over three fold less and a juvenile occupancy of 75 but showed just a 50 decline in generated biomass table 5 furthermore average simulated fork lengths were 106 and 116 mm for tributary and off channel rearing respectively suggesting enhanced rearing conditions in off channel habitats e g maslin 1996 this tradeoff is also shown by their sobol total order indices ranking off channel growth and residence time over tributaries table 4 more frequent activation of these habitats e g improving mainstem and side channel connectivity or small pulse flows from reservoir releases would enhance juvenile salmon residence time and likely improve out migration biomass and success as indicated by its total order sensitivity index table 4 nevertheless this is not indicative of tributary rearing having a marginal value similarly to the remaining off mainstem habitats tributary habitats also provided superior rearing conditions when compared to mainstem habitat generating half of the biomass 19 9 vs 41 3 with just 11 of rearing time on average this suggests that the relative importance of tributary habitat is greater than the inferred from the sensitivity analysis table 4 survival success during migration to the lower sacramento river depends in part on the existence and use of supplemental rearing habitats coupled with the timing of high flows individual survival success improves with juvenile condition i e weight to length ratio function of the rearing path in the upper sacramento river juveniles that reared in off channel habitats or tributaries when available regularly exhibited larger sizes and lower migration mortality this effect is more important for early migration dates when the contribution of mainstem rearing habitats to fish condition is greatly reduced compared to alternative habitats e g tributaries and off channel areas for instance simulated juveniles that reared in off channel areas during brood year 2006 early migration date exhibited superior condition 7 when compared with juveniles that used mainstem habitats in turn this enhanced migration survival by three fold however juveniles from brood year 2013 late migration date exhibited a 3 9 improvement in condition leading to a 98 increase in migration survival as such the marginal value of improved growth conditions decreases with an extended residence period since juveniles can reach suitable sizes to assure improved migration survival under exclusive mainstem rearing conditions regardless juveniles that reared only in the sacramento river mainstem exhibited the poorest condition and lowest annual survival these simulation outputs align with the discussion of sobol indices section 3 3 table 4 giving mainstem habitats a high influence on out migrant numbers due to prolonged rearing periods and not for superior rearing conditions as such off channel and tributary habitats hold a much greater relative importance than the suggested by the total order indices the annual variation in migration survival also reflects the existing tradeoff between migration date and juvenile abundances and condition later migration dates exhibited increased rearing mortalities due to extended exposure periods anderson et al 2005 but those individuals that succeeded were in better condition increasing their chances of survival during migration similarly the growth survival tradeoff also is expected to be crucial for out migrants at chipps island with longer residence times at the lower sacramento river producing fewer smolts in better condition and increasing and individual s probability of returning as an adult modeling as presented here suggests that off mainstem habitats are crucial to out migration and ocean stage survival and critical to long term recovery efforts for winter run chinook salmon populations this pattern was consistent throughout historical simulations with the greatest egg to smolt mortalities associated with low flow conditions and sparse or limited availability of supplemental habitats e g brood years 2001 2006 and 2014 fig 4 if these conditions were persistent across several years warm water releases from shasta reservoir associated with cold pool depletion significantly increase egg to fry mortality johnson and lindley 2016 low flow conditions also constrain the availability of two main alternative habitats e g off channel and floodplains limiting enhanced juvenile growth and out migration success as shown by the sensitivity analysis table 4 this also suggests that current infrastructure projects to improve floodplain management i e notching fremont weir dwr 2017 are promising because they offer the ability to provide floodplain access i during low flow years and ii when migration and overtopping events do not overlap lastly dry conditions are generally associated with small pulse flow cues for juvenile migration increasing their experienced mortality since the primary driver of smolt migration survival is the magnitude of the high flow event iglesias et al 2017 wrhap was not calibrated directly against observed fish population data e g bartholow 2004 although several parameters were defined from calibrated model outputs e g temperature related egg to fry survival martin et al 2017 table 1 parameter estimates were also defined from existing reported values in the literature empirical and laboratory studies and expert knowledge see table 2 model calibration faces two major challenges first the main model input number of returning adults to spawning areas killam 2006 azat 2019 is an estimate second the main migration data catches at chipps island knights landing and red bluff rotatory traps have high uncertainty from their efficiency factor estimates roberts 2007 pyper et al 2013a poytress et al 2014 therefore parameter value estimation by calibration to out migrant estimates probably cannot capture all effects of different physical and biological conditions on juveniles regardless the model s behavior was extensively reviewed to avoid errors and unrealistic hypotheses whrap represents an initial step to develop a method to understand the relative value and contribution of existing habitats to sustain winter run chinook salmon as such the model reflects the findings of previous studies on the ecological importance of each individual alternative rearing habitat in the sacramento valley sommer et al 2001 limm and marchetti 2009 and combines them to more completely represent winter run spawning rearing and out migration despite our analysis being driven by historical conditions it illustrates the potential of wrhap to assist in important decision making processes for an endemic and federally endangered fish from a water resource management standpoint linkages between water system operations and sacramento valley environmental conditions i e flow and temperature regimes that define habitat availability and quality can be used to define environmental flow requirements that target specific salmonid life stages or to estimate impacts of re operation policies on federally listed populations likewise wrhap can assist habitat restoration efforts by estimating effects of proposed recovery actions or programs of actions for winter run chinook and thus help develop optimized portfolios of habitat restoration actions future research will explore the effect of climate change on winter run juvenile dynamics under proposed and defined restoration portfolios by forcing wrhap with available temperature and flow projections in the sacramento valley brekke et al 2014 5 conclusions this study developed and tested a simplified freshwater rearing phase simulation model for winter run chinook salmon in california s sacramento valley based on previously published studies empirical field data laboratory studies and expert knowledge wrhap developed links connecting rearing habitat availability and quality with existing hydrologic conditions i e flow and temperature regimes and explained the impact of each individual habitat on juvenile development and out migration success a strength of the model is its capacity to identify important knowledge gaps in observed data with a flexible structure to allow integration of new data and functional relationships as they become available sensitivity analysis showed that estimates of mainstem rearing survival and growth rates together with observations on use and residence times within high flow habitats i e floodplains and off channel areas greatly influence juvenile productivity and body condition as such further studies are required to better understand the variability and temporal dynamics of these parameters allowing to build confidence on their related assumptions despite its simplicity wrhap provides realistic estimates of winter run production in the sacramento river valley represents several tradeoffs reasonably between in stream conditions and juvenile development and highlights the importance of off mainstem habitats for the long term persistence of winter run chinook salmon this aligns with the conclusions of lester et al 2011 in that more complex approaches to representing environmental outcomes do not necessarily improve predictions finally the modeling discussed here can aid resource managers by directly linking water management and habitat restoration actions in an effort to more clearly identify tradeoffs and effects on an endangered species

24640,reconciliation between water uses and sustaining aquatic species populations requires an effort to identify and quantify essential habitat characteristics for ecosystem health and valuation methods to predict ecosystem response to restoration actions this process is particularly challenging for anadromous fish species such as california s sacramento river winter run chinook salmon due to their limited geographic range and diverse life history habitat requirements tools such as life cycle models are needed to manage population dynamics and quantify the composite effects of processes across space and time nevertheless complex institutions can hinder result interpretation and communication and limit model use in decision making this paper focuses on the federally endangered and endemic sacramento river winter run chinook oncorhynchus tshawytscha by developing a winter run habitat based population model wrhap wrhap is a conceptual freshwater rearing stage model that includes alternative rearing habitats reported in the literature e g floodplains off channel and tributaries defines rules of habitat use based on instream conditions and incorporates a juvenile growth module that combines bioenergetics modeling with empirical growth rates model outputs reasonably follow observed out migration patterns and provide a realistic smolt size distribution arriving at the san francisco bay this effort demonstrates the importance of currently non critical habitats as defined by the endangered species act for juvenile development with floodplain habitat contributing to a quarter of out migrating biomass despite 18 availability and 10 of total rearing days and off channel growth being one of the most sensitive parameters explaining 13 of average juvenile weight variance the model shows the utility of a simple population model to explore relationships between habitat quality quantity and juvenile development and to assist water environmental management and decision making processes focused on species recovery keywords sacramento river chinook salmon juvenile rearing modeling bioenergetics modeling ecological valuation endangered species 1 introduction over the past century humans developed an extensive water management system in california s sacramento river basin this system is managed for multiple and sometimes competing objectives including irrigated agriculture flood control hydropower water supply and ecosystems in the past priority was given to human water uses producing sharp declines in anadromous fishes and other native species this in turn led to increased political legal and resource management efforts to enhance aquatic ecosystems and native fishes however despite substantial investments yoshiyama et al 1998 these efforts have been insufficient to sustain sacramento river winter run chinook salmon evolutionary significant unit esu waples 1991 this endemic population has declined dramatically from the 1970s to the present with fewer than 975 adults returning in 2017 84 5 from hatchery origin usfws 2019 four runs of chinook salmon named after the season adults return to spawn occur in the california central valley cvv basin each with unique life histories sacramento river winter run chinook adults migrate during winter and spawn during late spring and early summer moyle 2002 below keswick dam on the sacramento river after reaching maturity typically after two years in the ocean juveniles rear in freshwater habitats for 5 10 months before out migrating to the ocean they exhibit a diverse rearing history with habitats that include the sacramento river mainstem sutter and yolo bypasses jones and stokes associates 1993 sommer et al 2001 and other off channel habitats recently winter run chinook have also been found to rear in non natal tributaries such as the lassen tributaries i e deer mill and battle creeks and the feather and american rivers phillis et al 2018 winter run declines are strongly driven by the closure of shasta and keswick dams and near elimination of lateral habitat connectivity in the lower watershed from leveeing floodplain habitat and water diversions thus winter run chinook have been cut off from 100 of their historical spawning habitat along the mccloud and pit rivers cold volcanic spring fed rivers and currently only spawn in non natal habitats sacramento river below keswick dam yoshiyama et al 1998 lusardi and moyle 2017 the esu is vulnerable to extinction principally because it is restricted to a single spawning area between red bluff and keswick dam between late april and august nmfs 2014 as such the esu relies on cold water releases from keswick dam since winter run embryos are the most sensitive life stage to higher temperatures and require temperatures less than 12ºc in the field several degrees lower than those reported by laboratory studies 15 4ºc usfws 1999 martin et al 2017 although temperature related regulations to govern dam operations were established to protect endangered winter run salmon eggs during incubation nmfs 2009 such regulations have been insufficient for critically high temperatures during extended droughts williams et al 2016 adams 2018 likely to become more common as the climate warms martin et al 2017 despite a long history of awareness of the decline of winter run chinook and the mechanisms of decline few studies combine human water and land uses with explicit ecological objectives horne et al 2016 reconciling water uses and sustainable ecological goals requires identifying habitat characteristics essential for ecosystem health and developing effective methods to predict ecosystem response to water control decisions jager and smith 2008 this is particularly challenging for migratory and multi life stage species exhibiting broader geographic ranges and complex habitat shifts from evolved life histories affecting survivorship over time and space phillis et al 2018 freshwater habitat designated under esa as critically important for long term persistence of winter run is limited to the out migration corridor i e mainstem sacramento river below keswick dam to the golden gate bridge and excludes tributaries and seasonally inundated floodplain habitats however recent research shows non natal tributaries are important for winter run chinook rearing and development with 44 65 of returning adults having used these areas for at least three weeks during their juvenile life stage phillis et al 2018 such habitats likely provide diverse rearing conditions and possibly support growth and survival during out migration maslin et al 1996 limm and marchetti 2009 similarly seasonal floodplains such as the yolo and sutter bypasses provide critical rearing habitat where the growth of juvenile salmonids has outperformed congeners reared in the mainstem sacramento river during the same period sommer et al 2001 2020 jeffres et al 2008 2020 katz et al 2017 sacramento river winter run chinook salmon appear to rely on a more diverse set of rearing habitats than previously acknowledged suggesting expanded conservation opportunities for species recovery phillis et al 2018 population dynamic models show linkages between salmon survival and ecosystem variables such as temperature and flow and are often related to infrastructure control decisions in regulated systems they are insightful mathematical tools for evaluating the complex effects of water project operations and restoration on salmon population dynamics e g jager and rose 2003 such models offer a flexible conceptual structure and are defined and parametrized by expert knowledge empirical and laboratory studies and tested against ecological field observations dilão 2006 however complex institutions and methods often hinder result interpretability and communication hindering decision making based on their output horne et al 2016 most existing models do not represent the diverse rearing habitats within large river systems such as the sacramento valley recent modeling efforts e g beer et al 2017 hendrix et al 2017 also lack representation of juvenile growth in available rearing habitat despite its relationship to expected survival during out migration and in the marine environment claiborne et al 2011 iglesias et al 2017 here we present a conceptual population dynamic model integrating existing knowledge of early life stages of winter run chinook salmon e g growth survival rates egg critical water temperature from empirical data and previous modeling efforts the intent is to more systematically examine how off mainstem habitats may be better represented and managed for salmon conservation as such a simple conceptual structure and output interpretability was stipulated as a main goal for this modeling effort to improve communication of results to decision makers and for scientific synthesis this model the winter run habitat based population model wrhap i includes in its structure four alternative available habitats floodplain tributaries off channel and mainstem expanding the geographic extent represented in previous efforts and ii formulates the value of each available habitat for the number and size of out migrating salmon populations 2 methods 2 1 model description and structure wrhap is a simplified model to estimate the number and biomass of juveniles out migrating from california s sacramento valley to the sacramento san joaquin delta hereafter denoted as delta in a given year as a function of estimated winter run spawners and physical habitat variables along the sacramento river fig 1 the model structure consists of four modules arranged sequentially fig 2 each representing a coarse discretization in space and time to account for the different life stages and to follow the rearing movements of juveniles through the system as described in the literature grover et al 2004 del rosario et al 2013 see table 1 experienced growth and survival are applied on a daily time step within each module the delta stage is greatly simplified and ocean stages are excluded from the model structure to focus on year to year variability in freshwater habitat quantity and quality as such wrhap is not a full life cycle model this avoids exogenous sources of uncertainty that could hinder the interpretability of results 2 2 winter run juvenile habitat selection and out migration 2 2 1 spawning area this first module estimates the number of juveniles leaving spawning grounds below keswick dam to rear and move downstream along the sacramento river system during each year the number of spawners nspawn was obtained from the grandtab database azat 2019 which already accounts for adult pre spawn mortality we considered the annual proportion of females rfem and fecundity f reported by poytress 2016 and voss and poytress 2020 derived from carcass surveys and annual average of egg counts of winter run brood stock spawned at the livingston stone national fish hatchery respectively egg to fry survival was computed as a combination of natural βfry n without habitat effects density dependent and temperature induced mortality rates over the incubation period density dependent effects are expected due to the greater concentration of spawners on the uppermost river segment since the completion of the reengineered anderson cottonwood irrigation district acid fish ladders in 2001 poytress et al 2014 we evaluated the impact on egg to fry survival including the beverton holt density dependent term fitted by martin et al 2017 temperature induced mortality was simulated using the phenomenological model for winter run chinook salmon embryos developed by martin et al 2017 this model determines the instantaneous mortality rate hd d 1 that an embryo experiences during the dth day of its development with temperature tkwk d downstream keswick dam the model is parametrized with tcrit the temperature below which there is no temperature related mortality and bt the slope at which mortality rate increases with temperature 1 h d b t max t k w k d t c r i t 0 the length of this development period n days was modeled using a temperature dependent maturation function zeug et al 2012 then the temperature dependent survival for each year β t is computed as the average survival for all redds within every brood year by 2 β t 1 n redds d 1 n e h d the spawning dates and number of redds nredds were estimated from aerial redd surveys cdfw 2020 winter run juvenile production pj 0 is estimated using the following equation 3 p j 0 β fry n 1 n spawn r fem k n spawn r fem f β t where k is the capacity parameter of the beverton holt term parameter values description and sources are summarized in table 2 2 2 2 upper sacramento river rearing this module represents the dispersal of juveniles from natal reaches to rearing habitats within the upper sacramento river phillis et al 2018 using otolith analysis found that several mount lassen tributaries e g battle mill and deer creeks are primary non natal rearing habitats phillis et al 2018 suitable habitat availability atrib m2 was estimated for mill mc and deer creek dc from weighted usable area wua relationships bartholow 2004 derived from stage discharge curves and average cross sections kondolff et al 2001 cdfw 2017a 2017b to define the percentage of preferred rearing areas i e depths between 0 5 2 m nmfs 2014 a constant available habitat area was considered for battle creek bc representing the preferred alternative flows scenario defined in the battle creek restoration program appendix b icf international 2016 then the maximum percentage of juveniles accessing tributary habitat is computed following 4 γ trib ρ trib us p j 0 a trib mc h trib mc a trib dc h trib dc a trib bc where ρ trib us fish m2 is the juvenile density at tributary habitats table 2 and htrib t is the stage at tributary t retrieved from cdec daily data off channel habitat was defined as pools and areas adjacent to the sacramento mainstem that become active above specific flow thresholds maslin et al 1996 and limm and marchetti 2009 documented the use and importance of off channel habitat for juvenile rearing total inundated area aoff acres was estimated for different flow conditions in the sacramento river q sac fig 3 based on the modified normalized difference water index mndwi first proposed by mcfeeters 1996 to allow for the measurement of surface water extent this index was derived from multi spectral remote sensing imagery produced by the landsat multispectral scanner 2013 2020 period since its finer resolution allows to map smaller flood events chen et al 2014 generally the values of mndwi range from 1 to 1 with values over 0 representing surface water however a slight calibration in the threshold value was needed to result accuracy ji et al 2009 chen et al 2014 using surveyed off channel habitats between bend bridge and colusa kondolf and stillwater sciences 2007 a value of 0 05 was established as the cut off point the mndwi values under dense vegetation and or high cloud cover may be misrepresented mcfeeters 1996 leading to potential underestimation of total inundated area finally habitat capacity estimates to determine the maximum proportion of juveniles rearing in a habitat γ off were based on density estimates of 3 juveniles per unit of suitable habitat ρ off us m2 bartholow 2004 hendrix et al 2017 5 γ o f f 4046 86 a o f f q s a c ρ o f f u s p j 0 the model assumes that juveniles rear in one of two alternative habitats or that fish do not rear in either habitat i e a single individual does not move between tributaries and off channel areas the number of juveniles pj k that leave the upper

defined in table 2 2 2 3 juvenile migration to the lower sacramento river after rearing in the upper sacramento river area all surviving juveniles move downstream where rearing continues until smoltification peak migration through knights landing to the lower sacramento river occurs during high flow events i e at least 400 m3s 1 at wilkins slough rkm 190 del rosario et al 2013 with success rate strongly increasing with event flow rates michel et al 2015 furthermore iglesias et al 2017 showed a significant correlation between out migration mortality and poor fish condition i e a proxy of overall health of individual fish this is characterized using fulton s k factor which describes the ratio of fish weight g to fish length mm therefore migration survival βm k is modeled using a generalized linear model eq 6 fitted with a gaussian distribution and a logarithmic link to 2007 2012 tagged fish survival estimates iglesias et al 2017 with peak flows qout and juvenile condition

remaining age 0 population into available rearing habitats and estimates the number ready to out migrate to the ocean juveniles spend on average nearly three months rearing in the lower sacramento before their departure at chipps island del rosario et al 2013 residence time at this river segment dls was estimated from the 50 passage date at chipps island iep 2020 as in the previous module juveniles may rear in a maximum of one alternative rearing area off channel habitat in the lower sacramento is greatly restricted by intense channelization downstream of colusa ca flow habitat relationships were computed following the same procedure described for the upper sacramento river tributaries used by juveniles for rearing and development include the feather and american rivers phillis et al 2018 suitable habitat availability was determined based on stage discharge and wua relationships using the same procedure as the previous module estimates where compared with usage percentages for the 2004 2006 brood years from phillis et al 2018 the primary floodplains considered in the model are sutter and yolo bypasses which become active when high flows overtop tisdale and fremont weirs respectively nevertheless fish move into the floodplains exclusively when overtopping occurs concurrently or shortly after 1 2 weeks fish migration across knights landing the proportion of the population entering the bypasses αflood was modeled following the formulation of acierto et al 2014 which assumes juveniles are evenly distributed in the water column and enter the bypasses proportionally to flow 9 α flood ρ sutt er 1 ρ sutt er ρ yolo ρ sutt er q tis q tis q wlk ρ yolo q fre q fre q von where qst is the flow at cdec station st the proportion entering sutter bypass is subtracted before considering yolo bypass due to its upstream location residence time in floodplain habitat was defined as a function of the overtopping event length number of days and an average bypass draining period of three weeks takata et al 2017 the number of juveniles pj ki that reared in habitat k in the upper sacramento and now leave the lower sacramento river after rearing in habitat

the lower sacramento αi is the proportion that reared in habitat i βi is the daily rearing survival rate at habitat i and ti is the average weekly temperature at habitat i additional parameters are defined in table 1 before reaching chipps island smolts out migrate either along yolo bypass or through the delta complex channel system experiencing an additional source of mortality these values are considered constant across years to avoid additional sources of uncertainty introduced by smolt route selection a function of water management in the delta perry et al 2010 furthermore michel et al 2015 found that the best model to represent out migration survival for the complete sacramento river system held delta and san francisco bay survival constant through time therefore the number of

is also supported by data from vogel and marine 1991 showing millimeter deviation from this value 2 3 2 upper and lower sacramento river growth of juveniles in mainstem and tributary habitats was modeled as a constant percent increase in weight per day due to the lack of field studies documenting prey composition and prey density data growth rates were obtained using an average of reported values by scarce existing field studies sommer et al 2001 jeffres 2016 these studies were based on fall run chinook juveniles from end of january to mid march when coexisting winter run juveniles are greater in length since daily length increase rates are a function of juvenile length with decreasing marginal increments the expected rates for winter run should be less than those reported in the literature nevertheless the weight increase rate is expected to be similar under the same conditions and could be extrapolated to winter run juveniles jeffres 2019 the main drawback of using constant growth rates is the lack of representation of changing conditions in the sacramento river system between years however since growth in floodplains has been more extensively reported katz et al 2013 katz et al 2014 a bioenergetics model was implemented using the fish bioenergetics model 4 0 deslauriers et al 2017 for this and off channel rearing habitats as the latter is considered similar in

2020 the model used satiation percentages within 0 4 1 0 as daily values were not reported to estimate growth rate ranges along the experiment duration daily temperature was available from field measurements and the energy density of the prey was defined based on diet composition from stomach content data on average the diet included cladocerans 95 chiromidae 2 and copepods 3 with energy densities of 3960 j g 3248 j g and 4500 j g respectively luecke and brandt 1993 tiffan et al 2014 haskell et al 2017 the computed daily growth bands were then compared with the experienced growth of juveniles leaving the testing site at successive days due to sparse temperature data availability at yolo and sutter bypasses after historical overtopping events we also analyzed the differences in end of period simulated daily growth rates using daily versus averaged temperatures during the field experiment to assess if the latter provide a reasonable approximation the weight of a surviving

sensitivity of model outputs to every input parameter these indices are used for a mathematical and more precise estimation of the influence of individual variables or groups of variables on model output here we focused on the first and total order indices s1 st which indicates the proportion of total variance explained by the specific parameter by itself and the proportion not explained by all terms individual parameters and their n order interactions with other input parameters excluding those from the parameter analyzed respectively this method is superior when relationships between model outputs and input parameters are nonlinear or nonmonotonic iooss and lemaître 2015 for the analysis a sample size n of 35 000 was selected following saltelli et al 2010 within predefined ranges for all 21 model parameters based on observed ranges in field studies expert knowledge and feasible values e g 0 1 for habitat use parameters defined from observed data such us ratio of females rfem or fecundity f were not considered because they are regarded as observed inputs analogous to temperature or flow likewise the parameters of the bioenergetics model were not included in the analysis but the bioenergetics output growth at the floodplains rg flood and off channel areas rg off was considered in order to analyze their relative importance on juvenile development when compared to remaining rearing habitats the number and biomass of out migrants were computed for each of 1 540 000 2n p 1 model evaluations to calculate the first and total order sensitivity index and their 95 confidence interval using the salib library in python herman and usher 2017 this sample size n was needed to assure convergence in the sensitivity indices computation input parameters were ranked based on total order index value and considered non sensitive if their confidence intervals included zero this information helps identify habitat conditions availability and or quality which increase variance in successful juvenile development and can suggest habitat targets for potential management and recovery actions to improve juvenile production in the sacramento valley 3 results 3 1 field data comparison computed outputs were compared to recorded winter run indices of abundance throughout the life cycle red bluff juvenile counts brood years 1995 1999 and 2002 2017 martin et al 2001 poytress et al 2014 voss and poytress 2019 allowed comparison of in river juvenile production that reared in the upper sacramento river wrhap estimates closely follow the observed patterns r2 0 94 fig 4 d generally lying within their 90 confidence interval fig 4a as expected from using martin et al 2017 fitted biophysical model during previous model iterations outputs from brood years 1997 1998 differed in more than three times the standard deviation of the data distribution the discrepancy was from differences in spawner values provided by grandtab and cdfg carcass surveys killam 2006 with values of 836 and 2053 for 1998 respectively the latter values were adopted as more realistic estimates of fry production compared with red bluff records drought years with warm releases from shasta e g 2014 2016 were especially well represented as shown by the narrower uncertainty in the observed passage suggesting that egg to fry temperature mortality was adequately captured knights landing

verify the estimated number of migrants to the lower sacramento river a poorer fit was obtained r2 0 58 fig 4e expected from the more complex interactions occurring along the upper sacramento river with model estimates generally overestimating catch based abundances nevertheless annual migration patterns were reasonably reproduced e g by2012 2013 with output values largely within 95 confidence intervals of catch based estimates fig 4b finally model output was compared with abundance estimates at chipps island pyper et al 2013b iep 2020 for the 1995 2010 period three alternative midwater trawl efficiency values pittsburg jersey point and paired release were considered to estimate uncertainty bounds because a single best estimate has not been selected pyper et al 2013a these values were also considered constant through time as recommended by pyper et al 2013a the pittsburgh efficiency value was used to analyze model fitness since the remaining efficiencies led to unrealistic catch based estimates greater than abundancy numbers at knights landing e g by1999 2000 simulated abundances are a reasonable approximation of the historical pattern despite a low coefficient of determination r2 0 44 fig 4f as simulated values generally lie within the uncertainty bounds fig 4c deeming acceptable the simplification of delta out migration survival as a constant through time these comparisons showed inconsistencies between catch based estimates at knights landing rotary trap and chipps island mid water trawl requiring unrealistic survival values 1 to explain the change in population numbers between these two locations wrhap estimates lie within the uncertainty bounds at one of the locations when such discrepancies exist e g bys1999 2008 fig 4bc suggesting a better representation than the coefficient of determination values indicate to evaluate juvenile growth and migration timing we compared migrants fork lengths with reported ranges at knights landing snider and titus 1998 2000a b c vincik et al 2006 roberts 2007 mckibbin 2016 and chipps island iep 2020 since wrhap computes individual weight an empirical relationship l mm 48w0 3 g hinkelman et al 2017 was used to transform the estimates for their comparison simulated fork lengths of migrating juveniles to the lower sacramento river matched reasonably well for the reported brood years by 1995 1999 2001 and 2011 2012 with a simulated range of 64 109 mm against the recorded 45 119 mm in most years the smallest simulated juveniles 65 mm were larger than the range of shortest captured winter run i e 45 56 mm since these values correspond to later fry emergence times than those considered in the model structure average fork lengths were well captured with simulated fork lengths of 89 and 68 mm for by 2011 2012 against observed 88 and 60 mm for instance model output reasonably approximates recorded fork lengths at chipps island especially maximum fork lengths during brood years with floodplain habitat available e g by 1998 1999 2005 2007 2009 fig 5 similar to knights landing data smallest fork lengths were usually longer than reported sizes due to captured individuals with later emergence times than those considered in the model structure the greatest differences between modelled and observed length distributions were during low flow years with short residence periods at lower sacramento river e g by 2000 2004 3 2 fish bioenergetics model observed growth rates throughout all experiments show diminishing growth rates for longer residence times expected from decreasing percentage increases in weight for increasingly larger juveniles this temporal pattern was captured by the bioenergetics model bands fig 6 indicating a correct representation of the temperature effects on juvenile development modeling results accurately reproduced observed juvenile development with observed growth rates within a single satiation percentage range especially from 5 6 days before the experiment completion when greater numbers of juveniles 80 left the rearing area juveniles out migrating during the experiment s first half 10 of total showed poorer growth rates as expected since experiencing suboptimal rearing conditions could trigger early movement observed growth rates were the lowest during the 2017 experiment when extensive overtopping at fremont weir occurred and optimal conditions at floodplain habitats were not present i e shallow and warm waters for zooplankton production corline et al 2017 jeffres et al 2020 as such a satiation percentage under 50 was required to simulate the observed growth rates fig 6 which agree with existing conditions i e lower prey density in contrast knaggs ranch was disconnected from the sacramento river during the 2014 2016 experiments when controlled inundation was implemented providing optimal or near optimal zooplankton production and rearing conditions hence simulated satiation percentages were consistently over 60 70 with almost full satiation during 2016 90 differences in p values also could be related to annual changes in daphnia energy density as it conforms the greatest dietary component 90 and their specific caloric value was not recorded during the field study therefore bioenergetics model outputs presented a correct coherence with prey densities rearing conditions and recorded growth rates end of experiment growth rates estimated using a constant averaged temperature differed in less than 3 5 on average from the fluctuating temperature results fig 6 as such average temperatures in yolo and sutter bypasses after flooding events were used to simulate growth to adjust for sparse temperature data availability in those areas since they provide a reasonable approximation 3 3 sensitivity analysis sobol sensitivity indices showed rearing survival at the mainstem β main as the most sensitive parameter for total number of smolts reaching san francisco bay explaining a 50 5 of total variance first order index s1 and 58 when its parameter interactions are considered total order index st table 4 as such the influence on model output variance is at least three times greater than any other model parameter and mainly caused by the first order effect nossent et al 2011 this was an expected outcome as the complete cohort rears within the mainstem for prolonged periods 77 of total rearing time on average table 5 when off mainstem habitats are both available and unavailable for instance juveniles that reared in off channel habitats for two weeks spent their remaining rearing stage within the mainstem river fig 2 such rearing behavior coupled with the positive relationship between fish condition fulton s k and migration success βm eq 7 explains i the influence of upper sacramento river growth related parameters and ii mainstem growth rg main total effect being three fold greater than growth rates at alternative habitats rg trib and rg off despite their improved rearing conditions maslin 1996 limm and marchetti 2009 nevertheless the latter and off channel habitat use γflood being the fourth sixth ranked parameters suggest that juveniles taking advantage of these areas have greater chances of successfully out migrating lifting their relative importance in the upper sacramento river total out migrants show high sensitivity to egg to fry survival without temperature effects βfry n as its interaction with fecundity f and proportion of females rfem determines the initial number of juveniles out migration survival through the delta and yolo bypass do not significantly influence the variability of smolt abundance 3 1 of total variance indicating that mainstem conditions and available rearing habitats arose as the most limiting factor on chinook salmon production bartholow 2001 beer et al 2017 nevertheless rearing survival in the alternative habitats show low sensitivity sti 0 015 reflecting similar rearing mortalities independent of the choice of rearing path as indicated in the literature katz et al 2017 model outputs were not sensitive to parameters with negative indices values within confidence intervals nossent et al 2011 as expected smolt biomass was most influenced by growth related parameters growth rates and residence times and proportion of juveniles rearing at supplemental habitats the analysis shows floodplains as the most influential rearing habitat in the valley with its growth rate rg flood residence time d f l o o d l s and proportion of juveniles αflood as the first second and fourth most sensitive parameters for out migrating smolt biomass respectively the difference between their first and total order indices indicate their influence is mainly from interactions among these parameters for instance the interaction between rg flood and dflood explains a 17 of the total variance greater than either of them individually 12 and 9 5 respectively the total effect of floodplain growth rates is around three and six times greater than those associated with mainstem and remaining supplemental habitats respectively this agrees with field studies on the importance of floodplain habitat on smolt body condition and hence on initial ocean survival i e smolt to age 2 survival claiborne et al 2011 by providing enhanced rearing conditions sommer et al 2001 katz et al 2017 jeffres et al 2020 as could be expected the second ranked habitat is the sacramento mainstem rg main since juveniles spend prolonged periods rearing in this habitat even juveniles using off mainstem habitats along the upper and lower sacramento river table 5 however some of its influence on individual biomass total biomass over out migrant numbers is not related to growth conditions but rather its effect on migration survival βm eq 7 and smolt numbers second highest rank for total out migrants in table 4 the third ranked habitat is off channel areas explaining 13 of total variance its growth rate total order effect is just half that of mainstem habitat despite averaging 31 of mainstem residence times this shows that this supplemental habitat provides superior rearing conditions and so becomes an important driver on individual success during the marine stage agreeing with published literature maslin 1996 limm and marchetti 2009 finally the lowest ranked habitat by influence on average individual biomass is tributaries explaining 6 1 of total variance this was somewhat expected since tributary residence time is shorter than that of mainstem habitats and growth rates were inferior when compared with off channel habitats table 4 as such its total effect is nearly two four and ten fold less than off channel mainstem and floodplain areas respectively 4 discussion wrhap outputs result from mechanistic understanding of fish survival and growth and agree reasonably well with observed records of winter run abundances fig 4 nevertheless the model greatly simplifies fish ecology and population dynamics the coarse temporal and spatial discretization neglect some important fish habitat criteria such as peak and minimum water temperatures nrc 2004 furthermore not all instream habitat parameters except flow and temperature were directly represented due to data unavailability instead they were aggregated in the rearing survival estimate although other water quality parameters e g turbidity and predation dynamics greatly influence survival and rearing success national research council nrc 2004 the greatest uncertainty is related to several parameters e g tributary growth rates and estimates of rearing habitat usage survival and residence time due to the lack of available empirical and behavioral studies despite the importance of these estimates in understanding juvenile life stage limitations as illustrated by associated high total sensitivity indices sti table 4 a significant data gap exists because there is a lack of explicit monitoring for the winter run johnson et al 2017 as such only two studies provided mainstem growth rates and both were limited to three years of data 1998 1999 and 2016 sommer et al 2001 jeffres 2016 further only one study provided a comparison of tributary growth rates to mainstem conditions limm and marchetti 2009 and only three brood years 2004 2006 of otolith growth data were available for estimating tributary rearing phillis et al 2017 otolith growth data also are based on returning adults which potentially misrepresent actual habitat use by either underestimating actual numbers from the loss of individuals occurring between juvenile out migration and adult return or by overstating tributary use due to improved survival relative to the mainstem phillis et al 2017 these studies also cover only a small proportion of the extensive range of potential conditions experienced by juveniles during rearing and out migration a more intensive monitoring program is needed to better understand habitat availability and juvenile development tradeoffs and more accurately simulate the different life stages of winter run chinook salmon despite challenges from a lack of observational data model development was motivated by the neglect or misrepresentation of supplemental rearing habitats in existing modeling efforts partly due to their previous conception of a single habitat below a dam e g jager et al 1997 bartholow 2004 only hendrix et al 2017 included more disaggregation of rearing habitats for winter run chinook life stages but omitted tributaries and off channel areas shown to be important for chinook salmon juvenile growth and survival maslin et al 1996 limm and marchetti 2009 other modeling efforts for winter run chinook in the sacramento river only considered esa designated critical habitat e g zeug et al 2012 beer et al 2017 for such models fish survival depended exclusively on temperature during early life stages varying with distance and time of travel function of flows and smolt swimming speed e g x t model anderson et al 2005 although smolt swimming speed also is subject to its body condition no simulation of growth during the rearing stage of in river produced winter run chinook was included in any model structure the expanded conceptual structure of wrhap allows analysis of the effects of rearing history and alternative habitat constraints availability on juvenile growth and out migration success for instance model output from brood years with existing floodplain habitat show a consistent high proportion of biomass generated in this rearing area fig 7 as summarized in table 5 floodplains contribute the second most to total simulated out migration biomass approximately 29 30 less than mainstem fig 7 despite only 15 20 of total out migrants being able to access yolo and sutter bypasses and a rearing duration averaging only 7 8 of the total rearing period for instance several brood years present greater out migrating biomass despite having fewer individuals reaching san francisco bay e g 2002 and 2003 2006 and 2009 fig 7 thus wrhap successfully represents floodplains as providing enhanced rearing conditions compared to adjacent river channels sommer et al 2001 katz et al 2017 jeffres et al 2020 when adequate flows occur the importance of this habitat is also stated by the sensitivity analysis recognizing floodplain related parameters growth rate residence time and proportion of juveniles as the most sensitive for out migrating biomass table 4 similarly average winter run chinook fork lengths for during rearing under mainstem sacramento river conditions were 94 mm compared to 130 mm for juveniles that reared within floodplain habitat during periods with frequent high flows overtopping fremont weir floodplain habitat quality was more similar to mainstem habitat due to a decline in optimal environmental conditions shallow and warmer water for zooplankton production corline et al 2017 jeffres et al 2020 thus poorer growth rates were expected as shown by katz unpublished data fig 6 the model captured this tradeoff with daily growth rates of 1 5 2 5 day e g by 2005 2016 compared to 5 7 day under optimal floodplain conditions e g by 2009 2010 the timing of downstream migration and weir overtopping events were crucial for juvenile development since floodplain habitat was only available when both occurred concurrently for instance during brood year 2001 mainstem migration was triggered by high flows exceeding 400 m3 s at wilkins slough between late november through mid december del rosario et al 2013 but fremont weir overtopping commenced in mid january as such the bulk of the winter run population migrated downstream of fremont weir prior to floodplain activation precluding juveniles from taking advantage of enhanced rearing conditions tributaries and off channel habitats account for 19 9 and 9 9 respectively of total generated biomass fig 7 at first glance off channel habitats may appear as the least productive rearing habitat due to its low contribution despite approximately a third of total out migrants used these intermittent habitats table 5 however off channel habitats are active for shorter durations one to three weeks as shown by remote sensing imagery compared with tributaries e g 28 days phillis et al 2018 and mainstem habitats as such off channel rearing when compared to tributaries showed a residence time over three fold less and a juvenile occupancy of 75 but showed just a 50 decline in generated biomass table 5 furthermore average simulated fork lengths were 106 and 116 mm for tributary and off channel rearing respectively suggesting enhanced rearing conditions in off channel habitats e g maslin 1996 this tradeoff is also shown by their sobol total order indices ranking off channel growth and residence time over tributaries table 4 more frequent activation of these habitats e g improving mainstem and side channel connectivity or small pulse flows from reservoir releases would enhance juvenile salmon residence time and likely improve out migration biomass and success as indicated by its total order sensitivity index table 4 nevertheless this is not indicative of tributary rearing having a marginal value similarly to the remaining off mainstem habitats tributary habitats also provided superior rearing conditions when compared to mainstem habitat generating half of the biomass 19 9 vs 41 3 with just 11 of rearing time on average this suggests that the relative importance of tributary habitat is greater than the inferred from the sensitivity analysis table 4 survival success during migration to the lower sacramento river depends in part on the existence and use of supplemental rearing habitats coupled with the timing of high flows individual survival success improves with juvenile condition i e weight to length ratio function of the rearing path in the upper sacramento river juveniles that reared in off channel habitats or tributaries when available regularly exhibited larger sizes and lower migration mortality this effect is more important for early migration dates when the contribution of mainstem rearing habitats to fish condition is greatly reduced compared to alternative habitats e g tributaries and off channel areas for instance simulated juveniles that reared in off channel areas during brood year 2006 early migration date exhibited superior condition 7 when compared with juveniles that used mainstem habitats in turn this enhanced migration survival by three fold however juveniles from brood year 2013 late migration date exhibited a 3 9 improvement in condition leading to a 98 increase in migration survival as such the marginal value of improved growth conditions decreases with an extended residence period since juveniles can reach suitable sizes to assure improved migration survival under exclusive mainstem rearing conditions regardless juveniles that reared only in the sacramento river mainstem exhibited the poorest condition and lowest annual survival these simulation outputs align with the discussion of sobol indices section 3 3 table 4 giving mainstem habitats a high influence on out migrant numbers due to prolonged rearing periods and not for superior rearing conditions as such off channel and tributary habitats hold a much greater relative importance than the suggested by the total order indices the annual variation in migration survival also reflects the existing tradeoff between migration date and juvenile abundances and condition later migration dates exhibited increased rearing mortalities due to extended exposure periods anderson et al 2005 but those individuals that succeeded were in better condition increasing their chances of survival during migration similarly the growth survival tradeoff also is expected to be crucial for out migrants at chipps island with longer residence times at the lower sacramento river producing fewer smolts in better condition and increasing and individual s probability of returning as an adult modeling as presented here suggests that off mainstem habitats are crucial to out migration and ocean stage survival and critical to long term recovery efforts for winter run chinook salmon populations this pattern was consistent throughout historical simulations with the greatest egg to smolt mortalities associated with low flow conditions and sparse or limited availability of supplemental habitats e g brood years 2001 2006 and 2014 fig 4 if these conditions were persistent across several years warm water releases from shasta reservoir associated with cold pool depletion significantly increase egg to fry mortality johnson and lindley 2016 low flow conditions also constrain the availability of two main alternative habitats e g off channel and floodplains limiting enhanced juvenile growth and out migration success as shown by the sensitivity analysis table 4 this also suggests that current infrastructure projects to improve floodplain management i e notching fremont weir dwr 2017 are promising because they offer the ability to provide floodplain access i during low flow years and ii when migration and overtopping events do not overlap lastly dry conditions are generally associated with small pulse flow cues for juvenile migration increasing their experienced mortality since the primary driver of smolt migration survival is the magnitude of the high flow event iglesias et al 2017 wrhap was not calibrated directly against observed fish population data e g bartholow 2004 although several parameters were defined from calibrated model outputs e g temperature related egg to fry survival martin et al 2017 table 1 parameter estimates were also defined from existing reported values in the literature empirical and laboratory studies and expert knowledge see table 2 model calibration faces two major challenges first the main model input number of returning adults to spawning areas killam 2006 azat 2019 is an estimate second the main migration data catches at chipps island knights landing and red bluff rotatory traps have high uncertainty from their efficiency factor estimates roberts 2007 pyper et al 2013a poytress et al 2014 therefore parameter value estimation by calibration to out migrant estimates probably cannot capture all effects of different physical and biological conditions on juveniles regardless the model s behavior was extensively reviewed to avoid errors and unrealistic hypotheses whrap represents an initial step to develop a method to understand the relative value and contribution of existing habitats to sustain winter run chinook salmon as such the model reflects the findings of previous studies on the ecological importance of each individual alternative rearing habitat in the sacramento valley sommer et al 2001 limm and marchetti 2009 and combines them to more completely represent winter run spawning rearing and out migration despite our analysis being driven by historical conditions it illustrates the potential of wrhap to assist in important decision making processes for an endemic and federally endangered fish from a water resource management standpoint linkages between water system operations and sacramento valley environmental conditions i e flow and temperature regimes that define habitat availability and quality can be used to define environmental flow requirements that target specific salmonid life stages or to estimate impacts of re operation policies on federally listed populations likewise wrhap can assist habitat restoration efforts by estimating effects of proposed recovery actions or programs of actions for winter run chinook and thus help develop optimized portfolios of habitat restoration actions future research will explore the effect of climate change on winter run juvenile dynamics under proposed and defined restoration portfolios by forcing wrhap with available temperature and flow projections in the sacramento valley brekke et al 2014 5 conclusions this study developed and tested a simplified freshwater rearing phase simulation model for winter run chinook salmon in california s sacramento valley based on previously published studies empirical field data laboratory studies and expert knowledge wrhap developed links connecting rearing habitat availability and quality with existing hydrologic conditions i e flow and temperature regimes and explained the impact of each individual habitat on juvenile development and out migration success a strength of the model is its capacity to identify important knowledge gaps in observed data with a flexible structure to allow integration of new data and functional relationships as they become available sensitivity analysis showed that estimates of mainstem rearing survival and growth rates together with observations on use and residence times within high flow habitats i e floodplains and off channel areas greatly influence juvenile productivity and body condition as such further studies are required to better understand the variability and temporal dynamics of these parameters allowing to build confidence on their related assumptions despite its simplicity wrhap provides realistic estimates of winter run production in the sacramento river valley represents several tradeoffs reasonably between in stream conditions and juvenile development and highlights the importance of off mainstem habitats for the long term persistence of winter run chinook salmon this aligns with the conclusions of lester et al 2011 in that more complex approaches to representing environmental outcomes do not necessarily improve predictions finally the modeling discussed here can aid resource managers by directly linking water management and habitat restoration actions in an effort to more clearly identify tradeoffs and effects on an endangered species

24641,although the environmental status of the moroccan atlantic coastal waters has been researched in previous studies there is still a lack of knowledge about its biogeochemical functioning especially for the agadir coast where measurements are quite scarce realistic ecological models can help identifying the key mechanisms driving fluctuations in such coastal areas here we implemented a

the canary current system north west africa has been restrictively discussed in previous studies e g hernández león et al 2007 2019 lovecchio et al 2017 2018 arístegui et al 2020 santana falcón et al 2020 there is still a lack of knowledge about its biogeochemical functioning of the agadir coast to our knowledge no high resolution numerical model has yet been implemented to describe the biogeochemical properties of this area to fulfil these knowledge gaps the biogeochemical dynamics of lower trophic levels of the agadir coast through the development and the assessment of a three dimensional 3d mohid water modelling system has been investigated the flexibility of the mohid water allows the simulation of a large variety of ecological physical and chemical processes occurring in the water column sediment and air interfaces being so considered a powerful tool to investigate the dynamic aquatic ecosystems deus et al 2013 duarte et al 2014 piroddi et al 2015 mateus et al 2018 chang 2020 the main purpose of this study is to provide a decision support tool for coastal management of north west africa moroccan atlantic coast to accomplish this objective numerical simulations of a high resolution local configuration of 3d mohid water are performed over the agadir coastal waters special emphasis is given to describe the spatio temporal distribution of inorganic dissolved nutrients and their contribution to phytoplankton diatoms and flagellates dynamics time series surface and depth maps of the simulated physicochemical fields including water temperature salinity and dissolved oxygen inorganic nutrients nitrate phosphate and dissolved silica and planktonic assemblages chlorophyll a diatoms flagellates and zooplankton are carried out for the period 2017 2018 selected according to the data availability model validation is investigated by comparing simulated surface variables with monthly climatological and remote sensing data a quantitative validation

performance finally the dynamic of phytoplankton and their response to nutrients and environmental factors variations are discussed and pertinent conclusions are summarized 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area located on the south western atlantic coast of morocco the agadir coast is the central part of a 35 km long shoreline bound between cape ghir in the north and cape aglou in the southwest fig 1 the coast exhibit wide morphological and geological variation it is characterized by an alternation of rocky coast in the north and sandy coast in the south aouiche et al 2016a the orientation of the coast towards the west generates an important upwelling event because of its shallow depth and the constant regularity of the northeast ne winds in this area moujane et al 2011 agadir bay and the adjacent smaller anza beach north of the commercial port are the most important morphological characteristics of the region influenced by the atlas mountains the atlantic ocean and sahara the area is characterized by an arid to semi arid climate aouiche et al 2013 average annual temperatures range from 14 c in winter and 26 7 c in summer although temperatures may rise to over 40 c under the influence of sahara winds lamine et al 2019 the rainy season mainly occurs in the fall and in the first weeks of winter with average annual rainfall of about 300 mm year according to data obtained from the regional office of the development of agricultural souss massa relatively energetic waves from the north largely dominate the area in both winter and summer presenting approximately 67 of the incident waves and only 5 75 from the south furthermore the dominant winds in the area are from the west northwest wnw to the west w favourable for the generation of aeolian dunes in the semi arid climate of souss massa the area is mainly governed by mesotidal and semidiurnal tides with a mean neap tidal range of 1 3 m and a mean spring tidal range of 2 9 m tidal currents was relatively weak order of 0 1 m s and maintained a circular pattern within the coast aouiche et al 2016 2 2 model description numerical simulations are performed using mohid water modelling system www mohid com the model consists of a set of coupled modules that aim to simulate the main physical and biogeochemical processes in aquatic ecosystems miller and pinder 2004 it is based on the finite volume concept where the equations are applied macroscopically at each cell in the grid using divergent flux that assures the conservation in the transport of properties the hydrodynamic model solves the momentum and primitive continuity equations for the surface elevation supposing hydrostatic and boussinesq approximation valentim et al 2013 furthermore the model is implemented assuming a semi implicit time step integration for its temporal discretization using a cartesian and sigma coordinates for its vertical discretization and an arakawa c grid for its horizontal discretization martins et al 2001 the transport event for a given biogeochemical property p are calculated using a 3d advection diffusion differential equation cancino and neves 1995 d p d t p t u j p x j x j k θ p x j sources sink where p is the property concentration j is the index for the cartesian coordinate x y z k θ is the turbulent mass diffusion coefficient the sink and source terms for biogeochemical properties are computed in each cell of the grid and in each time instant using a biogeochemical model saraiva et al 2017 the state variables and processes are computed for a control volume regardless of any transport scheme the control volume approach consists of splitting the water body into finite segments or control volumes chapra 1997 solving for each one of them a series of linear equations representing the interdependence of various properties and calculating the mass balances considering the sources and sinks within each volumes the biogeochemical processes are mainly adapted based on formulations originally developed by the us environmental protection agency epa bowie et al 1985 the conceptual structure and the accounted processes are reported in fig 2 model equations and a list of model state variables as well as a list of parameters values are given in an appendix tables 3 5 thus inorganic and detrital organic forms of nitrogen n phosphorus p and silica si have been explicitly simulated being are driven by very different remineralisation rates the ammonia nh₄ equation considers respiration mineralisation processes phytoplankton uptake as well as the fraction of phytoplankton and zooplankton mortality that is directly supplied into the system in oxygenated water column nh₄ is oxidized to no₃ by nitrification and conversely no₃ is lost by denitrification to nitrogen gas n2 the kinetics of denitrification reaction is simulated as a function of no₃ dissolved oxygen do and temperature availability in the system arhonditsis and brett 2005 the model considers the organic and inorganic phosphorus forms the inorganic phosphorus po₄ considers mineralisation processes phytoplankton uptake as well as the fraction of phytoplankton and zooplankton mortality that is released into the water column in inorganic form fraction of the organic phosphorus settles to the sediment and another part is mineralized into po₄ the do mass balance equation considers the production of oxygen by primary producers the consumption of oxygen and the exchange of oxygen between water column and atmosphere the model considers two major groups of producers in the ecosystem diatoms dia and autotrophic flagellates fla and various organic matter components primary producers uptake inorganic nutrients nh₄ no₃ po₄ and dissolved silica dsi and follow an exponential growth model their variation is dependent on several factors mainly oxygen light incidence and nutrients availability gotelli 1995 the process is governed by equation d φ phy dt μ phy r phy e x phy m phy φ phy g phy

zooplankton mirozooplankton ciliate and mesozooplankton types are simulated with redfield ratio 106c 16n 1p such that their growth relies on the grazing rate and maximum growth rate grazing in turn depends on food density and size as well as the food encounter rate the microzooplankton graze on flagellates and detrital particulate matter whereas the mesozooplankton graze on diatoms flagellates and microzooplankton at rates determined by zooplankton swimming speed food size and density and particle encounter rate baird and emsley 1999 grazing and mortality result in the accumulation of detritus and dissolved inorganic and organic nutrients through remineralisation dissolved organic material refractory dissolved organic nitrogen donr refractory dissolved organic phosphorus dopr dissolved non refractory organic nitrogen donnr and non refractory dissolved organic phosphorus dopnr dissolved silica are simulated with redfield ratio 106c 16n 1p particulate organic material particulate organic nitrogen pon particulate organic phosphorus pop are remineralised to nh₄ and po₄ respectively and biogenic silica bsi to dsi they are generally produced by inefficient feeding plankton mortality and zooplankton excretion during these transformations don is released in the water column and rendered available to the phytoplankton either as nh₄ the dop is mineralized to po₄ and rendered become available to the phytoplankton 2 3 model implementation the model was implemented using the downscaling approach of nested domains described by mateus et al 2012 two domains of nested grids with different resolutions were used fig 1 the local high resolution domain agadir coast model system acms domain 2 receives its open boundary conditions from the lower resolution regional domain the moroccan atlantic coast operational model system macoms domain 1 which open boundary condition seawater temperature and salinity combines low frequency copernicus marine environment monitoring service cmems outputs with tidal levels simulated using the same horizontal resolution acms domain in operational modelling system the one way downscaling approach using an intermediate regional model application between cmems and a local domain has the advantage of running a number of local applications in parallel this allows simulations to be available in a short time period as macoms can run independently of its receiving local application macoms domain is an implementation of 2d barotropic model with 0 04 horizontal resolution regional domain resulting in a grid of 238 359 cells and maximum depths around 5300 m table 1 acms domain resulting of an implementation of 3d baroclinic model with 0 02 horizontal resolution a grid of 56 56 cells and a maximum depths

cloudiness and radiation data provided from wrf weather research and forecasting model implemented by action modulers http www actionmodulers pt were used to force the model the tidal forcing was obtained from the harmonic components extracted from the fes2012 with 3km resolution version of the fes finite element solution global tidal model carrère et al 2012 the monthly climatological 3d boundary for inorganic nutrients was derived from world ocean atlas 2013 woa13 https odv awi de data ocean the woa13 data provides vertical fields of inorganic nutrients no₃ po₄ and sio₄ and dissolved oxygen on a 1 00 grid defined at 37 standard depth levels with distances between values increasing with depth starting with 5 m intervals at the surface and 25 m intervals from 100 m depth onwards 2 4

assessment including correlation coefficient r difference of mean values bias root mean squared error rmse standard deviation sd and graphically the taylor s diagram taylor 2001 3 results 3 1 spatial variability of hydrographical condition the spring 20 mar apr may 20 jun summer 21 jun july aug 21 sep and winter 21 dec jan feb 19 mar horizontal distribution of sst predicted by the model and collected by odyssea are presented in fig 3 general sst cross shore gradient is detected this gradient is accentuated in the south western coast in result of the cold water inflow coming from the north the horizontal signature of the sst seasonal pattern is captured by the model with nevertheless some discrepancies near to the boundaries the model skill in reproducing the sst distribution was graphically summarized in a quantitative way using the taylor diagram the diagram investigates overall position of the simulated sst with respect to the odyssea products in terms of r rmse and sd taylor 2001 results are depicted in fig 4 and associated statistical indices are calculated in table 2 as a whole spatial distribution of sst presents relatively good scores in all skill indexes even if they tend to be slightly underestimated in spring and summer bias 0 129 and 0 177 c respectively table 2 the diagram clearly confirms the good agreement between simulated and satellite sst fields with correlation coefficient up to 0 87 of the three seasons the simulated sst in closest agreement with the satellite product in terms of high correlation r 0 86 and low error rmse 0 55 c is provided during the winter period in contrast this agreement decrease slightly during the spring period with r 0 74 rmse 0 68 cand sd 0 61 c and the summer period with r 0 72 rmse 0 69 c and sd 0 67 c likewise sss increased as the offshore distance increased fig 5 a b c however the near shore region affected by diluted waters and the offshore region affected by high salinity associated with warmer surface waters declined in winter fig 5c in contrast surface do was patchily distributed with a mass water of higher concentrations coming from the north simulated in spring and summer fig 5d e in winter the do concentrations decreased as the distance from the near shore region increased fig 5f vertical sections up to 1500 m of physicochemical parameters were illustrated selecting the co transect transect with high mean cross shore variables gradient from the agadir coast across the continental shelf to the offshore region fig 1 indeed the water temperature salinity and do concentration of co transect exhibited stratified distributions in both seasons summer and winter the temperature and salinity decreased as the depth increased with strong negative downward gradient of around 17 units difference between surface and bottom layers for water temperature 1 8 units for salinity as the temperature increased the microorganisms became more active nonetheless the leaping layers hindered the water exchange between the surfaces to the bottom layers inducing in a drop of the do levels on the bottom fig 6 3 2 spatial variability of nutrient concentrations and plankton biomass spatial distributions of surface no₃ po₄ and sio₄ concentrations in agadir coastal area were simulated during spring summer and winter 2017 2018 fig 7 the anomalously high no₃ concentrations were limited to the northern area during the spring period and could be associated to the boundary conditions fig 7a in contrast the central part of the coast seems to be favoured by high no₃ concentrations during summer and winter periods fig 7b c the po₄ distribution exhibits a different pattern as no₃ areas with low concentrations were located in a narrow coastal band in spring fig 7d in summer coastal circulation loads of po₄ concentrations to accumulate in the central part of the coast offshore extensions were detected during the winter period fig 7e f the sio₄ concentrations were found to be higher for all seasons in comparison with no₃ and po₄ thus sio₄ is unlikely to be the principal limiting factor for diatom distribution in our area in spring the sio₄ concentrations were higher than those in summer and exhibited decreasing trends as distance from the near shore coast increased fig 7g during summer and winter periods the lowest sio₄ concentrations were limited to the central part of coast the rest of the domain was relatively rich in sio₄ fig 7h i furthermore the vertical profiles of no₃ po₄ and sio₄ of co transect displayed stratified distributions fig 8 the nutrient concentrations gradually increased with increasing depth and high values were simulated in the bottom layers in response to the bottom currents and remineralisation of organic material on the other hand the simulated surface phytoplankton in terms of c biomass varies substantially from the coast to the open ocean showing a strong longitudinal decreasing trend of diatoms in spring and winter fig 9 a c in contrast the central part of the coast seems to be favoured by high biomass of diatoms during the summer period fig 9b simulated surface flagellate has a similar footprint to the diatoms distribution trends although with greater magnitude fig 9d e f nevertheless lower values of simulated zooplankton biomass were limited to the nearshore area in spring and to the central part of the coast in summer fig 9g h whereas the winter season exhibited a high zooplankton biomass near the coast which begins to decrease gradually to the offshore area fig 9i 3 3 temporal variation validation with climatology and satellite data to understand changes in phytoplankton distribution in relation to physical and biogeochemical variables we analyzed annual variation january december 2017 of sst sss do and inorganicnutrients by averaging the monthly climatology data and compared with simulated findings from station s 30 5n 10 5w fig 10 we summarize graphically in a quantitative way the model performance using the taylor diagram for temperature we analyzed the seasonal pattern of the mean sst which indicated that the study area warmed up and attained maximum temperature during summer in winter the surface water has cooled down rapidly and attained minimum temperature in february the model captured not only the seasonal variability in sst climatology but also the range of the observations fig 10a meanwhile the average sss climatology data showed higher values in winter and spring than that in summer and fall the model does not matches sss climatology data indicating a shift in timing of the monthly variability fig 10b and leading to a higher error rmse 1 67 psu fig 11 the surface do average climatology concentrations reached the maximum in the winter thereafter the do variation remained a decreasing trend and dropped to the minimum average in fall the model relatively captured the general annual trend with an underestimation mainly in the late period of investigation fig 10c a decreasing trend in inorganic nutrients no₃ and po₄ systematically occurred from the early spring leading to ample variations in no₃ concentrations explained mostly by the denitrification processes and the phytoplankton uptake see later discussion the model captured seasonal signature of the climatological pattern except a slight time lag of the winter peak and an overall overestimation in january and the early february and underestimation in the rest of the year fig 10d seasonal changes in po₄ concentrations were consistently associated with higher values in winter followed by a sharp decrease in summer overall the model captured reasonably seasonal pattern despite some discrepancies could be related to the used constant input values at the inflow boundaries fig 9e the general sio₄ trends show that the highest values were getting later in the year a continuous increase in sio₄ concentrations with time was simulated in agreement with the climatology data fig 10f on the other hand given the scarcity of field data time series of the sea surface chl a estimated using the conversion factor from simulated total phytoplankton carbon biomass as defined in lancelot et al 2005 are assessed using modis aqua satellite data overall the average concentration in spring and summer was higher than that in fall and winter the model captured reasonably well seasonal variability in chl a concentrations particularly good agreement is observed in spring and summer in winter the model has a tendency to underestimate surface chl a concentrations most notably in the early period of investigation january and february fig 10g the flagellate biomass distribution displays a similar pattern as chl a fig 10h however simulated flagellate growth starts at late february followed by the bloom peak in march and april the simulated biomass decreased in the late spring and the second summer bloom of lower magnitude was manifested after a summer bloom decline biomass attains even lower values in fall and reaches its annual minimum values in the november probably due to combined zooplankton grazing light and nutrient limitation compared to the flagellate the diatoms seasonal signature is less marked where biomass tended to remain low throughout the year their simulated biomass slowly but steadily increased reaching the maximum values in late december fig 10h the visualization of the models performance using the taylor diagram confirmed the agreement model climatology data fig 11 from the taylor skill indexes one can identify po₄ and no₃ tend to be the most skillful among the all model variables with high correlation coefficient r 0 8 low error rmse 0 6 mg l and normalised standard deviations close to 1 sd 0 91 and 1 07 mg l respectively chl a sst and sio₄ present a moderate correlation 0 68 r 0 7 and the correct variability sd 0 7 do is a bit out of phase with the observed one which results in its low correlation and error r 0 17 rmse 1 19 mg l and sd 0 86 mg l the low skill scores for do suggests that it is difficult to validate since many components interact with oxygen and contribute to oxygen production and consumption such as the exchange of oxygen between water column and atmosphere photosynthetic oxygen production respiratory consumption by phytoplankton and consumption of oxygen by degradation of organic matter sadeghian et al 2018 peng et al 2019 furthermore sss appears with a negative correlation r 0 3 and high error rmse 1 67 psu as the model fails to capture the observed evolution of the climatology data theses discrepancies can be due of the fact that the freshwater discharges from souss and massa rivers are not accounted in the model 4 discussion 4 1 spatio temporal dynamics of phytoplankton the dominance of simulated flagellates was somewhat surprising as several studies report that diatoms typically dominate moroccan atlantic coastal food chains somoue et al 2004 elghrib et al 2012 natij et al 2014 except for anabalón et al 2014 that report a low to moderate 20 68 contribution of diatoms to total phytoplankton in the cape ghir fig 1 there are a number of explanations for the lack of diatoms in this area the first can be associated to the strong water column stratification that provides beneficial conditions to favor flagellated group of the phytoplankton assemblages as flagellates are more adapted to stratified and stable waters with low nutrient concentrations e g lemley et al 2018 spilling et al 2018 lim et al 2019 another possible explanation can be attributed to the way phytoplankton responded to the time space changes in upwelling conditions sst sss that affect the nutrient levels in water column in fact many flagellate species are characterized by higher surface volume ratios compared to the diatoms group they are able to access alternative phosphorus sources burson et al 2016 and to use various forms of reduced nitrogen when n p ratios are minimal anabalón et al 2014 mulholland et al 2018 at the spatial scale the general shift in maximum flagellates and diatoms between the shelf and the open ocean during the spring period coincides with the spatial gradient of the surface inorganic nutrients fig 7 9 thereafter the possible injection of nutrients by coastal upwelling events could have improved phytoplankton proliferation in the central part of the coast during the summer period when coastal upwelling is more intense cropper et al 2014 santana falcón et al 2020 in winter the transport of high nutrient water to the offshore areas supported by the atlantic water advection could favors proliferation of phytoplankton in waters further offshore anabalón et al 2014 besides this spatial distribution increases in chl a concentrations in studied station s 30 5n 10 5w generate a major spring peak of 1 3 mg m3 in march and a minor summer peak of 0 1 mg m3 in july outside those two peaks chl a levels oscillate between approximately 0 008 and 1 3 mg m3 this range of values remains lower in comparison to those observed by id halla et al 2017 near the coastline 30 56n 9 76w 0 77 1 95 mg m3 surface distribution of simulated flagellates show similar trends with well pronounced spring bloom that could be attributed to the higher nutrient availability combined with adequate light conditions not shown in the upper stratified water column nutrient concentrations become then relatively low and simulated flagellate levels decrease to 0 058 mg c l in late may afterward flagellate growth conditions apparently improved due to sufficient light irradiance supported by the increase in surface solar heating generating relatively high flagellate levels in july after summer inorganic nutrients no₃ and po₄ are dropped to low levels in the surface water column and solar heating is decreased consequently the simulated flagellate levels reach their annual minima in fall and winter the diatom assemblages show less seasonal variability their amplitude remained low throughout our simulations gradually increasing until the early winter this low pattern could be partly confined to the changes in the nutrient molar ratios and the absence of adequate conditions for diatom growth relatively high nutrient concentrations and low water temperatures xiao et al 2017 zhong et al 2019 discussed in next section 4 2 response of phytoplankton to nutrients and environmental factors variations nutrients availability appeared to be the main factor controlling the phytoplankton distribution in moroccan atlantic coastal waters where the upwelling events are strong e g somoue et al 2004 elghrib et al 2012 anabalón et al 2014 in this context our findings reveal a sign of nutrient depletion supporting the claim that the phytoplankton dynamics in the area may be controlled by the annual variation in nutrients this is particularly relevant for no₃ as the simulated concentrations drops to low levels 0 0001 mg l during the first flagellate bloom early spring this low concentration can be designed as an index of limitation for fast photosynthesis in coastal waters kudryavtseva et al 2019 furthermore the average n p ratio was lower than the classical redfield ratio of 16 1 n p 0 4 suggesting that most of the available nitrogen has been incorporated by flagellate into the local biogeochemical cycle and move the coast towards nitrogen limitation the low n p ratio could be then attributed to the higher nitrogen uptake by the flagellate dominated blooms in the study area the injection of phosphorous into the surface waters caused by the upwelling of deep atlantic waters or to the faster recycling of phosphorous relative to nitrogen in the surface coastal waters furthermore although no₃ is recognized to be rapidly exhausted in upwelling filaments the nutrient rich water upwelled off north west africa barton et al 1998 is advected offshore at the surface layers as showed by the relatively high nutrient concentrations in the offshore waters santana falcón et al 2020 the exhaustion of nitrogen to the analytical limit during phytoplankton blooms has been previously detected in cape ghir during the three cruises june august and october 2009 in these cruises no₃ concentrations were close to the detection limit and inorganic n p ratios were lower than 6 anabalón et al 2014 in addition this notion of the primary production growth being nitrogen limited has been reported by various investigators in many areas of the north atlantic ocean e g sarmiento et al 1993 agusti et al 2001 ferreira et al 2019 by contrast the distribution of flagellates is less sensitive to the low phosphate concentrations 0 003 0 014 mg l due to their ability to secrete alkaline phosphatase in response to limited phosphorus availability e g li et al 2015 cao et al 2018 zhou et al 2017 2019 meanwhile the relative larger size of flagellates when comparing to diatoms makes it more adapted to take advantage of po₄ mainly delivered from the atlantic ocean via coastal upwelling events litchman et al 2007 on the other hand it is interesting to note that the high simulated concentrations of sio₄ between 0 008 and 0 075 mg l in comparison with no₃ and po₄ lead to stoichiometric p impoverishment relative to si si p ratios 16 1 paul et al 2008 and strong deficiency of n relative to si n si ratios 1 1 ramirez et al 2005 in our station these findings illustrate the preferential uptake of no₃ by phytoplankton and suggest that sio₄ is not limiting factor in the surface waters of the study area nutrient ratios and levels cannot account alone for phytoplankton distribution as environmental parameters are fundamental factors in shaping the distribution of diatoms and flagellates in the study areas temperature is assumed to have an indirect effect on the phytoplankton dynamics affecting the processes of sinking grazing and nutrient assimilation as well as the rate of biochemical reactions in water column spilling et al 2018 pan et al 2020 however spatial distribution of simulated and satellite sst fig 3 with a narrow band of cold waters in the nearshore area confirms the influence of the cold upwelling filament off north west africa arístegui et al 2009 santana falcón et al 2020 previous studies e g wooster et al 1976 nykjaer et al 1994 anabalón et al 2014 pointed out the permanent coastal upwelling off cape ghir 31n with maximum intensity in summer this filament propagates more than 100 km offshore associated with a cyclonic eddy mainly influenced by the local bottom topography the concave configuration of the coastline and the presence of the canary islands e g hagen et al 1996 barton et al 1998 pelegrí et al 2005 santana falcón et al 2020 the analysis of the horizontal and vertical co transect residual velocities calculated by averaging the transient velocities at each grid point over the simulation period from january 2017 to december 2018 reinforces these findings fig 12 thus the south west north east orientation of the coast and the differences in the bottom friction affect residual current velocity and induce a coastal cyclonic eddy typical of this region rhomad et al submitted for publication cyclonic eddy tend to increase no₃ and po₄ concentrations in the central parts of the coast during the summer period thereby controlling the phytoplankton growth in the area fig 7 9 temporal distribution of simulated sst shows seasonal variations with fluctuations ranging from 16 82 c in march to 21 30 c in august 2017 in situ sst measurements have reported a wider range of sst variation from 14 9 c in february 2016 to 26 6 c august 2017 lamine et al 2019 compared to the other areas imessouane bay southwest moroccan atlantic coast 19 2 c to 21 9 c amazzal et al 2020 and dakhla bay south moroccan atlantic coast 18 21 8 c berraho et al 2019 furthermore it is interesting to note that in our station phytoplankton blooming produced by rapid growth of flagellates is most common in the early spring and summer when sst is increasing after spring flagellates biomass declined rapidly while that of diatoms continued to increase fig 10 warming temperatures resulting in inorganic nutrients decline levels as a consequence of intense stratification can explain in part the persistence of flagellates at higher levels than diatoms which are still present in our station during summer but with low biomass smayda and reynolds 2003 diatoms ability to grow well at low water temperature baretta bekker et al 2009 witness the fact that they start growing in the early winter reaching a maximum in december this can be also attributed to the optimal water temperature range for the growth of diatoms 15 20 c for s costatum compared to that for flagellates 20 27 c for p donghaiense suzuki and takahashi 1995 xu et al 2010 besides water temperature salinity can strongly influence phytoplankton composition and biomass previous studies e g marshall et al 2006 badsi et al 2012 hernando et al 2015 have endorsed the tight relationship between salinity level and phytoplankton dynamic in our study the range of simulated sss values 36 23 36 56 psu were indicative of the influence of north atlantic central west water anabalón et al 2014 when compared to other atlantic moroccan areas the range for in situ sss is narrower than that simulated by our model minimum value of 31 26 psu february 2017 and a maximum value of 37 9 psu august 2017 was observed in taghazout bay lamine et al 2019 the range between 36 2 and 37 7 psu were observed in dakhla bay berraho et al 2019 and the range between 36 1 and 36 8 psu were observed in imessouane bay amazzal et al 2020 this could explain the dominance of large flagellate that may result from the salinity optimum for flagellates 36 7 37 7 psu for p arcuatum skejić et al 2017 20 37 psu for a minutum grzebyk et al 2003 it is consistent with other studies e g nche fambo et al 2015 showing that flagellates dominate marine brackish salinities but diatoms are able to persist at hypersaline waters in addition changes in ambient do concentrations could also a main factor considered to affect phytoplankton distribution and composition biswas et al 2014 srichandan et al 2015 naik et al 2020 from our simulation it can be observed that the horizontal distribution of phytoplankton is similar to that of do concentrations a strip of high sea surface phytoplankton simulated in the central part of the coast during the summer period coincides well with the do maximum concentrations fig 5e vertically nutrients are depleted in the surface water column and an enrichment of do is simulated higher than 8 5 mg l with a sharp decrease to the bottom less than 2 mg l from these findings agadir waters are relatively well oxygenated compared to taghazout bay 6 9 8 5 mg l lamine et al 2019 but less oxygenated compared to dakhla bay 7 2 10 8 mg l anhichem et al 2017 overall the relatively high do concentrations can be mostly attributed to the important circulation of water aouiche et al 2016a that improves oxygen levels inside the coast and the photosynthetic release of oxygen by the high flagellate blooms 5 conclusion to our knowledge this paper is the first biogeochemical modeling investigation of the of southern moroccan atlantic coast agadir coast using a high resolution three dimensional coupled hydrodynamic biogeochemical model special emphasis was dedicated to deciphering of planktonic assemblages chl a diatoms and flagellates dynamics in response to physicochemical fields water temperature salinity and do inorganic dissolved nutrients no₃ po₄ and sio₄ availability the model performance was investigated by comparison with satellite products odyssea for sst and modis for chl a and climatology data woa2018 despite aforementioned bias in temporal distribution of sss and do which is probably attributed to missing processes and some gaps in the hydrological cycle of the atmosphere model it is undisputed that our model reveals an adequate reproduction of spatial pattern of sst and seasonal signature of sst chl a and po₄ furthermore the underestimation of the simulated no₃ concentrations is likely a result of applied nutrient boundary conditions from nutrient concentrations and stoichiometric ratios it can be asserted that the no₃ levels may be the key element controlling phytoplankton distribution in the agadir coast the possible injection of nutrients through upwelling filaments associated with a cyclonic eddy could be responsible for the nutrients enrichment in the surface layers of water column improving therefore proliferation of phytoplankton in the central part of the coast in summer and toward the open ocean in winter biological variables reveal the largest responses to nutrient levels and environmental parameters with high seasonal variability the flagellates dominated total chl a in the upper layers of water column during spring and summer periods were coincident with warming water temperatures higher salinities intense stratification and lower nutrient no₃ and po₄ concentrations whereas considerable increased in diatoms biomass has been simulated after summer in response to lower water temperature and higher sio₄ concentrations this has major repercussions for the flow of carbon in the area as flagellates dominated phytoplankton assemblages contribute to low carbon export to deeper waters compared to diatoms cushing 1989 in sum the proposed 3d hydrodynamic biogeochemical model can be considered to be an interesting descriptor of the biogeochemical behaviour of moroccan atlantic coastal waters even if it is able to simulate reasonably seasonal cycles of inorganic dissolved nutrients and chl a

24641,although the environmental status of the moroccan atlantic coastal waters has been researched in previous studies there is still a lack of knowledge about its biogeochemical functioning especially for the agadir coast where measurements are quite scarce realistic ecological models can help identifying the key mechanisms driving fluctuations in such coastal areas here we implemented a three dimensional 3d coupled hydrodynamic biogeochemical model in order investigate the time space distribution of inorganic nutrients no₃ po₄ and sio₄ and their control on phytoplankton diatoms flagellates biomass on the agadir coast model performance was evaluated against satellite observations and climatology data the model achieved satisfactory representation of the sea surface temperature chlorophyll a and a reasonable agreement in the seasonal pattern of inorganic nutrients based on nutrient concentrations and their stoichiometric ratio the study points to nitrate as the key factor controlling phytoplankton distribution largely dominated by flagellates nitrate depletion occurs faster than phosphate and silicate thus driving the area towards nitrogen limitation keywords biogeochemical model agadir coast diatoms flagellates nitrogen limitation 1 introduction sustained by upwelling events and interactions with terrestrial inputs the coastal waters off north west africa in the canary current system including the moroccan atlantic coast are very productive in terms of phytoplankton biomass chl a up to 10 mg m 3 and primary production up to 5 gcm 2 d 1 arístegui and montero 2005 lauthuilière et al 2008 arístegui et al 2009 this makes this coast a very productive area in terms of pelagic and demersal resources arístegui et al 2009 chavez and messié 2009 recently coastal development has been unavoidable in parallel with economic growth within morocco consequently coastal marine ecosystems have been disrupted and several environmental problems have occurred such as pollution of coastal water eutrophication depletion of fish diversity and degradation of marine ecological habitats agmour et al 2018 boundir et al 2019 understanding and managing the ecological changes occurring under climatic and anthropogenic pressure is a scientific and coastal manager s challenge as well within this context numerical models could contribute to the coastal management improving the current knowledge on the nutrients and plankton dynamics supplementing the time space constraints of observations over the last years there has been an increase in the use of models as management support tools to describe the water quality of coastal and marine environments ce qual w2 e g cole and wells 2011 zhang et al 2015 qual2e e g soulignac et al 2018 hoang et

chosen for the development of a numerical coastal model for north west africa given its geographical location as a part of the canary current system the concavity of its coastline and the influence of the atlas mountains the area is characterised by a permanent upwelling responsible for a high productivity anabalón et al 2014 it is therefore an important resource for fishing aquaculture and recreational activities which has been under local impacts typically associated with strong human pressure industrial and urban expansion dredging and pollution discharges disturb its ecological balance nadir et al 2015 agnaou et al 2017 2018 lamine et al 2019 understanding the ecological behaviors of this area remains necessary to address coastal management questions unfortunately given the limited spatial and temporal coverage of observation networks a major part of the moroccan atlantic coastal waters including the agadir coast suffers usually from data sparsity the information is poorer when it comes to biogeochemical field data a coupled modeling system able of comprehensively capturing the cycle of biogeochemical processes occurring in water column could facilitate ecological analysis of ecosystem dynamics making it a useful tool for investigating nutrient and plankton variability in coastal areas although the biogeochemical variables in the coastal areas off the canary current system north west africa has been restrictively discussed in previous studies e g hernández león et al 2007 2019 lovecchio et al 2017 2018 arístegui et al 2020 santana falcón et al 2020 there is still a lack of knowledge about its biogeochemical functioning of the agadir coast to our knowledge no high resolution numerical model has yet been implemented to describe the biogeochemical properties of this area to fulfil these knowledge gaps the biogeochemical dynamics of lower trophic levels of the agadir coast through the development and the assessment of a three dimensional 3d mohid water modelling system has been investigated the flexibility of the mohid water allows the simulation of a large variety of ecological physical and chemical processes occurring in the water column sediment and air interfaces being so considered a powerful tool to investigate the dynamic aquatic ecosystems deus et al 2013 duarte et al 2014 piroddi et al 2015 mateus et al 2018 chang 2020 the main purpose of this study is to provide a decision support tool for coastal management of north west africa moroccan atlantic coast to accomplish this objective numerical simulations of a high resolution local configuration of 3d mohid water are performed over the agadir coastal waters special emphasis is given to describe the spatio temporal distribution of inorganic dissolved nutrients and their contribution to phytoplankton diatoms and flagellates dynamics time series surface and depth maps of the simulated physicochemical fields including water temperature salinity and

performance finally the dynamic of phytoplankton and their response to nutrients and environmental factors variations are discussed and pertinent conclusions are summarized 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area located on the south western atlantic coast of morocco the agadir coast is the central part of a 35 km long shoreline bound between cape ghir in the north and cape aglou in the southwest fig 1 the coast exhibit wide morphological and geological variation it is characterized by an alternation of rocky coast in the north and sandy coast in the south aouiche et al 2016a the orientation of the coast towards the west generates an important upwelling event because of its shallow depth and the constant regularity of the northeast ne winds in this area moujane et al 2011 agadir bay and the adjacent smaller anza beach north of the commercial port are the most important morphological characteristics of the region influenced by the atlas mountains the atlantic ocean and sahara the area is characterized by an arid to semi arid climate aouiche et al 2013 average annual temperatures range from 14 c in winter and 26 7 c in summer although temperatures may rise to over 40 c under the influence of sahara winds lamine et al 2019 the rainy season mainly occurs in the fall and in the first weeks of winter with average annual rainfall of about 300 mm year according to data obtained from the regional office of the development of agricultural souss massa relatively energetic waves from the north largely dominate the area in both winter and summer presenting approximately 67 of the incident waves and only 5 75 from the south furthermore the dominant winds in the area are from the west northwest wnw to the west w favourable for the generation of aeolian dunes in the semi arid climate of souss massa the area is mainly governed by mesotidal and semidiurnal tides with a mean neap tidal range of 1 3 m and a mean spring tidal range of 2 9 m tidal currents was relatively weak order of 0 1 m s and maintained a circular pattern within the coast aouiche et al 2016 2 2 model description numerical simulations are performed using mohid water modelling system www mohid com the model consists of a set of coupled modules that aim to simulate the main physical and biogeochemical processes in aquatic ecosystems miller and pinder 2004 it is based on the finite volume concept where the equations are applied macroscopically at each cell in the grid using divergent flux that assures the conservation in the transport of properties the hydrodynamic model solves the momentum and primitive continuity equations for the surface elevation supposing hydrostatic and boussinesq approximation valentim et al 2013 furthermore the model is implemented assuming a semi implicit time step integration for its temporal discretization using a cartesian and sigma coordinates for its vertical discretization and an arakawa c grid for its horizontal discretization martins et al 2001 the transport event for a given biogeochemical property p are calculated using a 3d advection diffusion differential equation cancino and neves 1995 d p d t p t u j p x j x j k θ p x j sources sink where p is the property concentration j is the index for the cartesian coordinate x y z k θ is the turbulent mass diffusion coefficient the sink and source terms for biogeochemical properties are computed in each cell of the grid and in each time instant using a biogeochemical model saraiva et al 2017 the state variables and processes are computed for a control volume regardless of any transport scheme the control volume approach consists of splitting the water body into finite segments or control volumes chapra 1997 solving for each one of them a series of linear equations representing the interdependence of various properties and calculating the mass balances considering the sources and sinks within each volumes the biogeochemical processes are mainly adapted based on formulations originally developed by the us environmental protection agency epa bowie et al 1985 the conceptual structure and the accounted processes are reported in fig 2 model equations and a list of model state variables as well as a list of parameters values are given in an appendix tables 3 5 thus inorganic and detrital organic forms of nitrogen n phosphorus p and silica si have been explicitly simulated being are driven by very different remineralisation rates the ammonia nh₄ equation considers respiration mineralisation processes phytoplankton uptake as well as the fraction of phytoplankton and zooplankton mortality that is directly supplied into the system in oxygenated water column nh₄ is oxidized to no₃ by nitrification and conversely no₃ is lost by denitrification to nitrogen gas n2 the kinetics of denitrification reaction is simulated as a function of no₃ dissolved oxygen do and temperature availability in the system arhonditsis and brett 2005 the model considers the organic and inorganic phosphorus forms the inorganic phosphorus po₄ considers mineralisation processes phytoplankton uptake as well as the fraction of phytoplankton and zooplankton mortality that is released into the water column in inorganic form fraction of the organic phosphorus settles to the sediment and another part is mineralized into po₄ the do mass balance equation considers the production of oxygen by primary producers the consumption of oxygen and the exchange of oxygen between water column and atmosphere the model considers two major groups of producers in the ecosystem diatoms dia and autotrophic flagellates fla and various organic matter components primary producers uptake inorganic nutrients nh₄ no₃ po₄ and dissolved silica dsi and follow an exponential growth model their

zooplankton mirozooplankton ciliate and mesozooplankton types are simulated with redfield ratio 106c 16n 1p such that their growth relies on the grazing rate and maximum growth rate grazing in turn depends on food density and size as well as the food encounter rate the microzooplankton graze on flagellates and detrital particulate matter whereas the mesozooplankton graze on diatoms flagellates and microzooplankton at rates determined by zooplankton swimming speed food size and density and particle encounter rate baird and emsley 1999 grazing and mortality result in the accumulation of detritus and dissolved inorganic and organic nutrients through remineralisation dissolved organic material refractory dissolved organic nitrogen donr refractory dissolved organic phosphorus dopr

and rendered become available to the phytoplankton 2 3 model implementation the model was implemented using the downscaling approach of nested domains described by mateus et al 2012 two domains of nested grids with different resolutions were used fig 1 the local high resolution domain agadir coast model system acms domain 2 receives its open boundary conditions from the lower resolution regional domain the moroccan atlantic coast operational model system macoms domain 1 which open boundary condition seawater temperature and salinity combines low frequency copernicus marine environment monitoring service cmems outputs with tidal levels simulated using the same horizontal resolution acms domain in operational modelling system the one way downscaling approach using an intermediate regional model application between cmems and a local domain has the advantage of running a number of local applications in parallel this allows simulations to be available in a short time period as macoms can run independently of its receiving local application macoms domain is an implementation of 2d barotropic model with 0 04 horizontal resolution regional domain resulting in a grid of 238 359 cells and maximum depths around 5300 m table 1 acms domain resulting of an implementation of 3d baroclinic model with 0 02 horizontal resolution a grid of 56 56 cells and a maximum depths

cloudiness and radiation data provided from wrf weather research and forecasting model implemented by action modulers http www actionmodulers pt were used to force the model the tidal forcing was obtained from the harmonic components extracted from the fes2012 with 3km resolution version of the fes finite element solution global tidal model carrère et al 2012 the monthly climatological 3d

oxygen on a 1 00 grid defined at 37 standard depth levels with distances between values increasing with depth starting with 5 m intervals at the surface and 25 m intervals from 100 m depth onwards 2 4

assessment including correlation coefficient r difference of mean values bias root mean squared error rmse standard deviation sd and graphically the taylor s diagram taylor 2001 3 results 3 1 spatial variability of hydrographical condition the spring 20 mar apr may 20 jun summer 21 jun july aug 21 sep and winter 21 dec jan feb 19 mar horizontal distribution of sst predicted by the model and collected by odyssea are presented in fig 3 general sst cross shore gradient is detected this gradient is accentuated in the south western coast in result of the cold water inflow coming from the north the horizontal signature of the sst seasonal pattern is captured by the model with nevertheless some discrepancies near to the boundaries the model skill in reproducing the sst distribution was graphically summarized in a quantitative way using the taylor diagram the diagram investigates overall position of the simulated sst with respect to the odyssea products in terms of r rmse and sd taylor 2001 results are depicted in fig 4 and associated statistical indices are calculated in table 2 as a whole spatial distribution of sst presents relatively good scores in all skill indexes even if they tend to be slightly underestimated in spring and summer bias 0 129 and 0 177 c respectively table 2 the diagram clearly confirms the good agreement between simulated and satellite sst fields with correlation coefficient up to 0 87 of the three seasons the simulated sst in closest agreement with the satellite product in terms of high correlation r 0 86 and low error rmse 0 55 c is provided during the winter period in contrast this agreement decrease slightly during the spring period with r 0 74 rmse 0 68 cand sd 0 61 c and the summer period with r 0 72 rmse 0 69 c and sd 0 67 c likewise sss increased as the offshore distance increased fig 5 a b c however the near shore region affected by diluted waters and the offshore region affected by high salinity associated with warmer surface waters declined in winter fig 5c in contrast surface do was patchily distributed with a mass water of higher concentrations coming from the north simulated in spring and summer fig 5d e in winter the do concentrations decreased as the distance from the near shore region increased fig 5f vertical sections up to 1500 m of physicochemical parameters were illustrated selecting the co transect transect with high mean cross shore variables gradient from the agadir coast across the continental shelf to the offshore region fig 1 indeed the water temperature salinity and do concentration of co transect exhibited stratified distributions in both seasons summer and winter the temperature and salinity decreased as the depth increased with strong negative downward gradient of around 17 units difference between surface and bottom layers for water temperature 1 8 units for salinity as the temperature increased the microorganisms became more active nonetheless the leaping layers hindered the water exchange between the surfaces to the bottom layers inducing in a drop of the do levels on the bottom fig 6 3 2 spatial variability of nutrient concentrations and plankton biomass spatial distributions of surface no₃ po₄ and sio₄ concentrations in agadir coastal area were simulated during spring summer and winter 2017 2018 fig 7 the anomalously high no₃ concentrations were limited to the northern area during the spring period and could be associated to the boundary conditions fig 7a in contrast the central part of the coast seems to be favoured by high no₃ concentrations during summer and winter periods fig 7b c the po₄ distribution exhibits a different pattern as no₃ areas with low concentrations were located in a narrow coastal band in spring fig 7d in summer coastal circulation loads of po₄ concentrations to accumulate in the central part of the coast offshore extensions were detected during the winter period fig 7e f the sio₄ concentrations were found to be higher for all seasons in comparison with no₃ and po₄ thus sio₄ is unlikely to be the principal limiting factor for diatom distribution in our area in spring the sio₄ concentrations were higher than those in summer and exhibited decreasing trends as distance from the near shore coast increased fig 7g during summer and winter periods the lowest sio₄ concentrations were limited to the central part of coast the rest of the domain was relatively rich in sio₄ fig 7h i furthermore the vertical profiles of no₃ po₄ and sio₄ of co transect displayed stratified distributions fig 8 the nutrient concentrations gradually increased with increasing depth and high values were simulated in the bottom layers in response to the bottom currents and remineralisation of organic material on the other hand the simulated surface phytoplankton in terms of c biomass varies substantially from the coast to the open ocean showing a strong longitudinal decreasing trend of diatoms in spring and winter fig 9 a c in contrast the central part of the coast seems to be favoured by high biomass of diatoms during the summer period fig 9b simulated surface flagellate has a similar footprint to the diatoms distribution trends although with greater magnitude fig 9d e f nevertheless lower values of simulated zooplankton biomass were limited to the nearshore area in spring and to the central part of the coast in summer fig 9g h whereas the winter season exhibited a high zooplankton biomass near the coast which begins to decrease gradually to the offshore area fig 9i 3 3 temporal variation validation with climatology and satellite data to understand changes in phytoplankton distribution in relation to physical and biogeochemical variables we analyzed annual variation january december 2017 of sst sss do and inorganicnutrients by averaging the monthly climatology data and compared with simulated findings from station s 30 5n 10 5w fig 10 we summarize graphically in a quantitative way the model performance using the taylor diagram for temperature we analyzed the seasonal pattern of the mean sst which indicated that the study area warmed up and attained maximum temperature during summer in winter the surface water has cooled down rapidly and attained minimum temperature in february the model captured not only the seasonal variability in sst climatology but also the range of the observations fig 10a meanwhile the average sss climatology data showed higher values in winter and spring than that in summer and fall the model does not matches sss climatology data indicating a shift in timing of the monthly variability fig 10b and leading to a higher error rmse 1 67 psu fig 11 the surface do average climatology concentrations reached the maximum in the winter thereafter the do variation remained a decreasing trend and dropped to the minimum average in fall the model relatively captured the general annual trend with an underestimation mainly in the late period of investigation fig 10c a decreasing trend in inorganic nutrients no₃ and po₄ systematically occurred from the early spring leading to ample variations in no₃ concentrations explained mostly by the denitrification processes and the phytoplankton uptake see later discussion the model captured seasonal signature of the climatological pattern except a slight time lag of the winter peak and an overall overestimation in january and the early february and underestimation in the rest of the year fig 10d seasonal changes in po₄ concentrations were consistently associated with higher values in winter followed by a sharp decrease in summer overall the model captured reasonably seasonal pattern despite some discrepancies could be related to the used constant input values at the inflow boundaries fig 9e the general sio₄ trends show that the highest values were getting later in the year a continuous increase in sio₄ concentrations with time was simulated in agreement with the climatology data fig 10f on the other hand given the scarcity of field data time series of the sea surface chl a estimated using the conversion factor from simulated total phytoplankton carbon biomass as defined in lancelot et al 2005 are assessed using modis aqua satellite data overall the average concentration in spring and summer was higher than that in fall and winter the model captured reasonably well seasonal variability in chl a concentrations particularly good agreement is observed in spring and summer in winter the model has a tendency to underestimate surface chl a concentrations most notably in the early period of investigation january and february fig 10g the flagellate biomass distribution displays a similar pattern as chl a fig 10h however simulated flagellate growth starts at late february followed by the bloom peak in march and april the simulated biomass decreased in the late spring and the second summer bloom of lower magnitude was manifested after a summer bloom decline biomass attains even lower values in fall and reaches its annual minimum values in the november probably due to combined zooplankton grazing light and nutrient limitation compared to the flagellate the diatoms seasonal signature is less marked where biomass tended to remain low throughout the year their simulated biomass slowly but steadily increased reaching the maximum values in late december fig 10h the visualization of the models performance using the taylor diagram confirmed the agreement model climatology data fig 11 from the taylor skill indexes one can identify po₄ and no₃ tend to be the most skillful among the all model variables with high correlation coefficient r 0 8 low error rmse 0 6 mg l and normalised standard deviations close to 1 sd 0 91 and 1 07 mg l respectively chl a sst and sio₄ present a moderate correlation 0 68 r 0 7 and the correct variability sd 0 7 do is a bit out of phase with the observed one which results in its low correlation and error r 0 17 rmse 1 19 mg l and sd 0 86 mg l the low skill scores for do suggests that it is difficult to validate since many components interact with oxygen and contribute to oxygen production and consumption such as the exchange of oxygen between water column and atmosphere photosynthetic oxygen production respiratory consumption by phytoplankton and consumption of oxygen by degradation of organic matter sadeghian et al 2018 peng et al 2019 furthermore sss appears with a negative correlation r 0 3 and high error rmse 1 67 psu as the model fails to capture the observed evolution of the climatology data theses discrepancies can be due of the fact that the freshwater discharges from souss and massa rivers are not accounted in the model 4 discussion 4 1 spatio temporal dynamics of phytoplankton the dominance of simulated flagellates was somewhat surprising as several studies report that diatoms typically dominate moroccan atlantic coastal food chains somoue et al 2004 elghrib et al 2012 natij et al 2014 except for anabalón et al 2014 that report a low to moderate 20 68 contribution of diatoms to total phytoplankton in the cape ghir fig 1 there are a number of explanations for the lack of diatoms in this area the first can be associated to the strong water column stratification that provides beneficial conditions to favor flagellated group of the phytoplankton assemblages as flagellates are more adapted to stratified and stable waters with low nutrient concentrations e g lemley et al 2018 spilling et al 2018 lim et al 2019 another possible explanation can be attributed to the way phytoplankton responded to the time space changes in upwelling conditions sst sss that affect the nutrient levels in water column in fact many flagellate species are characterized by higher surface volume ratios compared to the diatoms group they are able to access alternative phosphorus sources burson et al 2016 and to use various forms of reduced nitrogen when n p ratios are minimal anabalón et al 2014 mulholland et al 2018 at the spatial scale the general shift in maximum flagellates and diatoms between the shelf and the open ocean during the spring period coincides with the spatial gradient of the surface inorganic nutrients fig 7 9 thereafter the possible injection of nutrients by coastal upwelling events could have improved phytoplankton proliferation in the central part of the coast during the summer period when coastal upwelling is more intense cropper et al 2014 santana falcón et al 2020 in winter the transport of high nutrient water to the offshore areas supported by the atlantic water advection could favors proliferation of phytoplankton in waters further offshore anabalón et al 2014 besides this spatial distribution increases in chl a concentrations in studied station s 30 5n 10 5w generate a major spring peak of 1 3 mg m3 in march and a minor summer peak of 0 1 mg m3 in july outside those two peaks chl a levels oscillate between approximately 0 008 and 1 3 mg m3 this range of values remains lower in comparison to those observed by id halla et al 2017 near the coastline 30 56n 9 76w 0 77 1 95 mg m3 surface distribution of simulated flagellates show similar trends with well pronounced spring bloom that could be attributed to the higher nutrient availability combined with adequate light conditions not shown in the upper stratified water column nutrient concentrations become then relatively low and simulated flagellate levels decrease to 0 058 mg c l in late may afterward flagellate growth conditions apparently improved due to sufficient light irradiance supported by the increase in surface solar heating generating relatively high flagellate levels in july after summer inorganic nutrients no₃ and po₄ are dropped to low levels in the surface water column and solar heating is decreased consequently the simulated flagellate levels reach their annual minima in fall and winter the diatom assemblages show less seasonal variability their amplitude remained low throughout our simulations gradually increasing until the early winter this low pattern could be partly confined to the changes in the nutrient molar ratios and the absence of adequate conditions for diatom growth relatively high nutrient concentrations and low water temperatures xiao et al 2017 zhong et al 2019 discussed in next section 4 2 response of phytoplankton to nutrients and environmental factors variations nutrients availability appeared to be the main factor controlling the phytoplankton distribution in moroccan atlantic coastal waters where the upwelling events are strong e g somoue et al 2004 elghrib et al 2012 anabalón et al 2014 in this context our findings reveal a sign of nutrient depletion supporting the claim that the phytoplankton dynamics in the area may be controlled by the annual variation in nutrients this is particularly relevant for no₃ as the simulated concentrations drops to low levels 0 0001 mg l during the first flagellate bloom early spring this low concentration can be designed as an index of limitation for fast photosynthesis in coastal waters kudryavtseva et al 2019 furthermore the average n p ratio was lower than the classical redfield ratio of 16 1 n p 0 4 suggesting that most of the available nitrogen has been incorporated by flagellate into the local biogeochemical cycle and move the coast towards nitrogen limitation the low n p ratio could be then attributed to the higher nitrogen uptake by the flagellate dominated blooms in the study area the injection of phosphorous into the surface waters caused by the upwelling of deep atlantic waters or to the faster recycling of phosphorous relative to nitrogen in the surface coastal waters furthermore although no₃ is recognized to be rapidly exhausted in upwelling filaments the nutrient rich water upwelled off north west africa barton et al 1998 is advected offshore at the surface layers as showed by the relatively high nutrient concentrations in the offshore waters santana falcón et al 2020 the exhaustion of nitrogen to the analytical limit during phytoplankton blooms has been previously detected in cape ghir during the three cruises june august and october 2009 in these cruises no₃ concentrations were close to the detection limit and inorganic n p ratios were lower than 6 anabalón et al 2014 in addition this notion of the primary production growth being nitrogen limited has been reported by various investigators in many areas of the north atlantic ocean e g sarmiento et al 1993 agusti et al 2001 ferreira et al 2019 by contrast the distribution of flagellates is less sensitive to the low phosphate concentrations 0 003 0 014 mg l due to their ability to secrete alkaline phosphatase in response to limited phosphorus availability e g li et al 2015 cao et al 2018 zhou et al 2017 2019 meanwhile the relative larger size of flagellates when comparing to diatoms makes it more adapted to take advantage of po₄ mainly delivered from the atlantic ocean via coastal upwelling events litchman et al 2007 on the other hand it is interesting to note that the high simulated concentrations of sio₄ between 0 008 and 0 075 mg l in comparison with no₃ and po₄ lead to stoichiometric p impoverishment relative to si si p ratios 16 1 paul et al 2008 and strong deficiency of n relative to si n si ratios 1 1 ramirez et al 2005 in our station these findings illustrate the preferential uptake of no₃ by phytoplankton and suggest that sio₄ is not limiting factor in the surface waters of the study area nutrient ratios and levels cannot account alone for phytoplankton distribution as environmental parameters are fundamental factors in shaping the distribution of diatoms and flagellates in the study areas temperature is assumed to have an indirect effect on the phytoplankton dynamics affecting the processes of sinking grazing and nutrient assimilation as well as the rate of biochemical reactions in water column spilling et al 2018 pan et al 2020 however spatial distribution of simulated and satellite sst fig 3 with a narrow band of cold waters in the nearshore area confirms the influence of the cold upwelling filament off north west africa arístegui et al 2009 santana falcón et al 2020 previous studies e g wooster et al 1976 nykjaer et al 1994 anabalón et al 2014 pointed out the permanent coastal upwelling off cape ghir 31n with maximum intensity in summer this filament propagates more than 100 km offshore associated with a cyclonic eddy mainly influenced by the local bottom topography the concave configuration of the coastline and the presence of the canary islands e g hagen et al 1996 barton et al 1998 pelegrí et al 2005 santana falcón et al 2020 the analysis of the horizontal and vertical co transect residual velocities calculated by averaging the transient velocities at each grid point over the simulation period from january 2017 to december 2018 reinforces these findings fig 12 thus the south west north east orientation of the coast and the differences in the bottom friction affect residual current velocity and induce a coastal cyclonic eddy typical of this region rhomad et al submitted for publication cyclonic eddy tend to increase no₃ and po₄ concentrations in the central parts of the coast during the summer period thereby controlling the phytoplankton growth in the area fig 7 9 temporal distribution of simulated sst shows seasonal variations with fluctuations ranging from 16 82 c in march to 21 30 c in august 2017 in situ sst measurements have reported a wider range of sst variation from 14 9 c in february 2016 to 26 6 c august 2017 lamine et al 2019 compared to the other areas imessouane bay southwest moroccan atlantic coast 19 2 c to 21 9 c amazzal et al 2020 and dakhla bay south moroccan atlantic coast 18 21 8 c berraho et al 2019 furthermore it is interesting to note that in our station phytoplankton blooming produced by rapid growth of flagellates is most common in the early spring and summer when sst is increasing after spring flagellates biomass declined rapidly while that of diatoms continued to increase fig 10 warming temperatures resulting in inorganic nutrients decline levels as a consequence of intense stratification can explain in part the persistence of flagellates at higher levels than diatoms which are still present in our station during summer but with low biomass smayda and reynolds 2003 diatoms ability to grow well at low water temperature baretta bekker et al 2009 witness the fact that they start growing in the early winter reaching a maximum in december this can be also attributed to the optimal water temperature range for the growth of diatoms 15 20 c for s costatum compared to that for flagellates 20 27 c for p donghaiense suzuki and takahashi 1995 xu et al 2010 besides water temperature salinity can strongly influence phytoplankton composition and biomass previous studies e g marshall et al 2006 badsi et al 2012 hernando et al 2015 have endorsed the tight relationship between salinity level and phytoplankton dynamic in our study the range of simulated sss values 36 23 36 56 psu were indicative of the influence of north atlantic central west water anabalón et al 2014 when compared to other atlantic moroccan areas the range for in situ sss is narrower than that simulated by our model minimum value of 31 26 psu february 2017 and a maximum value of 37 9 psu august 2017 was observed in taghazout bay lamine et al 2019 the range between 36 2 and 37 7 psu were observed in dakhla bay berraho et al 2019 and the range between 36 1 and 36 8 psu were observed in imessouane bay amazzal et al 2020 this could explain the dominance of large flagellate that may result from the salinity optimum for flagellates 36 7 37 7 psu for p arcuatum skejić et al 2017 20 37 psu for a minutum grzebyk et al 2003 it is consistent with other studies e g nche fambo et al 2015 showing that flagellates dominate marine brackish salinities but diatoms are able to persist at hypersaline waters in addition changes in ambient do concentrations could also a main factor considered to affect phytoplankton distribution and composition biswas et al 2014 srichandan et al 2015 naik et al 2020 from our simulation it can be observed that the horizontal distribution of phytoplankton is similar to that of do concentrations a strip of high sea surface phytoplankton simulated in the central part of the coast during the summer period coincides well with the do maximum concentrations fig 5e vertically nutrients are depleted in the surface water column and an enrichment of do is simulated higher than 8 5 mg l with a sharp decrease to the bottom less than 2 mg l from these findings agadir waters are relatively well oxygenated compared to taghazout bay 6 9 8 5 mg l lamine et al 2019 but less oxygenated compared to dakhla bay 7 2 10 8 mg l anhichem et al 2017 overall the relatively high do concentrations can be mostly attributed to the important circulation of water aouiche et al 2016a that improves oxygen levels inside the coast and the photosynthetic release of oxygen by the high flagellate blooms 5 conclusion to our knowledge this paper is the first biogeochemical modeling investigation of the of southern moroccan atlantic coast agadir coast using a high resolution three dimensional coupled hydrodynamic biogeochemical model special emphasis was dedicated to deciphering of planktonic assemblages chl a diatoms and flagellates dynamics in response to physicochemical fields water temperature salinity and do inorganic dissolved nutrients no₃ po₄ and sio₄ availability the model performance was investigated by comparison with satellite products odyssea for sst and modis for chl a and climatology data woa2018 despite aforementioned bias in temporal distribution of sss and do which is probably attributed to missing processes and some gaps in the hydrological cycle of the atmosphere model it is undisputed that our model reveals an adequate reproduction of spatial pattern of sst and seasonal signature of sst chl a and po₄ furthermore the underestimation of the simulated no₃ concentrations is likely a result of applied nutrient boundary conditions from nutrient concentrations and stoichiometric ratios it can be asserted that the no₃ levels may be the key element controlling phytoplankton distribution in the agadir coast the possible injection of nutrients through upwelling filaments associated with a cyclonic eddy could be responsible for the nutrients enrichment in the surface layers of water column improving therefore proliferation of phytoplankton in the central part of the coast in summer and toward the open ocean in winter biological variables reveal the largest responses to nutrient levels and environmental parameters with high seasonal variability the flagellates dominated total chl a in the upper layers of water column during spring and summer periods were coincident with warming water temperatures higher salinities intense stratification and lower nutrient no₃ and po₄ concentrations whereas considerable increased in diatoms biomass has been simulated after summer in response to lower water temperature and higher sio₄ concentrations this has major repercussions for the flow of carbon in the area as flagellates dominated phytoplankton assemblages contribute to low carbon export to deeper waters compared to diatoms cushing 1989 in sum the proposed 3d hydrodynamic biogeochemical model can be considered to be an interesting descriptor of the biogeochemical behaviour of moroccan atlantic coastal waters even if it is able to simulate reasonably seasonal cycles of inorganic dissolved nutrients and chl a

24642,population projection matrices are a common means for predicting short and long term population persistence for rare threatened and endangered species data from such species can suffer from small sample sizes and consequently miss rare demographic events resulting in incomplete or biologically unrealistic life cycle trajectories matrices with missing values zeros e g no observation of seeds transitioning to seedlings are often patched using prior information from the literature other populations time periods other species best guess estimates or are sometimes even ignored to alleviate this problem we propose using a multinomial dirichlet model for parameterizing transitions and a gamma for reproduction to patch missing values in these holey matrices this formally integrates prior information within a bayesian framework and explicitly includes the weight of the prior information on the posterior distributions we show using two real data sets that the weight assigned to the prior information mainly influences the dispersion of the posteriors the inclusion of priors results in irreducible and ergodic matrices and more biologically realistic inferences can be made on the transition probabilities because the priors are explicitly stated the results are reproducible and can be re evaluated if alternative priors are available in the future keywords bayesian model beta distribution multinomial dirichlet model demography parameter estimates rare events 1 introduction population projection matrices are a common means for predicting long term population persistence especially for rare threatened and endangered species crone et al 2013 stott et al 2010a for matrix population models to be practical for ecologists and conservation biologists it is assumed that sample size is sufficient to estimate the true vital rates and transition probabilities of a population in the period and site of interest caswell 2001 or is at least a good approximation matrix entries are transition probabilities and recruitment rates we define transitions as all arrows in the t matrix transition matrix which include stasis and change of stage while the recruitment rates are defined in the f matrix fecundity matrix fig 1 however in reality the amount of data that can be obtained to estimate transition probabilities and recruitment rates from population surveys is often limited morris et al 2002 crone et al 2011 the challenge is to gather sufficient data to accurately represent the central tendencies and variance of life history parameters caswell 2001 coulson et al 2001 inference about transition probabilities and recruitment requires data from at least two time periods as the parameters included in the model are the transition survival rates of individuals at different ages stages including survival death and some measure of offspring production some transition events may be naturally rare resulting in infrequently observed or even unobserved events in some time periods or populations e g enright ogden 1979 pinero et al 1984 calvo 1993 kaneko kawano 2002 schödelbauerová et al 2010 in all of these cases the authors made educated guesses about values that were missing in their matrices while such substitutions are common in the literature when incomplete or biologically unrealistic values are obtained the ad hoc nature of the process is frequently not reproducible and rarely is the variance in the estimated quantities provided what is the best way to explicitly take advantage of prior information to resolve issues of missing data or rare vital rates that result in biologically unrealistic estimates confidence in population projection matrices ppm analysis outputs is highest when population sizes are large because data collected to estimate the parameters of the matrix will more likely be representative of the life history characteristics of the species but when sample sizes are small as when evaluating naturally rare and or endangered species parameter estimates and the consequential inferences based on these parameters could be misleading it is generally recognized that small sample sizes will at a minimum result in high variance of the parameter estimates which may have large impacts on estimates of population growth rates and extinction probabilities impairing management decisions crone et al 2011 yet even when sample sizes are large naturally rare events may still be missed or their estimates may not be accurate for the population species or experimental group under study ecologists have used various approaches to fill in missing data these include using means of multiple populations time periods aggregation among years values from the literature for the same or different populations or from congeneric species and best guess estimates from specialists menges dolan 1998 kendall nichols 2002 menges et al 2006 kéry schaub 2012 bayesian approaches have also been used for estimating parameters in population viability analyses pva mccarthy et al 2001 mccarthy masters 2005 lee and rieman 1997 used a bayesian belief network in a pva for salmonids and wade 2002 applied a bayesian approach to estimate life history parameters however wade s approach was limited to individual parameters and not for estimating multinomial parameters or the use of the beta distribution tremblay et al 2009a 2009b and tremblay and mccarthy 2014 used bayesian hierarchical models using multinomial distributions to estimate multiple transition parameters and vital rates simultaneously for rare or unobserved events and ackerman et al 2020 used the dirichlet function for transition probabilities tremblay and mccarthy 2014 used a bayesian approach to estimate transition probabilities and recruitment rates for missing values or low sample sizes with data from conspecific populations thus allowing the statistical model to borrow strength from other populations and generate estimated probabilities for all transitions these models used data from nearby conspecific or related populations collected in the same time period unfortunately many demography studies are carried out with single populations 44 for plants salguero gómez et al 2015 57 for animals salguero gómez et al 2016 limiting the usefulness of the tremblay and mccarthy 2014 approach moreover che castaldo et al 2018 recently modelled variation in life history parameters of plants and found that there was little evidence of consistent phylogenetic correlations and large variation even between different populations of the same species similar problems are also noted for ppm of animals where a limited amount of data is available for model construction for example eberhardt et al 1986 had a small sample size of grizzlies in some age classes morris and doak pg 197 2002 recognized the potential problem with small sample sizes for rare transitions but their recommendation was to use a mathematically complex approach similar to that developed by tremblay and mccarthy 2014 king et al 2010 chapter 8 demonstrate a bayesian approach to fill in missing covariate values in mark recapture and other complex ecological models of individual survival these are different and more complex problems than we address here in our case missing values are unobserved transitions in the more labor intensive data rich mark recapture analysis these unobserved transitions are modelled directly our goal is to show that a simple method exists for dealing with unobserved transitions in the case of sparse data in all cases the best substitute for missing or inaccurate values will depend on the knowledge of the life history of the species under study and the ability of the researcher to choose the best alternative considering a plethora of biological variables however it is not always clear how much weight to place on prior biological knowledge compared to the data and how to explicitly include this in the projection matrix an observation of 0 for a rare transition is still data while the maximum likelihood estimate would be 0 calculating an upper confidence limit of that estimate is not straightforward however calculation of credible intervals bounded by 0 and 1 is straightforward with the dirichlet process which considers simultaneously values of all other transitions for that specific stage in the examples mentioned below we compute matrix elements by using the direct counts for each stage and the change or stasis of these among time periods the ipm integrated population model approach may also be analyzed using bayesian inference methods schaub abadi 2011 biologically nonsensical results may arise from ppm by ignoring problems of ergodicity the condition that regardless of the initial stage structure the asymptotic growth rate will be the same and irreducibility the condition that the transitions from all stages to all other stages are possible both of which may severely impact matrix structure and analyses stott et al 2010a unfortunately these issues are relatively common stott et al 2010b surveyed the literature and estimated that 24 7 of population projection matrices were reducible and 15 6 were non ergodic matrices which include zeros due to rare events or low sample size in key life history rates are likely to be either non ergodic or reducible matrices while the definition of irreducible matrices has a specific mathematical description caswell 2001 biologically it often results in a life cycle model which is incomplete some of these reducible matrices had incomplete life cycles which stott et al 2010b regarded as defying biological rationale in many cases authors recognized the limitations of their models and used one or more methods mentioned above to substitute for missing or unrealistic values here we describe the use of a bayesian approach which allows incorporating explicit prior information into the analysis to fill in the holes created by small sample sizes and rare transitions we define a holey matrix as those matrices which have zeros holes for parameters that are expected to have non zero values in critical life history transitions otherwise the biological life history is nonsensical a simple example is when no recruitment or death of a certain age stage was observed during a specific time period our approach estimates values to replace those zeros thereby eliminating unrealistic life history transitions stasis and fertility rates we use the multinomial dirichlet distribution to estimate transition rates between stages and the gamma distribution to estimate recruitment rates and contrast the results with standard ppm analyses this approach differs in that it includes reproducibility as all priors are explicitly stated parameter estimation considers the sample size of the survey and weight of the priors and posteriors have a beta distribution thereby resolving issues of nonsensical confidence intervals furthermore it is applicable to a single population 2 methods 2 1 model species we illustrate our method using two data sets but the method can apply to any populations with transitions between stages or ages of animals or plants in the first example the data are from the endangered orchid lepanthes eltoroensis stimson an epiphyte endemic to puerto rico tremblay hutchings 2003 data were collected from a total of 1085 individuals on 23 trees which were permanently identified and tracked over a 6 year period at intervals of 6 months each tree is an independent deme population and these are widely separated 135 220 m mean sd this model data set is unusual in that it has 238 matrices transition periods most of which are holey when using traditional approaches for parameterizing transitions with these data we evaluate the effectiveness of the multinomial dirichlet distribution approach to cope with this situation the orchid life history stages included in this analysis are seedlings individuals without lepanthiform sheaths on any shoots juveniles individuals with sheaths but no active inflorescences or persistent peduncles of past reproductive effort and adults with presence of active or inactive inflorescences a simplistic life history diagram with transitions between stages is shown in fig 1 we do not include a seed bank stage because orchids have extremely small seeds that are difficult to follow in their natural habitat ackerman et al 1996 brzosko et al 2017 swartz dixon 2017 the orchid seed bank is ephemeral under the best of conditions seeds survive for not much more than a year arditti 1993 cited by arditti and ghani 2000 population projection matrices ppm were constructed specifying the probability of remaining in a stage stasis the transition probabilities among stages including mortality transition to death and per capita recruitment for each six month period for each population the mean number of individuals per population was 20 interquartile range 7 28 range 1 92 not all stages or transitions were present in every population at each time period resulting in many population samples with zero estimates for fertility and stasis transition probabilities are these sampled zeros accurately representing the life history of the species or are they an artifact of sample size due and to naturally occurring low transition frequencies this should be considered within the context of the life history characteristics of the species we do not discuss how to build a matrix population model or an integral population model ipm as this information has been thoroughly discussed in the literature e g caswell 2001 ellner rees 2006 tremblay et al 2009a hernández suárez et al 2019 for our orchid model data set we know that small populations are the norm tremblay hutchings 2003 so we would expect that not all transitions and recruitment would be observed resulting in ppm with biologically incomplete and unrealistic transitions 2 2 parameterizing survival and growth shrinkage transitions a simple bayesian model of the transition probabilities is the multinomial dirichlet model where the observed data number of observed transitions between stages come from a multinomial distribution and a dirichlet prior distribution a multivariate generalization of the beta distribution is used for the transition probabilities we define transition probabilities as the change from stage i to stage j of the species life history the dirichlet is a conjugate prior for the multinomial so posterior distributions belong to the same family dirichlet and the posterior parameters are obtained by updating the parameters of the prior using observed data congdon 2005 frigyik et al 2010 the dirichlet distribution was proposed by peter gustave lejeune dirichlet in 1839 to study a problem in celestial mechanics dirichlet 1839 he also applied it to probability theory a historical perspective of this method is described by gupta and richards 2001 and a mathematical description can be found in kotz et al 2000 let for example p i p i 1 p i 2 p i k j 1 k p i j 1 be the vector of transition probabilities from stage i to stages 1 k the dirichlet prior for p i can be written as π p i 1 p i 2 p i k γ i 1 k α i j γ α i 1 γ α i 2 γ α i k p i 1 α i 1 1 p i 2 α i 2 1 p i k α i k 1 α i j 0 for all j 1 k let x i 1 x i 2 x i k be the observed transitions and n i j 1 k x i j then the distribution of the observed transitions is assumed to be multinomial with probabilities p i 1 p i 2 p i k f x i 1 x i 2 x i k p i 1 p i 2 p i k n i x i 1 x i 2 x i k p i 1 x i 1 p i 2 x i 2 p i k x i k finally the posterior distribution of the vector of transition probabilities given the observed transitions is also a dirichlet distribution with parameters α i 1 x i 1 α i 2 x i 2 α i k x i k the marginal posterior distribution of each p i j will be b e t a α i j x i j k j α i k x i k with posterior mean e p i j x i 1 x i k α i j x i j k 1 k α i k x i k for a different initial stage k with vector of transition probabilities p k k i the chosen model assumes that p i and p k will have independent prior dirichlet distributions the discussion presented here for one vector of transition probabilities can be extended to all of them note that the sum of the posterior means of the transition probabilities equals to one as expected and the joint distribution of the vector of transition probabilities guarantees that restriction an advantage of this approach is that the credible intervals are easily calculated they can be non symmetrical and are bounded by 0 1 additionally it can produce positive estimates even in the case of unobserved transitions rather than estimating the transition probability as 0 as with the maximum likelihood methods as for any bayesian approach the choice of prior distribution can influence the posterior distribution thus one of the challenges when using bayesian models is recognizing how the prior distribution influences the posterior distribution choy et al 2009 a general guide for assigning the parameters of the prior α i 1 α i k can be obtained by considering the α s as the prior number of observed transitions and n i 0 j 1 k α i j as the prior sample size diaconis and ylvisaker 1979 that is if we could observe n 1 0 transitions from stage 1 we would expect α 1 i of them to be transitions from stage 1 to stage i note that n i 0 represents how much weight we are willing to assign to our prior knowledge another way to see this is by rewriting α i j n i 0 p i j 0 where p i j 0 is the prior probability of each transition and n i 0 is again the prior sample size so we assign values for the probabilities of each transition using prior knowledge such as previous studies on the same or similar species and we decide how much weight we are willing to give to those prior assignments for example if our prior sample size n i 0 is equal to 100 then we are putting a lot of weight on the prior information we are very confident of the prior information while if n i 0 1 then in this case we are not putting a lot of confidence in our prior information note that in the latter case the prior information will be fractions which will sum to 1 conventional noninformative priors could also be used use of noninformative priors for ppm is likely to be inappropriate as we suspect that in all cases some prior information of the life history of species is known we show the impact of using noninformative priors to demonstrate how lack recognition of appropriate prior biases posteriors 2 3 parameterizing the reproductive transitions a matrix model also includes components for reproductive contributions to the seedling stage typically this is accounted for by dividing the transition matrix into two components a matrix t that describes the survival and growth transitions and a matrix f that describes transitions due to reproduction the full matrix is a t f in the present case we can only calculate anonymous reproduction because there is no way to associate a new seedling with any particular adult consequently we cannot calculate the fecundity mean and variance per individual our estimate is solely the total number of recruits over the total number of reproductive individuals for the specific population if we did have specific information on individual contributions to reproduction then we could use it to parametrize similar prior distributions however we might have additional options beyond the simple gamma prior for the poisson that we use here thus the only non zero entry in f is the top right which is given by the number of new seedlings divided by the number of adults present in the previous sample period the number of seedlings is in fact a binomial variable with the number of trials equal to the number of seeds produced in the previous sampling period however we do not have that information and in this species the probability of successful recruitment is very small so we can approximate the number of new recruits with a poisson distribution typically orchids produce thousands if not millions of seeds in each capsule and recruitment is spasmodic lepanthes eltoroensis has approximately 2000 to 5000 seeds per capsule rlt unpublished what we observe is a sum of poisson variables one for each adult which in turn is a poisson distribution with a rate equal to the sum of the rates of individual distributions in this case we aggregate fertility and offspring survival in l eltoroensis breeding fruit production occurs throughout the year so it does not fit easily within the pre breeding and post breeding scenarios okuyama 2019 our approach was to estimate the number of recruits at time t 1 as a function of number of fruits at time t consequently our estimate can be considered pre breeding the conjugate prior for a poisson distribution is a gamma distribution with hyperparameters α and β after observing n intervals and seeing i 1 n x i events the hyperparameters are α α i 1 n x i and β β n we interpret β as the number of adults observed and α as the total number of recruits observed the expected value is α β and the prior equivalent sample size n 0 β there are many possible noninformative priors a classic choice being g a m m a α ϵ β ϵ where ε is some very small value like 0 001 this has an expected value of 1 and a very large variance so that most of the probability is close to 0 with a long tail note that this prior is noninformative in the sense that a single observation will overwhelm it another possibility is the so called neutral prior g a m m a α 1 3 β 1 3 which has ½ the posterior probability above and ½ below the maximum likelihood estimate of the rate kerman 2011 2 4 types of priors evaluated to explore how the selection of prior parameters influences the posterior distribution we evaluated 1 population matrices with no prior 2 population matrices assuming noninformative dirichlet priors on transitions and noninformative gamma priors on fecundity 3 informative priors for both transitions and fecundity with a range of weights n i 0 we extracted the informative prior n i 0 from an expert on epiphytic orchids rlt to compare with the noninformative prior in particular we considered the effects of weighting the informative prior by different fractions of the actual sample size for each population and time period ideally this prior would be extracted before collecting the data using formal elicitation techniques mcbride et al 2012 in this case the prior is only being used to demonstrate the technique in addition we simulated matrices from the posterior distribution of the matrix entries and calculate λ for each matrix to get a posterior distribution of λ s 2 5 simulation studies we simulated the effects of different priors on a second plant species calathea ovandensis marantaceae from the work of horvitz and schemske 1995 they had 4 plots and up to 5 years of transitions as well as a pooled matrix many of the transitions are very small probabilities the pooled matrix is both ergodic and irreducible and has a population growth rate of 0 99 we randomly sampled a population from the 7 above ground stages in this matrix proportional to the stable stage distribution then we generated a fate from the appropriate column of the matrix and a reproductive contribution from a poisson distribution for reproductive stages this simulated stage fate table was converted into a projection matrix using standard methods caswell 2001 we then constructed confidence limits or credible intervals on the asymptotic growth rate for each simulated matrix using a non parametric bootstrap morris doak 2005 or by simulating matrices from the bayesian posteriors we generated 100 simulated stage fate tables for each combination of methods and sample sizes between 50 and 500 plants sampling directly from the stable stage distribution of calathea created numerical issues for the non parametric bootstrap because most observations were of seeds we followed the example in the r package popbio stubben and milligan 2007 and treated the seed stage as unobserved providing fixed transition rates to the bootstrap algorithm this is analogous to providing strong informative priors on the seed transition rates we evaluated three different prior distributions for the transition rates the base of all three priors was a uniform distribution on all transitions with estimates 0 in the pooled matrix and a total weight of 1 in the first scenario we modified the seed transition rate priors to be accurate with a weight of 1000 to be comparable with the strong and accurate information based on the published matrix provided to the bootstrap in the second scenario we left all priors at the base prior in the third scenario we set prior observations of transitions with rates 0 01 to zero and multiplied all the other transitions by 1 25 representing a 25 positive bias where this perturbation resulted in column totals 1 we set mortality transitions to 0 and renormalized the other rates in all three prior scenarios we used a g a m m a α 0 00001 β 0 99999 prior on reproduction from stages known to reproduce the analyses were performed using the package raretrans which is available on github https github com atyre2 raretrans results were visualized with the r package ggplot2 version 2 1 0 wickham 2009 vignettes are available in the package to replicate all of the analyses performed in this paper 3 results lepanthes example 3 1 frequency of missing transitions we monitored 23 populations and each were surveyed 12 times which results in 11 transition periods and 253 possible transition matrices there are 15 population period combinations missing because of difficulty in relocating some populations for a total of 238 matrices only 6 of these matrices are irreducible and 23 including the 6 irreducible matrices are ergodic all of the matrices have 2 or more transitions that have maximum likelihood estimates equal to zero but known to be possible and thus holey the average population growth rate over all times and populations is λ 0 90 s d 0 21 r a n g e 0 1 4 suggesting a rapid decline when the matrices are holey adding a noninformative prior for transitions makes all matrices irreducible and ergodic with a mean λ 0 89 s d 0 15 r a n g e 0 33 1 5 and with the rlt prior fig 1 and a n 1 0 prior sample size of 1 the mean population growth rate is λ 0 93 s d 0 12 r a n g e 0 25 1 2 3 2 effect of missing values on population growth rate estimates posterior point estimates of λ are generally consistent with estimates from the raw observations with a few notable exceptions fig 2 λ s calculated from holey matrices have two spikes at λ 0 and λ 1 both of these spikes arise because of the large number of non ergodic and or reducible matrices 3 3 addition of priors for parameterizing ppm adding any prior information leads to these anomalous values spreading out over a more limited range leading to the spikes in fig 2 holey matrices with λ 0 end up with posterior point estimates generally less than 1 increasing the weight on the informative prior causes the posterior point estimates to shrink towards λ 0 96 the value for the informative prior alone the effect of increasing the prior weights on the posterior transition probabilities is clearer when examining a few transitions from a single population and time period fig 3 table 1 increasing the weight on the prior reduces the width of the credible intervals and shifts the posterior mean towards the prior and away from the maximum likelihood estimate credible intervals for λ fig 4 are similar in shape but increasing the weight shrinks the dispersion of the posterior the probability that λ 1 decreases with increasing weight on the rlt prior indicating rlt is a pessimist 3 4 simulation study of calathea for each sample size n and method we generated 100 sets of n observations from the calathea matrix for each of these 100 simulated populations we either generated 1000 bootstrap resamples or 1000 simulations from the posterior distribution fig 5 shows the mean 2 5 quantile and 97 5 quantile of λ from the thousand resamples or simulations for n 50 to evaluate the effects of sample size we calculated the average width of the intervals as the difference between the 2 5 and 97 5 quantiles and the bias as the average distance between the mean λ and the true asymptotic growth rate λ each point in fig 6 summarizes data from one panel of fig 5 when accurate information on seed transition rates is available in the prior the bayesian posteriors outperform smaller average interval width and less bias a non parametric bootstrap at small sample sizes 100 individuals fig 6 bootstrap vs simulation using a weak implied sample size of n i 0 1 and conditionally uniform prior on transitions out of the seed stage causes the interval width to expand and introduces a large positive bias fig 6 sim2 these effects do not decrease with sample size because by design the simulated data provides no information on seeds this problem disappears fig 6 sim3 when using a prior that is relatively accurate i e seed juvenile is smaller than seed seedling even if weak and biased even when the biased prior is sufficiently weak small sample sizes lead to unbiased posterior estimates the posterior retains a slight positive bias 95 credible interval includes zero relative to the bootstrap because of the lack of information on seed transitions 4 discussion uncertainty in vital rate parameter estimates should be small for the species and conditions under consideration unfortunately on many occasions transition events may simply fail to occur during the survey period the population projection matrices constructed from these data often result in reducible matrices stott et al 2010b using the dirichlet distribution to parameterize the matrices all of the matrices complied with being irreducible and ergodic regardless of the choice of prior the posterior distribution of each parameter follows a beta distribution from which it is possible to appreciate the amount of uncertainty for each of the parameters which could be considered an evaluation of demographic variance in addition evaluating environmental variance in rare species is often exacerbated by small sample size or some unobserved life history transitions thus inclusion of priors to estimate posterior transition probabilities offers a method of considering demographic and environmental variance in species with limited amounts of data 4 1 impact of choice of priors on ppm the weight we assign to the priors can influence the posterior distribution when we give large weight to our prior information and observed sample sizes are small then the prior can dominate the inference we would not recommend selecting a prior sample size equivalent or larger than the actual sample size as it would dominate the data a possible exception would arise when the priors come from the analysis of previous data obtained under identical conditions and that are not themselves holey if there is any suspicion that conditions have changed in time or vary in space the prior weight should be reduced below the observed sample size the selection of the prior parameters should be undertaken carefully before data collection starts as this could reduce bias in prior selection in other words any information from the literature or other sources before data collection might be useful for estimating priors and should be considered a priori to the analysis otherwise there is a risk that the observations themselves would affect the development of the priors we believe that informative priors are more useful than ignoring the effects of holey matrices or using informative priors but a low weight n i 0 prior sample size should be used our simulation study further confirmed the value of low weight informative priors even when the prior was biased the effects were small because of the low weight assigned to the prior distributions using a conditionally uniform priors positive values on transitions known to occur leads to strong positive bias when used on a stage with no empirical information 4 2 advantages of the multinomial dirichlet distribution when one uses the multinomial dirichlet distribution to deal with holey matrices there are several clear advantages which are as follows 1 provides more biologically accurate transition estimates when events are not observed or observed transition events are infrequent this can produce estimates even in the case of unobserved transitions 2 credible intervals on parameter estimates are bounded by 0 and 1 thereby avoiding biologically unrealistic values e g p 0 5 3 reproducibility of posterior estimates are possible by explicitly reporting the number of transitions stasis and recruitment fertility rates observed and the priors used 4 this method does not require sophisticated statistics such as hierarchical bayesian models fitted by markov chain monte carlo 5 using a bayesian approach starting with the parameter estimation of the ppm up to the pva propagates the parameter uncertainty through the projection and is likely to result in more accurate formulation of management criteria taylor et al 1996 goodman 2002 furthermore inclusion of rare transitions by using the multinomial dirichlet approach would make elasticity analyses more precise because this analysis only recognizes non zero matrix entries caswell 2001 thus holey matrices may result in inaccurate elasticities and ultimately extinction probabilities the latter are derived from measures affecting the stochastic growth rate whilst the deterministic growth rate will usually be unchanged unless sample size is small which is usually the case for rare species the non parametric bootstrap alternative does not solve the problems of matrices with holes caused by sampling zeros as in the case of calathea the bootstrap only works if we assume accurate knowledge of the transitions in the seed stage even if we did have such information for example from germination experiments presently available software produces overly optimistic estimates of precision by ignoring sampling variation in these transitions our method seamlessly incorporates such external information and preserves the uncertainty associated with those estimates 4 3 limitation to the approach despite the advantages one challenge still remains when observed sample sizes are small and knowledge of priors is absent or confidence in the priors is low if sample size for the whole study is small then we recommend that priors be selected with caution and simulations be performed to get a grasp of the influence of the priors on the posterior distribution we also suggest varying the parameters of the priors sensitivity analysis to clarify doubts about the effect of the choice of priors on the posteriors a common alternative parameterization of ppm s breaks the column of transitions to other stages into 2 distinct probabilities s the probability of surviving to the next census and a vector p with entries that describe the probability of transitioning to other stages including the probability of remaining in the same stage unfortunately we are not aware of a closed form for the prior on the transformed parameter however the survival and transition probabilities can be combined into the multinomial form that we use so this is not a serious limitation of our method 5 conclusions the multinomial dirichlet approach adds to the tools for estimating transition probabilities and should be implemented for estimating central tendencies and credible intervals of parameters and for evaluating transitions of rare and unobserved events calculation of parameter estimates should be explicit and observed transitions and priors should be shown in publications access to the raw data at least the number of observed transitions would open up the opportunity for data to be reanalyzed when additional data is collected or alternative priors are available while this approach can be used under any circumstances for estimating transitions the advantages are especially clear when transitions are not observed or infrequently so the approach presented here can be applied to ppm age and stage based and extended to ipm structured models of any size furthermore it is particularly useful when developing management strategies for rare and endangered species whose demographic data often suffer from small sample sizes and transition gaps with much at stake the mathematically

24642,population projection matrices are a common means for predicting short and long term population persistence for rare threatened and endangered species data from such species can suffer from small sample sizes and consequently miss rare demographic events resulting in incomplete or biologically unrealistic life cycle trajectories matrices with missing values zeros e g no observation of seeds transitioning to seedlings are often patched using prior information from the literature other populations time periods other species best guess estimates or are sometimes even ignored to alleviate this problem we propose using a multinomial dirichlet model for parameterizing transitions and a gamma for reproduction to patch missing values in these holey matrices this formally integrates prior information within a bayesian framework and explicitly includes the weight of the prior information on the posterior distributions we show using two real data sets that the weight assigned to the prior information mainly influences the dispersion of the posteriors the inclusion of priors results in irreducible and ergodic matrices and more biologically realistic inferences can be made on the transition probabilities because the priors are explicitly stated the results are reproducible and can be re evaluated if alternative priors are available in the future keywords bayesian model beta distribution multinomial dirichlet model demography parameter estimates rare events 1 introduction population projection matrices are a common means for predicting long term population persistence especially for rare threatened and endangered species crone et al 2013 stott et al 2010a for matrix population models to be practical for ecologists and conservation biologists it is assumed that sample size is sufficient to estimate the true vital rates and transition probabilities of a population in the period and site of interest caswell 2001 or is at least a good approximation matrix entries are transition probabilities and recruitment rates we define transitions as all arrows in the t matrix transition matrix which include stasis and change of stage while the recruitment rates are defined in the f matrix fecundity matrix fig 1 however in reality the amount of data that can be obtained to estimate transition probabilities and recruitment rates from population surveys is often limited morris et al 2002 crone et al 2011 the challenge is to gather sufficient data to accurately represent the central tendencies and variance of life history parameters caswell 2001 coulson et al 2001 inference about transition probabilities and recruitment requires data from at least two time periods as the parameters included in the model are the transition survival rates of individuals at different ages stages including survival death and some measure of offspring production some transition events may be naturally rare resulting in infrequently observed or even unobserved events in some time periods or populations e g enright ogden 1979 pinero et al 1984 calvo 1993 kaneko kawano 2002 schödelbauerová et al 2010 in all of these cases the authors made educated guesses about values that were missing in their matrices while such substitutions are common in the literature when incomplete or biologically unrealistic values are obtained the ad hoc nature of the process is frequently not reproducible and rarely is the variance in the estimated quantities provided what is the best way to explicitly take advantage of prior information to resolve issues of missing data or rare vital rates that result in biologically unrealistic estimates confidence in population projection matrices ppm analysis outputs is highest when population sizes are large because data collected to estimate the parameters of the matrix will more likely be representative of the life history characteristics of the species but when sample sizes are small as when evaluating naturally rare and or endangered species parameter estimates and the consequential inferences based on these parameters could be misleading it is generally recognized that small sample sizes will at a minimum result in high variance of the parameter estimates which may have large impacts on estimates of population growth rates and extinction probabilities impairing management decisions crone et al 2011 yet even when sample sizes are large naturally rare events may still be missed or their estimates may not be accurate for the population species or experimental group under study ecologists have used various approaches to fill in missing data these include using means of multiple populations time periods aggregation among years values from the literature for the same or different populations or from congeneric species and best guess estimates from specialists menges dolan 1998 kendall nichols 2002 menges et al 2006 kéry schaub 2012 bayesian approaches have also been used for estimating parameters in population viability analyses pva mccarthy et al 2001 mccarthy masters 2005 lee and rieman 1997 used a bayesian belief network in a pva for salmonids and wade 2002 applied a bayesian approach to estimate life history parameters however wade s approach was limited to individual parameters and not for estimating multinomial parameters or the use of the beta distribution tremblay et al 2009a 2009b and tremblay and mccarthy 2014 used bayesian hierarchical models using multinomial distributions to estimate multiple transition parameters and vital rates simultaneously for rare or unobserved events and ackerman et al 2020 used the dirichlet function for transition probabilities tremblay and mccarthy 2014 used a bayesian approach to estimate transition probabilities and recruitment rates for missing values or low sample sizes with data from conspecific populations thus allowing the statistical model to borrow strength from other populations and generate estimated probabilities for all transitions these models used data from nearby conspecific or related populations collected in the same time period unfortunately many demography studies are carried out with single populations 44 for plants salguero gómez et al 2015 57 for animals salguero gómez et al 2016 limiting the usefulness of the tremblay and mccarthy 2014 approach moreover che castaldo et al 2018 recently modelled variation in life history parameters of plants and found that there was little evidence of consistent phylogenetic correlations and large variation even between different populations of the same species similar problems are also noted for ppm of animals where a limited amount of data is available for model construction for example eberhardt et al 1986 had a small sample size of grizzlies in some age classes morris and doak pg 197 2002 recognized the potential problem with small sample sizes for rare transitions but their recommendation was to use a mathematically complex approach similar to that developed by tremblay and mccarthy 2014 king et al 2010 chapter 8 demonstrate a bayesian approach to fill in missing covariate values in mark recapture and other complex ecological models of individual survival these are different and more complex problems than we address here in our case missing values are unobserved transitions in the more labor intensive data rich mark recapture analysis these unobserved transitions are modelled directly our goal is to show that a simple method exists for dealing with unobserved transitions in the case of sparse data in all cases the best substitute for missing or inaccurate values will depend on the knowledge of the life history of the species under study and the ability of the researcher to choose the best alternative considering a plethora of biological variables however it is not always clear how much weight to place on prior biological knowledge compared to the data and how to explicitly include this in the projection matrix an observation of 0 for a rare transition is still data while the maximum likelihood estimate would be 0 calculating an upper confidence limit of that estimate is not straightforward however calculation of credible intervals bounded by 0 and 1 is straightforward with the dirichlet process which considers simultaneously values of all other transitions for that specific stage in the examples mentioned below we compute matrix elements by using the direct counts for each stage and the change or stasis of these among time periods the ipm integrated population model approach may also be analyzed using bayesian inference methods schaub abadi 2011 biologically nonsensical results may arise from ppm by ignoring problems of ergodicity the condition that regardless of the initial stage structure the asymptotic growth rate will be the same and irreducibility the condition that the transitions from all stages to all other stages are possible both of which may severely impact matrix structure and analyses stott et al 2010a unfortunately these issues are relatively common stott et al 2010b surveyed the literature and estimated that 24 7 of population projection matrices were reducible and 15 6 were non ergodic matrices which include zeros due to rare events or low sample size in key life history rates are likely to be either non ergodic or reducible matrices while the definition of irreducible matrices has a specific mathematical description caswell 2001 biologically it often results in a life cycle model which is incomplete some of these reducible matrices had incomplete life cycles which stott et al 2010b regarded as defying biological rationale in many cases authors recognized the limitations of their models and used one or more methods mentioned above to substitute for missing or unrealistic values here we describe the use of a bayesian approach which allows incorporating explicit prior information into the analysis to fill in the holes created by small sample sizes and rare transitions we define a holey matrix as those matrices which have zeros holes for parameters that are expected to have non zero values in critical life history transitions otherwise the biological life history is nonsensical a simple example is when no recruitment or death of a certain age stage was observed during a specific time period our approach estimates values to replace those zeros thereby eliminating unrealistic life history transitions stasis and fertility rates we use the multinomial dirichlet distribution to estimate transition rates between stages and the gamma distribution to estimate recruitment rates and contrast the results with standard ppm analyses this approach differs in that it includes reproducibility as all priors are explicitly stated parameter estimation considers the sample size of the survey and weight of the priors and posteriors have a beta distribution thereby resolving issues of nonsensical confidence intervals furthermore it is applicable to a single population 2 methods 2 1 model species we illustrate our method using two data sets but the method can apply to any populations with transitions between stages or ages of animals or plants in the first example the data are from the endangered orchid lepanthes eltoroensis stimson an epiphyte endemic to puerto rico tremblay hutchings 2003 data were collected from a total of 1085 individuals on 23 trees which were permanently identified and tracked over a 6 year period at intervals of 6 months each tree is an independent deme population and these are widely separated 135 220 m mean sd this model data set is unusual in that it has 238 matrices transition periods most of which are holey when using traditional approaches for parameterizing transitions with these data we evaluate the effectiveness of the multinomial dirichlet distribution approach to cope with this situation the orchid life history stages included in this analysis are seedlings individuals without lepanthiform sheaths on any shoots juveniles individuals with sheaths but no active inflorescences or persistent peduncles of past reproductive effort and adults with presence of active or inactive inflorescences a simplistic life history diagram with transitions between stages is shown in fig 1 we do not include a seed bank stage because orchids have extremely small seeds that are difficult to follow in their natural habitat ackerman et al 1996 brzosko et al 2017 swartz dixon 2017 the orchid seed bank is ephemeral under the best of conditions seeds survive for not much more than a year arditti 1993 cited by arditti and ghani 2000 population projection matrices ppm were constructed specifying the probability of remaining in a stage stasis the transition probabilities among stages including mortality transition to death and per capita recruitment for each six month period for each population the mean number of individuals per population was 20 interquartile range 7 28 range 1 92 not all stages or transitions were present in every population at each time period resulting in many population samples with zero estimates for fertility and stasis transition probabilities are these sampled zeros accurately representing the life history of the species or are they an artifact of sample size due and to naturally occurring low transition frequencies this should be considered within the context of the life history characteristics of the species we do not discuss how to build a matrix population model or an integral population model ipm as this information has been thoroughly discussed in the literature e g caswell 2001 ellner rees 2006 tremblay et al 2009a hernández suárez et al 2019 for our orchid model data set we know that small populations are the norm tremblay hutchings 2003 so we would expect that not all transitions and recruitment would be observed resulting in ppm with biologically incomplete and unrealistic transitions 2 2 parameterizing survival and growth shrinkage transitions a simple bayesian model of the transition probabilities is the multinomial dirichlet model where the observed data number of observed transitions between stages come from a multinomial distribution and a dirichlet prior distribution a multivariate generalization of the beta distribution is used for the transition probabilities we define transition probabilities as the change from stage i to stage j of the species life history the dirichlet is a conjugate prior for the multinomial so posterior distributions belong to the same family dirichlet and the posterior parameters are obtained by updating the parameters of the prior using observed data congdon 2005 frigyik et al 2010 the dirichlet distribution was proposed by peter gustave lejeune dirichlet in 1839 to study a problem in celestial mechanics dirichlet 1839 he also applied it to probability theory a historical perspective of this method is described by gupta and richards 2001 and a mathematical description can be found in kotz et al 2000 let for example p i p i 1 p i 2 p i k j 1 k p i j 1 be the vector of transition probabilities from stage i to stages 1 k the dirichlet prior for p i can be written as π p i 1 p i 2 p i k γ i 1 k α i j γ α i 1 γ α i 2 γ α i k p i 1 α i 1 1 p i 2 α i 2 1 p i k α i k 1 α i j 0 for all j 1 k let x i 1 x i 2 x i k be the observed transitions and n i j 1 k x i j then the distribution of the observed transitions is assumed to be multinomial with probabilities p i 1 p i 2 p i k f x i 1 x i 2 x i k p i 1 p i 2 p i k n i x i 1 x i 2 x i k p i 1 x i 1 p i 2 x i 2 p i k x i k finally the posterior distribution of the vector of transition probabilities given the observed transitions is also a dirichlet distribution with parameters α i 1 x i 1 α i 2 x i 2 α i k x i k the marginal posterior distribution of each p i j will be b e t a α i j x i j k j α i k x i k with posterior mean e p i j x i 1 x i k α i j x i j k 1 k α i k x i k for a different initial stage k with vector of transition probabilities p k k i the chosen model assumes that p i and p k will have independent prior dirichlet distributions the discussion presented here for one vector of transition probabilities can be extended to all of them note that the sum of the posterior means of the transition probabilities equals to one as expected and the joint distribution of the vector of transition probabilities guarantees that restriction an advantage of this approach is that the credible intervals are easily calculated they can be non symmetrical and are bounded by 0 1 additionally it can produce positive estimates even in the case of unobserved transitions rather than estimating the transition probability as 0 as with the maximum likelihood methods as for any bayesian approach the choice of prior distribution can influence the posterior distribution thus one of the challenges when using bayesian models is recognizing how the prior distribution influences the posterior distribution choy et al 2009 a general guide for assigning the parameters of the prior α i 1 α i k can be obtained by considering the α s as the prior number of observed transitions and n i 0 j 1 k α i j as the prior sample size diaconis and ylvisaker 1979 that is if we could observe n 1 0 transitions from stage 1 we would expect α 1 i of them to be transitions from stage 1 to stage i note that n i 0 represents how much weight we are willing to assign to our prior knowledge another way to see this is by rewriting α i j n i 0 p i j 0 where p i j 0 is the prior probability of each transition and n i 0 is again the prior sample size so we assign values for the probabilities of each transition using prior knowledge such as previous studies on the same or similar species and we decide how much weight we are willing to give to those prior assignments for example if our prior sample size n i 0 is equal to 100 then we are putting a lot of weight on the prior information we are very confident of the prior information while if n i 0 1 then in this case we are not putting a lot of confidence in our prior information note that in the latter case the prior information will be fractions which will sum to 1 conventional noninformative priors could also be used use of noninformative priors for ppm is likely to be inappropriate as we suspect that in all cases some prior information of the life history of species is known we show the impact of using noninformative priors to demonstrate how lack recognition of appropriate prior biases posteriors 2 3 parameterizing the reproductive transitions a matrix model also includes components for reproductive contributions to the seedling stage typically this is accounted for by dividing the transition matrix into two components a matrix t that describes the survival and growth transitions and a matrix f that describes transitions due to reproduction the full matrix is a t f in the present case we can only calculate anonymous reproduction because there is no way to associate a new seedling with any particular adult consequently we cannot calculate the fecundity mean and variance per individual our estimate is solely the total number of recruits over the total number of reproductive individuals for the specific population if we did have specific information on individual contributions to reproduction then we could use it to parametrize similar prior distributions however we might have additional options beyond the simple gamma prior for the poisson that we use here thus the only non zero entry in f is the top right which is given by the number of new seedlings divided by the number of adults present in the previous sample period the number of seedlings is in fact a binomial variable with the number of trials equal to the number of seeds produced in the previous sampling period however we do not have that information and in this species the probability of successful recruitment is very small so we can approximate the number of new recruits with a poisson distribution typically orchids produce thousands if not millions of seeds in each capsule and recruitment is spasmodic lepanthes eltoroensis has approximately 2000 to 5000 seeds per capsule rlt unpublished what we observe is a sum of poisson variables one for each adult which in turn is a poisson distribution with a rate equal to the sum of the rates of individual distributions in this case we aggregate fertility and offspring survival in l eltoroensis breeding fruit production occurs throughout the year so it does not fit easily within the pre breeding and post breeding scenarios okuyama 2019 our approach was to estimate the number of recruits at time t 1 as a function of number of fruits at time t consequently our estimate can be considered pre breeding the conjugate prior for a poisson distribution is a gamma distribution with hyperparameters α and β after observing n intervals and seeing i 1 n x i events the hyperparameters are α α i 1 n x i and β β n we interpret β as the number of adults observed and α as the total number of recruits observed the expected value is α β and the prior equivalent sample size n 0 β there are many possible noninformative priors a classic choice being g a m m a α ϵ β ϵ where ε is some very small value like 0 001 this has an expected value of 1 and a very large variance so that most of the probability is close to 0 with a long tail note that this prior is noninformative in the sense that a single observation will overwhelm it another possibility is the so called neutral prior g a m m a α 1 3 β 1 3 which has ½ the posterior probability above and ½ below the maximum likelihood estimate of the rate kerman 2011 2 4 types of priors evaluated to explore how the selection of prior parameters influences the posterior distribution we evaluated 1 population matrices with no prior 2 population matrices assuming noninformative dirichlet priors on transitions and noninformative gamma priors on fecundity 3 informative priors for both transitions and fecundity with a range of weights n i 0 we extracted the informative prior n i 0 from an expert on epiphytic orchids rlt to compare with the noninformative prior in particular we considered the effects of weighting the informative prior by different fractions of the actual sample size for each population and time period ideally this prior would be extracted before collecting the data using formal elicitation techniques mcbride et al 2012 in this case the prior is only being used to demonstrate the technique in addition we simulated matrices from the posterior distribution of the matrix entries and calculate λ for each matrix to get a posterior distribution of λ s 2 5 simulation studies we simulated the effects of different priors on a second plant species calathea ovandensis marantaceae from the work of horvitz and schemske 1995 they had 4 plots and up to 5 years of transitions as well as a pooled matrix many of the transitions are very small probabilities the pooled matrix is both ergodic and irreducible and has a population growth rate of 0 99 we randomly sampled a population from the 7 above ground stages in this matrix proportional to the stable stage distribution then we generated a fate from the appropriate column of the matrix and a reproductive contribution from a poisson distribution for reproductive stages this simulated stage fate table was converted into a projection matrix using standard methods caswell 2001 we then constructed confidence limits or credible intervals on the asymptotic growth rate for each simulated matrix using a non parametric bootstrap morris doak 2005 or by simulating matrices from the bayesian posteriors we generated 100 simulated stage fate tables for each combination of methods and sample sizes between 50 and 500 plants sampling directly from the stable stage distribution of calathea created numerical issues for the non parametric bootstrap because most observations were of seeds we followed the example in the r package popbio stubben and milligan 2007 and treated the seed stage as unobserved providing fixed transition rates to the bootstrap algorithm this is analogous to providing strong informative priors on the seed transition rates we evaluated three different prior distributions for the transition rates the base of all three priors was a uniform distribution on all transitions with estimates 0 in the pooled matrix and a total weight of 1 in the first scenario we modified the seed transition rate priors to be accurate with a weight of 1000 to be comparable with the strong and accurate information based on the published matrix provided to the bootstrap in the second scenario we left all priors at the base prior in the third scenario we set prior observations of transitions with rates 0 01 to zero and multiplied all the other transitions by 1 25 representing a 25 positive bias where this perturbation resulted in column totals 1 we set mortality transitions to 0 and renormalized the other rates in all three prior scenarios we used a g a m m a α 0 00001 β 0 99999 prior on reproduction from stages known to reproduce the analyses were performed using the package raretrans which is available on github https github com atyre2 raretrans results were visualized with the r package ggplot2 version 2 1 0 wickham 2009 vignettes are available in the package to replicate all of the analyses performed in this paper 3 results lepanthes example 3 1 frequency of missing transitions we monitored 23 populations and each were surveyed 12 times which results in 11 transition periods and 253 possible transition matrices there are 15 population period combinations missing because of difficulty in relocating some populations for a total of 238 matrices only 6 of these matrices are irreducible and 23 including the 6 irreducible matrices are ergodic all of the matrices have 2 or more transitions that have maximum likelihood estimates equal to zero but known to be possible and thus holey the average population growth rate over all times and populations is λ 0 90 s d 0 21 r a n g e 0 1 4 suggesting a rapid decline when the matrices are holey adding a noninformative prior for transitions makes all matrices irreducible and ergodic with a mean λ 0 89 s d 0 15 r a n g e 0 33 1 5 and with the rlt prior fig 1 and a n 1 0 prior sample size of 1 the mean population growth rate is λ 0 93 s d 0 12 r a n g e 0 25 1 2 3 2 effect of missing values on population growth rate estimates posterior point estimates of λ are generally consistent with estimates from the raw observations with a few notable exceptions fig 2 λ s calculated from holey matrices have two spikes at λ 0 and λ 1 both of these spikes arise because of the large number of non ergodic and or reducible matrices 3 3 addition of priors for parameterizing ppm adding any prior information leads to these anomalous values spreading out over a more limited range leading to the spikes in fig 2 holey matrices with λ 0 end up with posterior point estimates generally less than 1 increasing the weight on the informative prior causes the posterior point estimates to shrink towards λ 0 96 the value for the informative prior alone the effect of increasing the prior weights on the posterior transition probabilities is clearer when examining a few transitions from a single population and time period fig 3 table 1 increasing the weight on the prior reduces the width of the credible intervals and shifts the posterior mean towards the prior and away from the maximum likelihood estimate credible intervals for λ fig 4 are similar in shape but increasing the weight shrinks the dispersion of the posterior the probability that λ 1 decreases with increasing weight on the rlt prior indicating rlt is a pessimist 3 4 simulation study of calathea for each sample size n and method we generated 100 sets of n observations from the calathea matrix for each of these 100 simulated populations we either generated 1000 bootstrap resamples or 1000 simulations from the posterior distribution fig 5 shows the mean 2 5 quantile and 97 5 quantile of λ from the thousand resamples or simulations for n 50 to evaluate the effects of sample size we calculated the average width of the intervals as the difference between the 2 5 and 97 5 quantiles and the bias as the average distance between the mean λ and the true asymptotic growth rate λ each point in fig 6 summarizes data from one panel of fig 5 when accurate information on seed transition rates is available in the prior the bayesian posteriors outperform smaller average interval width and less bias a non parametric bootstrap at small sample sizes 100 individuals fig 6 bootstrap vs simulation using a weak implied sample size of n i 0 1 and conditionally uniform prior on transitions out of the seed stage causes the interval width to expand and introduces a large positive bias fig 6 sim2 these effects do not decrease with sample size because by design the simulated data provides no information on seeds this problem disappears fig 6 sim3 when using a prior that is relatively accurate i e seed juvenile is smaller than seed seedling even if weak and biased even when the biased prior is sufficiently weak small sample sizes lead to unbiased posterior estimates the posterior retains a slight positive bias 95 credible interval includes zero relative to the bootstrap because of the lack of information on seed transitions 4 discussion uncertainty in vital rate parameter estimates should be small for the species and conditions under consideration unfortunately on many occasions transition events may simply fail to occur during the survey period the population projection matrices constructed from these data often result in reducible matrices stott et al 2010b using the dirichlet distribution to parameterize the matrices all of the matrices complied with being irreducible and ergodic regardless of the choice of prior the posterior distribution of each parameter follows a beta distribution from which it is possible to appreciate the amount of uncertainty for each of the parameters which could be considered an evaluation of demographic variance in addition evaluating environmental variance in rare species is often exacerbated by small sample size or some unobserved life history transitions thus inclusion of priors to estimate posterior transition probabilities offers a method of considering demographic and environmental variance in species with limited amounts of data 4 1 impact of choice of priors on ppm the weight we assign to the priors can influence the posterior distribution when we give large weight to our prior information and observed sample sizes are small then the prior can dominate the inference we would not recommend selecting a prior sample size equivalent or larger than the actual sample size as it would dominate the data a possible exception would arise when the priors come from the analysis of previous data obtained under identical conditions and that are not themselves holey if there is any suspicion that conditions have changed in time or vary in space the prior weight should be reduced below the observed sample size the selection of the prior parameters should be undertaken carefully before data collection starts as this could reduce bias in prior selection in other words any information from the literature or other sources before data collection might be useful for estimating priors and should be considered a priori to the analysis otherwise there is a risk that the observations themselves would affect the development of the priors we believe that informative priors are more useful than ignoring the effects of holey matrices or using informative priors but a low weight n i 0 prior sample size should be used our simulation study further confirmed the value of low weight informative priors even when the prior was biased the effects were small because of the low weight assigned to the prior distributions using a conditionally uniform priors positive values on transitions known to occur leads to strong positive bias when used on a stage with no empirical information 4 2 advantages of the multinomial dirichlet distribution when one uses the multinomial dirichlet distribution to deal with holey matrices there are several clear advantages which are as follows 1 provides more biologically accurate transition estimates when events are not observed or observed transition events are infrequent this can produce estimates even in the case of unobserved transitions 2 credible intervals on parameter estimates are bounded by 0 and 1 thereby avoiding biologically unrealistic values e g p 0 5 3 reproducibility of posterior estimates are possible by explicitly reporting the number of transitions stasis and recruitment fertility rates observed and the priors used 4 this method does not require sophisticated statistics such as hierarchical bayesian models fitted by markov chain monte carlo 5 using a bayesian approach starting with the parameter estimation of the ppm up to the pva propagates the parameter uncertainty through the projection and is likely to result in more accurate formulation of management criteria taylor et al 1996 goodman 2002 furthermore inclusion of rare transitions by using the multinomial dirichlet approach would make elasticity analyses more precise because this analysis only recognizes non zero matrix entries caswell 2001 thus holey matrices may result in inaccurate elasticities and ultimately extinction probabilities the latter are derived from measures affecting the stochastic growth rate whilst the deterministic growth rate will usually be unchanged unless sample size is small which is usually the case for rare species the non parametric bootstrap alternative does not solve the problems of matrices with holes caused by sampling zeros as in the case of calathea the bootstrap only works if we assume accurate knowledge of the transitions in the seed stage even if we did have such information for example from germination experiments presently available software produces overly optimistic estimates of precision by ignoring sampling variation in these transitions our method seamlessly incorporates such external information and preserves the uncertainty associated with those estimates 4 3 limitation to the approach despite the advantages one challenge still remains when observed sample sizes are small and knowledge of priors is absent or confidence in the priors is low if sample size for the whole study is small then we recommend that priors be selected with caution and simulations be performed to get a grasp of the influence of the priors on the posterior distribution we also suggest varying the parameters of the priors sensitivity analysis to clarify doubts about the effect of the choice of priors on the posteriors a common alternative parameterization of ppm s breaks the column of transitions to other stages into 2 distinct probabilities s the probability of surviving to the next census and a vector p with entries that describe the probability of transitioning to other stages including the probability of remaining in the same stage unfortunately we are not aware of a closed form for the prior on the transformed parameter however the survival and transition probabilities can be combined into the multinomial form that we use so this is not a serious limitation of our method 5 conclusions the multinomial dirichlet approach adds to the tools for estimating transition probabilities and should be implemented for estimating central tendencies and credible intervals of parameters and for evaluating transitions of rare and unobserved events calculation of parameter estimates should be explicit and observed transitions and priors should be shown in publications access to the raw data at least the number of observed transitions would open up the opportunity for data to be reanalyzed when additional data is collected or alternative priors are available while this approach can be used under any circumstances for estimating transitions the advantages are especially clear when transitions are not observed or infrequently so the approach presented here can be applied to ppm age and stage based and extended to ipm structured models of any size furthermore it is particularly useful when developing management strategies for rare and endangered species whose demographic data often suffer from small sample sizes and transition gaps with much at stake the mathematically explicit and reproducible approach of the multinomial dirichlet model for estimating the parameters included in the population projections is highly desirable for attaining more biologically realistic

24643,the ability to predict changes in the abundances of the species in ecological communities is essential for sustainable management biodiversity conservation and community restoration we propose a framework to predict such changes we test our method which uses the linear lotka volterra equations llve as well as other empirical predictors linear least squares regression quadratic extrapolation simple exponential smoothing against the measured abundances of trees from the long term 50 ha plot on barro colorado island bci along eight censuses to obtain the parameters of the llve the intrinsic growth rate r and the carrying capacity k of each species and the interspecific interaction matrix a we first estimate a through the maximum entropy maxent method next using a as input we fit r and k then feeding the llve with these parameters we obtain predicted species trajectories along censuses since for this particular community the interspecific interaction coefficients are much smaller than the intraspecific ones keeping only intraspecific competition is enough to predict the evolution of the abundances of several tree species i e the llve reduce to a set of uncoupled logistic equations however this simplification is not a requirement of the method we define p values to establish when the predicted trajectory for a species is statistically significant this is crucial in determining the set of species over which a particular predictor can be meaningfully applied to illustrate a possible application of the method we present our predictions for the abundances of tree species for the currently underway bci 2020 census which provide warnings regarding species that are likely to experience important population loss keywords prediction of changes in species abundances tropical forest dynamics quantitative community ecology time series forecasting 1 introduction understanding the abundance and distribution of species at large spatial and temporal scales is the focus of macroecology brown and maurer 1989 blackburn and gaston 1998 indeed abundance is one of the most important measures of species conservation status hui et al 2001 estimates of species abundances are useful to understand community structure gaston and blackburn 2000 for monitoring changes in biodiversity wilson et al 2004 and is the state variable of interest in most population level ecological research and in most programs involving management and conservation of populations nichols and mackenzie 2004 therefore it is hard to overstate the usefulness of any efficient technique of forecasting the variation of species abundances for biodiversity conservation especially given global environmental change brook et al 2008 in a recent paper on the demographic trends and climate over 35 years in the long term 50 ha plot on barro colorado island bci panama condit et al 2017 notice that the bci forest has exhibited considerable dynamism in this period this 50 ha plot was established in 1981 and fully censused in 1982 then every 5 years from 1985 through 2015 all stems 1 cm diameter at breast height dbh were mapped measured and identified to species in each census the tree community has been in taxonomic nonequilibrium with many species abundances fluctuating over 35 years with no known cause condit et al 2017 the degree of stability in ecological communities is related to a major debate regarding whether species coexistence emerges from equilibrium niche partitioning or from non equilibrium stochastic dispersal assembly clark and mclachlan 2003 ishida et al 2003 according to the first hypothesis in a community at equilibrium each species occupies a different niche that results from and reduces direct competition whittaker 1975 stabilizing mechanisms like tradeoffs between species in terms of their capacities to disperse to sites where competition is weak to exploit abundant resources effectively and to compete for scarce resources clark and mclachlan 2003 play an important role the size of each species niche is determined by abiotic or biotic factors such as resource constraints or predators therefore if a species becomes too common its per capita growth rate declines because of resource limitation or increased predation conversely if it becomes too rare its per capita growth rate increases hence niche stabilization is synonym of negative density dependence alternatively the dispersal assembly hypothesis assumes that communities are open nonequilibrium assemblages of species that coexist only transiently by chance history and random dispersal rather than by the stabilizing effects of niche differentiation regarded as superfluous hubbell 2008 2009 this neutral model thus emphasizes equalizing mechanisms chesson 2000 because competitive exclusion of similar species is slow the relative importance of stabilizing and equalizing mechanisms in real communities is unknown here we propose a general series forecasting method to predict future species abundances based on the time discrete lotka volterra equations pastor 2008 fort 2020 we use the bci forest as a case study to test this method for the tree community of the 50 ha bci plot the interaction strengths between species were indirectly estimated by volkov et al 2009 using the principle of maximum entropy maxent jaynes 1957 2003 for the first census they found that the effects of the pairwise interspecific interaction coefficients are generally much smaller than the intraspecific ones by approximately an order of magnitude using the same maxent recipe we found that the interspecific interaction coefficients are much smaller than the intraspecific ones for the eight bci censuses see si although this is not a general result it was empirically found through competition experiments and field studies that pairwise interspecific interaction strengths are tend to be weak compared with the intraspecific ones for plants adler et al 2018 and a quite common finding across taxonomic groups fort and segura 2018 therefore neglecting the interspecific interaction coefficients is a sensible approximation for the bci tree community leading to a series of uncoupled logistic growth equations one for each species firstly we show that this set of equations can explain the overall evolution of the abundances of species that make up the community of trees in the bci plot secondly we demonstrate that our method leads to statistically significant predictions for the trajectories of several of the species their sequence of abundances over censuses thirdly we show that using alternative purely phenomenological fits we can obtain additional statistically significant predictions for the trajectories of many species in which the logistic growth model fails we conclude with our predictions for the abundances of 77 tree species for the future census to be held in bci in 2020 as well as warning signals regarding some species that are likely to experience important population loss 2 materials and methods 2 1 prediction of future species trajectories from time series of empirically observed abundances the procedure to predict future species trajectories is based on a novel general method based on the generalized linear lotka volterra equations pastor 2008 fort 2020 supplemented with three different empirical fitting predictors commonly used in time series forecasting these additional predictors serve both to assess the goodness of the method for each species and to use them for such species in which the method fails therefore we start with the proposed method predictor i below and then we select those species whose trajectories validate the method for the other species me do the same with each of the empirical fittings predictors ii to iv this allows to classify most of the species into different sets according which predictor best reproduces their trajectories in fact there are species which belong to more than one of these sets then we apply the prediction methods and compare predictions i the linear lotka volterra finite difference equations for describing s interacting tree species are 1 n i c 1 n i c r i n i c 1 j 1 s α i j c n j c k i where i denotes the tree species number ni c is the density dimensions of individuals area 1 for the census c ri is the intrinsic growth rate with dimension time 1 ki 0 is the carrying capacity individuals area 1 i e the maximum density of individuals that the environment can sustain indefinitely for this species alone and αij c is the interaction coefficient quantifying the effect of species j on species i for census c a negative positive αij reflects a competitive facilitative interaction of species j on species i namely the abundance of the i th species decreases increases with the increase of abundance of the j th species for each census to estimate the interaction matrix a αij c we proceed as in volkov et al 2009 and used the maxent principle jaynes 1957 2003 the idea of this principle is setting up the least biased probability distribution the one that maximizes the shannon information entropy on the basis of partial knowledge or constraints we have on a system if one of such constraints is that we know the covariance matrix c this maximization implies that the interaction matrix between species is given by a c 1 see supporting information si to compute c we divided the 50 ha bci plot into equally sized quadrats of side l thus for each quadrat we have a vector of abundances n 1 n 2 and averaging over these quadrats with the probability distribution p n 1 n 2 we obtained c cij n i n j n i n j we used time series forecasting to estimate parameters ri and ki of equations 1 for all species as well as to validate our method in time series forecasting it is customary first to partition the data series of length t into an earlier training period t 1 2 ttr and a later validation period t ttr 1 t the training period is used to estimate the parameters of the model and then the model with estimated parameters is used to generate forecasts to be compared with data corresponding to the validation period to assess the predictive performance of a model on new data shmueli and lichtendahl 2016 varying the training period ttr allows one to develop multiple model instances the validation partition is used to assess the performance of each model so that we can compare models and pick the best one to estimate ri and ki the general recipe is 1 we first rewrite eq 1 as 2 n i c 1 n i c n i c r i k i j 1 s α i j c n j c r i 2 for each species i we can use the empirical densities which thereafter we will denote as n i e with the superscript e to distinguish them from the theoretical ones for the training period c 1 2 ctr to evaluate both sides of eq 2 let us define 3 a y i c n i e c 1 n i e c n i e c 3 b x i c j 1 s α i j c n j e c in such a way that eq 2 becomes the equation of a straight line with slope ri ki and intercept ri 1 from these ctr values since the numerator of yi in eq 2 involves a difference between consecutive censuses we get ctr 1 points in the xi yi plane fig s6 in si to estimate ri and ri ki we apply a least squares fitting since several of the 328 species recorded in the bci plot have very low abundances their xi c and yi c exhibit drastic variations therefore to make this fitting meaningful we require a minimum density n min e i e only those s species such that n i e c n min e for all c are taken into account see table 2 2 for each of these species i 1 s since the species carrying capacity by definition must be positive we only take into account thus species with ki 0 which are the great majority as shown in table s4 once we have obtained the model parameters from the training set of data we can compare the abundances generated by the model against the empirical abundances of the validation set starting with n i c t r n i e c t r the subsequent theoretical abundances are generated via eq 1 as 4 n i c 1 n i c r i n i c 1 j 1 s α i j n j c k i c c t r 8 eq 4 combined with eq 3 b constitutes the basis of the lotka volterra predictor in fact for the eight bci censuses we found that the interspecific interaction coefficients αij i j are much smaller than the intraspecific ones see si we checked that including these off diagonal elements of the interaction matrix do not change the accuracy of the predictions for bci see si when turning off the interspecific interactions and taking αii 1 the lotka volterra predictor reduces to a logistic predictor i e equations 3 b and 4 simplify respectively to 3 b x i c n i e c 4 n i c 1 n i c r i n i c 1 n i c k i c c t r 8 as mentioned we also consider three empirical extrapolations of abundance data that are commonly used in time series forecasting i a linear least squares lls regression ii simple exponential smoothing ses on the abundance increment the abundance increment for all censuses beyond the training period is taken as constant and equal to δni α δni e c tr α 1 α δni e c tr 1 α 1 α 2 this is a sort of linear extrapolation but with weights such that the older values are gradually forgotten by the predictor rather than fitting α for each species we found α 0 2 gives good results for many species iii a second order polynomial fitting in the census number c i e ni c αic 2 βic γi in the same way as we did for the logistic model the parameters of predictors ii and iii are estimated using the training period 2 2 global accuracy metrics a commonly used metric for characterizing a model s predictive capabilities is the coefficient of determination r 2 to assess how well our method explains globally the abundances of all species of trees we considered the three more stringent error accuracy metrics summarized in table 1 for more details about these metrics and why we prefer them over r 2 as measures of global accuracy see si 2 3 significance test for trajectories for individual species in addition to measuring the accuracy of abundance predictions by means of the above three global metrics we performed a basic significance test for each predicted species trajectory this significance test with the p value can identify species for which the particular procedure yields better predictions than would be expected simply by chance this test consists of reshuffling the time series data for each species its ctr k 1 k 8 ctr measures of abundance to obtain a statistical ensemble of artificial data including the whole ctr k permutations for example in the case of the longest trajectories ctr k 8 we have 8 40 320 permutations then the relative error for the prediction on the randomized series is calculated and the results are compared to that obtained from the original time series the p value of each species trajectory for a given validation period is computed as the number of times the error of model predictions for the randomly shuffled series is smaller than the error for predictions corresponding to the actually observed series the prediction is selected as significant when the p value is low i e when the model is sensitive to the temporal trends which are destroyed by permutation we did this test for the logistic method as well as for the three fits we considered thus for each of these four models we obtained a different set of species with statistically significant trajectories at the 95 percent confidence level of course in general there is overlap of species among these sets i e species whose trajectories were significant for more than one model 3 results when we use the method without restriction to the whole tree species for a given abundance threshold n min e its accuracy is not good that is we use as a null model the abundances kept constant at the value measured at ctr then the mape of predictions is comparable to the mape of the null model for the immediate next censuses but then it becomes much worse e g for n min e 0 4 and ctr 4 the mape of logistic predictions for censuses c 5 8 are 13 0 23 4 44 4 and 93 5 respectively this has to be compared with the percentage mean absolute variations of abundances respect to census ctr given by 11 0 16 8 22 0 and 29 3 for c 5 8 thus we analyzed what happens when for each series of ctr k with k between 1 and 8 ctr censuses we use the method restricted to the subset of species such that their trajectories along these ctr k censuses are significant at the 95 percent confidence level for these subsets the method works as expected well the produced mape becomes much smaller than the one yielded by the null model table 2 shows the mape produced by the logistic method as well as for the three fits we considered and the null model for different training periods ctr and different values of the abundance threshold n min e notice that in most of the cases the mape of all model predictions for the next census i e five years ahead are between 1 and 2 compared with several times this percentage for the null model as expected a for a given training period the mape almost systematically increases for predictions from one census to the next this is particularly the case for the three fits different from the logistic model b increasing the training period also generally reduces the mape this is particularly apparent by looking at the last column for ctr 7 the pattern when decreasing the threshold n min e i e moving downward along columns is less clear it seems that the best results are obtained for n min e 1 therefore we take this as the default case that we will study in more detail the logistic predictor fares better that the others in the sense that for the set of species for which it gives significant predictions it achieves a lower mape table 2 shows that in 16 out of 42 predictions the logistic model is able to predict with lower mape with respect to the other procedures however note that the mapes in table 2 for different predictors are computed over different sets of species see table 4 on the other hand when considering predictions for individual species there are instances where one of the other empirical fits leads to a better prediction lower relative error than the logistic growth model fig 1 the modified coefficient of efficiency and index of agreement are also consistent with high levels of accuracy converging toward values close to 1 as shown in table 3 we show results only for the logistic model but the alternative three models produce similar results obviously the prediction performance also decreases as we increase the time window we are forecasting into the future finally table 4 shows for each cell of tables 2 and 3 the number of species whose trajectories were significant at the 95 confidence level for the three methods for instance the statistical significance test for individual species trajectories for n min e 1 ha 1 yielded for 50 out of the 170 tree species p value 0 05 using ctr 7 indeed for some species more than one of the predictors the logistic supplemented with the linear and quadratic fits yielded a p value 0 05 in these cases to untie we took the prediction of the predictor with smaller relative error therefore significant predictions of trajectories for half of these species 23 are obtained through the logistic growth model see table 5 in next section 4 discussion 4 1 method validation to put our method in perspective the calculation by volkov et al 2009 can be helpful the authors assuming that the tree community of bci plot is in steady state obtained estimates for the abundances of the 20 most abundant tree species in 1982 at bci i e just a single time point they were able to predict the abundances of some species with accuracy but failed badly for other species on average the mape was 86 the method we are proposing in the case of bci also neglects the interspecific interactions however it has remarkable differences firstly our approach doesn t require the assumption that the community is in a steady state by default it is not rather populations seem to be in constant turmoil actually there are several species whose abundances are clearly not in a steady state fig 1 fig s1 secondly and most importantly our method thus allows forecasting future abundances i e species trajectories and it works not just for the most abundant species but for many of them thirdly we can predict the abundances of several species with small errors 15 to 20 years into the future for several species in particular the mape for predictions five and ten years ahead is generally between 1 and 2 3 see table 2 numbers in black bold face these results are consistent with values of the modified coefficient of efficiency and index of agreement very close to 1 e 1 0 98 and d 1 0 99 tables 2 and 3 show that as expected our method yields the most accurate results for the longest possible training period of ctr 7 namely a mape of at most 1 2 and e 1 and d 1 always above 0 99 4 2 species consistent with a steady state are more the exception than the rule only a small fraction of the 170 species with a minimum density of n min e 1 ha 1 might be considered in a steady state with variations not significantly different from 0 see table s4 this is in consonance with the observed compositional change of the bci forest over the past 35 years condit et al 2017 the estimated carrying capacities for 155 out of these 170 species are 0 and roughly half of the species 74 have abundances that in the last census 2015 differ in 10 of their k i table s4 interestingly half of the species exhibit oscillations around their estimated carrying capacities along the 8 censuses table s5 it is worth noting that the species carrying capacities ki are parameters that are far from trivial to estimate from empirical data for a community as complex as the set of trees of a tropical forest including hundreds of species a straightforward procedure to estimate ri and ki for each species is performing the corresponding monoculture experiment in which the species is completely isolated from all the other species making up the community vandermer 1969 this seems not feasible for obvious practical reasons it is encouraging that the estimated carrying capacities are of the order to the ones estimated by fung et al 2016 for the bci forest nevertheless the values provided by our method for the logistic parameters ri and ki at most serve to provide information on ongoing general trends they should not to be considered as reliable estimates of their true values even when the abundances are accurately predicted since both estimates seem to be strongly correlated there can be compensations between them what drives species out from their steady state ni ki two classes of stochasticity that operate in ecological communities and may cause fluctuations in species abundances are demographic variance and temporal environmental variance chisholm et al 2014 fung et al 2016 demographic variance comprises demographic stochasticity which refers to variability in population growth arising from the discreteness of individuals and the random nature of birth and death processes in populations of finite size and demographic heterogeneity which arises when birth and death rates of individuals within a population vary by age size genotype etc temporal environmental variance arises from the effect of random variation in environmental conditions over time on the demographic rates of species these environmental changes include both fluctuations in abiotic factors such as fluctuations in rainfall temperature fire and in biotic factors e g abundance of pests at bci a major driver of tree abundance changes over the last 30 yr has been climate hubbell 2011 such random perturbations could certainly trigger oscillations of ni around ki there are several candidates among multiannual known climate oscillations baldwin et al 2001 bruun et al 2017 newman et al 2016 observed non monotonically changes of the estimated ki for many species when varying the training period ctr table s5 might reflect forced oscillations modulating the carrying capacities indeed using time dependent carrying capacities has long been recognized necessary to model population dynamics in environments that undergo change cushing 1986 shepherd and stojkov 2007 such time dependent carrying capacities have been used to model from fish population dynamics ikeda and yokoi 1980 to seasonal variations of available grass in grassland livestock production systems dieguez and fort 2017 and microbial biomass safuan et al 2011 the considerable compositional change in relative species abundances has been interpreted before hubbel 2011 as inconsistent with stabilizing forces which would rather imply fluctuations around fixed carrying capacities however this new analysis with the advantage of the availability of three new additional censuses suggests the possibility that the carrying capacities ki themselves could have been fluctuating strongly painting a picture more consistent with stabilizing forces 4 3 comparison of the different predictors we found p value 0 05 for the predicted trajectories by at least by one of the methods of 77 out of 170 species for n e min 1 0 90 out of 204 species for n e min 0 4 interestingly they can be classified into three classes according to the type of trajectory followed by n i e c which roughly coincide with the model producing the best prediction i for species such that n i e c grows or decreases more or less monotonically with a change in convexity the logistic growth method is generally the best predictor e g cassipourea elliptica psychotria horizontalis figs 1 a 1 c ii for species such that n i e c shows in addition to a global minimum maximum another local minimum maximum the ses or lls turn out to be the best predictors e g cecropia insignis tabernaemontana arborea figs 1 g 1 h the ability of ses to adapt to changing slope makes it often superior to lls and it can sometimes be slightly better than logistic or quadratic even in species for which these have p values below threshold iii for species such that n i e c is parabolic as expected the quadratic fit is the best predictor e g acalypha diversifolia fig 1 e which is the best predictor depends on how one chooses to measure the goodness of the predictions according to intended use in any case it is clear that none of the four predictors can be applied blindly the good below null model mapes we have obtained with the different predictors apply only to a subset of species which we again emphasize is different for each predictor crucial in choosing this set is the use of the p value which can detect when the prediction is significantly better than pure chance if one uses just one predictor on the whole set of species the mapes obtained are rather poor i e not better than the null model for all predictors the ses is rather successful in the sense that it is the predictor which has the largest number of species at a significant level of prediction for the 8th census using the first 7 as training and for this reason dominates table 5 below however it can only remain successful over longer periods for species that show a sustained linear trend since by construction it predicts a fixed δn it is probably more useful when trying to predict a few years ahead using a relatively long history in contrast the logistic method tends to give lower mapes over its own set of significant predictions at variance with the other predictors which are of empirical nature the logistic predictor is based on theoretical expectations and its fit parameters have a theoretical interpretation although it must be stressed that it is harder to obtain good estimation of the logistic parameters than it is to obtain a good prediction with this form this is due to interaction between the logistic parameters which can lead to two logistic functions with different parameters but making very similar abundance predictions especially in the short term 4 4 on the generality of the method and its limitations regarding the generality of the method it is worth remarking that the requirement of negligibility of interspecific interactions is not mandatory indeed in the general case of communities where interspecific interactions are important the lotka volterra predictor in terms of the full interaction matrix has to be used that is the pair of general equations 3 b and 4 rather than the simpler 3 b and 4 predict the species trajectories in the same way as we have done for bci the extra work is that one has to estimate the full matrix of interspecific coefficients either from experiments in cases in which this is feasible fort 2018 vandermeer 1969 or by other methods like maxent as we did here see si nevertheless a limitation of the method at least for the bci dataset is that it yields accurate predictions of future abundances only for the fraction of species whose trajectories during the training period are significant at the 95 percent confidence level e g for a training period ctr 7 for 50 out of the 170 species we have above a density threshold of n min e 1 ha 1 increasing the number of censuses ctr employed to fit the parameters ri and ki consistently improves the accuracy of our forecasting method this suggests that having additional data from future censuses will probably enhance the method accuracy 5 conclusion let us conclude with our predictions for the above set of 77 species including some warnings about possible species crashes the final model to forecast future values requires to recombine the training and validation periods into one series and estimate the model parameters ri and ki for these complete dataset i e taking ctr 8 table 5 shows predicted species abundances for the future 9 census to be held in 2020 the whole list for 170 species with a density of at least 1 tree ha 1 is in table s6 notice some yellow red light signals in table 5 of species for which we predict important losses in population by 2020 in particular for psychotria horizontalis this drop is of one third in consonance with a large negative growth coefficient r 0 45 compared with the mean over species r 0 34 table s4 for one species in table 5 poulsenia armata the fitted k parameter we obtained through the logistic method is negative si however we included this species because it has exhibited a drastic declining in its abundance along the eight censuses and a negative k might be interpreted as a serious warning of this observed population decreasing trend declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

macroecology brown and maurer 1989 blackburn and gaston 1998 indeed abundance is one of the most important measures of species conservation status hui et al 2001 estimates of species abundances are useful to understand community structure gaston and blackburn 2000 for monitoring changes in biodiversity wilson et al 2004 and is the state variable of interest in most population level ecological research and in most programs involving management and conservation of populations nichols and mackenzie 2004 therefore it is hard to overstate the usefulness of any efficient technique of forecasting the variation of species abundances for biodiversity conservation especially given global environmental change brook et al 2008 in a recent paper on the demographic trends and climate over 35 years in the long term 50 ha plot on barro colorado island bci panama condit et al 2017 notice that the bci forest has exhibited considerable dynamism in this period this 50 ha plot was established in 1981 and fully censused in 1982 then every 5 years from 1985 through 2015 all stems 1 cm diameter at breast height dbh were mapped measured and identified to species in each census the tree community has been in taxonomic nonequilibrium with many species abundances fluctuating over 35 years with no known cause condit et al 2017 the degree of stability in ecological communities is related to a major debate regarding whether species coexistence emerges from equilibrium niche partitioning or from non equilibrium stochastic dispersal assembly clark and mclachlan 2003 ishida et al 2003 according to the first hypothesis in a community at equilibrium each species occupies a different niche that results from and reduces direct competition whittaker 1975 stabilizing mechanisms like tradeoffs between species in terms of their capacities to disperse to sites where competition is weak to exploit abundant resources effectively and to compete for scarce resources clark and mclachlan 2003 play an important role the size of each species niche is determined by abiotic or biotic factors such as resource constraints or predators therefore if a species becomes too common its per capita growth rate declines because of resource limitation or increased predation conversely if it becomes too rare its per capita growth rate increases hence niche stabilization is synonym of negative density dependence alternatively the dispersal assembly hypothesis assumes that communities are open nonequilibrium assemblages of species that coexist only transiently by chance history and random dispersal rather than by the stabilizing effects of niche differentiation regarded as superfluous hubbell 2008 2009 this neutral model thus emphasizes equalizing mechanisms chesson 2000 because competitive exclusion of similar species is slow the relative importance of stabilizing and equalizing mechanisms in real communities is unknown here we propose a general series forecasting method to predict future species abundances based on the time discrete lotka volterra equations pastor 2008 fort 2020 we use the bci forest as a case study to test this method for the tree community of the 50 ha bci plot the interaction strengths between species were indirectly estimated by volkov et al 2009 using the principle of maximum entropy maxent jaynes 1957 2003 for the first census they found that the effects of the pairwise interspecific interaction coefficients are generally much smaller than the intraspecific ones by approximately an order of magnitude using the same maxent recipe we found that the interspecific interaction coefficients are much smaller than the intraspecific ones for the eight bci censuses see si although this is not a general result it was empirically found through competition experiments and field studies that pairwise interspecific interaction strengths are tend to be weak compared with the intraspecific ones for plants adler et al 2018 and a quite common finding across taxonomic groups fort and segura 2018 therefore neglecting the interspecific interaction coefficients is a sensible approximation for the bci tree community leading to a series of uncoupled logistic growth equations one for each species firstly we show that this set of equations can explain the overall evolution of the abundances of species that make up the community of trees in the bci plot secondly we demonstrate that our method leads to statistically significant predictions for the trajectories of several of the species their sequence of abundances over censuses thirdly we show that using alternative purely phenomenological fits we can obtain additional statistically significant predictions for the trajectories of many species in which the logistic growth model fails we conclude with our predictions for the abundances of 77 tree species for the future census to be held in bci in 2020 as well as warning signals regarding some species that are likely to experience important population loss 2 materials and methods 2 1 prediction of future species trajectories from time series of empirically observed abundances the procedure to predict future species trajectories is based on a novel general method based on the generalized linear lotka volterra equations pastor 2008 fort 2020 supplemented with three different empirical fitting predictors commonly used in time series forecasting these additional predictors serve both to assess the goodness of the method for each species and to use them for such species in which the method fails therefore we start with the proposed method predictor i below and then we select those species whose trajectories validate the method for the other species me do the same with each of the empirical fittings predictors ii to iv this allows to classify most of the species into different sets according which predictor best reproduces their trajectories in fact there are species which belong to more than one of these sets then we apply the prediction methods and compare predictions i the linear lotka volterra finite difference equations for describing s interacting tree species are 1 n i c 1 n i c r i n i c 1 j 1 s α i j c n j c k i where i denotes the tree species number ni c is the density dimensions of individuals area 1 for the census c ri is the intrinsic growth rate with dimension time 1 ki 0 is the carrying capacity individuals area 1 i e the maximum density of individuals that the environment can sustain indefinitely for this species alone and αij c is the interaction coefficient quantifying the effect of species j on species i for census c a negative positive αij reflects a competitive facilitative interaction of species j on species i namely the abundance of the i th species decreases increases with the increase of abundance of the j th species for each census to estimate the interaction matrix a αij c we proceed as in volkov et al 2009 and used the maxent principle jaynes 1957 2003 the idea of this principle is setting up the least biased probability distribution the one that maximizes the shannon information entropy on the basis of partial knowledge or constraints we have on a system if one of such constraints is that we know the covariance matrix c this maximization implies that the interaction matrix between species is given by a c 1 see supporting information si to compute c we divided the 50 ha bci plot into equally sized quadrats of side l thus for each quadrat we have a vector of abundances n 1 n 2 and averaging over these quadrats with the probability distribution p n 1 n 2 we obtained c cij n i n j n i n j we used time series forecasting to estimate parameters ri and ki of equations 1 for all species as well as to validate our method in time series forecasting it is customary first to partition the data series of length t into an earlier training period t 1 2 ttr and a later validation period t ttr 1 t the training period is used to estimate the parameters of the model and then the model with estimated parameters is used to generate forecasts to be compared with data corresponding to the validation period to assess the predictive performance of a model on new data shmueli and lichtendahl 2016 varying the training period ttr allows one to develop multiple model instances the validation partition is used to assess the performance of each model so that we can compare models and pick the best one to estimate ri and ki the general recipe is 1 we first rewrite eq 1 as 2 n i c 1 n i c n i c r i k i j 1 s α i j c n j c r i 2 for each species i we can use the empirical densities which thereafter we will denote as n i e with the superscript e to distinguish them from the theoretical ones for the training period c 1 2 ctr to evaluate both sides of eq 2 let us define 3 a y i c n i e c 1 n i e c n i e c 3 b x i c j 1 s α i j c n j e c in such a way that eq 2 becomes the equation of a straight line with slope ri ki and intercept ri 1 from these ctr values since the numerator of yi in eq 2 involves a difference between consecutive censuses we get ctr 1 points in the xi yi plane fig s6 in si to estimate ri and ri ki we apply a least squares fitting since several of the 328 species recorded in the bci plot have very low abundances their xi c and yi c exhibit drastic variations therefore to make this fitting meaningful we require a minimum density n min e i e only those s species such that n i e c n min e for all c are taken into account see table 2 2 for each of these species i 1 s since the species carrying capacity by definition must be positive we only take into account thus species with ki 0 which are the great majority as shown in table s4 once we have obtained the model parameters from the training set of data we can compare the abundances generated by the model against the empirical abundances of the validation set starting with n i c t r n i e c t r the subsequent theoretical abundances are generated via eq 1 as 4 n i c 1 n i c r i n i c 1 j 1 s α i j n j c k i c c t r 8 eq 4 combined with eq 3 b constitutes the basis of the lotka volterra predictor in fact for the eight bci censuses we found that the interspecific interaction coefficients αij i j are much smaller than the intraspecific ones see si we checked that including these off diagonal elements of the interaction matrix do not change the accuracy of the predictions for bci see si when turning off the interspecific interactions and taking αii 1 the lotka volterra predictor reduces to a logistic predictor i e equations 3 b and 4 simplify respectively to 3 b x i c n i e c 4 n i c 1 n i c r i n i c 1 n i c k i c c t r 8 as mentioned we also consider three empirical extrapolations of abundance data that are commonly used in time series forecasting i a linear least squares lls regression ii simple exponential smoothing ses on the abundance increment the abundance increment for all censuses beyond the training period is taken as constant and equal to δni α δni e c tr α 1 α δni e c tr 1 α 1 α 2 this is a sort of linear extrapolation but with weights such that the older values are gradually forgotten by the predictor rather than fitting α for each species we found α 0 2 gives good results for many species iii a second order polynomial fitting in the census number c i e ni c αic 2 βic γi in the same way as we did for the logistic model the parameters of predictors ii and iii are estimated using the training period 2 2 global accuracy metrics a commonly used metric for characterizing a model s predictive capabilities is the coefficient of determination r 2 to assess how well our method explains globally the abundances of all species of trees we considered the three more stringent error accuracy metrics summarized in table 1 for more details about these metrics and why we prefer them over r 2 as measures of global accuracy see si 2 3 significance test for trajectories for individual species in addition to measuring the accuracy of abundance predictions by means of the above three global metrics we performed a basic significance test for each predicted species trajectory this significance test with the p value can identify species for which the particular procedure yields better predictions than would be expected simply by chance this test consists of reshuffling the time series data for each species its ctr k 1 k 8 ctr measures of abundance to obtain a statistical ensemble of artificial data including the whole ctr k permutations for example in the case of the longest trajectories ctr k 8 we have 8 40 320 permutations then the relative error for the prediction on the randomized series is calculated and the results are compared to that obtained from the original time series the p value of each species trajectory for a given validation period is computed as the number of times the error of model predictions for the randomly shuffled series is smaller than the error for predictions corresponding to the actually observed series the prediction is selected as significant when the p value is low i e when the model is sensitive to the temporal trends which are destroyed by permutation we did this test for the logistic method as well as for the three fits we considered thus for each of these four models we obtained a different set of species with statistically significant trajectories at the 95 percent confidence level of course in general there is overlap of species among these sets i e species whose trajectories were significant for more than one model 3 results when we use the method without restriction to the whole tree species for a given abundance threshold n min e its accuracy is not good that is we use as a null model the abundances kept constant at the value measured at ctr then the mape of predictions is comparable to the mape of the null model for the immediate next censuses but then it becomes much worse e g for n min e 0 4 and ctr 4 the mape of logistic predictions for censuses c 5 8 are 13 0 23 4 44 4 and 93 5 respectively this has to be compared with the percentage mean absolute variations of abundances respect to census ctr given by 11 0 16 8 22 0 and 29 3 for c 5 8 thus we analyzed what happens when for each series of ctr k with k between 1 and 8 ctr censuses we use the method restricted to the subset of species such that their trajectories along these ctr k censuses are significant at the 95 percent confidence level for these subsets the method works as expected well the produced mape becomes much smaller than the one yielded by the null model table 2 shows the mape produced by the logistic method as well as for the three fits we considered and the null model for different training periods ctr and different values of the abundance threshold n min e notice that in most of the cases the mape of all model predictions for the next census i e five years ahead are between 1 and 2 compared with several times this percentage for the null model as expected a for a given training period the mape almost systematically increases for predictions from one census to the next this is particularly the case for the three fits different from the logistic model b increasing the training period also generally reduces the mape this is particularly apparent by looking at the last column for ctr 7 the pattern when decreasing the threshold n min e i e moving downward along columns is less clear it seems that the best results are obtained for n min e 1 therefore we take this as the default case that we will study in more detail the logistic predictor fares better that the others in the sense that for the set of species for which it gives significant predictions it achieves a lower mape table 2 shows that in 16 out of 42 predictions the logistic model is able to predict with lower mape with respect to the other procedures however note that the mapes in table 2 for different predictors are computed over different sets of species see table 4 on the other hand when considering predictions for individual species there are instances where one of the other empirical fits leads to a better prediction lower relative error than the logistic growth model fig 1 the modified coefficient of efficiency and index of agreement are also consistent with high levels of accuracy converging toward values close to 1 as shown in table 3 we show results only for the logistic model but the alternative three models produce similar results obviously the prediction performance also decreases as we increase the time window we are forecasting into the future finally table 4 shows for each cell of tables 2 and 3 the number of species whose trajectories were significant at the 95 confidence level for the three methods for instance the statistical significance test for individual species trajectories for n min e 1 ha 1 yielded for 50 out of the 170 tree species p value 0 05 using ctr 7 indeed for some species more than one of the predictors the logistic supplemented with the linear and quadratic fits yielded a p value 0 05 in these cases to untie we took the prediction of the predictor with smaller relative error therefore significant predictions of trajectories for half of these species 23 are obtained through the logistic growth model see table 5 in next section 4 discussion 4 1 method validation to put our method in perspective the calculation by volkov et al 2009 can be helpful the authors assuming that the tree community of bci plot is in steady state obtained estimates for the abundances of the 20 most abundant tree species in 1982 at bci i e just a single time point they were able to predict the abundances of some species with accuracy but failed badly for other species on average the mape was 86 the method we are proposing in the case of bci also neglects the interspecific interactions however it has remarkable differences firstly our approach doesn t require the assumption that the community is in a steady state by default it is not rather populations seem to be in constant turmoil actually there are several species whose abundances are clearly not in a steady state fig 1 fig s1 secondly and most importantly our method thus allows forecasting future abundances i e species trajectories and it works not just for the most abundant species but for many of them thirdly we can predict the abundances of several species with small errors 15 to 20 years into the future for several species in particular the mape for predictions five and ten years ahead is generally between 1 and 2 3 see table 2 numbers in black bold face these results are consistent with values of the modified coefficient of efficiency and index of agreement very close to 1 e 1 0 98 and d 1 0 99 tables 2 and 3 show that as expected our method yields the most accurate results for the longest possible training period of ctr 7 namely a mape of at most 1 2 and e 1 and d 1 always above 0 99 4 2 species consistent with a steady state are more the exception than the rule only a small fraction of the 170 species with a minimum density of n min e 1 ha 1 might be considered in a steady state with variations not significantly different from 0 see table s4 this is in consonance with the observed compositional change of the bci forest over the past 35 years condit et al 2017 the estimated carrying capacities for 155 out of these 170 species are 0 and roughly half of the species 74 have abundances that in the last census 2015 differ in 10 of their k i table s4 interestingly half of the species exhibit oscillations around their estimated carrying capacities along the 8 censuses table s5 it is worth noting that the species carrying capacities ki are parameters that are far from trivial to estimate from empirical data for a community as complex as the set of trees of a tropical forest including hundreds of species a straightforward procedure to estimate ri and ki for each species is performing the corresponding monoculture experiment in which the species is completely isolated from all the other species making up the community vandermer 1969 this seems not feasible for obvious practical reasons it is encouraging that the estimated carrying capacities are of the order to the ones estimated by fung et al 2016 for the bci forest nevertheless the values provided by our method for the logistic parameters ri and ki at most serve to provide information on ongoing general trends they should not to be considered as reliable estimates of their true values even when the abundances are accurately predicted since both estimates seem to be strongly correlated there can be compensations between them what drives species out from their steady state ni ki two classes of stochasticity that operate in ecological communities and may cause fluctuations in species abundances are demographic variance and temporal environmental variance chisholm et al 2014 fung et al 2016 demographic variance comprises demographic stochasticity which refers to variability in population growth arising from the discreteness of individuals and the random nature of birth and death processes in populations of finite size and demographic heterogeneity which arises when birth and death rates of individuals within a population vary by age size genotype etc temporal environmental variance arises from the effect of random variation in environmental conditions over time on the demographic rates of species these environmental changes include both fluctuations in abiotic factors such as fluctuations in rainfall temperature fire and in biotic factors e g abundance of pests at bci a major driver of tree abundance changes over the last 30 yr has been climate hubbell 2011 such random perturbations could certainly trigger oscillations of ni around ki there are several candidates among multiannual known climate oscillations baldwin et al 2001 bruun et al 2017 newman et al 2016 observed non monotonically changes of the estimated ki for many species when varying the training period ctr table s5 might reflect forced oscillations modulating the carrying capacities indeed using time dependent carrying capacities has long been recognized necessary to model population dynamics in environments that undergo change cushing 1986 shepherd and stojkov 2007 such time dependent carrying capacities have been used to model from fish population dynamics ikeda and yokoi 1980 to seasonal variations of available grass in grassland livestock production systems dieguez and fort 2017 and microbial biomass safuan et al 2011 the considerable compositional change in relative species abundances has been interpreted before hubbel 2011 as inconsistent with stabilizing forces which would rather imply fluctuations around fixed carrying capacities however this new analysis with the advantage of the availability of three new additional censuses suggests the possibility that the carrying capacities ki themselves could have been fluctuating strongly painting a picture more consistent with stabilizing forces 4 3 comparison of the different predictors we found p value 0 05 for the predicted trajectories by at least by one of the methods of 77 out of 170 species for n e min 1 0 90 out of 204 species for n e min 0 4 interestingly they can be classified into three classes according to the type of trajectory followed by n i e c which roughly coincide with the model producing the best prediction i for species such that n i e c grows or decreases more or less monotonically with a change in convexity the logistic growth method is generally the best predictor e g cassipourea elliptica psychotria horizontalis figs 1 a 1 c ii for species such that n i e c shows in addition to a global minimum maximum another local minimum maximum the ses or lls turn out to be the best predictors e g cecropia insignis tabernaemontana arborea figs 1 g 1 h the ability of ses to adapt to changing slope makes it often superior to lls and it can sometimes be slightly better than logistic or quadratic even in species for which these have p values below threshold iii for species such that n i e c is parabolic as expected the quadratic fit is the best predictor e g acalypha diversifolia fig 1 e which is the best predictor depends on how one chooses to measure the goodness of the predictions according to intended use in any case it is clear that none of the four predictors can be applied blindly the good below null model mapes we have obtained with the different predictors apply only to a subset of species which we again emphasize is different for each predictor crucial in choosing this set is the use of the p value which can detect when the prediction is significantly better than pure chance if one uses just one predictor on the whole set of species the mapes obtained are rather poor i e not better than the null model for all predictors the ses is rather successful in the sense that it is the predictor which has the largest number of species at a significant level of prediction for the 8th census using the first 7 as training and for this reason dominates table 5 below however it can only remain successful over longer periods for species that show a sustained linear trend since by construction it predicts a fixed δn it is probably more useful when trying to predict a few years ahead using a relatively long history in contrast the logistic method tends to give lower mapes over its own set of significant predictions at variance with the other predictors which are of empirical nature the logistic predictor is based on theoretical expectations and its fit parameters have a theoretical interpretation although it must be stressed that it is harder to obtain good estimation of the logistic parameters than it is to obtain a good prediction with this form this is due to interaction between the logistic parameters which can lead to two logistic functions with different parameters but making very similar abundance predictions especially in the short term 4 4 on the generality of the method and its limitations regarding the generality of the method it is worth remarking that the requirement of negligibility of interspecific interactions is not mandatory indeed in the general case of communities where interspecific interactions are important the lotka volterra predictor in terms of the full interaction matrix has to be used that is the pair of general equations 3 b and 4 rather than the simpler 3 b and 4 predict the species trajectories in the same way as we have done for bci the extra work is that one has to estimate the full matrix of interspecific coefficients either from experiments in cases in which this is feasible fort 2018 vandermeer 1969 or by other methods like maxent as we did here see si nevertheless a limitation of the method at least for the bci dataset is that it yields accurate predictions of future abundances only for the fraction of species whose trajectories during the training period are significant at the 95 percent confidence level e g for a training period ctr 7 for 50 out of the 170 species we have above a density threshold of n min e 1 ha 1 increasing the number of censuses ctr employed to fit the parameters ri and ki consistently improves the accuracy of our forecasting method this suggests that having additional data from future censuses will probably enhance the method accuracy 5 conclusion let us conclude with our predictions for the above set of 77 species including some warnings about possible species crashes the final model to forecast future values requires to recombine the training and validation periods into one series and estimate the model parameters ri and ki for these complete dataset i e taking ctr 8 table 5 shows predicted species abundances for the future 9 census to be held in 2020 the whole list for 170 species with a density of at least 1 tree ha 1 is in table s6 notice some yellow red light signals in table 5 of species for which we predict important losses in population by 2020 in particular for psychotria horizontalis this drop is of one third in consonance with a large negative growth coefficient r 0 45 compared with the mean over species r 0 34 table s4 for one species in table 5 poulsenia armata the fitted k parameter we obtained through the logistic method is negative si however we included this species because it has exhibited a drastic declining in its abundance along the eight censuses and a negative k might be interpreted as a serious warning of this observed population decreasing trend declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

24644,in this study an integrated 2d numerical model is applied to investigate the mechanical effects of the vegetation and soil type on slope stability the developed model can assess the mechanical aspects of vegetation in slope stabilization for this purpose a case study of the kheyrud forest located in northern iran is considered as a real case site different scenarios including three soil types fine grain with low medium and high strength and two vegetation types maple and common ash are assessed in the stability analysis based on safety factor the results confirm that the considered vegetation can prevent shallow landslide occasions but has a limited impact on deep landslide events the ratio of root zone depth to the depth of slide is the most important parameter in the contribution of vegetation in the increasing of the slope stability the simulation results show an improvement in the safety factor up to 25 when the mechanical aspects of vegetation are considered this improvement leads to stability for slopes with 10 more gradient the results also demonstrate the reinforcement effect of the roots stability improvement up to 25 and negative effect of the surcharge load reduction of stability up to 5 at a surcharge of 1 2 kpa on the slope stability the extent of these impacts varies by soil properties tree characteristics and slope geometry so that the overall result can vary the sensitivity analysis demonstrated an increase in the soil cohesion grows the negative effect of tree weight also it is observed that the increase of soil unit weight follows a decrease in the stabilization role of vegetation the role of the soil s friction angle is insignificant the findings can serve as a foundation for enhancing the scientific understanding of the relationship between the stabilization role of vegetation and soil vegetation and slope characteristics generally in the stabilization of a slope by artificial planting forests the native shrubs or trees with more reinforcing effects and low surcharge are more effective graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords slope stability mechanical effects of vegetation root reinforcement shallow landslides numerical modeling 1 introduction landslide is the downward movement of a mass e g earth rock debris of a slope in the form of fall topple slide spread and flow or a combination of them gariano and guzzetti 2016 varnes 1978 the triggering causes of landslides can be categorized into two groups natural causes such as rainfall and earthquake and human causes such as construction mining and deforestation forbes and broadhead 2011 gaillard et al 2007 haque et al 2016 in some cases the combination of both causes can be triggered a landslide it is estimated that 4 8 million people were affected and 18 000 lost their lives by landslides for the period from 1998 to 2017 wallemacq et al 2018 the reports indicate non seismic landslide event had been associated with about 5

klose et al 2016 the landslide hazards in iran occur commonly due to susceptible topography and climate shoaei 2014 according to published data up to september 2007 about 4500 landslides have been

the roots of vegetation extracted soil moisture and increase matric suction in the unsaturated root zone that leads to more stabilization fatahi et al 2010 on the other hand the canopy of vegetation cover absorbs a portion of the rainfall and reduces available water to infiltrate to the soil wilkinson et al 2002a nevertheless other factors such as the weight of heavy plants especially trees and the transmission of drag force generated by wind reduce the slope stability coppin and richards 1990 generally the effects of vegetation on the stability of a slope can be divided into two sections

characteristics of vegetation the type of soil and the geometry of the slope have a dominant effect on stability improvement but the sensitivity of stability improvement to these factors especially soil properties has not been investigated thoroughly to assess the role of vegetation on the stability of a slope there are some commercial and individual developed codes while these codes have a similar base they differ in some aspects including considering unsaturated conditions water infiltration nailing and vegetation effects chasm wilkinson et al 2002b trigrs baum et al 2008 2002 slip4ex

study emadi tafti and ataie ashtiani 2019 developed sshv 2d code that can apply combined mechanical and hydrological features of vegetation on slope stability this platform allows the addition of new modules for stability analysis to simulate different aspects of vegetation or rainfall in the present study the integrated effects of mechanical aspects of vegetation and soil type on the slope sliding were scrutinized a real case site located in northern iran including field measurement of vegetation soil and geometry characteristics was used as a representative of forestry slope in the mentioned site the field measurement data have been collected significantly but the numerical modeling has not been conducted deeply see table 1 the published numerical results of stability improvement due to mechanical aspects vary at different sites and have a wide range hence the objectives of this work are to quantify the contribution of vegetation in the stabilization of forestry slopes in the study area and to study the cross effect of soil tree and slope parameters on the vegetation mechanical role in slope stabilization by a sensitivity analysis in the following sections a

roots 2 the surcharge load due to weight of vegetation 3 the drag force due to wind blowing 4 the water uptake of roots due to transpiration 5 the interception of rainfall by the canopy and 6 the change in soil hydraulic conductivity occurs in the root zone the first three effects which can be named mechanical effects affect stability equation directly and the influence of other cases is on the hydrological module which considers the infiltration of rainfall and redistribution of soil moisture content in this study two mechanical effects of vegetation addition cohesion by roots and surcharge load are only considered and other effects are ignored notably consideration of hydrological effects increases stability and it is conservative to ignore these emadi tafti and ataie ashtiani 2019 also since the climate of the region is humid and the number of rainy days is noticeable the neglecting of soil matric suction can simulate the most critical state of the slope when the soil moisture has reached its maximum value therefore this assumption is reasonable in the sshv 2d model the limit equilibrium scheme is used for stability analysis the simplified bishop method and janbu s simplified method are available in the program in comparison with different limit equilibrium methods both mentioned methods have a result with good accuracy emadi tafti and ataie ashtiani 2019 the bishop method is used when the slip surface is circular and janbu s methods can be commonly used in non circular slides in this study the slip surface has been assumed to be circular and the simplified bishop method is considered for stability analysis the safety factor is calculated as below in this method 1 s f i 1 n c s c r b w q s u r b u a b tan ϕ u a u w b tan ϕ b m α i i 1 n w q s u r b i sin α i where 2 m α i cos α i sin α i tan ϕ i s f here c s kpa is effective soil cohesion c r kpa is additional cohesion due to root presence w kn is the weight of slice q s u r kpa is the uniform surcharge load caused by vegetation weight u a kpa is pore air pressure usually equals to zero ϕ is the effective internal friction angle u w kpa is pore water pressure u a u w is the matric suction ϕ b is the angle indicating the rate of change in shear strength relative to matric suction in unsaturated zone ϕ b ϕ and in saturated zone ϕ b ϕ b m is the width of the slice α is the inclination of the slice base and s f dimensionless is the safety factor of slope the summation should be conducted on whole slices so n is the number of slices see fig 1 since s f has appeared on both sides of the equation the result is obtained using an iterative method to achieve the lowest sf the different slip circles are examined the circles are defined by centers and radii entered by the user the numerical calculations are performed by the finite difference method fdm in the sshv 2d program so the domain is divided into rectangular cells this brings the slope to be approximated by a stepped edge to reduce the errors due to this approximation the dimensions of the cells can be assumed a small value in this study the horizontal and vertical dimension of cells is considered to 0 1 and 0 05 meter respectively the values are smaller than 1 slope dimensions in the sshv 2d model the reinforcement effect of roots is considered as an additional cohesion applied to bare soil cohesion so in the root zone the apparent cohesion of soil can be expressed as below 3 c c s c r where c kpa is the apparent cohesion of rooted soil c s kpa is the bare unrooted soil cohesion and c r kpa is additional cohesion due to the presence of roots to calculating the additional cohesion two alternatives are available in the current program one the root can be modeled as an individual elastoplastic bar and another the root can be considered as a distributed reinforcer element in this study the second alternative is used because the prior alternative requires more details than the former such as tree position the pullout resistance of root length of root etc the wu waldron method wwm is one of the most simple and well known relationships to the estimation of additional soil cohesion the relationship states the additional cohesion versus strength and geometric properties of roots waldron 1977 wu 1976 wu et al 1979 4 c r i 1 n k i σ r i a r i a where c r kpa is additional cohesion σ r kpa is mobilized tensile stress of roots at the slide plane a r m2 is the cross sectional area of roots at the slide plane a m2 is the cross sectional area of soil at the slide plane and n is the number of roots at the slide plane it is common that the ratio of a r per a is named root area ratio and is denoted by r a r dimensionless the summation sign means these parameters must be measured for each root or each class of roots and then aggregated k at the above equation is a function of the internal friction angle of soil ϕ and the angle between root orientation and the slide plane θ 5 k sin θ cos θ tan ϕ because the measurement of θ is not practical wu et al 1979 calculated the range of k changes at normal variation in ϕ and θ they observed that k is insensitive relatively and varies between 1 0 to 1 3 they substituted k by 1 2 wu et al 1979 moreover they assumed that the mobilized tensile stress in the slide plane is equal to the root tensile strength t r thus the final form of wwm can be expressed as 6 c r 1 2 i 1 n t r i r a r i the comparison between apparent cohesion of rooted soil measured by in situ tests and the theoretical value obtained from eq 3 demonstrated that the wwm overestimates additional cohesion fan and su 2008 operstein and frydman 2000 pollen et al 2004 waldron and dakessian 1981 wu 2013 therefore preti 2006 applied a reduction factor k on wwm and presented a modified version of the wwm as below although he suggested a value of 0 4 for the reduction factor based on experimental measurements other values have been reported in the literature 7 c r 1 2 k i 1 n t r i r a r i the weight of vegetation is another mechanical factor that influences the stability of slopes and is applied as a distributed uniform load on the slope in the sshv 2d program the surcharge load is an inputted parameter in the program to estimation of surcharge load the weight of trees in a region should be predicted and then divided into the area of the region an allometric relationship for the prediction of above ground biomass agb kg of an individual tree can be expressed as below west 2015 8 a g b α d b h β where d b h m is the tree diameter at the breast height 1 35 m and α and β are fitting parameters and vary by tree species jenkins et al 2003 presented the value of α and β from regression analysis for different species in the united states for hardwood species α varies between 0 0837 to 0 1477 and β is in the range of 2 3651 to 2 4835 when d b h is greater than 2 5 cm and is expressed in centimeters jenkins et al 2003 according to these values the a g b is obtained in kilograms based on the above equation the surcharge of trees on a slope can be computed by 9 q s u r 1 a i 1 n a g b g 1 ω where q s u r is the surcharge load kpa g is the gravitational acceleration n kg ω is the wood moisture content dimensionless n is the number of trees in the slope and a is the area of slope m2 at first glance it may be thought that the mean of d b h and the number of tree per hectare can be used to calculating the average surcharge but it should be known that since β is greater than 2 using the mean d b h will lead to a result less than the average surcharge therefore the data of individual trees or at least the number of trees in different diameter classes should be used in computing the surcharge load the size density and species of trees are the parameters affecting the surcharge load the different values of the surcharge load that has been reported in the literature have been collected by emadi tafti and ataie ashtiani 2019 the values include a wide range and vary from 70 to 5000 pa 2 2 site description the hyrcanian forest or caspian forest is a mixed forestry area that is extended along the southern and the southwestern shores of the caspian sea in iran and azerbaijan because the south border of this area is limited to the alborz mountains the region s climate is humid and mild this ancient forest which has about 850 kms long and 1 9 million hectares area is covered by deciduous broadleaved vegetation with about 50 tree and 80 shrub species abdi 2018 the educational and experimental forest of the university of tehran which is named kheyrud forest is located in the middle section of the hyrcanian forest 51 33 e to 51 42 e and 36 28 n to 36 37 n the site is 7 km east of nowshahr port in mazandaran province iran the present study has been performed based on measured data from the mentioned forest the kheyrud forest has an area of about 8000 hectares and is included seven districts see fig 2 the elevation of the site varies between 15 and 2200 m above sea level the climate is humid and mild and the average annual precipitation is about 1200 mm that commonly falls as rainfall the gradient of slopes in the kheyrud forest varies widely as far as in some areas have been seen vertical cliffs navidi and abtahi 2001 fig 3 shows the distribution of the slope gradient for the kheyrud forest it can be seen that the dominant gradient of the site is in the range of 15 to 65 the field observations and published reports indicate that more frequent shallow landslides have occurred in some areas where there are no trees abdi 2018 2014 hayati et al 2018b the landslides are shallow with a depth of about one meter hayati et al 2018b or a little more fig 4 shows two samples of shallow landslides that have occurred in the studied site the more occurrence of the landslides in bare slopes and the measured data for vegetation are the main reasons for the selection of this site to study the dominant tree species in kheyrud forest are oriental beech fagus orientalis hornbeam carpinus betulus persian ironwood parrotia persica and maple acer velutinum moreover alder alnus subcordata maple acer cappadocicum chestnut leaved oak quercus castaneifolia common ash fraxinus excelsior large leaved lime tilia platyphyllos and the like can be observed in this site abdi and deljouei 2019 hayati et al 2018b in the study site the in situ shear test for determination of additional cohesion due to the presence of roots has not been performed unfortunately but some researchers have calculated the additional cohesion of soil by the measurement of roots tensile strength and root area ratio of different species and using wwm abdi 2014 abdi et al 2010a abdi and deljouei 2019 esmaiili et al 2017 in these references 1 the excavated trenches to the measurement of rar and root sampling are at a different distance from the tree s trunk in some cases 0 5 m and in others 1 m 2 the measurement of r a r has been made on 10 cm layers of trenches wall 3 the root sampling has been performed at depth of 30 cm and the tensile strength has been measured in the laboratory 4 in using wwm the values of k and k are different in fig 5 the reported values of cr for different tree species have been shown it should be noted that in these diagrams the values are modified so that k 1 2 and k 1 to allow comparisons between five tree species since the root additional cohesion is highly dependent on the tree dimensions the average of dbh diameter at the breast height and the average height of trees are expressed in the diagrams some researchers have been reported the density and diameter distribution of trees in different regions in the study site bayat et al 2013 haydari et al 2013 mohammadalizadeh et al 2009 the regions are included one parcel to one district for example the diameter distribution of trees in gorazbon district has been reported by bayat et al 2013 that shown in fig 6 by considering this diagram and substituting α 0 0837 β 2 4835 and ω 0 33 in the equation 9 the surcharge load obtains 368 pa in this sample the density of trees is 290 trees per hectares however several times higher densities have also been reported in other regions of the study site hayati et al 2018b javanmiri pour et al 2017 that may lead to more surcharge load the soil of the kheyrud forest is mostly fine grain the most reported soil types are mh ml ch and cl according to the unified soil classification system uscs abdi 2014 abdi et al 2010a abdi and deljouei 2019 esmaiili et al 2017 some reported data which have been measured by in situ and laboratory tests have been listed in table 2 2 3 simulation assumptions and parameters in this study a two dimensional domain is used for the simulation of the slope as shown in fig 7 the ground of the site consists of a surface layer of fine grain soil which is located on a cracked calcareous bedrock abdi 2018 2014 hayati et al 2018b the surface soil is homogeneous and the depth of the layer is denoted by d see fig 7 the field measurements demonstrate that the depth of the surface layer is about 2 3 m commonly hayati et al 2018b therefore in subsequent simulations the value of d is considered as 1 2 and 3 m three types of soil with different strengths have been considered as surface soil the mechanical properties of the assumed soils have been presented in table 3 in the sensitivity analysis more values of the soil properties are considered the height and the angle of the slope are two parameters that are used to define the geometry of the slope these parameters are shown by h and α in fig 7 respectively to reduce the number of model parameters other dimensions of the model have also been defined by these variables in this study the four values of h ranging from 5 m to 20 m h 5m 10m 15m and 20m were assumed to simulations according to the gradient variation map of the site fig 3 the seven different values are assumed for slope angle as α 8 13 18 23 28 33 and 45 another aspect of the model is the trees and roots characteristics based on the measurement data presented in fig 5 two types of trees are considered in the modeling maple tree which represents trees with thicker and deeper roots and common ash tree that exhibits trees with strong shallow roots the additional cohesion distribution in depth is shown in fig 8 for both assumed trees based on the previous sample calculation of tree weight the surcharge load for both assumed trees is considered 0 6 kpa and the values 0 and 1 2 kpa are used for parametric analysis 3 results in this section the results of stability analysis for the mentioned slope in different conditions are presented the factor of safety is the main result of stability analysis for a slope since the stability analysis is performed under different conditions to determine the condition of analysis the safety factors sf are indicated by some subscripts the subscript of r means the reinforcement effect of roots has been considered in the analysis and the subscript of s demonstrates that the surcharge load of trees is applied to the model in the case of bare soil no subscript is used and if both effects are considered both subscripts are exerted together according to the previous section in the current simulations nine parameters contribute as shown in fig 9 in the first part of the simulations the impacts of mechanical aspects of vegetation on the stability of the site s slopes are investigated in the following some parameters are changed beyond the assumed values and the sensitivity of sf against them is assessed the results have been presented below 3 1 the global influence of vegetation mechanical effects on slope stability the assessment of vegetation mechanical effects on the improvement of slope stability is the main aim of the current study fig 10 demonstrates a sample of the overall results of vegetation role on the safety factors the increase in safety factor is calculated as sfrs sf sf the shown ranges on the diagrams demonstrate the variations of the safety factors against changes in the slope angles and the bars are the average of the values the maximum value of each range is related to the largest angle and the minimum value corresponds to the lowest angle this means that as the angle of slope increases the stability of the slope decreases the role of vegetation becomes more important it is noteworthy that the difference between safety factors sfrs sf has inverse behavior compared to relative increase namely the largest increase value is related to the slope with the smallest angle the common ash increases safety factors by 16 4 5 1 and 2 3 averagely when the bedrock located in the depth of 1m 2m and 3m respectively these values are 8 2 3 and 1 1 for the maple tree if the part of the soil where the roots are located to be defined as a root zone then the depth of the root zone is almost equal to the maximum depth of tree roots since in analysis with different d values the depth of the root zone let s call it zr is constant it can be said that the role of vegetation becomes more prominent when the ratio of zr to d decreases notably the slip surface moves a little when the vegetation effects are added to slope stability analysis but these changes are not significant in fact the bedrock mechanical properties are so large relative to the surface layer see fig 7 that the slip surface remains in the surface layer and close to the previous slip surface the assumption is considered based on the site condition 3 2 the influence of slope geometry on slope stability the height h and the angle of the slope α are two major parameters that define the geometry of the slope the analysis demonstrates that the sf is strongly influenced by the slope angle whereas the slope height changes do not have much effect as presented in fig 11 the relationship between the safety factors sfrs and the slope angles α follows a power law r2 0 99 it can also be seen that a line fits well r2 0 75 on the variation of safety factor sfrs versus slope s height h this pattern is observed in a variety of assumed soils tree types and all values of surface soil thickness d the small gradient of the fitted line in the safety factor slope height relationship e g 0 0053 for α 13 indicates that the changes of slope height have not significant effects on the safety factor and can be considered as an unessential parameter in parametric analysis by substituting the safety factor equal to 1 0 the boundary between stability and instability in the relationship that provides the safety factor in terms of slope angle and it leads to a critical slope angle αcr which steeper slopes will naturally be unstable this parameter can be a new criterion for the demonstration of stability improvement the values of the critical slope angle for different slope height and different surface soil depth are presented in fig 12 when d is equal to one on average the common ash and maple trees increase the critical slope angle by 4 6 and 2 2 respectively according to the diagrams increasing the slope height decreases the threshold of instability angle linearly whereas the surface soil thickness affects the critical angle by a power law it is observed that the change in the critical angle due to tree presence is greatly reduced at higher d the changes in the safety factor due to vegetation in terms of geometric parameters h and α are presented in fig 13 the diagrams demonstrate that relative changes in safety factors fluctuate slightly at small slope angles and have an increasing trend on steeper slopes interestingly this upward trend usually begins when the slope angle exceeds the critical angle for example when the slope height is 15 m the tree is common ash and the soil is low strength firstly the relative increase in safety factor is constant and equals to 15 approximately then the relative changes in the safety factor increase with the gradient of 0 4 per degree at slopes steeper than the critical slope the diagrams also demonstrate that the variations of relative changes in the safety factor in terms of slope height are ignorable however absolute changes in safety factors have a decreasing trend concerning both the angle and the height of the slope 3 2 1 the influence of root depth in this study two tree types have been assumed to have the root depth of 0 5 m for maple and 0 4 m for common ash although these depths are constant in various modeling they will be different if they are considered relative to the depth of surface soil the analyses show that higher d reduces the role of the tree in enhancing the slope stability see fig 10 if the relative changes in the safety factors are plotted at the relative depth of roots zr d it can be seen the increase in relative depth of root makes more improvement in the factor of safety see fig 14 this pattern is also seen in the absolute changes in the safety factors 3 2 2 the soil type effects the effects of soil type on the stabilization by vegetation are another aspect that has been investigated the assumed soils in this study are included three different strength soils in low strength soil the cohesion and the internal friction angle of the soil are lowest compared to other soil types both of these parameters increase in soil with medium strength and high strength than the previous type the unit weight of soils is also increased from low strength to high strength soil fig 15 shows the influence of soil strength on the role of vegetation in improving stability when the soil strength increases the changes in the factors of safety decrease for example in a similar condition the common ash increases the safety factor by 0 32 in low strength soil by 0 14 in medium strength soil and by 0 03 in high strength soil see fig 15a at α 13 this declining trend is more severe for relative changes in the safety factors see fig 15b to investigate the effects of the soil properties the mechanical parameters of soil c φ and γ were changed alone initially the internal friction angle of the soil was changed the result is presented in fig 16 it is observed that the change in safety factor has a linear relationship with the internal friction angle r2 0 86 the sign of line gradient is positive increasing in internal friction angle helps the stabilization role of the root but its gradient is low enough so that can be ignored therefore the internal friction angle has not a great impact on stabilization by roots considering in this case study in the following the internal friction angle was considered constant and the factor of safety was calculated for all combinations of cohesion and unit weight values the values of soil cohesion were 0 1 1 8 and 15 kpa and the values of soil unit weight were 14 16 18 and 20 kn m3 the absolute and relative changes in the factor of safety in terms of the unit weight and the cohesion of the soil are plotted in fig 17 the impact of the unit weight depends on the soil cohesion when soil cohesion is low the increase of the unit weight decreases the improving role of the trees in return the unit weight of the soil helps to roots in the slope stabilization where the soil has high cohesion the absolute and relative changes in the factor of safety have a linear trend with good accuracy r2 0 96 the soil cohesion has a negative effect on the stabilizing role of trees the results demonstrate the soil cohesion and the increase in safety factor due to trees have a contradictory effect this negative effect which changes linearly r2 0 99 is exacerbated by the lower the specific weight of the soil because the variation of the safety factor in terms of the soil cohesion is completely linear the relative changes in the safety factors have a homographic trend 3 3 the effect of the tree surcharge on the stability of the slope to study the impact of tree surcharge on stability the safety factor is calculated in three cases no surcharge consideration sfr the assumed surcharge of the tree 0 6 kpa and twice the assumed surcharge 1 2 kpa as shown in fig 18 in this study the tree surcharge desecrates the slope stability in other words sfr always is higher than sfrs the difference between sfr and sfrs decreases with the slope angle has a power trend whereas the relative values have an upward trend the analysis also demonstrates that the variations of the relative increase in the safety factor are linearly related to the amount of the surcharge load see fig 18b these patterns are repeated in other soil types tree types slope heights and surface soil thicknesses by changing in internal friction angle of the soil the impact of this parameter on the stabilization role of trees was investigated the results are presented in fig 19 similar to the previous section it is observed that the impact of the internal friction angle on the effect of tree surcharge on stabilization is ignorable but since the safety factor increases by increasing the internal friction angle the relative decreases in the safety factor of rooted soil have a decreasing trend the negative effect of the surcharge can be so high that it destroys the positive effect of root reinforcement or even overcomes it the unit weight and the cohesion of the soil are other parameters whose impact on the effect of the surcharge has been studied the increase in soil unit weight decreases the negative effect of the surcharge the gradient of declining trend decreases in low cohesion soils so that the effect of soil unit weight can be ignored in low cohesion soils see fig 20 a also the soil cohesion increases the negative effect of the surcharge a line can accurately express this relationship r2 0 999 as shown in fig 20b in low specific weight soils the growth is higher if the relative decrease in the safety factor is considered the growth of the surcharge s negative effects has a declining rate in terms of soil cohesion 3 4 the influence of the reduction factor of wwm on stabilization role of vegetation applying a reduction factor kʺ to wwm may compensate for the overestimation of this model preti 2006 to survey the impact of this factor the analysis is performed for kʺ 0 8 0 6 and 0 4 since the reduction factor scales the additional cohesion caused by the roots this perception may be created that the increased value of the safety factor is scaled on the same factor this conception is true when only the root reinforcement effect is considered sfr when both mechanical aspects reinforcement and surcharge are considered the surcharge load is not scaled by reduction factor and it leads to a greater reduction in the stabilization role of vegetation see fig 21 4 discussion the obtained results in this study demonstrate that the influence of mechanical aspects of vegetation can be widely different and varies from negative to positive values the reported results by other researchers also confirm the wide variation e g chok et al 2004 kokutse et al 2016 lin et al 2010 maffra et al 2019 mao et al 2014 naghdi et al 2013 simon and collison 2002 temgoua et al 2017 the specification of the tree type density depth of root zone and root characteristics and architecture mechanical soil parameters cohesion and specific weight and geometry of slope slope angle and depth of surface layer are effective parameters on the amount of stabilization role of vegetation in this study a relative improvement in the safety factor has been observed up to about 25 about the results two points must be kept in mind first the effect of surcharge load is always associated with root reinforcement effect and reporting the effect of root reinforcement alone e g kokutse et al 2016 simon and collison 2002 temgoua et al 2017 on improving the slope stability sfr sf is far from the truth unless in the assessment of the clearcutting at primary times second in many conditions most stability improvement occurs when the slope is stable enough e g increase in the safety factor is greater when the slope angle is lower however improving stability is needed when the slope is on the instability threshold therefore the enhancement of the safety factor is important where the safety factor is close to one this increment is not a maximum increment necessarily for example the improvement of the safety factor at the threshold of instability is about 15 where the maximum improvement at the same condition is about 25 4 1 the global influence of the mechanical aspects of vegetation on slope stability in the current study the results show that the reinforcement of soil by roots improve slope stability and the surcharge of a tree lowers the stability of slopes the combination of these two aspects depending on which of these is superior to another can improve or worsen the slope stability the root reinforcement is more effective in stability when the slip surface has more interaction with the roots deepening of the root zone and or reducing the slip depth are two major factors that increase interaction between these both in this study zr d has been considered as a representative of these two factors the result demonstrates that the increase in zr d improves the safety factor exponentially fig 14 this is consistent with the result of other researchers arnone et al 2016 chok et al 2004 feng 2016 mao et al 2014 steinacher et al 2009 thus the trees with deeper roots in similar condition can be more effective in slope stability also the role of root reinforcement is more whatever the slide to be shallower the analyses demonstrate that the surcharge load of trees decreases the slope s stability many studies have reported similar results abernethy and rutherfurd 2000 lan et al 2020 simon and collison 2002 steinacher et al 2009 but some other researches have mentioned conflicting results e g kokutse et al 2016 this effect becomes less important when the slip depth increases thus the shallower slide makes the surcharge load effect more worrying accordingly if planting forests are to be used to prevent shallow landslides it is best to use trees with a low surcharge load and deep and strong roots the specifications can make the use of shrubs superior to trees to prevent shallow landslides it is notable that the position of the tree on a slope also affects its stabilization effect in this study all surfaces of the model top middle and toe are covered by trees genet et al 2010 showed that the surcharge load on the toe of the slope can be beneficial and has a detrimental impact on the top and the middle of the slope the reduction factor at the modified wwm scales the additional cohesion to the soil created by roots the analyses appear that the mentioned factor applies similarly to change in the safety factor due to the reinforcing effect but does not affect the surcharge s impact therefore the ratio of safety factor improvement sfrs sf when the reduction factor is applied to not is less than the reduction factor 4 2 the influence of slope geometry on the slope stability of the rooted slope analyses demonstrated that the slope height has not a significant effect on slope stability and stabilization role of vegetation on the contrary the slope angle strongly alters the factor of safety if relative changes in sf are considered in terms of the slope angle it is observed that the relative changes are constant as long as the slope is stable and increase when the slope becomes unstable it is in line with the root reinforcement objective the depth of surface soil d is an essential parameter if it has been considered as a geometric parameter the importance of this parameter was explained in the previous section the depth of bedrock controls the slip depth and the depth of root growth the critical slope angle αcr increases when the mechanical effects of vegetation are considered for example the slope which failed at 25 6 48 will remain stable to 29 9 58 when the common ash tree stabilizes it these values are obtained for the depth of surface soil equal to one meter fig 12 the results of modeling with higher depths of surface soil d show that the critical slope angle does not change much in deep landslides 4 3 the impact of soil parameters in the stabilization of soil by vegetation between the three mechanical properties of the soil assumed in this study the priority of importance is cohesion unit weight and internal friction angle respectively as the soil cohesion increases the contribution of the root reinforcing effect decreases and the surcharge load effect grows although both are undesirable with increasing soil cohesion the stability improves and there is no need to stabilize by vegetation according to analyses the impact of soil cohesion on surcharge load effects is linear for assumed parameters in this work the gradient of the fitted line is of order 10 2 kpa 1 i e per kpa increase in soil cohesion the second decimal place of the improved factor of safety decreases then if the value of cohesion soil is added a few tens kpa the changed safety factor reduced in the first decimal place that is significant in slope stability with referring to the safety factor equation it appears that the decrease in safety factor with increasing soil cohesion returns to surcharge s negative effect otherwise the soil cohesion and the reinforcement effect are independent after cohesion the specific weight of soil is a more effective parameter the increase of soil unit weight decreases both root reinforcing and surcharge load effects the decrease of the surcharge load effect is desirable but the decrease in the reinforcing effect is not in line with stabilization the analyses demonstrate that the combination of these two effects destabilize the slope when the soil cohesion is low the soil stabilization is necessary although according to the parameter used in this study the changes in improved safety factors occur in a second decimal place due to the general decrease of the safety factor caused by the increase of unit weight the relative change in the safety factor is not ignorable the internal friction angle is the third property of the soil whose effect on the stabilization role of vegetation has been investigated the analyses show that the impact of this property on the change of safety factor can be neglected since increasing the internal friction angle improves the safety factor the relative change in the safety factor has a declining trend in terms of internal friction angle 5 conclusion in this study the influence of the mechanical properties of trees on the stability of a slope was investigated the considered parameters for soil tree and slope were based on measurement data at the kheyrud forest in northern iran a two dimensional model was analyzed by the sshv 2d program the reinforcement effect of the tree s root was considered as an additional cohesion that improved soil cohesion and reduced in depth also a uniform surcharge load was applied to all the upper surfaces of the model as the weight of trees moreover the sensitivity analysis was performed to investigate the effects of soil properties and depth of landslide the obtained results which some of them are reported for the first time in the technical literature can be summarized as follows the reinforcing effect of roots has a stabilizing role and the weight of the tree has a destabilizing role for the slope depending on which of the two effects is greater than the other the mechanical effect of trees on slope stability is determined both improvement and worsen cases were observed in analyses in the current study the improvement of the safety factor is observed up to about 25 the relative root zone depth the depth of the root zone related to slip depth is the most important parameter on the mechanical effect of vegetation so the role of vegetation in the prevention of shallow landslides is considerable soil cohesion is the most important mechanical property of soil which affects the stabilization role of vegetation the increase of soil cohesion raises the surcharge s negative effect therefore the soil cohesion and the stabilization role of vegetation are acting on opposite sides since the enhancing of soil cohesion generally improve stability the declining trend of vegetation role is not a concern the specific weight of soil also decreases the stabilization role of vegetation the analyses demonstrated that although the effect of vegetation is reduced the stabilization role is not converted to a destabilization role the result also showed that the impact of the internal friction angle is negligible thus the vegetation is helpful to prevent shallow landslide events however it does not play a significant role in deep landslides it can be suggested that in bioengineering methods for stabilization of a slope the native shrubs or trees with more reinforcing effect strong and deep roots and low surcharge low height and low diameter are more effective in future works the hydrological aspects of vegetation will also be added to mechanical aspects and the role of both will be compared in the stabilization of slopes declaration of

24644,in this study an integrated 2d numerical model is applied to investigate the mechanical effects of the vegetation and soil type on slope stability the developed model can assess the mechanical aspects of vegetation in slope stabilization for this purpose a case study of the kheyrud forest located in northern iran is considered as a real case site different scenarios including three soil types fine grain with low medium and high strength and two vegetation types maple and common ash are assessed in the stability analysis based on safety factor the results confirm that the considered vegetation can prevent shallow landslide occasions but has a limited impact on deep landslide events the ratio of root zone depth to the depth of slide is the most important parameter in the contribution of vegetation in the increasing of the slope stability the simulation results show an improvement in the safety factor up to 25 when the mechanical aspects of vegetation are considered this improvement leads to stability for slopes with 10 more gradient the results also demonstrate the reinforcement effect of the roots stability improvement up to 25 and negative effect of the surcharge load reduction of stability up to 5 at a surcharge of 1 2 kpa on the slope stability the extent of these impacts varies by soil properties tree characteristics and slope geometry so that the overall result can vary the sensitivity analysis demonstrated an increase in the soil cohesion grows the negative effect of tree weight also it is observed that the increase of soil unit weight follows a decrease in the stabilization role of vegetation the role of the soil s friction angle is insignificant the findings can serve as a foundation for enhancing the scientific understanding of the relationship between the stabilization role of vegetation and soil vegetation and slope characteristics generally in the stabilization of a slope by artificial planting forests the native shrubs or trees with more reinforcing effects and low surcharge are more effective graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords slope stability mechanical effects of vegetation root reinforcement shallow landslides numerical modeling 1 introduction landslide is the downward movement of a mass e g earth rock debris of a slope in the form of fall topple slide spread and flow or a combination of them gariano and guzzetti 2016 varnes 1978 the triggering causes of landslides can be categorized into two groups natural causes such as rainfall and earthquake and human causes such as construction mining and deforestation forbes and broadhead 2011 gaillard et al 2007 haque et al 2016 in some cases the combination of both causes can be triggered a landslide it is estimated that 4 8 million people were affected and 18 000 lost their lives by landslides for the period from 1998 to 2017 wallemacq et al 2018 the reports indicate non seismic landslide event had been associated with about 5 casualties in europe and an average of 11 5 fatalities worldwide for each event froude and petley 2018 haque et al 2016 the total annual loss due to landslides is about 20 billion usd in the world klose et al 2016 the landslide hazards in iran occur commonly due to susceptible topography and climate shoaei 2014 according to published data up to september 2007 about 4500 landslides have been recorded across iran kardan et al 2007 these landslides have been led to 185 fatalities and more than 12 6 billion usd direct financial losses dehnavi et al 2015 landslides damage infrastructures

projects is a sustainable method that can be used to stabilize slopes with environmental elements gray and sotir 1996 the vegetation enhances the slope characteristics in different ways and can be used to improvement of slope stability and erosion control morgan and rickson 2003 therefore instead of structural retention systems and artificial elements e g nailing geogrids conventional piles and gabion engineers used the vegetation to slopes stabilization collison and anderson 1996 the vegetation reinforces the soil by the roots and thus enhances the strength of the soil greenway 1987 also the roots of vegetation extracted soil moisture and increase matric suction in the unsaturated root zone that leads to more stabilization fatahi et al 2010 on the other hand the canopy of vegetation cover absorbs a portion of the rainfall and reduces available water to infiltrate to the soil wilkinson et al 2002a nevertheless other factors such as the weight of heavy plants especially trees and the transmission of drag force generated by wind reduce the slope stability coppin and richards 1990 generally the effects of vegetation on the stability of a slope can be divided into two sections greenway 1987 mechanical features e g reinforcing of soil applying surcharge load and transmitting wind force and hydrological features e g interception of rainfall and extraction of soil moisture in this study to assess the influence of mechanical features of vegetation on slope stability and their sensitivity to existing parameters e g soil properties and slope geometry the mechanical features have been taken only into account although the using vegetation to slope stabilization dates back to centuries ago lee 1985 its influences have been quantified from the 1960s zhu et al 2019 the

characteristics of vegetation the type of soil and the geometry of the slope have a dominant effect on stability improvement but the sensitivity of stability improvement to these factors especially soil properties has not been investigated thoroughly to assess the role of vegetation on the stability of a slope there are some commercial and individual developed codes while these codes have a similar base they differ in some aspects including considering unsaturated conditions water infiltration nailing and vegetation effects chasm wilkinson et al 2002b trigrs baum et al 2008 2002 slip4ex greenwood 2006 lapsus claessens et al 2007 hydrolisthisis anagnostopoulos et al 2015 and shia landslide aristizábal et al 2016 are the samples of individual developed models which able to stability analysis with considering some features of vegetated slopes since the mentioned codes don t consider all aspects of vegetation and or it was not possible to access the source of the code in a previous study emadi tafti and ataie ashtiani 2019 developed sshv 2d code that can apply combined mechanical and hydrological features of vegetation on slope stability this platform allows the addition of new modules for stability analysis to simulate different aspects of vegetation or rainfall in the present study the integrated effects of mechanical aspects of vegetation and soil type on the slope sliding were scrutinized a real case site located in northern iran including field measurement of vegetation soil and geometry characteristics was used as a representative of forestry slope in the mentioned site the field measurement data have been collected significantly but the numerical modeling has not been conducted deeply see table 1 the published numerical results of stability improvement due to mechanical aspects vary at different sites and have a wide range hence the objectives of this work are to quantify the contribution of vegetation in the stabilization of forestry slopes in the study area and to study the cross effect of soil tree and slope parameters on the vegetation mechanical role in slope stabilization by a sensitivity analysis in the following sections a brief description of the model used in this study is presented then the study site is introduced and the model and simulation parameters are explained and the results of numerical modeling are presented finally a discussion on the results and the study outputs are concluded 2 material and methods 2 1 slope stability analysis model in this study the sshv 2d model has been used to analysis of slope stability sshv 2d is an integrated two dimensional slope stability model that can consider hydrological and vegetation effects on the stability of a slope the model is a platform for landslide stability modeling developed and verified by authors emadi tafti and ataie ashtiani 2019 the vegetation effects considered in sshv 2d are including 1 soil additional cohesion due to the existence of roots 2 the surcharge load due to weight of vegetation 3 the drag force due to wind blowing 4 the water uptake of roots due to transpiration 5 the interception of rainfall by the canopy and 6 the change in soil hydraulic conductivity occurs in the root zone the first three effects which can be named mechanical effects affect stability equation directly and the influence of other cases is on the hydrological module which considers the infiltration of rainfall and redistribution of soil moisture content in this study two mechanical effects of vegetation addition cohesion by roots and surcharge load are only considered and other effects are ignored notably consideration of hydrological effects increases stability and it is conservative to ignore these emadi tafti and ataie ashtiani 2019 also since the climate of the region is humid and the number of rainy days is noticeable the neglecting of soil matric suction can simulate the most critical state of the slope when the soil moisture has reached its maximum value therefore this assumption is reasonable in the sshv 2d model the limit equilibrium scheme is used for stability analysis the simplified bishop method and janbu s simplified method are available in the program in comparison with different limit equilibrium methods both mentioned methods have a result with good accuracy emadi tafti and ataie ashtiani 2019 the bishop method is used when the slip surface is circular and janbu s methods can be commonly used in non circular slides in this study the slip surface has been assumed to be circular and the simplified bishop method is considered for stability analysis the safety factor is calculated as below in this method 1 s f i 1 n c s c r b w q s u r b u a b tan ϕ u a u w b tan ϕ b m α i i 1 n w q s u r b i sin α i where 2 m α i cos α i sin α i tan ϕ i s f here c s kpa is effective soil cohesion c r kpa is additional cohesion due to root presence w kn is the weight of slice q s u r kpa is the uniform surcharge load caused by vegetation weight u a kpa is pore air pressure usually equals to zero ϕ is the effective internal friction angle u w kpa is pore water pressure u a u w is the matric suction ϕ b is the angle indicating the rate of change in shear strength relative to matric suction in unsaturated zone ϕ b ϕ and in saturated zone ϕ b ϕ b m is the width of the slice α is the inclination of the slice base and s f dimensionless is the safety factor of slope the summation should be conducted on whole slices so n is the number of slices see fig 1 since s f has appeared on both sides of the equation the result is obtained using an iterative method to achieve the lowest sf the different slip circles are examined the circles are defined by centers and radii entered by the user the numerical calculations are performed by the finite difference method fdm in the sshv 2d program so the domain is divided into rectangular cells this brings the slope to be approximated by a stepped edge to reduce the errors due to this approximation the dimensions of the cells can be assumed a small value in this study the horizontal and vertical dimension of cells is considered to 0 1 and 0 05 meter respectively the values are smaller than 1 slope dimensions in the sshv 2d model the reinforcement effect of roots is considered as an additional cohesion applied to bare soil cohesion so in the root zone the apparent cohesion of soil can be expressed as below 3 c c s c r where c kpa is the apparent cohesion of rooted soil c s kpa is the bare unrooted soil cohesion and c r kpa is additional cohesion due to the presence of roots to calculating the additional cohesion two alternatives are available in the current program one the root can be modeled as an individual elastoplastic bar and another the root can be considered as a distributed reinforcer element in this study the second alternative is used because the prior alternative requires more details than the former such as tree position the pullout resistance of root length of root etc the wu waldron method wwm is one of the most simple and well known relationships to the estimation of additional soil cohesion the relationship states the additional cohesion versus strength and geometric properties of roots waldron 1977 wu 1976 wu et al 1979 4 c r i 1 n k i σ r i a r i a where c r kpa is additional cohesion σ r kpa is mobilized tensile stress of roots at the slide plane a r m2 is the cross sectional area of roots at the slide plane a m2 is the cross sectional area of soil at the slide plane and n is the number of roots at the slide plane it is common that the ratio of a r per a is named root area ratio and is denoted by r a r dimensionless the summation sign means these parameters must be measured for each root or each class of roots and then aggregated k at the above equation is a function of the internal friction angle of soil ϕ and the angle between root orientation and the slide plane θ 5 k sin θ cos θ tan ϕ because the measurement of θ is not practical wu et al 1979 calculated the range of k changes at normal variation in ϕ and θ they observed that k is insensitive relatively and varies between 1 0 to 1 3 they substituted k by 1 2 wu et al 1979 moreover they assumed that the mobilized tensile stress in the slide plane is equal to the root tensile strength t r thus the final form of wwm can be expressed as 6 c r 1 2 i 1 n t r i r a r i the comparison between apparent cohesion of rooted soil measured by in situ tests and the theoretical value obtained from eq 3 demonstrated that the wwm overestimates additional cohesion fan and su 2008 operstein and frydman 2000 pollen et al 2004 waldron and dakessian 1981 wu 2013 therefore preti 2006 applied a reduction factor k on wwm and presented a modified version of the wwm as below although he suggested a value of 0 4 for the reduction factor based on experimental measurements other values have been reported in the literature 7 c r 1 2 k i 1 n t r i r a r i the weight of vegetation is another mechanical factor that influences the stability of slopes and is applied as a distributed uniform load on the slope in the sshv 2d program the surcharge load is an inputted parameter in the program to estimation of surcharge load the weight of trees in a region should be predicted and then divided into the area of the region an allometric relationship for the prediction of above ground biomass agb kg of an individual tree can be expressed as below west 2015 8 a g b α d b h β where d b h m is the tree diameter at the breast height 1 35 m and α and β are fitting parameters and vary by tree species jenkins et al 2003 presented the value of α and β from regression analysis for different species in the united states for hardwood species α varies between 0 0837 to 0 1477 and β is in the range of 2 3651 to 2 4835 when d b h is greater than 2 5 cm and is expressed in centimeters jenkins et al 2003 according to these values the a g b is obtained in kilograms based on the above equation the surcharge of trees on a slope can be computed by 9 q s u r 1 a i 1 n a g b g 1 ω where q s u r is the surcharge load kpa g is the gravitational acceleration n kg ω is the wood moisture content dimensionless n is the number of trees in the slope and a is the area of slope m2 at first glance it may be thought that the mean of d b h and the number of tree per hectare can be used to calculating the average surcharge but it should be known that since β is greater than 2 using the mean d b h will lead to a result less than the average surcharge therefore the data of individual trees or at least the number of trees in different diameter classes should be used in computing the surcharge load the size density and species of trees are the parameters affecting the surcharge load the different values of the surcharge load that has been reported in the literature have been collected by emadi tafti and ataie ashtiani 2019 the values include a wide range and vary from 70 to 5000 pa 2 2 site description the hyrcanian forest or caspian forest is a mixed forestry area that is extended along the southern and the southwestern shores of the caspian sea in iran and azerbaijan because the south border of this area is limited to the alborz mountains the region s climate is humid and mild this ancient forest which has about 850 kms long and 1 9 million hectares area is covered by deciduous broadleaved vegetation with about 50 tree and 80 shrub species abdi 2018 the educational and experimental forest of the university of tehran which is named kheyrud forest is located in the middle section of the hyrcanian forest 51 33 e to 51 42 e and 36 28 n to 36 37 n the site is 7 km east of nowshahr port in mazandaran province iran the present study has been performed based on measured data from the mentioned forest the kheyrud forest has an area of about 8000 hectares and is included seven districts see fig 2 the elevation of the site varies between 15 and 2200 m above sea level the climate is humid and mild and the average annual precipitation is about 1200 mm that commonly falls as rainfall the gradient of slopes in the kheyrud forest varies widely as far as in some areas have been seen vertical cliffs navidi and abtahi 2001 fig 3 shows the distribution of the slope gradient for the kheyrud forest it can be seen that the dominant gradient of the site is in the range of 15 to 65 the field observations and published reports indicate that more frequent shallow landslides have occurred in some areas where there are no trees abdi 2018 2014 hayati et al 2018b the landslides are shallow with a depth of about one meter hayati et al 2018b or a little more fig 4 shows two samples of shallow landslides that have occurred in the studied site the more occurrence of the landslides in bare slopes and the measured data for vegetation are the main reasons for the selection of this site to study the dominant tree species in kheyrud forest are oriental beech fagus orientalis hornbeam carpinus betulus persian ironwood parrotia persica and maple acer velutinum moreover alder alnus subcordata maple acer cappadocicum chestnut leaved oak quercus castaneifolia common ash fraxinus excelsior large leaved lime tilia platyphyllos and the like can be observed in this site abdi and deljouei 2019 hayati et al 2018b in the study site the in situ shear test for determination of additional cohesion due to the presence of roots has not been performed unfortunately but some researchers have calculated the additional cohesion of soil by the measurement of roots tensile strength and root area ratio of different species and using wwm abdi 2014 abdi et al 2010a abdi and deljouei 2019 esmaiili et al 2017 in these references 1 the excavated trenches to the measurement of rar and root sampling are at a different distance from the tree s trunk in some cases 0 5 m and in others 1 m 2 the measurement of r a r has been made on 10 cm layers of trenches wall 3 the root sampling has been performed at depth of 30 cm and the tensile strength has been measured in the laboratory 4 in using wwm the values of k and k are different in fig 5 the reported values of cr for different tree species have been shown it should be noted that in these diagrams the values are modified so that k 1 2 and k 1 to allow comparisons between five tree species since the root additional cohesion is highly dependent on the tree dimensions the average of dbh diameter at the breast height and the average height of trees are expressed in the diagrams some researchers have been reported the density and diameter distribution of trees in different regions in the study site bayat et al 2013 haydari et al 2013 mohammadalizadeh et al 2009 the regions are included one parcel to one district for example the diameter distribution of trees in gorazbon district has been reported by bayat et al 2013 that shown in fig 6 by considering this diagram and substituting α 0 0837 β 2 4835 and ω 0 33 in the equation 9 the surcharge load obtains 368 pa in this sample the density of trees is 290 trees per hectares however several times higher densities have also been reported in other regions of the study site hayati et al 2018b javanmiri pour et al 2017 that may lead to more surcharge load the soil of the kheyrud forest is mostly fine grain the most reported soil types are mh ml ch and cl according to the unified soil classification system uscs abdi 2014 abdi et al 2010a abdi and deljouei 2019 esmaiili et al 2017 some reported data which have been measured by in situ and laboratory tests have been listed in table 2 2 3 simulation assumptions and parameters in this study a two dimensional domain is used for the simulation of the slope as shown in fig 7 the ground of the site consists of a surface layer of fine grain soil which is located on a cracked calcareous bedrock abdi 2018 2014 hayati et al 2018b the surface soil is homogeneous and the depth of the layer is denoted by d see fig 7 the field measurements demonstrate that the depth of the surface layer is about 2 3 m commonly hayati et al 2018b therefore in subsequent simulations the value of d is considered as 1 2 and 3 m three types of soil with different strengths have been considered as surface soil the mechanical properties of the assumed soils have been presented in table 3 in the sensitivity analysis more values of the soil properties are considered the height and the angle of the slope are two parameters that are used to define the geometry of the slope these parameters are shown by h and α in fig 7 respectively to reduce the number of model parameters other dimensions of the model have also been defined by these variables in this study the four values of h ranging from 5 m to 20 m h 5m 10m 15m and 20m were assumed to simulations according to the gradient variation map of the site fig 3 the seven different values are assumed for slope angle as α 8 13 18 23 28 33 and 45 another aspect of the model is the trees and roots characteristics based on the measurement data presented in fig 5 two types of trees are considered in the modeling maple tree which represents trees with thicker and deeper roots and common ash tree that exhibits trees with strong shallow roots the additional cohesion distribution in depth is shown in fig 8 for both assumed trees based on the previous sample calculation of tree weight the surcharge load for both assumed trees is considered 0 6 kpa and the values 0 and 1 2 kpa are used for parametric analysis 3 results in this section the results of stability analysis for the mentioned slope in different conditions are presented the factor of safety is the main result of stability analysis for a slope since the stability analysis is performed under different conditions to determine the condition of analysis the safety factors sf are indicated by some subscripts the subscript of r means the reinforcement effect of roots has been considered in the analysis and the subscript of s demonstrates that the surcharge load of trees is applied to the model in the case of bare soil no subscript is used and if both effects are considered both subscripts are exerted together according to the previous section in the current simulations nine parameters contribute as shown in fig 9 in the first part of the simulations the impacts of mechanical aspects of vegetation on the stability of the site s slopes are investigated in the following some parameters are changed beyond the assumed values and the sensitivity of sf against them is assessed the results have been presented below 3 1 the global influence of vegetation mechanical effects on slope stability the assessment of vegetation mechanical effects on the improvement of slope stability is the main aim of the current study fig 10 demonstrates a sample of the overall results of vegetation role on the safety factors the increase in safety factor is calculated as sfrs sf sf the shown ranges on the diagrams demonstrate the variations of the safety factors against changes in the slope angles and the bars are the average of the values the maximum value of each range is related to the largest angle and the minimum value corresponds to the lowest angle this means that as the angle of slope increases the stability of the slope decreases the role of vegetation becomes more important it is noteworthy that the difference between safety factors sfrs sf has inverse behavior compared to relative increase namely the largest increase value is related to the slope with the smallest angle the common ash increases safety factors by 16 4 5 1 and 2 3 averagely when the bedrock located in the depth of 1m 2m and 3m respectively these values are 8 2 3 and 1 1 for the maple tree if the part of the soil where the roots are located to be defined as a root zone then the depth of the root zone is almost equal to the maximum depth of tree roots since in analysis with different d values the depth of the root zone let s call it zr is constant it can be said that the role of vegetation becomes more prominent when the ratio of zr to d decreases notably the slip surface moves a little when the vegetation effects are added to slope stability analysis but these changes are not significant in fact the bedrock mechanical properties are so large relative to the surface layer see fig 7 that the slip surface remains in the surface layer and close to the previous slip surface the assumption is considered based on the site condition 3 2 the influence of slope geometry on slope stability the height h and the angle of the slope α are two major parameters that define the geometry of the slope the analysis demonstrates that the sf is strongly influenced by the slope angle whereas the slope height changes do not have much effect as presented in fig 11 the relationship between the safety factors sfrs and the slope angles α follows a power law r2 0 99 it can also be seen that a line fits well r2 0 75 on the variation of safety factor sfrs versus slope s height h this pattern is observed in a variety of assumed soils tree types and all values of surface soil thickness d the small gradient of the fitted line in the safety factor slope height relationship e g 0 0053 for α 13 indicates that the changes of slope height have not significant effects on the safety factor and can be considered as an unessential parameter in parametric analysis by substituting the safety factor equal to 1 0 the boundary between stability and instability in the relationship that provides the safety factor in terms of slope angle and it leads to a critical slope angle αcr which steeper slopes will naturally be unstable this parameter can be a new criterion for the demonstration of stability improvement the values of the critical slope angle for different slope height and different surface soil depth are presented in fig 12 when d is equal to one on average the common ash and maple trees increase the critical slope angle by 4 6 and 2 2 respectively according to the diagrams increasing the slope height decreases the threshold of instability angle linearly whereas the surface soil thickness affects the critical angle by a power law it is observed that the change in the critical angle due to tree presence is greatly reduced at higher d the changes in the safety factor due to vegetation in terms of geometric parameters h and α are presented in fig 13 the diagrams demonstrate that relative changes in safety factors fluctuate slightly at small slope angles and have an increasing trend on steeper slopes interestingly this upward trend usually begins when the slope angle exceeds the critical angle for example when the slope height is 15 m the tree is common ash and the soil is low strength firstly the relative increase in safety factor is constant and equals to 15 approximately then the relative changes in the safety factor increase with the gradient of 0 4 per degree at slopes steeper than the critical slope the diagrams also demonstrate that the variations of relative changes in the safety factor in terms of slope height are ignorable however absolute changes in safety factors have a decreasing trend concerning both the angle and the height of the slope 3 2 1 the influence of root depth in this study two tree types have been assumed to have the root depth of 0 5 m for maple and 0 4 m for common ash although these depths are constant in various modeling they will be different if they are considered relative to the depth of surface soil the analyses show that higher d reduces the role of the tree in enhancing the slope stability see fig 10 if the relative changes in the safety factors are plotted at the relative depth of roots zr d it can be seen the increase in relative depth of root makes more improvement in the factor of safety see fig 14 this pattern is also seen in the absolute changes in the safety factors 3 2 2 the soil type effects the effects of soil type on the stabilization by vegetation are another aspect that has been investigated the assumed soils in this study are included three different strength soils in low strength soil the cohesion and the internal friction angle of the soil are lowest compared to other soil types both of these parameters increase in soil with medium strength and high strength than the previous type the unit weight of soils is also increased from low strength to high strength soil fig 15 shows the influence of soil strength on the role of vegetation in improving stability when the soil strength increases the changes in the factors of safety decrease for example in a similar condition the common ash increases the safety factor by 0 32 in low strength soil by 0 14 in medium strength soil and by 0 03 in high strength soil see fig 15a at α 13 this declining trend is more severe for relative changes in the safety factors see fig 15b to investigate the effects of the soil properties the mechanical parameters of soil c φ and γ were changed alone initially the internal friction angle of the soil was changed the result is presented in fig 16 it is observed that the change in safety factor has a linear relationship with the internal friction angle r2 0 86 the sign of line gradient is positive increasing in internal friction angle helps the stabilization role of the root but its gradient is low enough so that can be ignored therefore the internal friction angle has not a great impact on stabilization by roots considering in this case study in the following the internal friction angle was considered constant and the factor of safety was calculated for all combinations of cohesion and unit weight values the values of soil cohesion were 0 1 1 8 and 15 kpa and the values of soil unit weight were 14 16 18 and 20 kn m3 the absolute and relative changes in the factor of safety in terms of the unit weight and the cohesion of the soil are plotted in fig 17 the impact of the unit weight depends on the soil cohesion when soil cohesion is low the increase of the unit weight decreases the improving role of the trees in return the unit weight of the soil helps to roots in the slope stabilization where the soil has high cohesion the absolute and relative changes in the factor of safety have a linear trend with good accuracy r2 0 96 the soil cohesion has a negative effect on the stabilizing role of trees the results demonstrate the soil cohesion and the increase in safety factor due to trees have a contradictory effect this negative effect which changes linearly r2 0 99 is exacerbated by the lower the specific weight of the soil because the variation of the safety factor in terms of the soil cohesion is completely linear the relative changes in the safety factors have a homographic trend 3 3 the effect of the tree surcharge on the stability of the slope to study the impact of tree surcharge on stability the safety factor is calculated in three cases no surcharge consideration sfr the assumed surcharge of the tree 0 6 kpa and twice the assumed surcharge 1 2 kpa as shown in fig 18 in this study the tree surcharge desecrates the slope stability in other words sfr always is higher than sfrs the difference between sfr and sfrs decreases with the slope angle has a power trend whereas the relative values have an upward trend the analysis also demonstrates that the variations of the relative increase in the safety factor are linearly related to the amount of the surcharge load see fig 18b these patterns are repeated in other soil types tree types slope heights and surface soil thicknesses by changing in internal friction angle of the soil the impact of this parameter on the stabilization role of trees was investigated the results are presented in fig 19 similar to the previous section it is observed that the impact of the internal friction angle on the effect of tree surcharge on stabilization is ignorable but since the safety factor increases by increasing the internal friction angle the relative decreases in the safety factor of rooted soil have a decreasing trend the negative effect of the surcharge can be so high that it destroys the positive effect of root reinforcement or even overcomes it the unit weight and the cohesion of the soil are other parameters whose impact on the effect of the surcharge has been studied the increase in soil unit weight decreases the negative effect of the surcharge the gradient of declining trend decreases in low cohesion soils so that the effect of soil unit weight can be ignored in low cohesion soils see fig 20 a also the soil cohesion increases the negative effect of the surcharge a line can accurately express this relationship r2 0 999 as shown in fig 20b in low specific weight soils the growth is higher if the relative decrease in the safety factor is considered the growth of the surcharge s negative effects has a declining rate in terms of soil cohesion 3 4 the influence of the reduction factor of wwm on stabilization role of vegetation applying a reduction factor kʺ to wwm may compensate for the overestimation of this model preti 2006 to survey the impact of this factor the analysis is performed for kʺ 0 8 0 6 and 0 4 since the reduction factor scales the additional cohesion caused by the roots this perception may be created that the increased value of the safety factor is scaled on the same factor this conception is true when only the root reinforcement effect is considered sfr when both mechanical aspects reinforcement and surcharge are considered the surcharge load is not scaled by reduction factor and it leads to a greater reduction in the stabilization role of vegetation see fig 21 4 discussion the obtained results in this study demonstrate that the influence of mechanical aspects of vegetation can be widely different and varies from negative to positive values the reported results by other researchers also confirm the wide variation e g chok et al 2004 kokutse et al 2016 lin et al 2010 maffra et al 2019 mao et al 2014 naghdi et al 2013 simon and collison 2002 temgoua et al 2017 the specification of the tree type density depth of root zone and root characteristics and architecture mechanical soil parameters cohesion and specific weight and geometry of slope slope angle and depth of surface layer are effective parameters on the amount of stabilization role of vegetation in this study a relative improvement in the safety factor has been observed up to about 25 about the results two points must be kept in mind first the effect of surcharge load is always associated with root reinforcement effect and reporting the effect of root reinforcement alone e g kokutse et al 2016 simon and collison 2002 temgoua et al 2017 on improving the slope stability sfr sf is far from the truth unless in the assessment of the clearcutting at primary times second in many conditions most stability improvement occurs when the slope is stable enough e g increase in the safety factor is greater when the slope angle is lower however improving stability is needed when the slope is on the instability threshold therefore the enhancement of the safety factor is important where the safety factor is close to one this increment is not a maximum increment necessarily for example the improvement of the safety factor at the threshold of instability is about 15 where the maximum improvement at the same condition is about 25 4 1 the global influence of the mechanical aspects of vegetation on slope stability in the current study the results show that the reinforcement of soil by roots improve slope stability and the surcharge of a tree lowers the stability of slopes the combination of these two aspects depending on which of these is superior to another can improve or worsen the slope stability the root reinforcement is more effective in stability when the slip surface has more interaction with the roots deepening of the root zone and or reducing the slip depth are two major factors that increase interaction between these both in this study zr d has been considered as a representative of these two factors the result demonstrates that the increase in zr d improves the safety factor exponentially fig 14 this is consistent with the result of other researchers arnone et al 2016 chok et al 2004 feng 2016 mao et al 2014 steinacher et al 2009 thus the trees with deeper roots in similar condition can be more effective in slope stability also the role of root reinforcement is more whatever the slide to be shallower the analyses demonstrate that the surcharge load of trees decreases the slope s stability many studies have reported similar results abernethy and rutherfurd 2000 lan et al 2020 simon and collison 2002 steinacher et al 2009 but some other researches have mentioned conflicting results e g kokutse et al 2016 this effect becomes less important when the slip depth increases thus the shallower slide makes the surcharge load effect more worrying accordingly if planting forests are to be used to prevent shallow landslides it is best to use trees with a low surcharge load and deep and strong roots the specifications can make the use of shrubs superior to trees to prevent shallow landslides it is notable that the position of the tree on a slope also affects its stabilization effect in this study all surfaces of the model top middle and toe are covered by trees genet et al 2010 showed that the surcharge load on the toe of the slope can be beneficial and has a detrimental impact on the top and the middle of the slope the reduction factor at the modified wwm scales the additional cohesion to the soil created by roots the analyses appear that the mentioned factor applies similarly to change in the safety factor due to the reinforcing effect but does not affect the surcharge s impact therefore the ratio of safety factor improvement sfrs sf when the reduction factor is applied to not is less than the reduction factor 4 2 the influence of slope geometry on the slope stability of the rooted slope analyses demonstrated that the slope height has not a significant effect on slope stability and stabilization role of vegetation on the contrary the slope angle strongly alters the factor of safety if relative changes in sf are considered in terms of the slope angle it is observed that the relative changes are constant as long as the slope is stable and increase when the slope becomes unstable it is in line with the root reinforcement objective the depth of surface soil d is an essential parameter if it has been considered as a geometric parameter the importance of this parameter was explained in the previous section the depth of bedrock controls the slip depth and the depth of root growth the critical slope angle αcr increases when the mechanical effects of vegetation are considered for example the slope which failed at 25 6 48 will remain stable to 29 9 58 when the common ash tree stabilizes it these values are obtained for the depth of surface soil equal to one meter fig 12 the results of modeling with higher depths of surface soil d show that the critical slope angle does not change much in deep landslides 4 3 the impact of soil parameters in the stabilization of soil by vegetation between the three mechanical properties of the soil assumed in this study the priority of importance is cohesion unit weight and internal friction angle respectively as the soil cohesion increases the contribution of the root reinforcing effect decreases and the surcharge load effect grows although both are undesirable with increasing soil cohesion the stability improves and there is no need to stabilize by vegetation according to analyses the impact of soil cohesion on surcharge load effects is linear for assumed parameters in this work the gradient of the fitted line is of order 10 2 kpa 1 i e per kpa increase in soil cohesion the second decimal place of the improved factor of safety decreases then if the value of cohesion soil is added a few tens kpa the changed safety factor reduced in the first decimal place that is significant in slope stability with referring to the safety factor equation it appears that the decrease in safety factor with increasing soil cohesion returns to surcharge s negative effect otherwise the soil cohesion and the reinforcement effect are independent after cohesion the specific weight of soil is a more effective parameter the increase of soil unit weight decreases both root reinforcing and surcharge load effects the decrease of the surcharge load effect is desirable but the decrease in the reinforcing effect is not in line with stabilization the analyses demonstrate that the combination of these two effects destabilize the slope when the soil cohesion is low the soil stabilization is necessary although according to the parameter used in this study the changes in improved safety factors occur in a second decimal place due to the general decrease of the safety factor caused by the increase of unit weight the relative change in the safety factor is not ignorable the internal friction angle is the third property of the soil whose effect on the stabilization role of vegetation has been investigated the analyses show that the impact of this property on the change of safety factor can be neglected since increasing the internal friction angle improves the safety factor the relative change in the safety factor has a declining trend in terms of internal friction angle 5 conclusion in this study the influence of the mechanical properties of trees on the stability of a slope was investigated the considered parameters for soil tree and slope were based on measurement data at the kheyrud forest in northern iran a two dimensional model was analyzed by the sshv 2d program the reinforcement effect of the tree s root was considered as an additional cohesion that improved soil cohesion and reduced in depth also a uniform surcharge load was applied to all the upper surfaces of the model as the weight of trees moreover the sensitivity analysis was performed to investigate the effects of soil properties and depth of landslide the obtained results which some of them are reported for the first time in the technical literature can be summarized as follows the reinforcing effect of roots has a stabilizing role and the weight of the tree has a destabilizing role for the slope depending on which of the two effects is greater than the other the mechanical effect of trees on slope stability is determined both improvement and worsen cases were observed in analyses in the current study the improvement of the safety factor is observed up to about 25 the relative root zone depth the depth of the root zone related to slip depth is the most important parameter on the mechanical effect of vegetation so the role of vegetation in the prevention of shallow landslides is considerable soil cohesion is the most important mechanical property of soil which affects the stabilization role of vegetation the increase of soil cohesion raises the surcharge s negative effect therefore the soil cohesion and the stabilization role of vegetation are acting on opposite sides since the enhancing of soil cohesion generally improve stability the declining trend of vegetation role is not a concern the specific weight of soil also decreases the stabilization role of vegetation the analyses demonstrated that although the effect of vegetation is reduced the stabilization role is not converted to a destabilization role the result also showed that the impact of the internal friction angle is negligible thus the vegetation is helpful to prevent shallow landslide events however it does not play a significant role in deep landslides it can be suggested that in bioengineering methods for stabilization of a slope the native shrubs or trees with more reinforcing effect strong and deep roots and low surcharge low height and low diameter are more effective in future works the hydrological aspects of vegetation will also be added to mechanical aspects and the role of both will be compared in the stabilization of slopes declaration of
