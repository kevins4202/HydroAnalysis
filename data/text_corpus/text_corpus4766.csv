23830,modeling ocean processes requires a discrete representation of the system geometry which itself contains multiple degrees of freedom especially for systems of large geographical scale this paper assesses the unstructured meshing requirements for a large scale astronomic tide model domain of the western north atlantic ocean gulf of mexico and caribbean sea with telescopic focus of the south atlantic bight united states southeastern seaboard and its estuaries the methodologies of localized truncation error analysis ltea which account only for the model interior and ltea plus complex derivatives cd which account for the model interior and boundary are exploited due to their foundations stemming directly from tidal physics ltea and ltea cd are applied for the m 2 tidal harmonics resulting from linear and nonlinear solutions of the adcirc advanced circulation model based on a highly resolved uniform mesh the resultant target element size distributions are interrogated distinctively for the inshore estuarine region of the south atlantic bight the inlet punctuated coastline the shelf slope rise triad and deep ocean and the open ocean boundary the relatively large size of the ltea computational molecule makes it the suitable choice for the deep ocean offshore and shelf regions where the tidal dynamics are predominantly linear and smoothly changing in space ltea cd is the logical choice for the shallows and estuaries because of the spatial coverage afforded by the combined utility of interior and boundary estimators computational molecules as well as its accounting for the nonlinearities in the evaluation of local truncation error the combination of the two methods enables an almost complete coverage of the domain for generating spacing requirements with ltea cd extending beyond the interior only definition of ltea to capture the inshore regions and model boundaries implementing the approach with ltea and ltea cd to target finer resolution in areas with sharper gradients in the hydrodynamics while relaxing resolution in areas with smoother hydrodynamics resulted in a mesh with a far reduced number of elements 1 3m relative to an overly resolved uniform mesh 10m elements that is comparable in accuracy with 5 tidal amplitude error for 99 of the domain keywords meshing requirements target element size truncation error adcirc coastal systems estuaries 1 introduction computational numerical modeling of shallow water dynamics is an essential tool that scientists and engineers rely upon to study and understand coastal and estuarine hydrodynamics which ultimately translates to critical information useful towards active management priorities for example numerical models at the operational grade inform on public flooding forecasts for coastal rivers and waterways e g the coastal emergency risks assessment system for surge prediction cf blanton et al 2012 and high resolution numerical modeling at the research grade affords scientific developments with coupled hydro environmental processes e g hydro mem a linkage between hydrodynamic physical model and marsh equilibrium model cf alizad et al 2016 numerical modeling applications are broadly ranging in technical scope yet a central component with numerical modeling is the spatial discretization of the model domain typically referred to as either a grid or mesh many hydrodynamic models applied in the coastal and estuarine setting see table 1 for examples work with unstructured grids or meshes of quadrilateral or triangular elements respectively that are variably sized to resolve the domain bathymetry and boundary features accurately and efficiently regardless of the model each employs a set of numerical schemes to solve the shallow water equations that govern the longwave behavior of astronomic tides and storm surge in complexly bounded coastal and estuarine domains the foundation of a deterministic shallow water model is the physics desired to be simulated i e longwave tidal physics the crux of the methodology presented in this paper lies with the assessment of mesh sizing functions that optimally account for the discrete representation of tidal physics the optimality is such that the approach results in a reduction and domain wide uniformization of the truncation error associated with the numerical model the truncation error analysis was derived from the shallow water equations as formulated into the generalized wave continuity equation gwce and is demonstrated herein with the adcirc model westerink et al 2008 numerous techniques exist in the guidance of meshing requirements for coastal and ocean modeling most techniques entail assessing the domain bathymetry or some function thereof e g bathymetric gradient with a common feature being the geometric bathymetric basis of the technique for example three techniques commonly used for generating an a priori mesh sizing function for a large scale ocean shelf domain include 1a a δ 2 h yields δ h 1b a δ 2 1 h yields δ 1 h 1c a δ 2 h h yields δ h h where a represents the area of a triangular element with an edge length of δ and h is the bathymetric depth the relationship of h equates to larger elements in deeper waters relative to smaller elements in shallower waters the relationships with h 1 equate to larger elements over flatter bottoms relative to smaller elements over bathymetric gradients greenberg et al 2007 these three basic sizing functions were developed with a strict purpose of resolving longwaves e g tidal motions in the open ocean over the continental shelf and up to the coastline legrand et al 2007 refer to table 2 for a listing of mesh sizing techniques extending past a strictly geometric basis localized truncation error analysis ltea hagen 1998 was founded upon the physics of the tidal flow viz discernment of the linearized spatial gradients in the hydrodynamics for the generation of an a posteriori mesh sizing function the aforementioned techniques including ltea are applicable for longwave flows in large scale ocean domains with relatively coarse definition of the coastline e g refer to hagen et al 2006 the next challenge dealt with expanding beyond the coastline and into the estuary and intertidal zones to develop meshing requirements for the inshore regions of the model domain there has since been substantial progress in this area of mesh generation with the publication and release of various toolbox utilities including battri bilgili et al 2006 ltea plus complex derivatives cd parrish and hagen 2008 gmsh geuzaine and remacle 2009 admesh conroy et al 2012 and oceanmesh2d roberts et al 2019a an advantageous feature with ltea cd lies with the assessment of the nonlinear tidal physics within the estuary bacopoulos et al 2011 whereas other toolboxes are based strictly on geometry and or bathymetry best practices with tidal and particularly storm surge simulations for coastal and estuarine domains are to employ a large scale modeling approach that telescopes from the deep ocean into the shallows e g refer to bacopoulos et al 2009 such ocean to estuary modeling requires the relative scaling of element sizes and the transition in resolution from the fine coastal feature definition to offshore over the continental shelf and out to the open ocean a consideration with this relative scaling lies with the rate of element size transitions between zones of variable resolution roberts et al 2019b commonly referred to as the gradation of the mesh persson 2006 which is evaluated herein with the sizing functions generated by ltea and ltea cd in this paper ltea and ltea cd are appraised for their collective utility towards defining meshing requirements for a variably resolved ocean to estuary domain to that end we demonstrate in the context of astronomic tidal modeling where ltea is sufficient and where ltea cd is providing clear benefits this variable performance of ltea vs ltea cd is shown to be a function of the unique computational molecules that are necessary to describe the mathematical formulations that enable the definition of derivatives of water surface elevation and flow variables as follows 1 ltea with its use of relatively large finite difference molecule is appropriate in the deep ocean where the tidal dynamics are quasi linear and the velocity gradients are slowly evolving while 2 ltea cd with its use of complex derivative based molecules permits inclusion of boundaries and intricate geometries of the intertidal zones as well as the rapidly changing tidal velocities and the nonlinear nature of the tidal species keeping with the basis formulations the approach is to perform ltea on linear model output and ltea cd on nonlinear model output our recommendation is to consider in tandem the mathematical treatment via the molecule of the numerical method and flow physics through the largely water level based gradients in ltea vs the velocity based gradients and nonlinearities included in ltea cd furthermore even though present day mesh development in the intertidal zone regions is largely geometry driven the advance of hppc high performance parallel computing is enabling the development of meter scale resolution models that will benefit future unstructured mesh generation or the scaling that results from ltea cd 1 1 background the concept of ltea lies with redistributing the nodes of an existing mesh to spread out the localized truncation error as uniformly as possible over the entire model domain hagen et al 2001 to that end ltea is an a posteriori method relying upon an a priori mesh and hydrodynamic solution hagen and parrish 2004 the local truncation error is obtained as the difference between the continuous and discrete forms of the non conservative momentum equations which is estimated by calculating the higher order terms of the numerical approximation hagen et al 2002 the approach of ltea is robust to estimate the local truncation error over a total of 81 points 9 9 structured grid that span four valence elements fig 1 however calculations of truncation error at the boundary and near the boundary in this case up to three to four element layers inward from the boundary are precluded by molecule point s falling outside the model domain the problem of near boundary and boundary calculation was solved with the development of ltea cd parrish and hagen 2008 which reformulates the approximation to be in complex space while additionally accounting for coriolis force and nonlinear bottom stress the solution approach using complex derivatives gave rise to two shapes of computational molecules 1 a 7 node hexagon for the domain interior and 2 an 8 node semi circle that permits for calculation of the local truncation error up to and including the mesh boundary parrish and hagen 2007 the hexagonal and semi circular molecules of ltea cd are small compared with the 9 9 molecule of ltea utilizing only the first layer of valence elements in calculating the local truncation error fig 1 illustrates an example positioning of the ltea and ltea cd computational molecules and the resultant domain wide node coverage as applied to a structured mesh with equilateral triangles in each example the respective molecule is positioned and drawn to scale to calculate the local truncation error at the westernmost mesh node as computationally possible the green dots represent the totality of mesh nodes captured by domain wide application of the respective molecule the 9 9 molecule of ltea cannot capture the boundary and nearby mesh nodes because of the structured grid falling outside the model domain representing the challenge with a larger size molecule in fact the 9 9 molecule captures only six mesh nodes of the overall triangulation in this example however an advantage with the larger size molecule is that it considers information for more points and over a broader spatial range in the calculation of the local truncation error with the 9 9 molecule containing 81 points and spanning four valence shells conversely the ltea cd molecules are small containing only 7 interior or 8 boundary points and span just one valence shell yet the combination of the interior and boundary molecules captures almost all the mesh nodes while only the three vertices per the three elements total of nine mesh nodes that constitute the corners of the triangular model domain are not captured by the ltea cd molecules this example illustrates the inapplicability of computational molecules for mesh nodes of sharply concave boundaries of a model domain even with the 8 node semi circular molecule of ltea cd 1 2 objective at present there exists no formalized guidance on when to apply ltea versus ltea cd besides the differences in the computational molecules ltea and ltea cd differ by their origin and applicability ltea involves a linear assessment of the shallow water dynamics typically driven by singular dominant tidal constituent e g m 2 ltea cd considers nonlinear advection and finite amplitude effects within the hydrodynamic fields as well as nonlinear bottom stress and coriolis effects an objective of this paper is to highlight the various performance aspects of the different computational molecules in calculating local truncation error and generating a target element size distribution as a corollary we provide some general guidance in using the assortment of computational molecules with ltea and ltea cd for meshing requirements of ocean to estuary domains 2 mathematical basis for estimating local truncation error the origin of the localized truncation error analysis involves the two dimensional linearized non conservative momentum equations in harmonic

individual terms designate the center node 0 of the submesh in either case ltea cd or ltea the local truncation error τ ˆ me or τ ˆ me is set to a prescribed value and the complex valued δ is solved for with the modulus of δ selected as the target element size for the local node hereafter symbolized as δ t the variable resolution of the target element size distribution δ t x y is a direct outcome of the method ltea or ltea cd and scalable to meet the specific meshing criteria see e g bacopoulos et al 2011 for ltea the partial derivatives of eq 3 are computed using two dimensional central difference approximations hagen 1998 for the 9 9 molecule the estimates of the second and third order partial derivatives have a leading order accuracy of order four and the fourth and fifth order partial derivatives have a leading order accuracy of order two for ltea cd the derivative term of eq 4 is computed using difference equations parrish and hagen 2008 for the interior case symbolized with ω let f be approximated at any interior point j by a sixth order polynomial f j ω p ˆ j a ˆ t δ j where the vector values of a ˆ a ˆ k k 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 are complex constants and the k th value of

of the zeroth to seventh order terms with o δ 2 accuracy where δ equals the average edge length of the local mesh elements the stencils of ltea 9 9 molecule and ltea cd hexagonal and semi circular molecules fig 2 need not necessarily coincide with the elements of a mesh on which the solution is computed however the central node of the molecule is located on a node of the mesh from which the solution is derived if a neighbor of the central node does not coincide with a mesh node which occurs with non equilateral triangles in an unstructured mesh then the values of the solution i e η ˆ u ˆ and v ˆ per tidal constituent are linearly interpolated onto the neighbor rigorous analysis with mesh configuration of valences of four six and eight has demonstrated the optimal configuration to be a valence of six although a mesh with ranges in valence from four to eight would be acceptable hagen 1998 close examination of the second and fourth order truncation error see eq 3 reveals the fractional coefficients are lowest for all cross derivative terms with a valence of six relative to a valence of four or eight consideration of the jacobian indicates this optimum to be a direct result of the even radial spacing provided by a valence of six burnett 1987 3 domain presentation the western north atlantic tidal wnat model domain encompasses the gulf of mexico caribbean sea and the northern part of the atlantic ocean found west of the 60 w meridian fig 3 major bathymetric features include the continental shelf break depth of 183 m 600 feet dunn 1989 and blake s escarpment 2500 m with respective gradients of 6 and 2 bates and jackson 1987 similar features of sharp bathymetric gradients surround the bahamas bank region the wnat model domain also includes the bay of fundy within the gulf of maine as fronted by georges bank as well as lake maricaibo lake pontchartrain chesapeake bay delaware bay and new york sound a foundational discretization of the wnat model domain is the 333k mesh fig 4 the 333k mesh 333k standing for 333k nodes in the mesh is the eastcoast 2001 mesh mukai et al 2002 with added resolution 1 km placed along the south atlantic bight coastline hagen et al 2006 the eastcoast 2001 mesh was developed with a combination of the wavelength to grid size ratio 100 and the topographic length scale h h 1 00 table 2 and a defined minimum element size generally ranging from 1 to 4 km along the land boundaries and a defined maximum element size of 25 km in the deep atlantic the element size distribution of the 333k mesh contains resolution of 1 km along blake s escarpment and resolution of 1 5 km along the continental shelf break louisiana coastline and bahamas bank region with relatively coarser resolution in the deep ocean fig 5a the south atlantic bight coastline extends from 27 n at west palm beach florida to 35 n at cape lookout north carolina a notable feature with the south atlantic bight is the wide continental shelf which is 140 km wide at its apex at the florida georgia border fig 3 the south atlantic bight coastline is perforated by 64 inlets which are interconnected on the inshore side by the atlantic intracoastal waterway with expansive salt marsh fringing on the estuaries of georgia and south carolina dame et al 2000 bacopoulos and hagen 2017 modeled astronomical tides in the south atlantic bight with a continuous domain telescoping from the deep ocean wnat model domain into the estuaries the mesh definition of the south atlantic bight coastline including the expansive intertidal zones 3700 km 2 along the north florida and georgia involves element sizes generally ranging from 50 to 150 m with a minimum element size of 10 m fig 6 simulating tides with the model domain as a continuum entails resolution that varies by three orders of magnitude i e from tens of meters to tens of kilometers appending the discretization of the south atlantic bight estuaries to the 333k mesh yielded a continuous mesh with 699 175 nodes and 1 296 069 elements table 3 4 methodology 4 1 generation of a priori mesh conceptually an a priori mesh for a large scale model domain can be developed amongst a variety of criteria table 2 for example the 333k mesh was developed manually with a combination of the wavelength to grid size ratio and the topographic length scale mukai et al 2002 including a tremendous manual effort to refine the south atlantic bight coastline hagen et al 2006 herein an a priori mesh is defined with uniform resolution of 3 km domain wide leading up to the nearshore region of the south atlantic bight coastline fig 5b for the purpose of establishing an a priori mesh that is uninfluenced by meshing criteria the fine resolution of the south atlantic bight and its estuaries tens to hundreds of meters remains as defined by the intertidal model codenamed marsh of bacopoulos and hagen 2017 the uniform 3 km resolution of the ocean shelf region transitions to the finer resolution of the south atlantic bight coastline over a 20 km swath running parallel with the coastline fig 6 this a priori mesh with uniform resolution of the large scale domain and near equilateral triangulation is a strategic design such that the triangulation is compatible with the structural spatial basis of the ltea and ltea cd interior molecules viz a valence of six equilateral triangles fig 2 the mesh contains 1 379 854 nodes and 2 662 781 elements table 3 4 2 hydrodynamic model configuration the a priori mesh is applied in two simulations of astronomic tides with the adcirc model westerink et al 2008 firstly the model is implemented in a linear simulation with forcing by the m 2 tidal constituent constant bottom friction is set to 0 0004 s 1 hagen et al 2001 secondly the model is implemented in a nonlinear simulation with forcing by seven tidal constituents k 1 o 1 m 2 s 2 n 2 k 2 and q 1 the nonlinear terms include finite amplitude terms with the minimum allowable depth for wetting and drying set to 0 1 m advection and bottom stress 7a τ c f u 2 v 2 h 7b c f g h 1 3 n 2 where τ is bottom friction c f is the bottom friction coefficient u and v are the depth integrated velocities in the longitudinal and latitudinal directions respectively h is the total water depth h ζ where h equals the bathymetric depth with respect to the vertical datum and ζ equals the water level deviation relative to datum and n is the manning s roughness coefficient manning s roughness is prescribed based on landcover type after bacopoulos and hagen 2017 n 0 020 s m 1 3 for fully wetted zones open water n 0 035 s m 1 3 for emergent herbaceous wetlands and n 0 050 s m 1 3 for woody wetlands geographical coordinates are employed and coriolis effects are enabled horizontal eddy viscosity is set to 5 m2 s 1 the weighting factor used in the generalized wave continuity formulation kinnmark 1985 is set to 0 005 m s 1 for still water depth greater than 10 m and 0 020 m s 1 otherwise kolar et al 1994 boundary forcing consists of tidal constituents amplitude and phase per frequency imposed on the 60 w meridian as derived from the global ocean model of le le provost et al 1998 no flux constraints are imposed on all other mainland island boundaries a total of 45 days is simulated using a time step of 1 s the model simulations are spun up from a cold start with a 10 day forcing ramp the simulated hydrodynamics are harmonically analyzed from day 15 to day 45 to produce amplitudes and phases for water levels and velocities if a mesh node dried out at any instance during the tidal simulation the harmonic results for that mesh node are nullified the harmonic results from the linear and nonlinear simulations are assessed for the m 2 tidal constituent using ltea and ltea cd respectively 4 3 generation of a posteriori meshes two a posteriori meshes are generated for the large scale domain telescoping into the south atlantic bight and its estuaries firstly with the ltea spacing requirements and secondly with ltea cd the a posteriori mesh generation does not involve the inshore regions of the south atlantic bight whereby the mesh definition of the estuaries is kept as is refer to bacopoulos et al 2011 for mesh resolution assessment of the south atlantic bight estuaries then the resolution at the inlets becomes the common seam between the existing triangulation of the estuaries and the a posteriori mesh generation in the nearshore and extending into the shelf and deep ocean therefore the spacing requirements are scaled uniformly i e δ a δ t where a is a uniform scaling factor applied to the target size subscript t such that δ matches with the resolution at the inlets the boundary of the large scale domain is the same in terms of feature definition e g chesapeake bay delaware bay long island sound and gulf of maine along the mid and north atlantic seaboards meshing is accomplished with surface water modeling system sms aquaveo 2021 using a scalar paving density algorithm for triangulation where the scalar dataset is the scaled ltea or ltea cd spacing requirement δ the two a posteriori meshes are implemented in nonlinear simulations of astronomic tides with the adcirc model westerink et al 2008 the first a posteriori mesh is based on ltea fig 5c containing 699 747 nodes and 1 302 776 elements for the deep atlantic and telescoping into the estuaries of the south atlantic bight and the second a posteriori mesh is based on ltea cd fig 5d containing 700 861 nodes and 1 304 577 elements table 3 both a posteriori meshes exhibit variable resolution with finer resolution of the shallows and bathymetric gradients e g the bahama banks and the shelf break respectively and coarser resolution in the open areas of the deep atlantic 4 4 interpretation of ltea and ltea cd spacing requirements the spacing requirements are interpreted in terms of spatial gradients of water level and velocity contained in the model solution this interpretation is intended to confirm the fundamental basis of ltea and ltea cd upon which the spacing requirements are calculated from the higher order derivative terms of the solution approximation see eqs 3 and 4 these spatial gradients are calculated directly from the model solution as follows the water level gradient at a local node is the average among all nodes that connect with the local node of the rise difference of η amp where amp stands for amplitude between the local node and the adjacent node over the run element side length the velocity gradient is calculated similarly except that the variable of interest is the semi major axis which is a scalar representation of the velocity vector data u ˆ and v ˆ gonella 1972 5 results 5 1 ltea and ltea cd spacing requirements generated from a priori mesh the a priori model mesh and adcirc simulation results of harmonic water levels η ˆ and depth integrated velocities u ˆ and v ˆ are evaluated with ltea and ltea cd see eq 2 to generate spacing requirements for the large scale domain telescoping into the south atlantic bight and its estuaries the spacing requirements are assessed in four ways see fig 4 for geographical reference 1 the fully wetted zones of the south atlantic bight estuaries 2 the coastline running the full length of the south atlantic bight 3 a section line at 30 n extending seaward from the south atlantic bight coastline 81 w 60 w and 4 the open ocean boundary of the large scale model domain as located along the 60 w meridian 5 1 1 fully wetted zones of the south atlantic bight estuaries there are 215 773 mesh nodes inside the fully wetted zones of the south atlantic bight estuaries ltea and ltea cd can compute spacing requirements for 22 748 and 203 667 nodes respectively over this same region ltea can calculate spacing requirements for only little over ten percent 11 of the mesh nodes which corresponds to just 20 of the inshore fully wetted surface area fig 6 illustrates the minimal spatial coverage of ltea due to the constraint of the shorelines and channel banks with respect to the size of the computational molecule 9 9 cf fig 1a with only a few points 62 inside the fully wetted zones of the st mary s river st andrew sound and st simon sound it should be noted that truncation error estimates are not calculated when the molecule overlaps intertidal zones since the solution contaminates the harmonic analysis conversely ltea cd can compute for over ninety percent 94 of the mesh nodes or 92 of the surface area table 4 conveys the element sizing of the a priori mesh and size estimations from ltea and ltea cd for nodes of the a priori mesh in the south atlantic bight estuaries only nodes for which ltea provided an estimate are included total of 22 748 nodes the a priori mesh sizing ranges 1 st 99th percentiles from 40 to 486 m with median value 50 th percentile of 172 m and interquartile range 25 th 75th percentiles of 130 237 m the scales from ltea and ltea cd are greater than the mesh sizing by multiples multiples of the ltea scales relative to the mesh sizing range from 2 8 to 28 2 with median value of 6 6 multiples of the ltea cd scales relative to the mesh sizing range from 1 3 to 3 9 with median value of 2 1 the percentile measures reflect the inclination of the spacing requirements to specify larger multiples for larger mesh sizes and vice versa more so with ltea than with ltea cd the spacing requirements of ltea and ltea cd differdue to the combined effect of i linear ltea versus nonlinear ltea cd simulation and ii the different formulations of ltea eq 3 and ltea cd eq 4 the former effect is interpreted with the velocity gradients associated with the linear ltea and nonlinear ltea cd simulations of astronomic tides fig 7 the distributions of velocity gradients are similar in shape with positive skewness but differ by one to two orders of magnitude in central location percentile values 25th 50th and 75th of velocity gradients for the linear simulation are 1 4 and 12 10 6 s 1 table 4 corresponding percentile values for the nonlinear simulation are 329 953 and 2828 10 6 s 1 which equates to a multiple ratio of nonlinear versus linear of 300 the latter effect of the ltea and ltea cd formulations deals with i the physical terms contained in the formulation eq 2 and ii the mathematics and numerical computational molecules of ltea and ltea cd fig 1 5 1 2 coastline running the full length of the south atlantic bight the spacing requirements generated by ltea cd are compared with the a priori mesh sizing for a polyline running 1400 km along the entire length of the south atlantic bight coastline fig 8 there is a similar behavior exhibited between the two curves albeit with a discernible bias of the ltea cd sizing being greater than the a priori mesh sizing the a priori mesh sizing and ltea cd spacing requirements are assessed at points representing the inlets and in between the inlets fig 9 where the inlets represent the splice point between the inshore region and the offshore the histogram for the a priori mesh sizing illustrates near identical shape and location between the distributions of inlets and in between inlets this commonality of the distributions reinforces the design feature of the a priori mesh with consistent spacing along the full coastline length of the south atlantic bight percentile values 25th 50th and 75th of the distributions are 65 178 and 291 m at the inlets and 57 176 and 295 m in between the inlets table 5 on the contrary the histogram for the ltea cd spacing requirements features distributions of less similar shape with a positive translation i e increase in element sizing of the in between inlets distribution versus the inlets the 25th 50th and 75th percentile values of the in between inlets distribution are 201 309 and 531 m which are larger by upwards of 150 m relative to the inlets 126 241 and 399 m beginning with an a priori mesh that consistently resolves the south atlantic bight coastline the ltea cd spacing requirements suggest coarser resolution in between the inlets relative to finer resolution at the inlets for example multiples for the mesh sizing ratio of inlets versus in between inlets across the range of percentile values are 1 1 1 0 and 1 0 whereas the respective multiples for ltea cd are 0 6 0 8 and 0 8 this variability of finer and coarser resolution for the inlets and in between the inlets respectively is explained by larger velocity gradients at the inlets on the order of 10 4 10 3 s 1 relative to smaller velocity gradients in between the inlets 10 5 s 1 the velocity gradients at the inlets are 10 100 times greater than those exhibited in between the inlets this relationship follows the fundamental basis of localized truncation error analysis hagen 1998 and the basic property that the local element size in this case defined by spacing requirements is inversely proportional with the local resolution of the physics in this case defined by velocity gradient westerink et al 1994 5 1 3 section line at 30 n a section line runs latitudinally along 30 n and extends seaward from the south atlantic bight coastline 81 w to the open ocean boundary at 60 w fig 4 features along the bathymetric profile include the coast continental shelf and break blake s plateau and escarpment and deep abyss fig 10a the shelf break and blake s escarpment are two distinctive bathymetric features of high relief fig 10b the shelf break lies at an approximate depth of 183 m 600 feet dunn 1989 with a sharp bathymetric gradient of 0 020 table 6 blake s escarpment lies at a depth of 2500 m with an even sharper bathymetric gradient of 0 066 the continental shelf blake s plateau and deep abyss are relatively flat with bathymetric gradients less than 0 001 bathymetric depth and gradient are used to inform the three mesh sizing functions of eq 1 along the section line fig 10c for comparison against the different mesh scales the sizing function of h provides a simplified variation in element size with direct relation to the bathymetric depth the other two sizing functions capture the bottom features of large bathymetric gradients e g the continental shelf break and blake s escarpment among the three sizing functions h h reflects the desired outcomes of finer resolution in shallow waters and or over sharp bottom relief greenberg et al 2007 in practical application a ceiling value can be assigned to handle discontinuities i e when the gradient is zero or very small fig 10d displays the sizing functions along the 30 n section line for the 333k mesh the a priori 3 km uniform mesh and the two a posteriori meshes of the western north atlantic tidal model domain with fine resolution of the south atlantic bight the 333k mesh was developed primarily based on the h h criterion and as such the mesh sizing along the section line reflects the estimation by h h fig 10c the sizing function of the 333k mesh is 3 8 and 2 0 km on the shelf and at the break respectively which compares with 0 3 and 0 1 km for the h h estimation table 6 similarly the 333k mesh sizing is 8 3 and 1 0 km for blake s plateau and escarpment respectively compared with 1 2 and 0 2 km for h h the resolution of the a priori mesh is 300 m at the coast which transitions abruptly to the uniform resolution of 3 km that spans across the remainder of the section line beginning with a mesh of uniform resolution both ltea and ltea cd produce spacing requirements that vary along the section line with the bathymetric profile particularly at areas with sharp bottom relief for example the mesh sizing at the shelf break is 2 7 and 3 0 km for ltea and ltea cd respectively and 4 6 and 5 2 km at blake s escarpment conversely the mesh sizing is 4 9 and 4 5 km for ltea and ltea cd respectively for the relatively flat bottom of blake s plateau there is a resemblance between the ltea and ltea cd spacing requirements and the 333k mesh finally the spacing requirements for ltea are discernibly larger than those for ltea cd in the deep abyss with mesh sizing 8 5 km for ltea versus 7 5 km for ltea cd the difference in the spacing requirements of ltea and ltea cd fig 10d is explained by the gradients in water level fig 10e and velocity fig 10f associated with the linear ltea and nonlinear ltea cd simulations of astronomic tides the water level gradients of the nonlinear simulation are greater than those of the linear simulation up until the deep abyss 66 w where the two curves intersect after which the opposite is the case similar behavior is found in the velocity gradients with a convergence of the two curves beyond the deep abyss eastward of 66 w the water level gradients of the nonlinear simulation 0 68 10 6 are upwards of four times greater than those of the linear simulation 0 18 10 6 at the shelf break table 6 similarly the velocity gradients at the shelf break are 9 86 10 6 s 1 for the nonlinear simulation and 1 39 10 6 s 1 for the linear simulation which equates to a seven fold difference these differences in the gradients of water level and velocity are also exhibited at blake s escarpment with a four fold difference in the water level gradient 0 14 10 6 nonlinear simulation versus 0 04 10 6 linear simulation and a ten fold difference in the velocity gradient 0 19 10 6 s 1 nonlinear versus 0 02 10 6 s 1 linear finally the velocity gradients in the deep abyss are hardly detectable 0 01 10 6 s 1 with both the nonlinear and linear simulations whereas there is a measurable amplitude with the water level gradients 0 08 10 6 5 1 4 open ocean boundary at 60 w the open ocean boundary runs along the 60 w meridian over a distance of 4148 km spanning latitudinally from 8 n venezuela south america to 46 n nova scotia canada fig 4 the depths along the open ocean boundary are for the most part on the order of thousands of meters with relative shallows of 100 m at the peripheries fig 11a the sizing functions are presented in fig 11b for the 333k mesh the a priori 3 km uniform mesh and the a posteriori mesh based on ltea cd of the western north atlantic tidal model domain with fine resolution of the south atlantic bight the ltea spacing requirements are not assessed for the open ocean boundary due to the lack of boundary definition with the 9 9 molecule fig 1a the curve along ln δ 1 relates to the uniform 3 km resolution of the a priori mesh starting with this uniform distribution of element sizes along the open ocean boundary ltea cd generates an element size distribution that ranges over one e folding i e ln δ max δ min 2 the ltea cd sizing distribution reflects that of the 333k mesh sizes with larger elements in the deep waters albeit lesser in magnitude by a factor of e the element size distributions are inversely related with the velocity gradients along the open ocean boundary fig 11c velocity gradients are 1 10 6 s 1 in the shallows versus 0 001 0 1 10 6 s 1 in the deep waters corresponding with smaller and larger element sizes respectively 5 2 performance of a posteriori meshes ltea and ltea cd the runtimes associated with the numerical simulations are provided in table 7 all simulations were performed on the same system including cpu compute nodes each with two 24 core intel cascade lake intel xeon platinum 8260 processor cpus 192 gb memory and 600 gb hdd foremost the compute performance of the a posteriori meshes is essentially the same between ltea and ltea cd next the increased computational expense due to the inclusion of nonlinear terms is exhibited with the two implementations linear vs nonlinear of the a priori mesh finally the increased computational expense with the split by four version of the a priori mesh is associated with the increased computational density i e number of nodes per processor of the numerical simulation performance of the model solutions from the various meshes is assessed in terms of cumulative area fraction errors cafe hagen et al 2001 as a basis for the error statistic a true solution is developed from a split by four version of the a priori mesh the split by four mesh contains 5 422 835 nodes and 10 651 124 elements table 3 the resolution of which is 1 5 km throughout the domain of all the meshes defined in this study the split by four mesh affords the finest resolution for 99 of the total domain area which is surpassed only by the 333k mesh for a limited area 1 of the total domain of coastal louisiana and blake s escarpment with resolution of 1 km the error statistic used to evaluate the ltea and ltea cd meshes as well as the 333k mesh including the south atlantic bight estuaries is defined by 8 e rel 100 ξ m ξ 0 ξ 0 where e rel is the relative error ξ is the model solution and the subscripts m and 0 stand for the mesh under evaluation and truth split by four mesh respectively error is evaluated for two components of the model solution 1 the harmonic water level amplitude and 2 the semi major axis as a tidal ellipse parameter derived from the harmonic velocity amplitude and phase gonella 1972 a focus is placed on the m 2 tidal constituent since it is the predominant constituent in the south atlantic bight low tidal amplitude errors absolute value less than 0 5 are found in the western north atlantic ocean moderate errors abs within 1 2 5 in the caribbean sea gulf of mexico and gulf of maine and high errors abs greater than 5 over georges bank and the bahama banks fig 12 there are no discernible errors manifested along the open ocean boundary which corroborates the water level boundary condition is sufficiently transmitting the tidal forcing into the model regardless of the boundary resolution overall error magnitudes are greater with the ltea cd mesh relative to the ltea mesh the error magnitudes are small 0 5 in the deep atlantic regardless of the mesh under evaluation the error signage is switched between the two a posteriori meshes and the 333k mesh for the caribbean sea and gulf of mexico including the west florida shelf some of the large errors in the large scale domain with magnitude greater than 5 are meaningless because of the very small m 2 water level amplitude 1 cm fig 13 e g the central axis of errors running north south through the gulf of mexico lake maricaibo and south of puerto rico more meaningful errors within the large scale domain include those inside the gulf of maine where m 2 water level amplitudes are upwards of 6 m due to resonant properties over georges bank which has shallow depths in the general range of 30 60 m and within the bahama banks which are very shallow with depths less than 10 m errors in the model solution of semi major axis are most expressive along bathymetric gradients inside the domain including the shelf break and blake s escarpment fig 14 errors are greatest within the bahama banks at 5 10 and upwards of 20 errors with the velocity solution are manifested along the open ocean boundary unlike the tidal amplitude errors because of the dirichlet type boundary condition with specification of water level whereby the depth integrated velocity is a free variable in the model solution in general error magnitudes are greater with the ltea cd mesh relative to the ltea mesh like the tidal amplitude errors the error signage with velocity semi major axis is switched between the two a posteriori meshes and the 333k mesh in some areas e g within the caribbean sea and gulf of mexico including the west florida shelf the performance difference between the two a posteriori meshes and the 333k mesh is also expressed within the gulf of maine and over georges bank where simulated m 2 velocities semi major axis are 1 2 m s 1 fig 15 with relative errors of 2 5 5 added validation of the model solutions for velocity semi major axis is performed at six velocity gaging stations located on the continental shelf of the south atlantic bight see inset in fig 15 the six stations sourced from blanton et al 2004 are situated on the inner or mid shelf at depths of 11 35 m table 8 the data range from 7 to 30 cm s 1 over the six stations and the model replicates this spatial variability in the velocity semi major axis the model solution of semi major axis is the same with a precision of cm s 1 for all six stations regardless of the mesh comparing against the data with error of zero or in the single percentages and up to only 14 at one of the stations cafe plots of the relative errors illustrate a converged solution for the a priori mesh the two a posteriori meshes and the 333k mesh including the south atlantic bight estuaries fig 16 the cafe plots present under and over prediction errors versus a cumulative percentage of the total area exceeded by a respective error hagen et al 2001 a perfect solution would result in a single vertical line plotted at zero on the x coordinate the lower bound on the y coordinate is 1 of the cumulative domain area which means the error levels associated with 99 of the total domain area are plotted solution convergence is expressed in the cafe plot with collapse of the curve towards a perfect solution all mesh solutions are based on nonlinear tidal simulation the a priori mesh performs the best of all meshes which should be expected considering the greater nodal density of approximately twice as many nodes as the other comparative meshes table 3 the a posteriori meshes perform relatively the same between ltea and ltea cd with 99 of the domain area exhibiting a tidal amplitude error within 5 and a semi major axis sema error within 12 table 9 it worth noting the slight outperformance with ltea relative to ltea cd the a posteriori meshes perform comparably with the 333k mesh including the south atlantic bight for sema error ltea and ltea cd are an improvement over the 333k mesh 6 discussion a primary reason for the difference in performance of the linear ltea and nonlinear ltea cd simulations of astronomic tides is bottom friction the linear simulation employs a constant bottom friction set to 0 0004 s 1 the nonlinear simulation utilizes a manning s roughness formulation for bottom friction see eq 7 considering a manning s n value of 0 020 s m 1 3 for open water and a tidal speed of 1 m s 1 bottom friction adjusts with the depth of the water column h for example as 0 0040 s 1 for 1 m water depth 0 0004 s 1 for 5 5 m and 10 4 s 1 for 20 m or greater throughout most of the model domain and time bottom friction in the linear simulation is greater than by orders of magnitude that of the nonlinear simulation this greater bottom stress applied in the linear simulation relative to the nonlinear simulation is manifested through the simulated tides with more dynamics e g larger gradients in water levels and velocities in the nonlinear simulation versus the linear simulation the less more dynamics in the simulated tides with the linear nonlinear simulations yields larger smaller element sizing in the ltea and ltea cd spacing requirements respectively a nuance with ltea versus ltea cd is the non inclusion of bottom friction in the mathematical formulation see eq 2 which is the reason for performing ltea on linear model output and ltea cd on nonlinear model output to that end the truncation error estimator of ltea cd see eq 4 contains three physical components of the governing equations inertia ω coriolis effect f and bottom friction τ significance can be computed as the ratio of the magnitude of an individual term ω f or τ relative to the sum of all terms of the right hand side of eq 4 the significance of bottom friction is near negligible 1 in deep water but is 125 over the continental shelf and 185 inside the estuaries bacopoulos et al 2011 the ratio values greater than 100 are due to the cancellation of terms on the right hand side this impact of bottom friction is a key reason for the larger smaller element sizing in the ltea and ltea cd spacing requirements inside the estuaries and over the continental shelf another discernment of the ltea and ltea cd spacing requirements is the gradation i e rate of element size transitions between zones of variable resolution persson 2006 9 γ 100 δ j δ k x j x k where δ and x are element edge length and position respectively the subscripts j and k denote adjacent elements and γ expressed as a percentage is gradation typical thresholds of γ for unstructured meshes in shallow water modeling are 15 35 higher γ values will lead to overly coarse elements in areas away from the zones of high resolution subsequently degrading the discrete bathymetric representation in the model roberts et al 2019b it has also been shown that high gradation value e g γ 50 leads to the introduction of truncation errors and degrades the overall accuracy of the numerical solution hagen et al 2000 the gradations of the ltea and ltea cd spacing requirements are at most 17 γ indicative of smoothly changing size functions the spacing requirements generated with ltea and ltea cd can be scaled according to a desired mesh design e g absolute minimum or maximum element size element size for feature definition boundary or interior e g shelf break and or the total number of elements in the mesh the gradation of the sizing function remains constant with scaling if the scaling is applied uniformly over the domain alternatively the scaling of the sizing function can be associated with other meshing constraints e g minimum mesh size feature size grade slope and or submarine channels roberts et al 2019b to provide a comprehensive compatibility amongst the host of meshing constraints all considered the spacing requirements of ltea and ltea cd can be readily combined with existing meshing routines e g admesh conroy et al 2012 and oceanmesh2d roberts et al 2019a for improved methods and outcomes of automatic mesh generation viz incorporation of tidal physics into the meshing process although applied herein for astronomic tides the evaluation of flow gradients by ltea and ltea cd make their assessment of target element size applicable for other longwave dynamics bacopoulos 2018 as an immediate extension the spatial gradients associated with storm surge are like those for astronomic tidal flows i e more dynamic in the shallows relative to the deeper waters moreover since tide and storm surge modeling within the estuarine domain entails overland flows bilskie et al 2020 it makes sense to extend the applicability of ltea and ltea cd into the marshes coastal wetlands and other topographical features of the estuary finally such physically based spacing requirements can also extend to other physics e g short waves some formalized guidance on applying ltea and ltea cd is extracted from the study as follows prefaced by the importance of high fidelity bathymetric data and quality definition of the contiguous shoreline providing the foundational information for mesh development firstly it is advised to begin with ltea since it is based on linear tide simulation from which an essential level of insight into the tidal physics of the domain and the resolution thereof can be efficiently discerned care should be taken with the a priori mesh such that it is not overly coarse and lacking in basic definition of the bathymetry and thusly the tidal dynamics from which the spacing requirements are determined an alternative approach is to begin with an overly resolved mesh and apply ltea or ltea cd in an iterative manner for mesh optimization bacopoulos 2018 the 9 9 molecule of ltea evaluates the higher order terms of the truncation error over a broader spatial range relative to ltea cd by a factor of four in distances size i e four valence shells with ltea versus one valence shell with ltea cd as applied to a mesh with equilateral triangles fig 1 aside from the mathematical details of each method viz order of numerical accuracy the spatial aspects i e size with the computational molecules alone are cause for the varied performance of ltea and ltea cd more rigorous analysis to disentangle the individual components of numerical method accuracy and the computational molecule size is a subject of future work secondly the ltea cd spacing requirements are valid for the model boundary and adjacent three to four layers of elements where ltea cannot compute a spacing requirement to that end ltea cd provides a clear benefit over ltea in areas with complicated boundaries fig 17 shows such examples of complex configuration where ltea cd prescribes a greater proportion of nodes overall and along the boundary in the graphic displayed for the bay of fundy the ltea mesh contains 4067 nodes with 421 of them defining the boundary whereas the ltea cd mesh contains upwards of twice the number of nodes at 7043 nodes with 632 of them defining the boundary similarly the ltea mesh contains 944 nodes with 146 of them defining the boundary in the graphic displayed for lake maricaibo which contrasts against the ltea cd mesh with over twice the number of nodes at 2166 nodes and 253 of them defining the boundary at the coastal land margin ltea is impractical inside the intricate domain e g the estuaries of the south atlantic bight which makes ltea cd the logical choice for such shallow and tightly bounded regions the relative performance of the approaches ltea and ltea cd is manifested in different ways both approaches produce similarly distributed spacing requirements fig 5 such that the underlying information is essentially the same both methods are sensitive to water depth bathymetric gradient h and changes in bathymetric gradient 2 h including bottom features like the continental shelf break and blake s escarpment as represented by the corresponding local flow field ltea produces a wider range of target element sizes and more variability in the spacing requirements than ltea cd the larger computational molecule of ltea spans over a wider range of elements than the ltea cd molecule and thus captures a wider range of the variability in the local flow field not displayed here but a smoothing of the spacing requirements followed by a normalization parrish and hagen 2007 reveals common trends between the ltea and ltea cd target element sizes similarly it is reasoned that the slightly smaller errors with the ltea mesh relative to the ltea cd mesh fig 16 is due to the larger computational molecule and greater capture of the flow field variability the geographical distributions of over underprediction are nearly identical with ltea and ltea cd fig 12 the large negative sema errors inside the gulf of maine are the likely result of inadequate definition of the local geometry especially considering that the system exhibits tidal resonance there is a slightly more muted sema error with the ltea mesh relative to the ltea cd in the caribbean sea and inside chesapeake bay relative to the 333k mesh the greatest improvements with ltea and ltea cd are found on the west florida shelf inside chesapeake bay and delaware bay and along the northern gulf of mexico the ltea and ltea cd meshes inherently account for the tidal flow dynamics whereas the 333k mesh was designed strictly based on the domain bathymetry and bathymetric gradients to that end it is not surprising that the ltea and ltea cd meshes perform comparably with or slightly better than the 333k mesh 7 conclusion the development of unstructured finite element meshes for ocean and coastal circulation modeling of a large scale domain with intricate coastal feature definition entails a collection of meshing constraints a priori meshes can be designed objectively based on local feature size bathymetric gradients tidal wavelengths minimum and maximum mesh size submarine channels and gradation e g see bilgili et al 2006 conroy et al 2012 and roberts et al 2019a such feature driven a priori approaches adjust the resolution to match both the physical system s length scale and estimated length scales of the dominant physics wherein the physical scales are estimated with heuristics e g wavelength to grid scale and topographic length scale to supplement the established a priori meshing criteria the a posteriori methodologies presented in this paper adjust the resolution based on the discrete representation of the physics via numerical truncation error estimation the methodologies ltea localized truncation error analysis and ltea cd plus complex derivatives are demonstrated as physics based approaches for the robust definition of resolution requirements for large scale shallow water model domain with high feature definition of the coastal land margin ltea which is formulated upon a linearization of the tidal physics and employed with linear tide simulation is appropriate for the deep abyss and other regions of low bathymetric relief where the tidal dynamics are smoothly changing over space ltea cd accounts for bottom friction and the nonlinearities of the tidal physics while able to compute a spacing requirement for the model boundary making it the logical choice for the nearshore and coastline both ltea and ltea cd capably resolve the bathymetric features and more importantly the hydrodynamic gradients in the shallow water flow in the shelf ocean region whereby ltea cd resolves the estuarine shallows and tightly bounded features of the inshore region although demonstrated for the western north atlantic ocean out to the 60 w meridian telescoping into the south atlantic bight estuaries southeastern united states the workflows of ltea and ltea cd can be readily translated to other shallow water adcirc model domains with complex basin geometry the methodologies were developed specifically for adcirc with solution of the shallow water equations in the gwce formulation such that application to other models with

23830,modeling ocean processes requires a discrete representation of the system geometry which itself contains multiple degrees of freedom especially for systems of large geographical scale this paper assesses the unstructured meshing requirements for a large scale astronomic tide model domain of the western north atlantic ocean gulf of mexico and caribbean sea with telescopic focus of the south atlantic bight united states southeastern seaboard and its estuaries the methodologies of localized truncation error analysis ltea which account only for the model interior and ltea plus complex derivatives cd which account for the model interior and boundary are exploited due to their foundations stemming directly from tidal physics ltea and ltea cd are applied for the m 2 tidal harmonics resulting from linear and nonlinear solutions of the adcirc advanced circulation model based on a highly resolved uniform mesh the resultant target element size distributions are interrogated distinctively for the inshore estuarine region of the south atlantic bight the inlet punctuated coastline the shelf slope rise triad and deep ocean and the open ocean boundary the relatively large size of the ltea computational molecule makes it the suitable choice for the deep ocean offshore and shelf regions where the tidal dynamics are predominantly linear and smoothly changing in space ltea cd is the logical choice for the shallows and estuaries because of the spatial coverage afforded by the combined utility of interior and boundary estimators computational molecules as well as its accounting for the nonlinearities in the evaluation of local truncation error the combination of the two methods enables an almost complete coverage of the domain for generating spacing requirements with ltea cd extending beyond the interior only definition of ltea to capture the inshore regions and model boundaries implementing the approach with ltea and ltea cd to target finer resolution in areas with sharper gradients in the hydrodynamics while relaxing resolution in areas with smoother hydrodynamics resulted in a mesh with a far reduced number of elements 1 3m relative to an overly

systems estuaries 1 introduction computational numerical modeling of shallow water dynamics is an essential tool that scientists and engineers rely upon to study and understand coastal and estuarine hydrodynamics which ultimately translates to critical information useful towards active management priorities for example numerical models at the operational grade inform on public flooding forecasts for coastal rivers and waterways e g the coastal emergency risks assessment system for surge prediction cf blanton et al 2012 and high resolution numerical modeling at the research grade affords scientific developments with coupled hydro environmental processes e g hydro mem a linkage between hydrodynamic physical model and marsh equilibrium model cf alizad et al 2016 numerical modeling applications are broadly ranging in technical scope yet a central component with numerical modeling is the spatial discretization of the model domain typically referred to as either a grid or mesh many hydrodynamic models applied in the coastal and estuarine setting see table 1 for examples work with unstructured grids or meshes of quadrilateral or triangular elements respectively that are variably sized to resolve the domain bathymetry and boundary features accurately and efficiently regardless of the model each employs a set of numerical schemes to solve the shallow water equations that govern the longwave behavior of astronomic tides and storm surge in complexly bounded coastal and estuarine domains the foundation of a deterministic shallow water model is the physics desired to be simulated i e longwave tidal physics the crux of the methodology presented in this paper lies with the assessment of mesh sizing functions that optimally account for the discrete representation of tidal physics the optimality is such that the approach results in a reduction and domain wide uniformization of the truncation error associated with the numerical model the truncation error analysis was derived from the shallow water equations as formulated into the generalized wave continuity equation gwce and is demonstrated herein with the adcirc model westerink et al 2008 numerous techniques exist in the guidance of meshing requirements for coastal and ocean modeling most techniques entail assessing the domain bathymetry or some function thereof e g bathymetric gradient with a common feature being the geometric bathymetric basis of the technique for example three techniques commonly used for generating an a priori mesh sizing function for a large scale ocean shelf domain include 1a a δ 2 h yields δ h 1b a δ 2 1 h yields δ 1 h 1c a δ 2 h h yields δ h h where a represents the area of a triangular element with an edge length of δ and h is the bathymetric depth the relationship of h equates to larger elements in deeper waters relative to smaller elements in shallower waters the relationships with h 1 equate to larger elements over flatter bottoms relative to smaller elements over bathymetric gradients greenberg et al 2007 these three basic sizing functions were developed with a strict purpose of resolving longwaves e g tidal motions in the open ocean over the continental shelf and up to the coastline legrand et al 2007 refer to table 2 for a listing of mesh sizing techniques extending past a strictly geometric basis localized truncation error analysis ltea hagen 1998 was founded upon the physics of the tidal flow viz discernment of the linearized spatial gradients in the hydrodynamics for the generation of an a posteriori mesh sizing function the aforementioned techniques including ltea are applicable for longwave flows in large scale ocean domains with relatively coarse definition of the coastline e g refer to hagen et al 2006 the next challenge dealt with expanding beyond the coastline and into the estuary and intertidal zones to develop meshing requirements for the inshore regions of the model domain there has since been substantial progress in this area of mesh generation with the publication and release of various toolbox utilities including battri bilgili et al 2006 ltea plus complex derivatives cd parrish and hagen 2008 gmsh geuzaine and remacle 2009 admesh conroy et al 2012 and oceanmesh2d roberts et al 2019a an advantageous feature with ltea cd lies with the assessment of the nonlinear tidal physics within the estuary bacopoulos et al 2011 whereas other toolboxes are based strictly on geometry and or bathymetry best practices with tidal and particularly storm surge simulations for coastal and estuarine domains are to employ a large scale modeling approach that telescopes from the deep ocean into the shallows e g refer to bacopoulos et al 2009 such ocean to estuary modeling requires the relative scaling of element sizes and the transition in resolution from the fine coastal feature definition to offshore over the continental shelf and out to the open ocean a consideration with this relative scaling lies with the rate of element size transitions between zones of variable resolution roberts et al 2019b commonly referred to as the gradation of the mesh persson 2006 which is evaluated herein with the sizing functions generated by ltea and ltea cd in this paper ltea and ltea cd are appraised for their collective utility towards defining meshing requirements for a variably resolved ocean to estuary domain to that end we demonstrate in the context of astronomic tidal modeling where ltea is sufficient and where ltea cd is providing clear benefits this variable performance of ltea vs ltea cd is shown to be a function of the unique computational molecules that are necessary to describe the mathematical formulations that enable the definition of derivatives of water surface elevation and flow variables as follows 1 ltea with its use of relatively large finite difference molecule is appropriate in the deep ocean where the tidal dynamics are quasi linear and the velocity gradients are slowly evolving while 2 ltea cd with its use of complex derivative based molecules permits inclusion of boundaries and intricate geometries of the intertidal zones as well as the rapidly changing tidal velocities and the nonlinear nature of the tidal species keeping with the basis formulations the approach is to perform ltea on linear model output and ltea cd on nonlinear model output our recommendation is to consider in tandem the mathematical treatment via the molecule of the numerical method and flow physics through the largely water level based gradients in ltea vs the velocity based gradients and nonlinearities included in ltea cd furthermore even though present day mesh development in the intertidal zone regions is largely geometry driven the advance of hppc high performance parallel computing is enabling the development of meter scale resolution models that will benefit future unstructured mesh generation or the scaling that results from ltea cd 1 1 background the concept of ltea lies with redistributing the nodes of an existing mesh to spread out the localized truncation error as uniformly as possible over the entire model domain hagen et al 2001 to that end ltea is an a posteriori method relying upon an a priori mesh and hydrodynamic solution hagen and parrish 2004 the local truncation error is obtained as the difference between the continuous and discrete forms of the non conservative momentum equations which is estimated by calculating the higher order terms of the numerical approximation hagen et al 2002 the approach of ltea is robust to estimate the local truncation error over a total of 81 points 9 9 structured grid that span four valence elements fig 1 however calculations of truncation error at the boundary and near the boundary in this case up to three to four element layers inward from the boundary are precluded by molecule point s falling outside the model domain the problem of near boundary and boundary calculation was solved with the development of ltea cd parrish and hagen 2008 which reformulates the approximation to be in complex space while additionally accounting for coriolis force and nonlinear bottom stress the solution approach using complex derivatives gave rise to two shapes of computational molecules 1 a 7 node hexagon for the domain interior and 2 an 8 node semi circle that permits for calculation of the local truncation error up to and including the mesh boundary parrish and hagen 2007 the hexagonal and semi circular molecules of ltea cd are small compared with the 9 9 molecule of ltea utilizing only the first layer of valence elements in calculating the local truncation error fig 1 illustrates an example positioning of the ltea and ltea cd computational molecules and the resultant domain wide node coverage as applied to a structured mesh with equilateral triangles in each example the respective molecule is positioned and drawn to scale to calculate the local truncation error at the westernmost mesh node as computationally possible the green dots represent the totality of mesh nodes captured by domain wide application of the respective molecule the 9 9 molecule of ltea cannot capture the boundary and nearby mesh nodes because of the structured grid falling outside the model domain representing the challenge with a larger size molecule in fact the 9 9 molecule captures only six mesh nodes of the overall triangulation in this example however an advantage with the larger size molecule is that it considers information for more points and over a broader spatial range in the calculation of the local truncation error with the 9 9 molecule containing 81 points and spanning four valence shells conversely the ltea cd molecules are small containing only 7 interior or 8 boundary points and span just one valence shell yet the combination of the interior and boundary molecules captures almost all the mesh nodes while only the three vertices per the three elements total of nine mesh nodes that constitute the corners of the triangular model domain are not captured by the ltea cd molecules this example illustrates the inapplicability of computational molecules for mesh nodes of sharply concave boundaries of a model domain even with the 8 node semi circular molecule of ltea cd 1 2 objective at present there exists no formalized guidance on when to apply ltea versus ltea cd besides the differences in the computational molecules ltea and ltea cd differ by their origin and applicability ltea involves a linear assessment of the shallow water dynamics typically driven by singular dominant tidal constituent e g m 2 ltea cd considers nonlinear advection and finite amplitude effects within the hydrodynamic fields as well as nonlinear bottom stress and coriolis effects an objective of this paper is to highlight the various performance aspects of the different computational molecules in calculating local truncation error and generating a target element size distribution as a corollary we provide some general guidance in using the assortment of computational molecules with ltea and ltea cd for meshing requirements of ocean to estuary domains 2 mathematical basis for estimating local truncation error the origin of the localized truncation error analysis involves the two dimensional linearized non conservative momentum equations in harmonic

for with the modulus of δ selected as the target element size for the local node hereafter symbolized as δ t the variable resolution of the target element size distribution δ t x y is a direct outcome of the method ltea or ltea cd and scalable to meet the specific meshing criteria see e g bacopoulos et al 2011 for ltea the partial derivatives of eq 3 are computed using two dimensional central difference approximations hagen 1998 for the 9 9 molecule the estimates of the second and third order partial derivatives have a leading order accuracy of order four and the fourth and fifth order partial derivatives have a leading order accuracy of order two for ltea cd the derivative term of eq 4 is computed using difference equations parrish and hagen 2008 for the interior case symbolized

molecules fig 2 need not necessarily coincide with the elements of a mesh on which the solution is computed however the central node of the molecule is located on a node of the mesh from which the solution is derived if a neighbor of the central node does not coincide with a mesh node which occurs with non equilateral triangles in an unstructured mesh then the values of the solution i e η ˆ u ˆ and v ˆ per tidal constituent are linearly interpolated onto the neighbor rigorous analysis with mesh configuration of valences of four six and eight has demonstrated the optimal configuration to be a valence of six although a mesh with ranges in valence from four to eight would be acceptable hagen 1998 close examination of the second and fourth order truncation error see eq 3 reveals the fractional coefficients are lowest for all cross derivative terms with a valence of six relative to a valence of four or eight consideration of the jacobian indicates this optimum to be a direct result of the even radial spacing provided by a valence of six burnett 1987 3 domain presentation the western north atlantic tidal wnat model domain encompasses the gulf of mexico caribbean sea and the northern part of the atlantic ocean found west of the 60 w meridian fig 3 major bathymetric features include the continental shelf break depth of 183 m 600 feet dunn 1989 and blake s escarpment 2500 m with respective gradients of 6 and 2 bates and jackson 1987 similar features of sharp bathymetric gradients surround the bahamas bank region the wnat model domain also includes the bay of fundy within the gulf of maine as fronted by georges bank as well as lake maricaibo lake pontchartrain chesapeake bay delaware bay and new york sound a foundational discretization of the wnat model domain is the 333k mesh fig 4 the 333k mesh 333k standing for 333k nodes in the mesh is the eastcoast 2001 mesh mukai et al 2002 with added resolution 1 km placed along the south atlantic bight coastline hagen et al 2006 the eastcoast 2001 mesh was developed with a combination of the wavelength to grid size ratio 100 and the topographic length scale h h 1 00 table 2 and a defined minimum element size generally ranging from 1 to 4 km along the land boundaries and a defined maximum element size of 25 km in the deep atlantic the element size distribution of the 333k mesh contains resolution of 1 km along blake s escarpment and resolution of 1 5 km along the continental shelf break louisiana coastline and bahamas bank region with relatively coarser resolution in the deep ocean fig 5a the south atlantic bight coastline extends from 27 n at west palm beach florida to 35 n at cape lookout north carolina a notable feature with the south atlantic bight is the wide continental shelf which is 140 km wide at its apex at the florida georgia border fig 3 the south atlantic bight coastline is perforated by 64 inlets which are interconnected on the inshore side by the atlantic intracoastal waterway with expansive salt marsh fringing on the estuaries of georgia and south carolina dame et al 2000 bacopoulos and hagen 2017 modeled astronomical tides in the south atlantic bight with a continuous domain telescoping from the deep ocean wnat model domain into the estuaries the mesh definition of the south atlantic bight coastline including the expansive intertidal zones 3700 km 2 along the north florida and georgia involves element sizes generally ranging from 50 to 150 m with a minimum element size of 10 m fig 6 simulating tides with the model domain as a continuum entails resolution that varies by three orders of magnitude i e from tens of meters to tens of kilometers appending the discretization of the south atlantic bight estuaries to the 333k mesh yielded a continuous mesh with 699 175 nodes and 1 296 069 elements table 3 4 methodology 4 1 generation of a priori mesh conceptually an a priori mesh for a large scale model domain can be developed amongst a variety of criteria table 2 for example the 333k mesh was developed manually with a combination of the wavelength to grid size ratio and the topographic length scale mukai et al 2002 including a tremendous manual effort to refine the south atlantic bight coastline hagen et al 2006 herein an a priori mesh is defined with uniform resolution of 3 km domain wide leading up to the nearshore region of the south atlantic bight coastline fig 5b for the purpose of establishing an a priori mesh that is uninfluenced by meshing criteria the fine resolution of the south atlantic bight and its estuaries tens to hundreds of meters remains as defined by the intertidal model codenamed marsh of bacopoulos and hagen 2017 the uniform 3 km resolution of the ocean shelf region transitions to the finer resolution of the south atlantic bight coastline over a 20 km swath running parallel with the coastline fig 6 this a priori mesh with uniform resolution of the large scale domain and near equilateral triangulation is a strategic design such that the triangulation is compatible with the structural spatial basis of the ltea and ltea cd interior molecules viz a valence of six equilateral triangles fig 2 the mesh contains 1 379 854 nodes and 2 662 781 elements table 3 4 2 hydrodynamic model configuration the a priori mesh is applied in two simulations of astronomic tides with the adcirc model westerink et al 2008 firstly the model is implemented in a linear simulation with forcing by the m 2 tidal constituent constant bottom friction is set to 0 0004 s 1 hagen et al 2001 secondly the model is implemented in a nonlinear simulation with forcing by seven tidal constituents k 1 o 1 m 2 s 2 n 2 k 2 and q 1 the nonlinear terms include finite amplitude terms with the minimum allowable depth for wetting and drying set to 0 1 m advection and bottom stress 7a τ c f u 2 v 2 h 7b c f g h 1 3 n 2 where τ is bottom friction c f is the bottom friction coefficient u and v are the depth integrated velocities in the longitudinal and latitudinal directions respectively h is the total water depth h ζ where h equals the bathymetric depth with respect to the vertical datum and ζ equals the water level deviation relative to datum and n is the manning s roughness coefficient manning s roughness is prescribed based on landcover type after bacopoulos and hagen 2017 n 0 020 s m 1 3 for fully wetted zones open water n 0 035 s m 1 3 for emergent herbaceous wetlands and n 0 050 s m 1 3 for woody wetlands geographical coordinates are employed and coriolis effects are enabled horizontal eddy viscosity is set to 5 m2 s 1 the weighting factor used in the generalized wave continuity formulation kinnmark 1985 is set to 0 005 m s 1 for still water depth greater than 10 m and 0 020 m s 1 otherwise kolar et al 1994 boundary forcing consists of tidal constituents amplitude and phase per frequency imposed on the 60 w meridian as derived from the global ocean model of le le provost et al 1998 no flux constraints are imposed on all other mainland island boundaries a total of 45 days is simulated using a time step of 1 s the model simulations are spun up from a cold start with a 10 day forcing ramp the simulated hydrodynamics are harmonically analyzed from day 15 to day 45 to produce amplitudes and phases for water levels and velocities if a mesh node dried out at any instance during the tidal simulation the harmonic results for that mesh node are nullified the harmonic results from the linear and nonlinear simulations are assessed for the m 2 tidal constituent using ltea and ltea cd respectively 4 3 generation of a posteriori meshes two a posteriori meshes are generated for the large scale domain telescoping into the south atlantic bight and its estuaries firstly with the ltea spacing requirements and secondly with ltea cd the a posteriori mesh generation does not involve the inshore regions of the south atlantic bight whereby the mesh definition of the estuaries is kept as is refer to bacopoulos et al 2011 for mesh resolution assessment of the south atlantic bight estuaries then the resolution at the inlets becomes the common seam between the existing triangulation of the estuaries and the a posteriori mesh generation in the nearshore and extending into the shelf and deep ocean therefore the spacing requirements are scaled uniformly i e δ a δ t where a is a uniform scaling factor applied to the target size subscript t such that δ matches with the resolution at the inlets the boundary of the large scale domain is the same in terms of feature definition e g chesapeake bay delaware bay long island sound and gulf of maine along the mid and north atlantic seaboards meshing is accomplished with surface water modeling system sms aquaveo 2021 using a scalar paving density algorithm for triangulation where the scalar dataset is the scaled ltea or ltea cd spacing requirement δ the two a posteriori meshes are implemented in nonlinear simulations of astronomic tides with the adcirc model westerink et al 2008 the first a posteriori mesh is based on ltea fig 5c containing 699 747 nodes and 1 302 776 elements for the deep atlantic and telescoping into the estuaries of the south atlantic bight and the second a posteriori mesh is based on ltea cd fig 5d containing 700 861 nodes and 1 304 577 elements table 3 both a posteriori meshes exhibit variable resolution with finer resolution of the shallows and bathymetric gradients e g the bahama banks and the shelf break respectively and coarser resolution in the open areas of the deep atlantic 4 4 interpretation of ltea and ltea cd spacing requirements the spacing requirements are interpreted in terms of spatial gradients of water level and velocity contained in the model solution this interpretation is intended to confirm the fundamental basis of ltea and ltea cd upon which the spacing requirements are calculated from the higher order derivative terms of the solution approximation see eqs 3 and 4 these spatial gradients are calculated directly from the model solution as follows the water level gradient at a local node is the average among all nodes that connect with the local node of the rise difference of η amp where amp stands for amplitude between the local node and the adjacent node over the run element side length the velocity gradient is calculated similarly except that the variable of interest is the semi major axis which is a scalar representation of the velocity vector data u ˆ and v ˆ gonella 1972 5 results 5 1 ltea and ltea cd spacing requirements generated from a priori mesh the a priori model mesh and adcirc simulation results of harmonic water levels η ˆ and depth integrated velocities u ˆ and v ˆ are evaluated with ltea and ltea cd see eq 2 to generate spacing requirements for the large scale domain telescoping into the south atlantic bight and its estuaries the spacing requirements are assessed in four ways see fig 4 for geographical reference 1 the fully wetted zones of the south atlantic bight estuaries 2 the coastline running the full length of the south atlantic bight 3 a section line at 30 n extending seaward from the south atlantic bight coastline 81 w 60 w and 4 the open ocean boundary of the large scale model domain as located along the 60 w meridian 5 1 1 fully wetted zones of the south atlantic bight estuaries there are 215 773 mesh nodes inside the fully wetted zones of the south atlantic bight estuaries ltea and ltea cd can compute spacing requirements for 22 748 and 203 667 nodes respectively over this same region ltea can calculate spacing requirements for only little over ten percent 11 of the mesh nodes which corresponds to just 20 of the inshore fully wetted surface area fig 6 illustrates the minimal spatial coverage of ltea due to the constraint of the shorelines and channel banks with respect to the size of the computational molecule 9 9 cf fig 1a with only a few points 62 inside the fully wetted zones of the st mary s river st andrew sound and st simon sound it should be noted that truncation error estimates are not calculated when the molecule overlaps intertidal zones since the solution contaminates the harmonic analysis conversely ltea cd can compute for over ninety percent 94 of the mesh nodes or 92 of the surface area table 4 conveys the element sizing of the a priori mesh and size estimations from ltea and ltea cd for nodes of the a priori mesh in the south atlantic bight estuaries only nodes for which ltea provided an estimate are included total of 22 748 nodes the a priori mesh sizing ranges 1 st 99th percentiles from 40 to 486 m with median value 50 th percentile of 172 m and interquartile range 25 th 75th percentiles of 130 237 m the scales from ltea and ltea cd are greater than the mesh sizing by multiples multiples of the ltea scales relative to the mesh sizing range from 2 8 to 28 2 with median value of 6 6 multiples of the ltea cd scales relative to the mesh sizing range from 1 3 to 3 9 with median value of 2 1 the percentile measures reflect the inclination of the spacing requirements to specify larger multiples for larger mesh sizes and vice versa more so with ltea than with ltea cd the spacing requirements of ltea and ltea cd differdue to the combined effect of i linear ltea versus nonlinear ltea cd simulation and ii the different formulations of ltea eq 3 and ltea cd eq 4 the former effect is interpreted with the velocity gradients associated with the linear ltea and nonlinear ltea cd simulations of astronomic tides fig 7 the distributions of velocity gradients are similar in shape with positive skewness but differ by one to two orders of magnitude in central location percentile values 25th 50th and 75th of velocity gradients for the linear simulation are 1 4 and 12 10 6 s 1 table 4 corresponding percentile values for the nonlinear simulation are 329 953 and 2828 10 6 s 1 which equates to a multiple ratio of nonlinear versus linear of 300 the latter effect of the ltea and ltea cd formulations deals with i the physical terms contained in the formulation eq 2 and ii the mathematics and numerical computational molecules of ltea and ltea cd fig 1 5 1 2 coastline running the full length of the south atlantic bight the spacing requirements generated by ltea cd are compared with the a priori mesh sizing for a polyline running 1400 km along the entire length of the south atlantic bight coastline fig 8 there is a similar behavior exhibited between the two curves albeit with a discernible bias of the ltea cd sizing being greater than the a priori mesh sizing the a priori mesh sizing and ltea cd spacing requirements are assessed at points representing the inlets and in between the inlets fig 9 where the inlets represent the splice point between the inshore region and the offshore the histogram for the a priori mesh sizing illustrates near identical shape and location between the distributions of inlets and in between inlets this commonality of the distributions reinforces the design feature of the a priori mesh with consistent spacing along the full coastline length of the south atlantic bight percentile values 25th 50th and 75th of the distributions are 65 178 and 291 m at the inlets and 57 176 and 295 m in between the inlets table 5 on the contrary the histogram for the ltea cd spacing requirements features distributions of less similar shape with a positive translation i e increase in element sizing of the in between inlets distribution versus the inlets the 25th 50th and 75th percentile values of the in between inlets distribution are 201 309 and 531 m which are larger by upwards of 150 m relative to the inlets 126 241 and 399 m beginning with an a priori mesh that consistently resolves the south atlantic bight coastline the ltea cd spacing requirements suggest coarser resolution in between the inlets relative to finer resolution at the inlets for example multiples for the mesh sizing ratio of inlets versus in between inlets across the range of percentile values are 1 1 1 0 and 1 0 whereas the respective multiples for ltea cd are 0 6 0 8 and 0 8 this variability of finer and coarser resolution for the inlets and in between the inlets respectively is explained by larger velocity gradients at the inlets on the order of 10 4 10 3 s 1 relative to smaller velocity gradients in between the inlets 10 5 s 1 the velocity gradients at the inlets are 10 100 times greater than those exhibited in between the inlets this relationship follows the fundamental basis of localized truncation error analysis hagen 1998 and the basic property that the local element size in this case defined by spacing requirements is inversely proportional with the local resolution of the physics in this case defined by velocity gradient westerink et al 1994 5 1 3 section line at 30 n a section line runs latitudinally along 30 n and extends seaward from the south atlantic bight coastline 81 w to the open ocean boundary at 60 w fig 4 features along the bathymetric profile include the coast continental shelf and break blake s plateau and escarpment and deep abyss fig 10a the shelf break and blake s escarpment are two distinctive bathymetric features of high relief fig 10b the shelf break lies at an approximate depth of 183 m 600 feet dunn 1989 with a sharp bathymetric gradient of 0 020 table 6 blake s escarpment lies at a depth of 2500 m with an even sharper bathymetric gradient of 0 066 the continental shelf blake s plateau and deep abyss are relatively flat with bathymetric gradients less than 0 001 bathymetric depth and gradient are used to inform the three mesh sizing functions of eq 1 along the section line fig 10c for comparison against the different mesh scales the sizing function of h provides a simplified variation in element size with direct relation to the bathymetric depth the other two sizing functions capture the bottom features of large bathymetric gradients e g the continental shelf break and blake s escarpment among the three sizing functions h h reflects the desired outcomes of finer resolution in shallow waters and or over sharp bottom relief greenberg et al 2007 in practical application a ceiling value can be assigned to handle discontinuities i e when the gradient is zero or very small fig 10d displays the sizing functions along the 30 n section line for the 333k mesh the a priori 3 km uniform mesh and the two a posteriori meshes of the western north atlantic tidal model domain with fine resolution of the south atlantic bight the 333k mesh was developed primarily based on the h h criterion and as such the mesh sizing along the section line reflects the estimation by h h fig 10c the sizing function of the 333k mesh is 3 8 and 2 0 km on the shelf and at the break respectively which compares with 0 3 and 0 1 km for the h h estimation table 6 similarly the 333k mesh sizing is 8 3 and 1 0 km for blake s plateau and escarpment respectively compared with 1 2 and 0 2 km for h h the resolution of the a priori mesh is 300 m at the coast which transitions abruptly to the uniform resolution of 3 km that spans across the remainder of the section line beginning with a mesh of uniform resolution both ltea and ltea cd produce spacing requirements that vary along the section line with the bathymetric profile particularly at areas with sharp bottom relief for example the mesh sizing at the shelf break is 2 7 and 3 0 km for ltea and ltea cd respectively and 4 6 and 5 2 km at blake s escarpment conversely the mesh sizing is 4 9 and 4 5 km for ltea and ltea cd respectively for the relatively flat bottom of blake s plateau there is a resemblance between the ltea and ltea cd spacing requirements and the 333k mesh finally the spacing requirements for ltea are discernibly larger than those for ltea cd in the deep abyss with mesh sizing 8 5 km for ltea versus 7 5 km for ltea cd the difference in the spacing requirements of ltea and ltea cd fig 10d is explained by the gradients in water level fig 10e and velocity fig 10f associated with the linear ltea and nonlinear ltea cd simulations of astronomic tides the water level gradients of the nonlinear simulation are greater than those of the linear simulation up until the deep abyss 66 w where the two curves intersect after which the opposite is the case similar behavior is found in the velocity gradients with a convergence of the two curves beyond the deep abyss eastward of 66 w the water level gradients of the nonlinear simulation 0 68 10 6 are upwards of four times greater than those of the linear simulation 0 18 10 6 at the shelf break table 6 similarly the velocity gradients at the shelf break are 9 86 10 6 s 1 for the nonlinear simulation and 1 39 10 6 s 1 for the linear simulation which equates to a seven fold difference these differences in the gradients of water level and velocity are also exhibited at blake s escarpment with a four fold difference in the water level gradient 0 14 10 6 nonlinear simulation versus 0 04 10 6 linear simulation and a ten fold difference in the velocity gradient 0 19 10 6 s 1 nonlinear versus 0 02 10 6 s 1 linear finally the velocity gradients in the deep abyss are hardly detectable 0 01 10 6 s 1 with both the nonlinear and linear simulations whereas there is a measurable amplitude with the water level gradients 0 08 10 6 5 1 4 open ocean boundary at 60 w the open ocean boundary runs along the 60 w meridian over a distance of 4148 km spanning latitudinally from 8 n venezuela south america to 46 n nova scotia canada fig 4 the depths along the open ocean boundary are for the most part on the order of thousands of meters with relative shallows of 100 m at the peripheries fig 11a the sizing functions are presented in fig 11b for the 333k mesh the a priori 3 km uniform mesh and the a posteriori mesh based on ltea cd of the western north atlantic tidal model domain with fine resolution of the south atlantic bight the ltea spacing requirements are not assessed for the open ocean boundary due to the lack of boundary definition with the 9 9 molecule fig 1a the curve along ln δ 1 relates to the uniform 3 km resolution of the a priori mesh starting with this uniform distribution of element sizes along the open ocean boundary ltea cd generates an element size distribution that ranges over one e folding i e ln δ max δ min 2 the ltea cd sizing distribution reflects that of the 333k mesh sizes with larger elements in the deep waters albeit lesser in magnitude by a factor of e the element size distributions are inversely related with the velocity gradients along the open ocean boundary fig 11c velocity gradients are 1 10 6 s 1 in the shallows versus 0 001 0 1 10 6 s 1 in the deep waters corresponding with smaller and larger element sizes respectively 5 2 performance of a posteriori meshes ltea and ltea cd the runtimes associated with the numerical simulations are provided in table 7 all simulations were performed on the same system including cpu compute nodes each with two 24 core intel cascade lake intel xeon platinum 8260 processor cpus 192 gb memory and 600 gb hdd foremost the compute performance of the a posteriori meshes is essentially the same between ltea and ltea cd next the increased computational expense due to the inclusion of nonlinear terms is exhibited with the two implementations linear vs nonlinear of the a priori mesh finally the increased computational expense with the split by four version of the a priori mesh is associated with the increased computational density i e number of nodes per processor of the numerical simulation performance of the model solutions from the various meshes is assessed in terms of cumulative area fraction errors cafe hagen et al 2001 as a basis for the error statistic a true solution is developed from a split by four version of the a priori mesh the split by four mesh contains 5 422 835 nodes and 10 651 124 elements table 3 the resolution of which is 1 5 km throughout the domain of all the meshes defined in this study the split by four mesh affords the finest resolution for 99 of the total domain area which is surpassed only by the 333k mesh for a limited area 1 of the total domain of coastal louisiana and blake s escarpment with resolution of 1 km the error statistic used to evaluate the ltea and ltea cd meshes as well as the 333k mesh including the south atlantic bight estuaries is defined by 8 e rel 100 ξ m ξ 0 ξ 0 where e rel is the relative error ξ is the model solution and the subscripts m and 0 stand for the mesh under evaluation and truth split by four mesh respectively error is evaluated for two components of the model solution 1 the harmonic water level amplitude and 2 the semi major axis as a tidal ellipse parameter derived from the harmonic velocity amplitude and phase gonella 1972 a focus is placed on the m 2 tidal constituent since it is the predominant constituent in the south atlantic bight low tidal amplitude errors absolute value less than 0 5 are found in the western north atlantic ocean moderate errors abs within 1 2 5 in the caribbean sea gulf of mexico and gulf of maine and high errors abs greater than 5 over georges bank and the bahama banks fig 12 there are no discernible errors manifested along the open ocean boundary which corroborates the water level boundary condition is sufficiently transmitting the tidal forcing into the model regardless of the boundary resolution overall error magnitudes are greater with the ltea cd mesh relative to the ltea mesh the error magnitudes are small 0 5 in the deep atlantic regardless of the mesh under evaluation the error signage is switched between the two a posteriori meshes and the 333k mesh for the caribbean sea and gulf of mexico including the west florida shelf some of the large errors in the large scale domain with magnitude greater than 5 are meaningless because of the very small m 2 water level amplitude 1 cm fig 13 e g the central axis of errors running north south through the gulf of mexico lake maricaibo and south of puerto rico more meaningful errors within the large scale domain include those inside the gulf of maine where m 2 water level amplitudes are upwards of 6 m due to resonant properties over georges bank which has shallow depths in the general range of 30 60 m and within the bahama banks which are very shallow with depths less than 10 m errors in the model solution of semi major axis are most expressive along bathymetric gradients inside the domain including the shelf break and blake s escarpment fig 14 errors are greatest within the bahama banks at 5 10 and upwards of 20 errors with the velocity solution are manifested along the open ocean boundary unlike the tidal amplitude errors because of the dirichlet type boundary condition with specification of water level whereby the depth integrated velocity is a free variable in the model solution in general error magnitudes are greater with the ltea cd mesh relative to the ltea mesh like the tidal amplitude errors the error signage with velocity semi major axis is switched between the two a posteriori meshes and the 333k mesh in some areas e g within the caribbean sea and gulf of mexico including the west florida shelf the performance difference between the two a posteriori meshes and the 333k mesh is also expressed within the gulf of maine and over georges bank where simulated m 2 velocities semi major axis are 1 2 m s 1 fig 15 with relative errors of 2 5 5 added validation of the model solutions for velocity semi major axis is performed at six velocity gaging stations located on the continental shelf of the south atlantic bight see inset in fig 15 the six stations sourced from blanton et al 2004 are situated on the inner or mid shelf at depths of 11 35 m table 8 the data range from 7 to 30 cm s 1 over the six stations and the model replicates this spatial variability in the velocity semi major axis the model solution of semi major axis is the same with a precision of cm s 1 for all six stations regardless of the mesh comparing against the data with error of zero or in the single percentages and up to only 14 at one of the stations cafe plots of the relative errors illustrate a converged solution for the a priori mesh the two a posteriori meshes and the 333k mesh including the south atlantic bight estuaries fig 16 the cafe plots present under and over prediction errors versus a cumulative percentage of the total area exceeded by a respective error hagen et al 2001 a perfect solution would result in a single vertical line plotted at zero on the x coordinate the lower bound on the y coordinate is 1 of the cumulative domain area which means the error levels associated with 99 of the total domain area are plotted solution convergence is expressed in the cafe plot with collapse of the curve towards a perfect solution all mesh solutions are based on nonlinear tidal simulation the a priori mesh performs the best of all meshes which should be expected considering the greater nodal density of approximately twice as many nodes as the other comparative meshes table 3 the a posteriori meshes perform relatively the same between ltea and ltea cd with 99 of the domain area exhibiting a tidal amplitude error within 5 and a semi major axis sema error within 12 table 9 it worth noting the slight outperformance with ltea relative to ltea cd the a posteriori meshes perform comparably with the 333k mesh including the south atlantic bight for sema error ltea and ltea cd are an improvement over the 333k mesh 6 discussion a primary reason for the difference in performance of the linear ltea and nonlinear ltea cd simulations of astronomic tides is bottom friction the linear simulation employs a constant bottom friction set to 0 0004 s 1 the nonlinear simulation utilizes a manning s roughness formulation for bottom friction see eq 7 considering a manning s n value of 0 020 s m 1 3 for open water and a tidal speed of 1 m s 1 bottom friction adjusts with the depth of the water column h for example as 0 0040 s 1 for 1 m water depth 0 0004 s 1 for 5 5 m and 10 4 s 1 for 20 m or greater throughout most of the model domain and time bottom friction in the linear simulation is greater than by orders of magnitude that of the nonlinear simulation this greater bottom stress applied in the linear simulation relative to the nonlinear simulation is manifested through the simulated tides with more dynamics e g larger gradients in water levels and velocities in the nonlinear simulation versus the linear simulation the less more dynamics in the simulated tides with the linear nonlinear simulations yields larger smaller element sizing in the ltea and ltea cd spacing requirements respectively a nuance with ltea versus ltea cd is the non inclusion of bottom friction in the mathematical formulation see eq 2 which is the reason for performing ltea on linear model output and ltea cd on nonlinear model output to that end the truncation error estimator of ltea cd see eq 4 contains three physical components of the governing equations inertia ω coriolis effect f and bottom friction τ significance can be computed as the ratio of the magnitude of an individual term ω f or τ relative to the sum of all terms of the right hand side of eq 4 the significance of bottom friction is near negligible 1 in deep water but is 125 over the continental shelf and 185 inside the estuaries bacopoulos et al 2011 the ratio values greater than 100 are due to the cancellation of terms on the right hand side this impact of bottom friction is a key reason for the larger smaller element sizing in the ltea and ltea cd spacing requirements inside the estuaries and over the continental shelf another discernment of the ltea and ltea cd spacing requirements is the gradation i e rate of element size transitions between zones of variable resolution persson 2006 9 γ 100 δ j δ k x j x k where δ and x are element edge length and position respectively the subscripts j and k denote adjacent elements and γ expressed as a percentage is gradation typical thresholds of γ for unstructured meshes in shallow water modeling are 15 35 higher γ values will lead to overly coarse elements in areas away from the zones of high resolution subsequently degrading the discrete bathymetric representation in the model roberts et al 2019b it has also been shown that high gradation value e g γ 50 leads to the introduction of truncation errors and degrades the overall accuracy of the numerical solution hagen et al 2000 the gradations of the ltea and ltea cd spacing requirements are at most 17 γ indicative of smoothly changing size functions the spacing requirements generated with ltea and ltea cd can be scaled according to a desired mesh design e g absolute minimum or maximum element size element size for feature definition boundary or interior e g shelf break and or the total number of elements in the mesh the gradation of the sizing function remains constant with scaling if the scaling is applied uniformly over the domain alternatively the scaling of the sizing function can be associated with other meshing constraints e g minimum mesh size feature size grade slope and or submarine channels roberts et al 2019b to provide a comprehensive compatibility amongst the host of meshing constraints all considered the spacing requirements of ltea and ltea cd can be readily combined with existing meshing routines e g admesh conroy et al 2012 and oceanmesh2d roberts et al 2019a for improved methods and outcomes of automatic mesh generation viz incorporation of tidal physics into the meshing process although applied herein for astronomic tides the evaluation of flow gradients by ltea and ltea cd make their assessment of target element size applicable for other longwave dynamics bacopoulos 2018 as an immediate extension the spatial gradients associated with storm surge are like those for astronomic tidal flows i e more dynamic in the shallows relative to the deeper waters moreover since tide and storm surge modeling within the estuarine domain entails overland flows bilskie et al 2020 it makes sense to extend the applicability of ltea and ltea cd into the marshes coastal wetlands and other topographical features of the estuary finally such physically based spacing requirements can also extend to other physics e g short waves some formalized guidance on applying ltea and ltea cd is extracted from the study as follows prefaced by the importance of high fidelity bathymetric data and quality definition of the contiguous shoreline providing the foundational information for mesh development firstly it is advised to begin with ltea since it is based on linear tide simulation from which an essential level of insight into the tidal physics of the domain and the resolution thereof can be efficiently discerned care should be taken with the a priori mesh such that it is not overly coarse and lacking in basic definition of the bathymetry and thusly the tidal dynamics from which the spacing requirements are determined an alternative approach is to begin with an overly resolved mesh and apply ltea or ltea cd in an iterative manner for mesh optimization bacopoulos 2018 the 9 9 molecule of ltea evaluates the higher order terms of the truncation error over a broader spatial range relative to ltea cd by a factor of four in distances size i e four valence shells with ltea versus one valence shell with ltea cd as applied to a mesh with equilateral triangles fig 1 aside from the mathematical details of each method viz order of numerical accuracy the spatial aspects i e size with the computational molecules alone are cause for the varied performance of ltea and ltea cd more rigorous analysis to disentangle the individual components of numerical method accuracy and the computational molecule size is a subject of future work secondly the ltea cd spacing requirements are valid for the model boundary and adjacent three to four layers of elements where ltea cannot compute a spacing requirement to that end ltea cd provides a clear benefit over ltea in areas with complicated boundaries fig 17 shows such examples of complex configuration where ltea cd prescribes a greater proportion of nodes overall and along the boundary in the graphic displayed for the bay of fundy the ltea mesh contains 4067 nodes with 421 of them defining the boundary whereas the ltea cd mesh contains upwards of twice the number of nodes at 7043 nodes with 632 of them defining the boundary similarly the ltea mesh contains 944 nodes with 146 of them defining the boundary in the graphic displayed for lake maricaibo which contrasts against the ltea cd mesh with over twice the number of nodes at 2166 nodes and 253 of them defining the boundary at the coastal land margin ltea is impractical inside the intricate domain e g the estuaries of the south atlantic bight which makes ltea cd the logical choice for such shallow and tightly bounded regions the relative performance of the approaches ltea and ltea cd is manifested in different ways both approaches produce similarly distributed spacing requirements fig 5 such that the underlying information is essentially the same both methods are sensitive to water depth bathymetric gradient h and changes in bathymetric gradient 2 h including bottom features like the continental shelf break and blake s escarpment as represented by the corresponding local flow field ltea produces a wider range of target element sizes and more variability in the spacing requirements than ltea cd the larger computational molecule of ltea spans over a wider range of elements than the ltea cd molecule and thus captures a wider range of the variability in the local flow field not displayed here but a smoothing of the spacing requirements followed by a normalization parrish and hagen 2007 reveals common trends between the ltea and ltea cd target element sizes similarly it is reasoned that the slightly smaller errors with the ltea mesh relative to the ltea cd mesh fig 16 is due to the larger computational molecule and greater capture of the flow field variability the geographical distributions of over underprediction are nearly identical with ltea and ltea cd fig 12 the large negative sema errors inside the gulf of maine are the likely result of inadequate definition of the local geometry especially considering that the system exhibits tidal resonance there is a slightly more muted sema error with the ltea mesh relative to the ltea cd in the caribbean sea and inside chesapeake bay relative to the 333k mesh the greatest improvements with ltea and ltea cd are found on the west florida shelf inside chesapeake bay and delaware bay and along the northern gulf of mexico the ltea and ltea cd meshes inherently account for the tidal flow dynamics whereas the 333k mesh was designed strictly based on the domain bathymetry and bathymetric gradients to that end it is not surprising that the ltea and ltea cd meshes perform comparably with or slightly better than the 333k mesh 7 conclusion the development of unstructured finite element meshes for ocean and coastal circulation modeling of a large scale domain with intricate coastal feature definition entails a collection of meshing constraints a priori meshes can be designed objectively based on local feature size bathymetric gradients tidal wavelengths minimum and maximum mesh size submarine channels and gradation e g see bilgili et al 2006 conroy et al 2012 and roberts et al 2019a such feature driven a priori approaches adjust the resolution to match both the physical system s length scale and estimated length scales of the dominant physics wherein the physical scales are estimated with heuristics e g wavelength to grid scale and topographic length scale to supplement the established a priori meshing criteria the a posteriori methodologies presented in this paper adjust the resolution based on the discrete representation of the physics via numerical truncation error estimation the methodologies ltea localized truncation error analysis and ltea cd plus complex derivatives are demonstrated as physics based approaches for the robust definition of resolution requirements for large scale shallow water model domain with high feature definition of the coastal land margin ltea which is formulated upon a linearization of the tidal physics and employed with linear tide simulation is appropriate for the deep abyss and other regions of low bathymetric relief where the tidal dynamics are smoothly changing over space ltea cd accounts for bottom friction and the nonlinearities of the tidal physics while able to compute a spacing requirement for the model boundary making it the logical choice for the nearshore and coastline both ltea and ltea cd capably resolve the bathymetric features and more importantly the hydrodynamic gradients in the shallow water flow in the shelf ocean region whereby ltea cd resolves the estuarine shallows and tightly bounded features of the inshore region although demonstrated for the western north atlantic ocean out to the 60 w meridian telescoping into the south atlantic bight estuaries southeastern united states the workflows of ltea and ltea cd can be readily translated to other shallow water adcirc model domains with complex basin geometry the methodologies were developed specifically for adcirc with solution of the shallow water equations in the gwce formulation such that application to other models with different truncation errors will require adaptation of ltea and ltea cd credit authorship contribution statement peter bacopoulos methodology software validation formal analysis investigation writing

23831,the flux anomaly forced model inter comparison project fafmip aims to study the response of the ocean to changes in prescribed surface flux heat freshwater and wind caused by atmospheric co2 increase among these surface flux perturbations the heat flux has the greatest effect on ocean heat uptake ohu the atlantic meridional circulation amoc and sea level changes this occurs in part because of the redistributed heat flux qr which is the component of the heat flux driven by ocean circulation changes and almost nearly doubles the initial heat flux perturbation f prescribed by fafmip in the north atlantic na in this study we used a standalone ocean model to quantitatively investigate the impact of qr on ohu and the amoc in prescribed heat anomaly experiments faf heat experiment in fafmip we also showed that whether the other two fafmip heat flux anomaly experiments faf heat na50pct and faf heat na0pct can reasonably simulate the ocean s response to prescribed surface heat flux especially ohu and amoc our findings show that faf heat na50pct is better because the redistribution feedback qr nearly equals the initial perturbation 50 f in the na and thus recovers the total perturbation f in faf heat although direct comparisons cannot be drawn both faf heat na50pct and faf heat experiments with no effect of qr cause amoc weakening that is roughly comparable with the 1pctco 2 experiments the magnitude of simulated amoc weakening in faf heat na50pct is 3 9sv accounting for about 29 of the amoc intensity in unperturbed experiment which is closer to the faf heat experiment about 31 with no effect of qr relative to the faf heat experiment because of negative qr in all regions except the na region especially for the central and eastern equatorial pacific and southern ocean the simulated global ohu in faf heat na50pct is reduced by 10 as compared to the added ohu in the faf heat experiment the qr in the faf heat experiment increases ohu by approximately 13 of the total ohu and further reduces amoc intensity by 3 4 sv accounting for 26 of the amoc strength in an unperturbed experiment faf heat na0pct results in a significant reduction in ohu approximately 26 and the magnitude of amoc weakening is only approximately 1 9 sv despite no f being added in the na keywords fafmip ogcm ocean climate change ohu amoc 1 introduction the ocean absorbs approximately 90 of the additional radiative heat in global warming scenarios atmospheric co2 concentration increase because of its large heat capacity church et al 2013a recent estimates of the ocean heat uptake ohu have shown that the ocean has warmed to above 2000 m in depth since 1950 levitus et al 2012 dias et al 2020 the ohu can mitigate the rate of surface climate change and causes global and regional sea level change church et al 2011 the ratio of global mean sea level rise to ohu is 0 12 m yj 1 according to coupled model inter comparison project phase 5 cmip5 results church et al 2013b ohu also influences the diagnosis and projection of transient surface warming garuba and klinger 2016 therefore an understanding of ohu is crucial to reduce the large uncertainty in projections of global and regional sea level changes exhibited by contemporary climate system models yin et al 2010 pardaens et al 2011 bouttes et al 2012 yin 2012 increased atmospheric co2 concentration causes air sea turbulence flux changes including changes in heat fresh water and wind stress garuba and klinger 2018 each of the co2 induced perturbations in heat freshwater and momentum surface fluxes contributes to changes in the pattern and magnitude of ohu and ocean circulation mikolajewicz and voss 2000 huber and zanna 2017 demonstrated that surface flux perturbations are major sources of spread in the estimations of ohu and sea level change the flux anomaly forced model inter comparison project fafmip was proposed to compare different model responses to surface flux perturbations and to understand the inter model spread in atlantic meridional overturning circulation amoc change ohu and sea level rise gregory et al 2016 fafmip participating climate and ocean models are all forced with the same prescribed surface fluxes of momentum heat and fresh water these forcing fluxes are derived from the ensemble mean differences between years 61 and 80 of 13 cmip5 atmosphere ocean general circulation models aogcms under 1pctco2 forcing corresponding to doubled co2 concentration relative to preindustrial levels and from all years of picontrol simulations and fixed seasonal cycles previous work has shown the heat flux perturbation is the most dominant factor contributing to amoc weakening ohu increase and sea level rise among the surface flux perturbations rahmstorf and ganapolski 1999 gregory et al 2006 bouttes and gregory 2014 gregory et al 2016 jin et al 2021 thus in the present study we focus on the heat flux perturbation experiments in fafmip the prescribed surface heat flux perturbation has been termed added heat flux f by bouttes and gregory 2014 and gregory et al 2016 and the surface heat flux perturbation caused by the circulation change through the redistribution of sea surface temperature sst gradients has been termed redistributed heat flux qr by gregory et al 2016 this redistributed heat flux is often associated with the weakening of amoc the weakened amoc reduces northward heat transport and leads to the cooling of sst in the north atlantic na which causes the redistributed heat flux and makes the ocean absorb more heat from the atmosphere banks and gregory 2006 xie and vallis 2012 marshall et al 2014 marshall et al 2014 used an ocean general circulation model ogcm to demonstrate the broad similarities between the change in temperature in a simplified ocean only model and that in cmip5 coupled climate models in response to global warming xie and vallis 2012 used an ocean model to show that redistribution due to amoc slowdown also increases the penetration speed of temperature anomalies garuba and klinger 2016 introduced a method for isolating and quantifying this active heat uptake component or redistribution feedback in an ocean only global warming experiment and found that most of the active heat uptake occurs in the na gregory et al 2016 indicated that the qr applying method b described in section 2 2 recommended by fafmip to compute surface heat flux is nearly equal to f in the na thus the average redistribution feedback nearly doubles the prescribed heat f input to the na region we called this phenomenon double counting the double counting effect further enhances the weakening of amoc however quantitative evaluation of the influence of qr especially for double counting heat flux over the na on ohu and the amoc in fafmip has been lacking fafmip experiments can be carried out with both aogcms and stand alone ogcms gregory et al 2016 couldrey et al 2021 showed the diversity of the ocean component in coupled models plays a key role in sea level projection uncertainties under greenhouse gas forcing by comparing the results of fafmip and 1pctco2 experiments in ocean only fafmip the atmospheric variables are prescribed the redistributive heat flux is mainly a result of the response of ocean processes to prescribed flux perturbations without including feedback from the atmosphere todd et al 2020 showed that the ocean only framework of fafmip enables a clearer assessment of the direct ocean response to surface flux perturbations relative to the coupled framework jin et al 2022 demonstrated that the changes in global mean temperature ocean heat content and steric sea level simulated in the ogcm are generally consistent with aogcm simulations therefore we have used an ogcm to conduct all three heat flux anomaly experiments faf heat faf heat na50pct and faf heat na0pct proposed by fafmip and applied two different methods method b and method c as described by gregory et al 2016 for computing the surface heat flux to quantitatively investigate the influence of qr in particular how double counting heat flux in the na influences ohu and amoc in the faf heat experiment additionally we explored whether the other two fafmip heat flux anomaly experiments faf heat na50pct and faf heat na0pct can offer a better ocean response to prescribed surface heat flux f relative to faf heat especially ohu and amoc change we note that while our experiments allow the direct assessment of the impact of surface flux perturbations on the ocean they do not include the atmosphere ocean feedback that exists in aogcms and the climate system which can alter the response of the amoc e g kostov et al 2019 the paper is structured as follows the details of the models and experiments are introduced in section 2 the results are detailed in section 3 and the summary and discussion are presented in section 4 2 the models and experiments 2 1 the models the ogcm used in this study is the revised climate system ocean model version 2 licom2 0 of the state key laboratory of numerical modeling for atmospheric sciences and geophysical fluid dynamics and the institute of atmospheric physics iap liu et al 2012 dong et al 2021 the model domain is between 78 5 s to 87 5 n with 1 zonal resolution the meridional resolution is refined to 0 5 between 10 s and 10 n and it is reduced gradually from 0 5 to 1 between 10 and 20 there are 30 levels in the vertical direction with 10 m per layer in the upper 150 m this resolution can resolve the equatorial waves and capture the upper mixed layer and thermocline lin et al 2013 the second order vertical turbulent mixing scheme was applied canuto et al 2001 2002 the scheme of gent and mcwilliams 1990 which uses a diffusion coefficient of 1000 m2 s for both the bolus and redi parts was used for the isopycnal mixing convection was parameterized by convective adjustment pacanowski 1995 the sea surface salinity boundary condition in the ogcm is the combination of new well posed boundary conditions jin et al 2017 and restoring boundary conditions the restoring boundary condition for sea surface salinity was used for preventing uncontrolled drifts in salinity as a response to inaccurate precipitation griffies et al 2009 the sst was not restored during the simulations this new well posed boundary condition uses the virtual salt flux that includes the proper correlations between the freshwater flux and surface salinity and the real salt flux is generally parameterized through 10 m wind speed u 10 which can conserve total ocean salinity see jin et al 2017 for more details the revised licom2 0 is the ogcm of the cas esm2 the second version of the chinese academy of sciences earth system model that participated in cmip6 2 2 methods following the tracer partitioned approach recommended by famfip gregory et al 2016 we divided the temperature change and ohu into added and redistributive components the partitioned approach is briefly introduced as follows using the subscripts c and p to denote values in the control and perturbation experiments respectively according to garuba and klinger 2016 2018 the advective diffusive equation of temperature tendency in the control experiment can be expressed with the following equation 1 t c t υ c t c q c for simplicity we set the specific heat capacity of seawater to unity in the equation q c is the sea surface heat flux υ c includes all transport processes such as the bolus component parameterizing eddy effects and mixing and υ c t c is a convergence i e represents all heat transport processes in the ocean including advection diffusion convection and ice freezing adjustment the temperature in the heat flux perturbation experiments is affected by the prescribed added heat anomaly f as well as the atmosphere ocean heat flux qp computed by the bulk formula thus the corresponding equation is given as follows 2 t p t υ p t p q p f where υ p t p is different from υ c t c because the velocities and diffusivities are changed due to the effects of f and t p on seawater density to eliminate the strong negative feedback between surface heat flux and sst to eliminate exaggerated effects of redistributed heat flux qr for maximizing the effect of f on the sea surface a tracer tr was initialized to t at time tp which is only forced by qp instead of f and does not directly affect seawater density the equation for the introduced tracer tr is written as follows 3 t r t υ p t r q p fafmip provides three methods method a method b and method c to compute surface heat flux in method a the prescribed heat flux f is positive in large regions the sea surface tp forced by the effects of f see eq 2 generally rises and is used to compute surface heat flux thus causing a large negative redistributive heat flux qr in the net surface heat flux into the ocean this negative redistributive heat flux qr opposes f especially for the ogcm framework since the atmospheric state variables are prescribed in ogcm experiments therefore this method has not been adopted in the ogcm experiments in method b the method recommended by fafmip a redistributed temperature tracer tr is introduced and not directly forced by f the sst used to compute qp is derived from the sea surface tr see eq 3 instead of tp moreover an added temperature tracer ta which is initialized at zero is also introduced and experiences only the prescribed surface heat flux perturbation f importantly the qp can be different from the surface heat flux qc in the control experiment this is because tr can be different from the prognostic surface temperature tc in the control experiment due to changes in advection or mixing therefore the difference between qp and qc would result in redistributed heat flux qr however in method c the sst for computing qp is supplied by sea surface tc see eq 1 from the control experiment which is not affected by the prescribed added heat flux f and change in ocean circulation therefore method c would result in almost no redistributed heat flux qr according to gregory et al 2016 although method c has certain disadvantages such as being more computationally expensive and suppressing the actual interaction between atmosphere and ocean it can be adopted in the ogcm experiment by using the daily frequency of sst in the control experiment which applies f accurately to the na without generating redistributed qr thus its simulation of the amoc decline may provide the best estimate of the response to the prescribed f in this paper we applied method b and method c to quantitatively evaluate the influence of qr on ohu and the amoc in fafmip the equation for total temperature anomaly can be derived from eqs 1 and 2 as follows 4 t t υ c t υ t c υ t f q r where the primes denote anomalies compared to the control experiment according to method b the equation for t a can be written as follows 5 t a t υ p t a f where t a is zero when there is no prescribed surface heat flux f the difference between t a and t is the redistributive temperature anomaly t r which can be written as eq 4 minus eq 5 6 t r t υ p t r υ t c q r note that tr is mainly affected by ocean circulation change υ t c and qr in method b while qr is nearly zero in method c thus the difference of tr in method b and method c can represent the role of qr 2 3 experiments the standalone ogcm has been integrated for 300 years to reach quasi equilibrium in the upper ocean using the coordinated ocean ice reference experiments i core i protocol proposed by griffies et al 2009 the core i provides climatological mean repeating normal year forcing of large and yeager 2004 including surface wind surface air temperature and specific humidity at 10 m height sea level pressure downward shortwave radiation downward longwave radiation and precipitation including rain and snow which are mostly at 6 hourly intervals the control and perturbation experiments have continued to integrate 100 years each initialized from a near equilibrium period year 301 the control experiment is forced with only the core i called ctrl here we have conducted four heat flux perturbation experiments exp 1 exp 2 exp 3 and exp 4 exp 1 which is run using method b to compute surface heat fluxes isolates the effects of pure redistributive heat flux qr and the added heat flux perturbation f on the ocean state exp 2 which is run using method c suppresses the redistributive heat flux and accurately exhibits the effect of the added heat flux perturbation f on the ocean climate change both exp 1 and exp 2 apply the same prescribed added heat flux perturbation f which is denoted as the faf heat experiment in fafmip exp 3 which is denoted as the faf heat na50pct in fafmip couldrey et al 2022 applies the same prescribed added heat flux perturbation f as exp 1 and exp 2 but only 50 f within the part of the na 80 w 10 e 30 65 n to eliminate double counting heat input in the na and realistically represent the ocean change due to the effect of f exp 4 which is denoted as faf heat na0pct in fafmip couldrey et al 2022 does not apply f in the na region note that the perturbation f outside the na region in exp 3 and exp 4 are the same as in exp 1 and exp 2 all the setups of the three experiments exp 1 exp 3 and exp 4 are the same except that difference added heat flux perturbation f are applied in the na region the details of the five experiments are provided in table 1 it is noteworthy that ice freezing adjustment can result in additional heat flux anomaly therefore we applied the same ice freezing adjustment heat flux in each perturbation experiments as that in ctrl 3 results the imposed surface heat flux perturbations f prescribed by fafmip were added to the sea surface which contributes to a change in the pattern and magnitude of the ocean circulation resulting in redistributive heat flux qr time series of global mean quantities give a useful indication of the approach to the steady state fig 1 shows the time series of global mean and na mean total surface heat flux perturbation f qr and the redistributed heat flux qr simulated in different perturbation experiments relative to ctrl fig 1a shows that the global mean f qr in all the perturbation experiments exhibits similar trends except for exp 2 the global mean f qr increases during the first few years and gradually decreases which is the result of variability in qr fig 1b because f is almost constant and has no annual trend and variability the time means over the entire simulation of f qr in exp 2 using method c remain constant at about 1 87 w m2 table 2 which is almost equal to f about 1 86 w m2 dashed red line in fig 1a this indicates that by applying method c exp 2 can avoid the global effect of qr because of the effect of qr the global mean of f qr in exp 1 is 2 15 w m 2 and significantly larger than f and the corresponding qr in exp 1 and exp 2 are 0 29 w m2 and 0 01 w m2 respectively the global mean f qr values in exp 3 and exp 4 are 1 65 w m2 and 1 31 w m2 respectively both of which are smaller than f in exp 1 and exp 2 largely because f in the na region is smaller in exps 3 4 the corresponding global qr means in exp 3 and exp 4 are 0 06 w m2 and 0 05 w m2 respectively in the na region within the red box of fig 2a the f qr in exp 2 remains constant and almost equal to f fig 1c and qr is almost zero fig 1d thus exp 2 has almost no double heat flux counting effects meaning that this experiment realistically represents the ocean s responses to the prescribed added heat flux f in the na the means of qr and of f in the na over the entire simulation in exp 1 are 14 25 w m2 and 10 69 w m2 respectively and the mean values of qr and 50 f in the na simulated in exp 3 are 6 04 w m2 and 5 35 w m2 respectively therefore the redistributive heat flux qr in exp 1 and exp 3 is nearly equivalent to the prescribed heat flux in the na 100 f in exp 1 and 50 f in exp 3 demonstrating the double counting effect there as a result both experiments exaggerate the effect of their respective f in the na however because exp 3 only applies 50 of f in the na the total heat flux anomaly into the na is 50 f qr approximately 11 39 w m2 which is comparable to f 10 69 w m2 in exp 1 because no f was added in the na the mean qr over the na simulated in exp 4 is only approximately 2 34 w m2 fig 2 shows the patterns of prescribed sea surface heat flux perturbation f in fafmip and redistributed heat flux anomaly qr simulated in the four heat flux perturbation experiments the most evident feature of f is that it is positive in the na and the southern ocean indicating strong input of heat flux to the ocean fig 2a interestingly qr in exp 1 is similar to that in the aogcm mean shown in fig 2d of gregory et al 2016 the positive qr is located in the na region and the negative qr in the low to mid latitude atlantic and the central and eastern equatorial pacific this suggests that the effects of qr in our ogcm experiments especially the doubling of heat flux over the na may provide insight into aogcm heat flux anomaly experiments in fafmip the qr patterns simulated in exp 1 exp 3 and exp 4 are similar figs 2b 2d and 2e only the magnitudes of qr are different the magnitude of qr is the largest in exp 1 followed by exp 2 and smallest in exp 3 consistent with the global and na mean values figs 1b and 1d the qr simulated in exp 2 shows no substantial change in most regions fig 2c and in particular it has no effect in the na which means no double counting effect the total heat flux anomaly over na in exp 2 is mainly caused by the prescribed f which is nearly equivalent to the effect of heat flux anomaly 50 f qr in exp 3 the differences in the mean qr of the na between the three experiments exp 1 exp 3 and exp 4 are mostly caused by differences in amoc changes to be discussed later which mainly stem from differences in the magnitude of f over the na the amoc weakening leads to reduced northward heat transport which results in the consequent cooling of redistributed sst in the na region and warming of redistributed sst in low to mid latitude atlantic the different degrees of amoc change in the three experiments result in the different magnitudes of negative qr in low to mid latitude atlantic and positive qr in the na region the qr simulated in exp 1 exp 3 and exp 4 exhibited negative heat flux anomalies similar to active heat loss in garuba and klinger 2018 in the central and eastern equatorial pacific which is mainly associated with the el niño like redistributed sst anomaly caused by the weakening of the pacific subtropical shallow cell in response to the warming scenarios luo et al 2016 this shows that the heat flux anomaly experiments in fafmip can reproduce the weakening of both the amoc and the pacific subtropical cell to further distinguish the effects of f and qr fig 3 provides the time series of the global mean and atlantic arctic atl arc mean temperature anomaly t and tr the global mean t simulated in all four perturbation experiments shows a trend of substantial increase fig 3a similar to the global mean surface heat flux the t simulated in exp 1 shows the most significant increase followed by that in exp 2 the magnitude of increase in t simulated in exp 3 is slightly smaller than that of exp 2 while that of exp 4 is the smallest for instance in the final year the global mean t simulated in the four perturbation experiments are 0 443 c 0 390 c 0 340 c and 0 287 c however the increase in global mean t in exp 2 is consistent with ta in exp 1 with the latter determined almost entirely by f in exp 1 0 386 c red dashed line in fig 3a this indicates that the global mean tr forced by qr in exp 2 has almost no global effect on t this result further demonstrates that exp 2 can almost eliminate the effect of qr fig 3b especially for global scale the increase in global mean tr simulated in exp 1 leads to higher t than ta which further exaggerates the role of f leading to excessive increase in ohu ρ c p t d v in fafmip the global mean tr simulated in exp 3 and exp 4 is similar being 0 013 c and 0 011 c at the end of the simulations respectively which is consistent with the global mean qr in the two experiments the global mean t in both exp 3 and exp 4 is lower than ta in exp 1 due to the different f imposed in the na fig 3a which leads to relatively weak ohu for instance in the final year the ohu simulated in exp 1 exp 2 exp 3 and exp 4 is 24 3 gj 21 6 gj 18 9 gj and 15 63 gj respectively the added ohu of ta ρ c p t a d v simulated in the four experiments is 21 2gj 21 2gj 17 97gj and 14 90gj respectively the redistributed ohu of tr ρ c p t r d v is 3 1gj 0 2gj 0 97gj and 0 73gj respectively accounting for 13 0 9 5 and 5 of the total ohu this indicates that the effect of qr adds an additional 13 of extra ohu in exp 1 relative to that in exp 2 moreover although the heat flux anomaly over the na in exp 3 50 f qr is nearly equivalent to f the total ohu in exp 3 is reduced by 10 as compared to the heat uptake of ta in exp 1 this is mainly because the strong negative qr in the regions outside the na especially for the low to mid latitude atlantic and the central and eastern equatorial pacific partly negates the effects of f in exp 3 consistent with t the total ohu in exp 4 is substantially smaller about 26 than the heat uptake of ta in exp 1 which is related to the combined effect of no added heat flux f in the na region and smaller qr the differences of global mean t and tr simulated in the four experiments are mainly caused by that in the atl arc region figs 3c and 3d show the changes in mean t and tr over the atl arc region with time the changes in mean t simulated in all four experiments in this region show a similar pattern to that of the global mean temperature change for instance in the final year the atl arc mean t simulated in the four experiments are 0 79 c 0 51 c 0 44 c and 0 31 c the mean values of tr over atl arc in both exp 2 and exp 3 are smaller than that in exp 1 for example in the final year the mean tr in the atl arc region in exp 1 exp 2 and exp 3 are 0 04 c 0 26 c and 0 05 c respectively the difference of tr between exp 1 and exp 2 is that in exp2 tr only decreases due to heat redistribution by ocean transport following amoc weakening however a similar redistribution also occurs in exp 1 qr also fluxes large amounts of heat into the region in exp1 but not in exp2 fig 2b and c driving up tr the relatively weaker tr simulated in exp 3 is mainly caused by the relatively small input of qr to the na due to 50 f added to the na i e only 42 of that in exp 1 though the mean tr simulated in exp 4 in the region is comparable to that in exp 1 it simulates the lowest t in the region as it does not impose f on the na region to further investigate the differences in ohu simulated in the four experiments fig 4 shows the patterns of changes in mean ocean heat content ohc ρ c p t d z and added ohc ρ c p t a d z and redistributed ohc ρ c p t r d z in the final decade 391 400 the changes in ohc simulated in the four experiments mainly occurred in the atlantic ocean and the southern ocean and the relatively strong added ohc increase appeared in the na and the southern ocean a significant decrease in redistributed ohc can be observed in the na and arctic region and a significant redistributed ohc increase in the low to mid latitude southern atlantic and the equatorial pacific the significant decrease in redistributed ohc over the na in the four experiments mainly resulted from the cooling due to resolved advection figure s1 which is consistent with the simulated amoc weakening to be discussed later for the resolved advection the redistributed ohc change is mainly driven by ocean circulation change υ t c instead of temperature change υ p t r figure s2 which is consistent with the results of winton et al 2013 the difference in ohc change between exp 1 and exp 2 is mainly attributed to difference in redistributed ohc change throughout the entire atlantic fig 4d which is more negative redistributed ohc change over the na and arctic region in exp 2 fig 4f this difference in redistributed ohc change is itself attributed to the double counting effects due to qr in exp 1 which is absent in exp 2 as both exp 2 and exp 3 can effectively represent the net effect of f over na in fafmip the ohc changes simulated in the two experiments are similar in the na region figs 4d and 4 g because exp 3 only applies 50 f to the na the change in added ohc is significantly smaller than that in exp 1 and exp 2 figs 4e and 4 h despite similar magnitudes of amoc weakening simulated in exp 2 and exp 3 to be discussed later the changes in redistributed ohc simulated in exp 3 are less negative than that of exp 2 due to the double counting effect in exp 3 the weaker associated tr partly offsets the weaker ta in exp 3 relative to exp 2 demonstrating the similarity of ohu in the na region between exp 2 and exp 3 because exp 4 does not impose a prescribed heat flux perturbation f over the na region changes in ohc and added ohc in the atl arc region are significantly less than that in the other three experiments it is noted that changes in redistributed ohc in exp 1 exp 3 and exp 4 exhibit decreases in the tropical pacific and increases in the equatorial pacific and the east coast of the pacific in exp 2 the redistributed ohc change exhibits an increase in the northern pacific and a decrease in the southern pacific which may result from the increased stratification and equatorward heat transport by the subtropical gyres dias et al 2020 fig 5a shows the amoc patterns in the final decade of ctrl ctrl can effectively simulate the basic characteristics of the amoc replicating an upper cell above 3000 m north atlantic deep water and a bottom cell below antarctic bottom water with the maximum simulated value being 13 2 sv compared with ctrl all four experiments show the patterns of amoc weakening figs 5b 5c and 5d amoc weakening simulated in exp 1 is the strongest and that in exp 2 and exp 3 is of comparable magnitude while that in exp 4 is the smallest for instance the final decadal mean maximum amoc values simulated in exp 1 exp 2 exp 3 and exp 4 have weakened by 7 5 sv 4 1 sv 3 9 sv and 1 9 sv respectively compared to ctrl the changes in the amoc simulated in the four experiments are significant because the weakening values of amoc are larger than 1 65 2 s according to the method of gregory et al 2016 where s is the interannual standard deviation of the amoc in the ctrl and is approximately 0 06 sv in our ctrl although the same f is applied in both exp 1 and exp 2 its influence is enhanced due to the double counting effect over the na in exp 1 further weakening amoc intensity by 3 4 sv fig 5b with the magnitude of additional weakening accounting for 26 of the amoc intensity in ctrl exp 2 and exp 3 are better able to apply the intended total forcing f than exp 1 because they avoid exp 2 or compensate for exp 3 the double heat flux count therefore the intensity of amoc weakening in exp 2 and exp 3 is closer to the magnitude expected at the time of co2 doubling in 1pctco2 experiments note that there is a clear negative correlation between amoc change and the qr of the na region figure s3 in exp 1 and the correlation coefficient is 0 89 suggesting the magnitude of qr is closely tied to changes in amoc strength 4 summary and discussion in this study we use an ogcm to quantitatively investigate the influence of anomalous redistribution heat flux qr on ohu and amoc change in particular we focused our analysis on the double counting effect in the na whereby the redistributed heat flux qr doubles the magnitude of the initial prescribed perturbation f and its effect on ohu and amoc change we did so by comparing two different heat flux treatments exp 1 and exp 2 using method b and method c respectively we found that exp 2 which suppresses the redistributed heat flux qr best represents the effect of added heat flux f in fafmip experiments among the four heat flux perturbation experiments when the redistributed heat flux feedback is included as in exp 1 qr increases the net ocean heat flux by 13 and weakens the amoc by 26 mainly because it nearly doubles the added heat flux into the na the additional ohu due to the redistribution feedback is consistent with the result about 10 of todd et al 2020 and couldrey et al 2021 we also compare the impact of reduced heat fluxes in the na region in the faf heat na50pct exp 3 and faf heat na0pct exp 4 experiments in fafmip in order to identify whether these experiments improve the ocean s response to prescribed surface heat flux f particularly with respect to ohu and amoc relative to the faf heat experiment exp 2 suppresses the redistributed heat flux qr therefore the magnitude of heat flux anomaly 50 f qr over na in exp 3 is nearly equivalent to that in exp 2 the intensity of amoc weakening is similar in exp 2 and exp 3 which weaken by 31 and 29 respectively and is closer to the magnitude of decline expected at the time of co2 doubling in 1pctco2 experiments than in exp 1 however the existence of negative qr in other regions such as central and eastern equatorial pacific and the southern ocean causes the global average f qr in exp 3 to be smaller than f in exp 1 and exp 2 therefore the ohu in exp 3 is reduced by 10 compared to added ohu in exp 1 and exp 2 exp 4 which imposes no f in the na fails to capture the global effects of f on patterns of ocean heat storage and amoc change and leads to approximately 26 less global ohu although no heat flux has been added in the na in exp 4 the amoc weakens by 14 1 9 sv relative to the control experiment our results are consistent with those of griffies et al 2009 and todd et al 2020 in that the redistributive heat flux qr causes the greater total ohu than the added ohc change in the four heat flux perturbation experiments the largest changes in ohc simulated in all the four experiments mainly occurred in the atlantic and southern oceans the main difference in ohc between exp 1 and exp 2 is that exp 2 simulates less ohu in the entire atlantic especially the negative ohc change that occurs in the south of iceland which is mainly due to differences in redistributed ohc changes simulated in the two experiments the smaller redistributed ohc change over atl arc region especially in the na region in exp 2 compared to that in exp 1 is mainly due to the absence of the qr effect double counting effect in the na this further suggests that the influence of qr especially the double counting effect in the na would significantly increase atlantic ohu especially in the na and arctic region as both exp 2 and exp 3 can effectively represent the effect of f over na in fafmip the ohc changes simulated in the two experiments are similar in the na region however there is less ohu in exp 3 than in exp 2 in the southern ocean and north pacific mainly due to the difference in redistributed ohc change since exp 4 does not impose a prescribed heat flux perturbation of f over the na region changes in ohc and added ohc in the atl arc region are significantly less than those in the other three experiments in this study our focus is on the effects of the redistributed heat flux feedback on ohu and amoc future studies will need to explore sea level change response to different heat flux perturbations in fafmip however there are several caveats to directly comparing the results of ogcms and aogcms first the atmospheric state variables are prescribed in ogcm experiments which are not affected by ocean circulation change i e atmosphere ocean feedback is absent second the quasi equilibriums between the ogcm using core i forcing and aogcms are different for example gregory and tailleux 2010 pointed out the different initial strengths that amoc tends to have as the amoc changes as co2 increases finally the weak sss restoring is used in the study which is absent in the aogcms future studies will be required to investigate how our results compare to the ocean response to the fafmip f and qr in aocgms credit authorship contribution statement jiangbo

23831,the flux anomaly forced model inter comparison project fafmip aims to study the response of the ocean to changes in prescribed surface flux heat freshwater and wind caused by atmospheric co2 increase among these surface flux perturbations the heat flux has the greatest effect on ocean heat uptake ohu the atlantic meridional circulation amoc and sea level changes this occurs in part because of the redistributed heat flux qr which is the component of the heat flux driven by ocean circulation changes and almost nearly doubles the initial heat flux perturbation f prescribed by fafmip in the north atlantic na in this study we used a standalone ocean model to quantitatively investigate the impact of qr on ohu and the amoc in prescribed heat anomaly experiments faf heat experiment in fafmip we also showed that whether the other two fafmip heat flux anomaly experiments faf heat na50pct and faf heat na0pct can reasonably simulate the ocean s response to prescribed surface heat flux especially ohu and amoc our findings show that faf heat na50pct is better because the redistribution feedback qr nearly equals the initial perturbation 50 f in the na and thus recovers the total perturbation f in faf heat although direct comparisons cannot be drawn both faf heat na50pct and faf heat experiments with no effect of qr cause amoc weakening that is roughly comparable with the 1pctco 2 experiments the magnitude of simulated amoc weakening in faf heat na50pct is 3 9sv accounting for about 29 of the amoc intensity in unperturbed experiment which is closer to the faf heat experiment about 31 with no effect of qr relative to the faf heat experiment because of negative qr in all regions except the na region especially for the central and eastern equatorial pacific and southern ocean the simulated global ohu in faf heat na50pct is reduced by 10 as compared to the added ohu in the faf heat experiment the qr in the faf heat experiment increases ohu by approximately 13 of the total ohu and further reduces amoc intensity by 3 4 sv accounting for 26 of the amoc strength in an unperturbed experiment faf heat na0pct results in a significant reduction in ohu approximately 26 and the magnitude of amoc weakening is only approximately 1 9 sv despite no f being added in the na keywords fafmip ogcm ocean climate change ohu amoc 1 introduction the ocean absorbs approximately 90 of the additional radiative heat in global warming scenarios atmospheric co2 concentration increase because of its large heat capacity church et al 2013a recent estimates of the ocean heat uptake ohu have shown that the ocean has warmed to above 2000 m in depth since 1950 levitus et al 2012 dias et al 2020 the ohu can mitigate the rate of surface climate change and causes global and regional sea level change church et al 2011 the ratio of global mean sea level rise to ohu is 0 12 m yj 1 according to coupled model inter comparison project phase 5 cmip5 results church et al 2013b ohu also influences the diagnosis and projection of transient surface warming garuba and klinger 2016 therefore an understanding of ohu is crucial to reduce the large uncertainty in projections of global and regional sea level changes exhibited by contemporary climate system models yin et al 2010 pardaens et al 2011 bouttes et al 2012 yin 2012 increased atmospheric co2 concentration causes air sea turbulence flux changes including changes in heat fresh water and wind stress garuba and klinger 2018 each of the co2 induced perturbations in heat freshwater and momentum surface fluxes contributes to changes in the pattern and magnitude of ohu and ocean circulation mikolajewicz and voss 2000 huber and zanna 2017 demonstrated that surface flux perturbations are major sources of spread in the estimations of ohu and sea level change the flux anomaly forced model inter comparison project fafmip was proposed to compare different model responses to surface flux perturbations and to understand the inter model spread in atlantic meridional overturning circulation amoc change ohu and sea level rise gregory et al 2016 fafmip participating climate and ocean models are all forced with the same prescribed surface fluxes of momentum heat and fresh water these forcing fluxes are derived from the ensemble mean differences between years 61 and 80 of 13 cmip5 atmosphere ocean general circulation models aogcms under 1pctco2 forcing corresponding to doubled co2 concentration relative to preindustrial levels and from all years of picontrol simulations and fixed seasonal cycles previous work has shown the heat flux perturbation is the most dominant factor contributing to amoc weakening ohu increase and sea level rise among the surface flux perturbations rahmstorf and ganapolski 1999 gregory et al 2006 bouttes and gregory 2014 gregory et al 2016 jin et al 2021 thus in the present study we focus on the heat flux perturbation experiments in fafmip the prescribed surface heat flux perturbation has been termed added heat flux f by bouttes and gregory 2014 and gregory et al 2016 and the surface heat flux perturbation caused by the circulation change through the redistribution of sea surface temperature sst gradients has been termed redistributed heat flux qr by gregory et al 2016 this redistributed heat flux is often associated with the weakening of amoc the weakened amoc reduces northward heat transport and leads to the cooling of sst in the north atlantic na which causes the redistributed heat flux and makes the ocean absorb more heat from the atmosphere banks and gregory 2006 xie and vallis 2012 marshall et al 2014 marshall et al 2014 used an ocean general circulation model ogcm to demonstrate the broad similarities between the change in temperature in a simplified ocean only model and that in cmip5 coupled climate models in response to global warming xie and vallis 2012 used an ocean model to show that redistribution due to amoc slowdown also increases the penetration speed of temperature anomalies garuba and klinger 2016 introduced a method for isolating and quantifying this active heat uptake component or redistribution feedback in an ocean only global warming experiment and found that most of the active heat uptake occurs in the na gregory et al 2016 indicated that the qr applying method b described in section 2 2 recommended by fafmip to compute surface heat flux is nearly equal to f in the na thus the average redistribution feedback nearly doubles the prescribed heat f input to the na region we called this phenomenon double counting the double counting effect further enhances the weakening of amoc however quantitative evaluation of the influence of qr especially for double counting heat flux over the na on ohu and the amoc in fafmip has been lacking fafmip experiments can be carried out with both aogcms and stand alone ogcms gregory et al 2016 couldrey et al 2021 showed the diversity of the ocean component in coupled models plays a key role in sea level projection uncertainties under greenhouse gas forcing by comparing the results of fafmip and 1pctco2 experiments in ocean only fafmip the atmospheric variables are prescribed the redistributive heat flux is mainly a result of the response of ocean processes to prescribed flux perturbations without including feedback from the atmosphere todd et al 2020 showed that the ocean only framework of fafmip enables a clearer assessment of the direct ocean response to surface flux perturbations relative to the coupled framework jin et al 2022 demonstrated that the changes in global mean temperature ocean heat content and steric sea level simulated in the ogcm are generally consistent with aogcm simulations therefore we have used an ogcm to conduct all three heat flux anomaly experiments faf heat faf heat na50pct and faf heat na0pct proposed by fafmip and applied two different methods method b and method c as described by gregory et al 2016 for computing the surface heat flux to quantitatively investigate the influence of qr in particular how double counting heat flux in the na influences ohu and amoc in the faf heat experiment additionally we explored whether the other two fafmip heat flux anomaly experiments faf heat na50pct and faf heat na0pct can offer a better ocean response to prescribed surface heat flux f relative to faf heat especially ohu and amoc change we note that while our experiments allow the direct assessment of the impact of surface flux perturbations on the ocean they do not include the atmosphere ocean feedback that exists in aogcms and the climate system which can alter the response of the amoc e g kostov et al 2019 the paper is structured as follows the details of the models and experiments are introduced in section 2 the results are detailed in section 3 and the summary and discussion are presented in section 4 2 the models and experiments 2 1 the models the ogcm used in this study is the revised climate system ocean model version 2 licom2 0 of the state key laboratory of numerical modeling for atmospheric sciences and geophysical fluid dynamics and the institute of atmospheric physics iap liu et al 2012 dong et al 2021 the model domain is between 78 5 s to 87 5 n with 1 zonal resolution the meridional resolution is refined to 0 5 between 10 s and 10 n and it is reduced gradually from 0 5 to 1 between 10 and 20 there are 30 levels in the vertical direction with 10 m per layer in the upper 150 m this resolution can resolve the equatorial waves and capture the upper mixed layer and thermocline lin et al 2013 the second order vertical turbulent mixing scheme was applied canuto et al 2001 2002 the scheme of gent and mcwilliams 1990 which uses a diffusion coefficient of 1000 m2 s for both the bolus and redi parts was used for the isopycnal mixing convection was parameterized by convective adjustment pacanowski 1995 the sea surface salinity boundary condition in the ogcm is the combination of new well posed boundary conditions jin et al 2017 and restoring boundary conditions the restoring boundary condition for sea surface salinity was used for preventing uncontrolled drifts in salinity as a response to inaccurate precipitation griffies et al 2009 the sst was not restored during the simulations this new well posed boundary condition uses the virtual salt flux that includes the proper correlations between the freshwater flux and surface salinity and the real salt flux is generally parameterized through 10 m wind speed u 10 which can conserve total ocean salinity see jin et al 2017 for more details the revised licom2 0 is the ogcm of the cas esm2 the second version of the chinese academy of sciences earth system model that participated in cmip6 2 2 methods following the tracer partitioned approach recommended by famfip gregory et al 2016 we divided the temperature change and ohu into added and redistributive components the partitioned approach is briefly introduced as follows using the subscripts c and p to denote values in the control and perturbation experiments respectively according to garuba and klinger 2016 2018 the advective diffusive equation of temperature tendency in the control experiment can be expressed with the following equation 1 t c t υ c t c q c for simplicity we set the specific heat capacity of seawater to unity in the equation q c is the sea surface heat flux υ c includes all transport processes such as the bolus component parameterizing eddy effects and mixing and υ c t c is a convergence i e represents all heat transport processes in the ocean including advection diffusion convection and ice freezing adjustment the temperature in the heat flux perturbation experiments is affected by the prescribed added heat anomaly f as well as the atmosphere ocean heat flux qp computed by the bulk formula thus the corresponding equation is given as follows 2 t p t υ p t p q p f where υ p t p is different from υ c t c because the velocities and diffusivities are changed due to the effects of f and t p on seawater density to eliminate the strong negative feedback between surface heat flux and sst to eliminate exaggerated effects of redistributed heat flux qr for maximizing the effect of f on the sea surface a tracer tr was initialized to t at time tp which is only forced by qp instead of f and does not directly affect seawater density the equation for the introduced tracer tr is written as follows 3 t r t υ p t r q p fafmip provides three methods method a method b and method c to compute surface heat flux in method a the prescribed heat flux f is positive in large regions the sea surface tp forced by the effects of f see eq 2 generally rises and is used to compute surface heat flux thus causing a large negative redistributive heat flux qr in the net surface heat flux into the ocean this negative redistributive heat flux qr opposes f especially for the ogcm framework since the atmospheric state variables are prescribed in ogcm experiments therefore this method has not been adopted in the ogcm experiments in method b the method recommended by fafmip a redistributed temperature tracer tr is introduced and not directly forced by f the sst used to compute qp is derived from the sea surface tr see eq 3 instead of tp moreover an added temperature tracer ta which is initialized at zero is also introduced and experiences only the prescribed surface heat flux perturbation f importantly the qp can be different from the surface heat flux qc in the control experiment this is because tr can be different from the prognostic surface temperature tc in the control experiment due to changes in advection or mixing therefore the difference between qp and qc would result in redistributed heat flux qr however in method c the sst for computing qp is supplied by sea surface tc see eq 1 from the control experiment which is not affected by the prescribed added heat flux f and change in ocean circulation therefore method c would result in almost no redistributed heat flux qr according to gregory et al 2016 although method c has certain disadvantages such as being more computationally expensive and suppressing the actual interaction between atmosphere and ocean it can be adopted in the ogcm experiment by using the daily frequency of sst in the control experiment which applies f accurately to the na without generating redistributed qr thus its simulation of the amoc decline may provide the best estimate of the response to the prescribed f in this paper we applied method b and method c to quantitatively evaluate the influence of qr on ohu and the amoc in fafmip the equation for total temperature anomaly can be derived from eqs 1 and 2 as follows 4 t t υ c t υ t c υ t f q r where the primes denote anomalies compared to the control experiment according to method b the equation for t a can be written as follows 5 t a t υ p t a f where t a is zero when there is no prescribed surface heat flux f the difference between t a and t is the redistributive temperature anomaly t r which can be written as eq 4 minus eq 5 6 t r t υ p t r υ t c q r note that tr is mainly affected by ocean circulation change υ t c and qr in method b while qr is nearly zero in method c thus the difference of tr in method b and method c can represent the role of qr 2 3 experiments the standalone ogcm has been integrated for 300 years to reach quasi equilibrium in the upper ocean using the coordinated ocean ice reference experiments i core i protocol proposed by griffies et al 2009 the core i provides climatological mean repeating normal year forcing of large and yeager 2004 including surface wind surface air temperature and specific humidity at 10 m height sea level pressure downward shortwave radiation downward longwave radiation and precipitation including rain and snow which are mostly at 6 hourly intervals the control and perturbation experiments have continued to integrate 100 years each initialized from a near equilibrium period year 301 the control experiment is forced with only the core i called ctrl here we have conducted four heat flux perturbation experiments exp 1 exp 2 exp 3 and exp 4 exp 1 which is run using method b to compute surface heat fluxes isolates the effects of pure redistributive heat flux qr and the added heat flux perturbation f on the ocean state exp 2 which is run using method c suppresses the redistributive heat flux and accurately exhibits the effect of the added heat flux perturbation f on the ocean climate change both exp 1 and exp 2 apply the same prescribed added heat flux perturbation f which is denoted as the faf heat experiment in fafmip exp 3 which is denoted as the faf heat na50pct in fafmip couldrey et al 2022 applies the same prescribed added heat flux perturbation f as exp 1 and exp 2 but only 50 f within the part of the na 80 w 10 e 30 65 n to eliminate double counting heat input in the na and realistically represent the ocean change due to the effect of f exp 4 which is denoted as faf heat na0pct in fafmip couldrey et al 2022 does not apply f in the na region note that the perturbation f outside the na region in exp 3 and exp 4 are the same as in exp 1 and exp 2 all the setups of the three experiments exp 1 exp 3 and exp 4 are the same except that difference added heat flux perturbation f are applied in the na region the details of the five experiments are provided in table 1 it is noteworthy that ice freezing adjustment can result in additional heat flux anomaly therefore we applied the same ice freezing adjustment heat flux in each perturbation experiments as that in ctrl 3 results the imposed surface heat flux perturbations f prescribed by fafmip were added to the sea surface which contributes to a change in the pattern and magnitude of the ocean circulation resulting in redistributive heat flux qr time series of global mean quantities give a useful indication of the approach to the steady state fig 1 shows the time series of global mean and na mean total surface heat flux perturbation f qr and the redistributed heat flux qr simulated in different perturbation experiments relative to ctrl fig 1a shows that the global mean f qr in all the perturbation experiments exhibits similar trends except for exp 2 the global mean f qr increases during the first few years and gradually decreases which is the result of variability in qr fig 1b because f is almost constant and has no annual trend and variability the time means over the entire simulation of f qr in exp 2 using method c remain constant at about 1 87 w m2 table 2 which is almost equal to f about 1 86 w m2 dashed red line in fig 1a this indicates that by applying method c exp 2 can avoid the global effect of qr because of the effect of qr the global mean of f qr in exp 1 is 2 15 w m 2 and significantly larger than f and the corresponding qr in exp 1 and exp 2 are 0 29 w m2 and 0 01 w m2 respectively the global mean f qr values in exp 3 and exp 4 are 1 65 w m2 and 1 31 w m2 respectively both of which are smaller than f in exp 1 and exp 2 largely because f in the na region is smaller in exps 3 4 the corresponding global qr means in exp 3 and exp 4 are 0 06 w m2 and 0 05 w m2 respectively in the na region within the red box of fig 2a the f qr in exp 2 remains constant and almost equal to f fig 1c and qr is almost zero fig 1d thus exp 2 has almost no double heat flux counting effects meaning that this experiment realistically represents the ocean s responses to the prescribed added heat flux f in the na the means of qr and of f in the na over the entire simulation in exp 1 are 14 25 w m2 and 10 69 w m2 respectively and the mean values of qr and 50 f in the na simulated in exp 3 are 6 04 w m2 and 5 35 w m2 respectively therefore the redistributive heat flux qr in exp 1 and exp 3 is nearly equivalent to the prescribed heat flux in the na 100 f in exp 1 and 50 f in exp 3 demonstrating the double counting effect there as a result both experiments exaggerate the effect of their respective f in the na however because exp 3 only applies 50 of f in the na the total heat flux anomaly into the na is 50 f qr approximately 11 39 w m2 which is comparable to f 10 69 w m2 in exp 1 because no f was added in the na the mean qr over the na simulated in exp 4 is only approximately 2 34 w m2 fig 2 shows the patterns of prescribed sea surface heat flux perturbation f in fafmip and redistributed heat flux anomaly qr simulated in the four heat flux perturbation experiments the most evident feature of f is that it is positive in the na and the southern ocean indicating strong input of heat flux to the ocean fig 2a interestingly qr in exp 1 is similar to that in the aogcm mean shown in fig 2d of gregory et al 2016 the positive qr is located in the na region and the negative qr in the low to mid latitude atlantic and the central and eastern equatorial pacific this suggests that the effects of qr in our ogcm experiments especially the doubling of heat flux over the na may provide insight into aogcm heat flux anomaly experiments in fafmip the qr patterns simulated in exp 1 exp 3 and exp 4 are similar figs 2b 2d and 2e only the magnitudes of qr are different the magnitude of qr is the largest in exp 1 followed by exp 2 and smallest in exp 3 consistent with the global and na mean values figs 1b and 1d the qr simulated in exp 2 shows no substantial change in most regions fig 2c and in particular it has no effect in the na which means no double counting effect the total heat flux anomaly over na in exp 2 is mainly caused by the prescribed f which is nearly equivalent to the effect of heat flux anomaly 50 f qr in exp 3 the differences in the mean qr of the na between the three experiments exp 1 exp 3 and exp 4 are mostly caused by differences in amoc changes to be discussed later which mainly stem from differences in the magnitude of f over the na the amoc weakening leads to reduced northward heat transport which results in the consequent cooling of redistributed sst in the na region and warming of redistributed sst in low to mid latitude atlantic the different degrees of amoc change in the three experiments result in the different magnitudes of negative qr in low to mid latitude atlantic and positive qr in the na region the qr simulated in exp 1 exp 3 and exp 4 exhibited negative heat flux anomalies similar to active heat loss in garuba and klinger 2018 in the central and eastern equatorial pacific which is mainly associated with the el niño like redistributed sst anomaly caused by the weakening of the pacific subtropical shallow cell in response to the warming scenarios luo et al 2016 this shows that the heat flux anomaly experiments in fafmip can reproduce the weakening of both the amoc and the pacific subtropical cell to further distinguish the effects of f and qr fig 3 provides the time series of the global mean and atlantic arctic atl arc mean temperature anomaly t and tr the global mean t simulated in all four perturbation experiments shows a trend of substantial increase fig 3a similar to the global mean surface heat flux the t simulated in exp 1 shows the most significant increase followed by that in exp 2 the magnitude of increase in t simulated in exp 3 is slightly smaller than that of exp 2 while that of exp 4 is the smallest for instance in the final year the global mean t simulated in the four perturbation experiments are 0 443 c 0 390 c 0 340 c and 0 287 c however the increase in global mean t in exp 2 is consistent with ta in exp 1 with the latter determined almost entirely by f in exp 1 0 386 c red dashed line in fig 3a this indicates that the global mean tr forced by qr in exp 2 has almost no global effect on t this result further demonstrates that exp 2 can almost eliminate the effect of qr fig 3b especially for global scale the increase in global mean tr simulated in exp 1 leads to higher t than ta which further exaggerates the role of f leading to excessive increase in ohu ρ c p t d v in fafmip the global mean tr simulated in exp 3 and exp 4 is similar being 0 013 c and 0 011 c at the end of the simulations respectively which is consistent with the global mean qr in the two experiments the global mean t in both exp 3 and exp 4 is lower than ta in exp 1 due to the different f imposed in the na fig 3a which leads to relatively weak ohu for instance in the final year the ohu simulated in exp 1 exp 2 exp 3 and exp 4 is 24 3 gj 21 6 gj 18 9 gj and 15 63 gj respectively the added ohu of ta ρ c p t a d v simulated in the four experiments is 21 2gj 21 2gj 17 97gj and 14 90gj respectively the redistributed ohu of tr ρ c p t r d v is 3 1gj 0 2gj 0 97gj and 0 73gj respectively accounting for 13 0 9 5 and 5 of the total ohu this indicates that the effect of qr adds an additional 13 of extra ohu in exp 1 relative to that in exp 2 moreover although the heat flux anomaly over the na in exp 3 50 f qr is nearly equivalent to f the total ohu in exp 3 is reduced by 10 as compared to the heat uptake of ta in exp 1 this is mainly because the strong negative qr in the regions outside the na especially for the low to mid latitude atlantic and the central and eastern equatorial pacific partly negates the effects of f in exp 3 consistent with t the total ohu in exp 4 is substantially smaller about 26 than the heat uptake of ta in exp 1 which is related to the combined effect of no added heat flux f in the na region and smaller qr the differences of global mean t and tr simulated in the four experiments are mainly caused by that in the atl arc region figs 3c and 3d show the changes in mean t and tr over the atl arc region with time the changes in mean t simulated in all four experiments in this region show a similar pattern to that of the global mean temperature change for instance in the final year the atl arc mean t simulated in the four experiments are 0 79 c 0 51 c 0 44 c and 0 31 c the mean values of tr over atl arc in both exp 2 and exp 3 are smaller than that in exp 1 for example in the final year the mean tr in the atl arc region in exp 1 exp 2 and exp 3 are 0 04 c 0 26 c and 0 05 c respectively the difference of tr between exp 1 and exp 2 is that in exp2 tr only decreases due to heat redistribution by ocean transport following amoc weakening however a similar redistribution also occurs in exp 1 qr also fluxes large amounts of heat into the region in exp1 but not in exp2 fig 2b and c driving up tr the relatively weaker tr simulated in exp 3 is mainly caused by the relatively small input of qr to the na due to 50 f added to the na i e only 42 of that in exp 1 though the mean tr simulated in exp 4 in the region is comparable to that in exp 1 it simulates the lowest t in the region as it does not impose f on the na region to further investigate the differences in ohu simulated in the four experiments fig 4 shows the patterns of changes in mean ocean heat content ohc ρ c p t d z and added ohc ρ c p t a d z and redistributed ohc ρ c p t r d z in the final decade 391 400 the changes in ohc simulated in the four experiments mainly occurred in the atlantic ocean and the southern ocean and the relatively strong added ohc increase appeared in the na and the southern ocean a significant decrease in redistributed ohc can be observed in the na and arctic region and a significant redistributed ohc increase in the low to mid latitude southern atlantic and the equatorial pacific the significant decrease in redistributed ohc over the na in the four experiments mainly resulted from the cooling due to resolved advection figure s1 which is consistent with the simulated amoc weakening to be discussed later for the resolved advection the redistributed ohc change is mainly driven by ocean circulation change υ t c instead of temperature change υ p t r figure s2 which is consistent with the results of winton et al 2013 the difference in ohc change between exp 1 and exp 2 is mainly attributed to difference in redistributed ohc change throughout the entire atlantic fig 4d which is more negative redistributed ohc change over the na and arctic region in exp 2 fig 4f this difference in redistributed ohc change is itself attributed to the double counting effects due to qr in exp 1 which is absent in exp 2 as both exp 2 and exp 3 can effectively represent the net effect of f over na in fafmip the ohc changes simulated in the two experiments are similar in the na region figs 4d and 4 g because exp 3 only applies 50 f to the na the change in added ohc is significantly smaller than that in exp 1 and exp 2 figs 4e and 4 h despite similar magnitudes of amoc weakening simulated in exp 2 and exp 3 to be discussed later the changes in redistributed ohc simulated in exp 3 are less negative than that of exp 2 due to the double counting effect in exp 3 the weaker associated tr partly offsets the weaker ta in exp 3 relative to exp 2 demonstrating the similarity of ohu in the na region between exp 2 and exp 3 because exp 4 does not impose a prescribed heat flux perturbation f over the na region changes in ohc and added ohc in the atl arc region are significantly less than that in the other three experiments it is noted that changes in redistributed ohc in exp 1 exp 3 and exp 4 exhibit decreases in the tropical pacific and increases in the equatorial pacific and the east coast of the pacific in exp 2 the redistributed ohc change exhibits an increase in the northern pacific and a decrease in the southern pacific which may result from the increased stratification and equatorward heat transport by the subtropical gyres dias et al 2020 fig 5a shows the amoc patterns in the final decade of ctrl ctrl can effectively simulate the basic characteristics of the amoc replicating an upper cell above 3000 m north atlantic deep water and a bottom cell below antarctic bottom water with the maximum simulated value being 13 2 sv compared with ctrl all four experiments show the patterns of amoc weakening figs 5b 5c and 5d amoc weakening simulated in exp 1 is the strongest and that in exp 2 and exp 3 is of comparable magnitude while that in exp 4 is the smallest for instance the final decadal mean maximum amoc values simulated in exp 1 exp 2 exp 3 and exp 4 have weakened by 7 5 sv 4 1 sv 3 9 sv and 1 9 sv respectively compared to ctrl the changes in the amoc simulated in the four experiments are significant because the weakening values of amoc are larger than 1 65 2 s according to the method of gregory et al 2016 where s is the interannual standard deviation of the amoc in the ctrl and is approximately 0 06 sv in our ctrl although the same f is applied in both exp 1 and exp 2 its influence is enhanced due to the double counting effect over the na in exp 1 further weakening amoc intensity by 3 4 sv fig 5b with the magnitude of additional weakening accounting for 26 of the amoc intensity in ctrl exp 2 and exp 3 are better able to apply the intended total forcing f than exp 1 because they avoid exp 2 or compensate for exp 3 the double heat flux count therefore the intensity of amoc weakening in exp 2 and exp 3 is closer to the magnitude expected at the time of co2 doubling in 1pctco2 experiments note that there is a clear negative correlation between amoc change and the qr of the na region figure s3 in exp 1 and the correlation coefficient is 0 89 suggesting the magnitude of qr is closely tied to changes in amoc strength 4 summary and discussion in this study we use an ogcm to quantitatively investigate the influence of anomalous redistribution heat flux qr on ohu and amoc change in particular we focused our analysis on the double counting effect in the na whereby the redistributed heat flux qr doubles the magnitude of the initial prescribed perturbation f and its effect on ohu and amoc change we did so by comparing two different heat flux treatments exp 1 and exp 2 using method b and method c respectively we found that exp 2 which suppresses the redistributed heat flux qr best represents the effect of added heat flux f in fafmip experiments among the four heat flux perturbation experiments when the redistributed heat flux feedback is included as in exp 1 qr increases the net ocean heat flux by 13 and weakens the amoc by 26 mainly because it nearly doubles the added heat flux into the na the additional ohu due to the redistribution feedback is consistent with the result about 10 of todd et al 2020 and couldrey et al 2021 we also compare the impact of reduced heat fluxes in the na region in the faf heat na50pct exp 3 and faf heat na0pct exp 4 experiments in fafmip in order to identify whether these experiments improve the ocean s response to prescribed surface heat flux f particularly with respect to ohu and amoc relative to the faf heat experiment exp 2 suppresses the redistributed heat flux qr therefore the magnitude of heat flux anomaly 50 f qr over na in exp 3 is nearly equivalent to that in exp 2 the intensity of amoc weakening is similar in exp 2 and exp 3 which weaken by 31 and 29 respectively and is closer to the magnitude of decline expected at the time of co2 doubling in 1pctco2 experiments than in exp 1 however the existence of negative qr in other regions such as central and eastern equatorial pacific and the southern ocean causes the global average f qr in exp 3 to be smaller than f in exp 1 and exp 2 therefore the ohu in exp 3 is reduced by 10 compared to added ohu in exp 1 and exp 2 exp 4 which imposes no f in the na fails to capture the global effects of f on patterns of ocean heat storage and amoc change and leads to approximately 26 less global ohu although no heat flux has been added in the na in exp 4 the amoc weakens by 14 1 9 sv relative to the control experiment our results are consistent with those of griffies et al 2009 and todd et al 2020 in that the redistributive heat flux qr causes the greater total ohu than the added ohc change in the four heat flux perturbation experiments the largest changes in ohc simulated in all the four experiments mainly occurred in the atlantic and southern oceans the main difference in ohc between exp 1 and exp 2 is that exp 2 simulates less ohu in the entire atlantic especially the negative ohc change that occurs in the south of iceland which is mainly due to differences in redistributed ohc changes simulated in the two experiments the smaller redistributed ohc change over atl arc region especially in the na region in exp 2 compared to that in exp 1 is mainly due to the absence of the qr effect double counting effect in the na this further suggests that the influence of qr especially the double counting effect in the na would significantly increase atlantic ohu especially in the na and arctic region as both exp 2 and exp 3 can effectively represent the effect of f over na in fafmip the ohc changes simulated in the two experiments are similar in the na region however there is less ohu in exp 3 than in exp 2 in the southern ocean and north pacific mainly due to the difference in redistributed ohc change since exp 4 does not impose a prescribed heat flux perturbation of f over the na region changes in ohc and added ohc in the atl arc region are significantly less than those in the other three experiments in this study our focus is on the effects of the redistributed heat flux feedback on ohu and amoc future studies will need to explore sea level change response to different heat flux perturbations in fafmip however there are several caveats to directly comparing the results of ogcms and aogcms first the atmospheric state variables are prescribed in ogcm experiments which are not affected by ocean circulation change i e atmosphere ocean feedback is absent second the quasi equilibriums between the ogcm using core i forcing and aogcms are different for example gregory and tailleux 2010 pointed out the different initial strengths that amoc tends to have as the amoc changes as co2 increases finally the weak sss restoring is used in the study which is absent in the aogcms future studies will be required to investigate how our results compare to the ocean response to the fafmip f and qr in aocgms credit authorship contribution statement jiangbo

23832,in ocean and climate models the simulation of upper ocean temperature and salinity depends on mixing parameterizations for ocean surface boundary layer turbulence existing mixing parameterizations are based on physical principles with empirical parameters however they are still imperfect leading to biases in the simulation of physical states in the upper ocean in this study we explore the use of the data based machine learning technique specifically a deep neural network model for the effects of vertical mixing in the ocean surface boundary layer the model is trained using process oriented simulations of the upper ocean turbulence driven by realistic forcing conditions at the ocean station papa that is a mid latitude ocean climate station the deep neural network model outperforms traditional physics based parameterizations that relate the mixing effects to surface forcing using deterministic formulas the deep neural network model is also used to explore two currently debated issues in the development of physics based mixing parameterizations including the representation of wave forcing and the history of forcing conditions keywords ocean surface boundary

and in the near future fox kemper et al 2014 2019 for the following reasons most models for the realistic ocean have to be configured on grids that are coarser than the scale of osbl turbulence tens of centimeters to meters even in a small domain setting where model grids could be as fine as at a scale of meters those models are based on hydrostatic approximation that excludes osbl turbulence in addition to the above mentioned computational and physical limitations numerically hindcast forecast models utilize finite volume or finite difference schemes that are flexible and efficient but less accurate than spectral methods used in models to compute turbulence in an idealized version of hindcast forecast model that neglects the effect of horizontal processes the effect of ocean surface boundary layer on prognostic variables are calculated as follows 1a c t m i x i n g w c z where c represents a tracer such as temperature and salinity and w is vertical velocity prime indicates fluctuation associated with turbulence and overbar means ensemble averaged quantity without signals of turbulence subscript mixing denotes that this is the time tendency due only to vertical turbulent mixing by osbl turbulence other terms and their effect on the time tendency are neglected for simplicity turbulent fluctuations i e w and c in the above equation cannot be calculated in hindcast and forecast models they must be approximated using averaged variables i e c and forcing conditions through a parameterization as follows 1b w c z z k t c z γ c where k t are the vertical diffusivity and υ c is the counter gradient or non local term e g deardorff 1966 in some parameterizations to account for tracer transport that is not inversely related to the spatial gradient of the tracer the counter gradient term is important when coherent structures such as buoyancy driven convective cells and wave driven langmuir circulations are dominant those coherent structures fill the whole ocean surface boundary layer and tracer transport is no longer local and unrelated to the local tracer gradient i e c z in eq 1 parameters i e k t and υ c are deterministic functions of variables including surface forcing conditions wind wave and buoyancy flux and water column conditions their treatment is different in the two classes of commonly used physics based mixing parameterization in the first order parameterizations such as the k profile parameterization e g large et al 1994 the dependence of the parameters on surface forcing and water column conditions is direct in the second moment

model e g kantha and clayson 1994 umlauf and burchard 2003 reichl and hallberg 2018 those parameterizations usually work well for flows under one of the three forcing conditions wind wave and buoyancy

number of parameters in those parameterizations are tuned using data from either field observations or high fidelity process oriented computer simulations when one of the three forcing conditions dominates or exists e g harcourt 2015 reichl et al 2016 they are less accurate when the three forcing conditions are similarly important or when the surface buoyancy flux is stabilizing e g li et al 2019 however the realistic ocean is usually under the comparable influence of all three forcing conditions fig 1a or with surface buoyancy flux stabilizing the upper ocean fig 1b biases in the simulated upper ocean states using those parameterizations remain degrading our hindcasting forecasting ability of the upper ocean states the marine ecosystem and the coupling of the ocean with the atmosphere e g belcher et al 2012 given the aforementioned challenges in traditional physics based osbl mixing parameterizations this study explores the use of machine learning specifically a deep

study are 1 to train a dnn model to parameterize the mixing effects of osbl turbulence 2 to compare the dnn model with a few traditional physics based parameterizations using a single column model and 3 to explore the significance of different forcing parameters using the dnn model the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the dnn model and a few traditional deterministic parameterizations used for comparison section 3 describes the data used to develop and evaluate the dnn model section 4 presents and discusses model results and section 5 summarizes the important conclusions and discusses possible future research directions 2 model description 2 1 a physics informed deep neural network model for the vertical mixing by ocean surface boundary layer turbulence a feedforward deep neural network dnn model e g goodfellow et al 2016 is used in this study as opposed to representing the vertical mixing effect by osbl turbulence using deterministic functions such as eq 1 a dnn model provides an effective and flexible approximation of non linear mapping between an input layer containing profiles of temperature and salinity and forcing conditions and an output layer containing profiles of the time derivatives of the variables i e the left hand side term in eq 1a the profiles of the time derivative of temperature and salinity are then used to prognostically calculate the profiles of temperature and salinity like using a traditional physics based parameterization we also experimented using the profiles of turbulent fluxes i e the right hand side term in eq 1a as output and the prognostic temperature and salinity profiles are the same the input and output layers are connected by one or multiple hidden layers fig 3 assume there are a total of m layers including the input j 1 hidden j 2 to m 1 and output j m layers the output of neuron i in layer j with n j neurons i e x i j is calculated using outputs from the previous layer i e x i j 1 as goodfellow et al 2016 2 x i j f k 1 n j 1 w k i j 1 x k i j 1 b k i j 1 where w k i j 1 and b k i j 1 are the weight and bias directing from neuron k in layer j 1 to neuron i in layer j respectively and f is the activation function the optimized set of weights and biases are determined through a learning process in other words each neuron represents a simple operation defined by an activation function the output of each neuron is used as input to neurons in the next layer in a feedforward dnn model operations in each neuron collectively contribute to the mapping from the input layer to the output layer in addition to the set of weights and bias there are a few hyperparameters in the model i e those predefined and not optimized during each learning including the activation function the loss function and the numbers of hidden layers and neurons these hyperparameters are selected after the learning stage using data not used in the learning the leaky rectified linear unit leakyrelu f x max 0 1 x x e g maas et al 2013 one of the popular ones in dnn models is used as the nonlinear activation function in this study it was reported by gentine et al 2018 that the leakyrelu shows the best performance among a few activation functions our own sensitivity experiments also showed that the leakyrelu results in the fastest decrease in both the training and validation losses over epochs and best final scores among a few activation functions including rectified linear unit relu tangent hyperbolic f x tan h x and the sigmoid f x 1 e x 1 the loss function used to gauge the performance of the trained model is defined as 3 l o s s x p r e d i c t i o n x t r u t h 2 α d h c d t q h e a t d s c d t q s a l t where x p r e d i c t i o n and x t r u t h are the variables in the output layer and from the data the les solutions in this study respectively hc and sc stand for water column heat and salt content respectively and α is a constant set to 0 1 in this study the first term on the right hand side of eq 3 measures the deviation of the predicted results from the data the second right hand side term is a penalty when the prediction violates heat and salt conservation penalizing the loss when physical principles are violated is one of the popular approaches to add physical constraint to a dnn model with the loss function the trained dnn model not only best re produces the data but also best abides by conservation laws to seek the optimized set of w k i j 1 and b k i j 1 that best map variables in the input layer to those in the output layer available data are first separated into three independent sets a training dataset a validation set and a prediction testing set the determination of the optimal set of w k i j 1 and b k i j 1 is formulated as a supervised learning problem where the main goal is to minimize the loss function based on the training data set the optimization of w k i j 1 and b k i j 1 is achieved by the stochastic gradient descent methods which iteratively choose new values of w k i j 1 and b k i j 1 to reduce the loss function the learning process is repeated for 2000 iterations the parameters that result in the smallest generalization error of the model which is the loss estimated on a validation dataset that is independent of the training set are selected sensitivity experiments with 4000 iterations were conducted to confirm that the generalization error will not further decrease after 2000 iterations the training of the dnn model is conducted using the python library tensorflow http www tensorflow org and the python library keras https keras io the computer code can be accessed through the link in the acknowledgement section using nvidia geforce rtx 2080 ti gpu each training and validation process takes about 10 min to complete a number of tests using the dnn model with different model hyperparameters and inputs are reported in this paper table 1 in the control simulation the dnn model has 1 hidden layer and 256 neurons in the hidden layer the numbers of hidden layer and neuron result in the smallest error and are selected by sensitivity experiments that systematically vary the two numbers the input layer includes profiles of temperature and salinity as well as forcing including wind vector surface buoyancy flux the vertical profiles of the stokes drift at the current time step t and the previous time step t δ t with δ t 30 min here the stokes drift is wave averaged current associated with wave and drives wave driven langmuir turbulence when it interacts with ocean currents e g craik and leibovich 1976 in addition to the control simulation two groups of sensitivity experiments are conducted to decide the input that constructs the best model the first group of sensitivity experiments is devised to explore model performance under different representations of surface wave forcing while the importance of wave forcing is realized how it is represented differs in different parameterizations e g li et al 2019 in addition to the control simulation where the vertical profile of the stokes drift vector is used to represent wave effect three sensitivity experiments using the surface stokes drift magnitude and the surface stokes drift vector respectively are conducted the second group of sensitivity experiments in which the input layer includes forcing without history t and that with a 1 h history t t δ t and t 2 δ t respectively is designed to test the effect of forcing history on the performance of mixing parameterizations 2 2 the general ocean turbulence model gotm the performance of the dnn models is compared with conventional osbl mixing parameterizations with deterministic formulas for this purpose the general ocean turbulence model gotm burchard et al 1999 umlauf and burchard 2005 umlauf et al 2014 is used the gotm is a library and testbed of parameterizations for vertical mixing by osbl turbulence it belongs to the single column model that excludes the impacts of horizontal processes the gotm includes several commonly used osbl mixing parameterizations in this study two variants of the k profile parameterizations kpp large et al 1994 that is a popular first order model including the kpp cvmix e g large et al 1994 li et al 2021 van roekel et al 2018 and the kpp lf17 li and fox kemper 2017 are included in the comparison it is shown in li et al 2019 that the performance of kpp lf17 is similar to some other variants of the kpp including wave effects e g van roekel et al 2012 reichl et al 2016 the kpp cvmix is the kpp in the community ocean vertical mixing cvmix project griffies et al 2015 and is used in a few global ocean models such as the parallel ocean program version 2 pop2 smith et al 2010 it includes the mixing effects of wind and cooling driven turbulence but not those of wave driven langmuir circulations the other kpp variant i e kpp lf17 includes the effect of langmuir turbulence lt in the framework of kpp by enhancing both the magnitude of diffusivity and the entrainment at the base of the osbl they differ in the forms of the enhancement factors for diffusivity and entrainment see li et al 2019 for a detailed comparison of the three parameterizations in addition to the kpp another type of commonly used parameterization is second moment closure schemes e g harcourt 2015 kantha and clayson 2004 it was concluded in li et al 2019 that those schemes perform similarly to the kpp and therefore the comparison between the dnn model and different variants of the kpp is representative of that between the data based dnn model and traditional physics based parameterizations 3 data description the data for training validating and testing the dnn model and for evaluating traditional physics based parameterization in the gotm are turbulence resolving solutions for ocean station papa 50 n 145 w calculated using the national center for atmospheric research large eddy simulation ncar les model e g sullivan et al 1996 the ncar les model has been extensively used to study osbl turbulence driven by one or a combination of wind wave and heating cooling e g sullivan and mcwilliams 2010 and has been shown to accurately reproduce in situ observations when the effect of osbl turbulence dominates e g liang et al 2020 solutions from les models are traditionally used to derive physics based parameterizations with deterministic formulas for the effects of osbl turbulence e g chor et al 2021 yang et al 2015 sinha et al 2015 van roekel et al 2018 as they fully resolve osbl turbulence yet exclude all other larger scale processes those solutions are commonly used to tune and evaluate parameterizations in a 1 d model setting such as within the framework of the gotm e g van roekel et al 2018 li et al 2019 the ocean station papa located at the north pacific subpolar gyre 50 n 145 w fig 1c is selected since continuous high resolution measurements of physical and chemical states and fluxes at and near both sides of the air sea interfaces insights into physical and biogeochemical processes in the upper ocean have been gained through the analysis of observation at the station and accompanying computer simulations e g alford et al 2012 cronin et al 2015 kaminski et al 2021 for this study the ncar les model was run for about nine years from september 2010 to june 2019 during which high resolution observations of wind wave surface heat flux and the profiles of temperature and salinity e g cronin et al 2015 thomson et al 2013 are available there is a period between fall 2017 and spring 2018 when the directional wave spectrum is not available and that period is excluded in the simulation the forcing conditions including wind wave and surface buoyancy both heat and freshwater forcing were applied uniformly across horizontal locations of the domain the model was restarted every ten days during each restart in situ profiles of temperature and salinity were used as initial conditions across horizontal locations of the domain a 6 h simulation with constant forcing at the start of the period was used to spin up the turbulence field observed surface wind wave and surface buoyancy flux were used as surface forcing conditions the forcing conditions at this station during the multi year simulation cover a wide range of meteorological conditions that are representative of mid latitude oceans turbulence is not predominantly governed by one of three types although the dominance of langmuir turbulence is more common than that of the other two types of turbulence compared to the osbl turbulence of the global ocean osbl turbulence at the station is more influenced by wave driven langmuir turbulence and is much less influenced by buoyancy driven convective turbulence fig 2 a to c show the comparison between the les solutions and observation the model agrees generally with the observations slight deviation of model solutions from the observation is expected as the les model includes only osbl turbulence and the effects from larger scale circulations i e submesoscale mesoscale and basin scale currents are not excluded it should be noted that liang et al 2017 showed that the same les model and configuration accurately reproduce the physical and chemical environment in the osbl during a 15 day period without significant influence from processes other than osbl turbulence the exclusion of other processes makes the les solutions superior over in situ data for the purpose of developing osbl mixing parameterization for the study horizontally and temporally averaged temperature and salinity profiles were archived every half hour excluding the first 12 h of each simulation there are approximately 80 000 vertical profiles of temperature and salinity respectively around 72 14 5 and 13 5 of the remaining solutions and the corresponding forcing conditions were used for the training validation and testing of the dnn model respectively 4 results 4 1 performance of the dnn model the skill of the dnn model is evaluated by comparison with the les solutions which are considered the truth and with solutions using the conventional physics based parameterizations note that the performance assessment in this section is based on the testing dataset from the les solutions that is independent of the training and validating datasets and is not used for the learning of the dnn model fig 4 compares the prediction by the dnn model and two different traditional parameterizations kpp cvmix and kpp lf17 for a 9 day period in december 2010 the wind is moderate at the beginning of the period with a speed 10 m above the sea level u 10 around 10 m s fig 4a the wind weakens to about 5 m s at around day 2 and slowly strengthens to more than 18 m s at around day 5 two different forms of langmuir numbers i e msm97 mcwilliams et al 1997 and vr12 van roekel et al 2012 are plotted in fig 4b there is no substantial difference between msm97 and another popular langmuir number proposed by harcourt and d asaro 2008 not shown the difference between vr12 and msm97 is evident as vr12 includes the effect of wind wave mis alignment shows more variability than msm97 langmuir number is mostly close to 0 3 during most of the period implying the existence of wave driven langmuir turbulence during the period it briefly goes above below 0 3 when the wind strengthens weakens implying the dominance of wind wave driven turbulence during those moments the net surface heat flux cools the osbl and there are a few episodic rain events the osbl continuously cools and deepens during the period it also gets saltier when high salinity water in the thermocline is entrained into the osbl fig 4c and d all three models including the dnn model the kpp cvmix and the kpp lf17 capture the trends for mixed layer depth temperature and salinity in the osbl fig 4e to j the predicted mixed layer depth by the dnn model closely follows that by the les model the predicted temperature in the osbl by the dnn model is slightly cooler than the truth the les solutions on the order of 0 1 c fig 4e traditional deterministic parameterizations i e the two variants of the kpp model predict a substantially warmer mixed layer by more than 1 c fig 4g and i similar to that for temperature the error for salinity is smaller for the dnn model than for the two traditional parameterizations fig 4f h and j by comparing the mixed layer depth it is obvious that the two kpp models predict a mixed layer shallower than the truth while the mixed layer depth diagnosed from the dnn solutions closely follows the truth it should be noted that the kpp lf17 i e the kpp that includes wave induced mixing does predict a slightly deeper cooler and saltier osbl than the kpp cvmix does the difference between kpp lf17 and kpp cvmix in our simulations qualitatively agrees with fig 2 in li et al 2019 however the difference between kpp lf17 and kpp cvmix is much smaller than that between the two and the truth therefore is not evident in fig 4 implying that including wave effect in a traditional physics based model still cannot match the truth as well as the dnn model does like over the global ocean the most common meteorological condition at the osp is also when the three types of turbulence are similarly important or when the surface buoyancy flux is stabilizing fig 1 those are the conditions when traditional physics based parameterizations struggle li et al 2019 the skill of the dnn model for all prediction periods is evaluated using the statistics of errors fig 5 both the mean and the standard deviation of the errors for both temperature and salinity are significantly smaller for the solutions using the dnn model than those using the two variants of the kpp model both kpp cvmix and kpp lf17 systematically predict warmer and fresher osbl while the mean error for both temperature and salinity using the dnn model is less obvious the comparison of model error statistics confirms that the data based dnn model on average outperforms the two traditional physics based parameterizations although the learning of dnn model is not based on the testing dataset the dnn model performs well as the forcing conditions in the testing dataset i e the input overlaps with those in the training and validation datasets in the parameter space shown in fig 1 4 2 discussion based on sensitivity experiments in this subsection the sensitivity of the dnn model to model inputs including the forms of wave forcing and the history of forcing is evaluated using the taylor diagrams fig 6 respectively in the taylor diagram three metrics viz the mean absolute error solid grey lines the root mean square error solid black lines and correlation dashed black lines representing the error the scattering of the prediction and the similarity in pattern respectively are presented in the same figure results from the two traditional parameterizations are not included in the comparison as the errors from those two models are much larger than those using the dnn framework it should be noted that the optimal numbers of hidden layers and neurons in each layer are different when input variables for dnn model are different table 1 sensitivity experiments by altering those hyperparameters not shown were conducted to select those optimal numbers 4 2 1 the importance of stokes drift profile the first group of sensitivity experiments examine the choice of wave forcing those two tests include one using surface stokes drift without directional information green cross and one using surface stokes drift vector blue cross the dnn models with surface stokes as input are used to mimic the input of commonly used first order parameterization for langmuir circulations such as the kpp lf17 li and fox kemper 2017 in those parameterizations a turbulent langmuir number that is a function of surface or near surface stokes drift is included as a parameter to quantify the effects of wave driven langmuir turbulence there are a few variants of turbulent langmuir number la t used in different parameterization here the dnn model using stokes drift magnitude as an input corresponds to parameterizations e g mcwilliams and sullivan 2000 using the la t originally defined in mcwilliams et al 1997 the dnn model using stokes drift vector mimics parameterizations e g van roekel et al 2012 li and fox kemper 2017 using la t that considers wind wave misalignment e g van roekel et al 2012 note that there is a third popular variant of la t that uses near surface averaged stokes drift instead of surface stokes drift e g harcourt and d asaro 2008 the solutions of the two sensitivity experiments have larger errors than those of the control simulation fig 6a and b the control simulation red dots out performs the two sensitivity experiments blue pluses and green crosses in terms of root mean square error rmse by more than 15 implying that the detailed stokes drift profile is better than surface stokes drift in representing the effect of waves this is expected as the subsurface profile of stokes drift is complicated when both swell and wind wave are present e g mcwilliams et al 2014 breivik and christensen 2020 and the detailed profile is important in determining the production of turbulent kinetic energy in the osbl 4 2 2 the importance of forcing history the second group of sensitivity experiments are designed to test an important assumption in first order osbl turbulence parameterizations such as the kpp in those parameterizations forcing conditions at the current time step are used and the underlying assumption is that osbl turbulence and its mixing effect are always in equilibrium with surface forcing conditions wind wave and surface buoyancy flux over much of the global ocean however surface forcing conditions are always changing associated with atmospheric variability at the weather and climatic scales consequently osbl turbulence and its mixing effect are seldom in equilibrium with forcing conditions it has never been evaluated how significant the effect of forcing history is the length of the forcing history could be decided by considering the following scaling the velocity scale of ocean surface boundary layer turbulence at mild to moderate forcing is 10 2 m s 1 cm s and the vertical scale of ocean surface boundary layer in most of the global ocean is 101 m so the eddy turnover time and the turbulence response time scale are on the order of 103 s in a recent study by wang and kukulka 2021 where the les model is driven by an abruptly changing wind it is shown that turbulence response time is at a scale of 103 s since the wind abruptly changes direction with that consideration a 30 min history of forcing conditions both t and t δ t with δ t 30 min is used as input in the control simulation and in the first group of sensitivity experiments comparisons of errors in the control simulation driven by a 30 min history of forcing red dots and the sensitivity experiment driven by forcing conditions without history yellow triangles mimicking first order parameterizations fig 6a and b show that the control simulations perform better by more than 15 in terms of rmse another sensitivity experiment driven by a one hour history of forcing conditions purple squares yields similar results as the control simulation and out performs the sensitivity experiment driven by forcing conditions without history therefore including the history forcing in osbl mixing parameterizations improve the prediction of upper ocean states 5 summary and future research directions in this study a deep neural network dnn model that is a type of machine learning model for the effect of ocean surface boundary layer osbl turbulence is trained using 9 year process oriented numerical solutions for the ocean station papa osp that is at the subpolar pacific ocean computer code for training the dnn model is available through a link in the acknowledgement section the dnn model is evaluated and compared against two popular traditional physics based parameterizations using deterministic formulas i e two variants of the k profile parameterizations kpp including the kpp cvmix e g large et al 1994 griffies et al 2015 and the kpp lf17 li and fox kemper 2017 it is also used to investigate the choice of forcing conditions in parameterizations for osbl turbulence important conclusions from the results are 1 the data based machine learning model viz the physics informed deep neural network dnn model outperforms two popular traditional physics based parameterizations namely the kpp cvmix and the kpp lf17 2 including wave forcing improves the performance of the dnn model the use of a stokes drift profile is superior to the use of surface stokes drift 3 including a 30 min or 1 h history of forcing conditions as input for the dnn model improves the prediction over the use of forcing conditions without any history while the profiles of stokes drift and the history of forcing are not in first order parameterizations like the kpp they are inherently in second order closures e g umlauf and burchard 2003 2005 kantha and clayson 2004 harcourt 2015 in second order closures turbulent characteristics such as its intensity dissipation rate and length scale is prognostically calculated using equations that includes the vertical profile of the stokes drift and the history of forcing is retained during time integration our study shows the promise of a dnn model for the parameterization of vertical mixing in the osbl in this study the dnn model was trained and tested for conditions at ocean station papa that is representative of conditions at the mid latitude the model should be applicable to regions under forcing conditions within the parameter space shown in fig 1 a and b before the application of the trained dnn model to a region forcing conditions in that region need to be examined to ensure that they are within the parameter space of the training data fig 1 a and b also show that the training data still miss some turbulence regimes most notably convective turbulence in deep mixed layers that is typical at high latitudes and strongly heated boundary layer that is at the tropical regions process oriented solutions from the large eddy simulation model at a variety of geographic locations such as those at the southern ocean e g large et al 2019 in the tropics and in other ocean regions need to be included in the training and validation datasets to expand the parameter space that the trained dnn model can tackle recently les simulations for the ocean under realistic hurricane conditions are also available e g rabe et al 2015 liang et al 2020 if those solutions are added to the training and validation datasets the trained dnn model will also be applicable for the ocean under those extreme conditions finally while the current study tests the dnn model in a single column model which is an idealized version of a hindcasting forecasting ocean model future research will implement the dnn model in hindcast forecast ocean models and test it in regional and global oceans our ongoing efforts to implement the dnn model in the coupled ocean atmosphere wave sediment transport coawst model

23832,in ocean and climate models the simulation of upper ocean temperature and salinity depends on mixing parameterizations for ocean surface boundary layer turbulence existing mixing parameterizations are based on physical principles with empirical parameters however they are still imperfect leading to biases in the simulation of physical states in the upper ocean in this study we explore the use of the data based machine learning technique specifically a deep neural network model for the effects of vertical mixing in the ocean surface boundary layer the model is trained using process oriented simulations of the upper ocean turbulence driven by realistic forcing conditions at the ocean station papa that is a mid latitude ocean climate station the deep neural network model outperforms traditional physics based parameterizations that relate the mixing effects to surface forcing using deterministic formulas the deep neural network model is also used to explore two currently debated issues in the development of physics based mixing parameterizations including the representation of wave forcing and the history of forcing conditions keywords ocean surface boundary layer parameterization mixing machine learning 1 introduction ocean surface boundary layer osbl turbulence plays an important role in the ocean environment and global climate it mediates the rate of exchange of heat and materials between the atmosphere and the interior ocean e g sallée et al 2013 liang et al 2013 controls the effect of the ocean on the atmosphere by determining the temperature of the sea surface e g chen et al 1994 richards et al 2009 modulates ocean ecosystem by setting the physical and chemical environment of the euphotic zone e g taylor and ferrari 2011 and alter the dispersion and transport of pollutants in the near surface ocean e g liang et al 2018 2021 kukulka 2020 with continued efforts using advanced observational techniques and high fidelity computer simulations it is now understood that osbl turbulence is primarily driven by three processes at the sea surface viz wind e g skyllingstad et al 1999 heating cooling e g li et al 2005 pearson et al 2015 and ocean surface gravity waves e g d asaro et al 2014 qiao et al 2004 it is also altered by other factors including density stratification price and sundermeyer 1999 the earth s rotation liu et

submesoscale currents e g hamlington et al 2014 sullivan and mcwilliams 2019 yuan and liang 2021 in hindcast forecast ocean and climate models osbl turbulence cannot be explicitly simulated currently and in the near future fox kemper et al 2014 2019 for the following reasons most models for the realistic ocean have to be configured on grids that are coarser than the scale of osbl turbulence tens of centimeters to meters even in a small domain setting where model grids could be as fine as at a scale of meters those models are based on hydrostatic approximation that excludes osbl turbulence in addition to the above mentioned computational and physical limitations numerically hindcast forecast models utilize finite volume or finite difference schemes that are flexible and efficient but less accurate than spectral methods used in models to compute turbulence in an idealized version of hindcast forecast model that neglects the effect of horizontal processes the effect of ocean surface boundary layer on prognostic variables are calculated as follows 1a c t m i x i n g w c z where c represents a tracer such as temperature and salinity and w is vertical velocity prime indicates fluctuation associated with turbulence and overbar means ensemble averaged quantity without signals of turbulence subscript mixing denotes that this is the time tendency due only to vertical turbulent mixing by osbl turbulence other terms and their effect on the time tendency are neglected for simplicity turbulent fluctuations i e w and c in the above equation cannot be calculated in hindcast and forecast models they must be approximated using averaged variables i e c and forcing conditions through a parameterization as follows 1b w c z z k t c z γ c where k t are the vertical diffusivity and υ c is the counter gradient or non local term e g deardorff 1966 in some parameterizations to account for tracer transport that is not inversely related to the spatial gradient of the tracer the counter gradient term is important when coherent structures such as buoyancy driven convective cells and wave driven langmuir circulations are dominant those coherent structures fill the whole ocean surface boundary layer and tracer transport is no longer local and unrelated to the local tracer gradient i e c z in eq 1 parameters i e k t and υ c are deterministic functions of variables including surface forcing conditions wind wave and buoyancy flux and water column conditions their treatment is different in the two classes of commonly used physics based mixing parameterization in the first order parameterizations such as the k profile parameterization e g large et al 1994 the dependence of the parameters on surface forcing and water column conditions is direct in the second moment parameterizations k t and υ c are diagnosed from turbulence statistics such as the kinetic energy the length scales and the dissipation rate of turbulence that are prognostically calculated in the model e g kantha and clayson 1994 umlauf and burchard 2003 reichl and hallberg 2018 those parameterizations usually work well for flows under one of the three forcing conditions wind wave and buoyancy forcing for the following two reasons 1 theories exist for the velocity scale of turbulence driven by each of those forcing conditions e g belcher et al 2012 d asaro et al 2014 and 2 the limited number of parameters in those parameterizations are tuned using data from either field observations or high fidelity process oriented computer simulations when one of the three forcing conditions dominates or exists e g harcourt 2015 reichl et al 2016 they are less accurate when the three forcing conditions are similarly important or when the surface buoyancy flux is stabilizing e g li et al 2019 however the realistic ocean is usually under the comparable influence of all three forcing conditions fig 1a or with surface buoyancy flux stabilizing the upper ocean fig 1b biases in the simulated upper ocean states using those parameterizations remain degrading our hindcasting forecasting ability of the upper ocean states the marine ecosystem and the coupling of the ocean with the atmosphere e g belcher et al 2012 given the aforementioned challenges in traditional physics based osbl mixing parameterizations this study explores the use of machine learning specifically a deep neural network dnn model to parameterize the vertical mixing effects of osbl turbulence in recent years machine learning techniques that are data based have attracted attention in the community of atmospheric and oceanic sciences and have been investigated for different applications such as ensemble weather forecasting e g rasp and lerch 2018 the parameterization of convection in atmospheric

bolton and zanna 2019 zanna and bolton 2020 and the prediction of ocean currents from observations e g liu and weisberg 2005 and satellite images e g zeng et al 2015 the specific objectives of the study are 1 to train a dnn model to parameterize the mixing effects of osbl turbulence 2 to compare the dnn model with a few traditional physics based parameterizations using a single column model and 3 to explore the significance of different forcing parameters using the dnn model the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the dnn model and a few traditional deterministic parameterizations used for comparison section 3 describes the data used to develop and evaluate the dnn model section 4 presents and discusses model results and section 5 summarizes the important conclusions and discusses possible future research directions 2 model description 2 1 a physics informed deep neural network model for the vertical mixing by ocean surface boundary layer turbulence a feedforward deep neural network dnn model e g goodfellow et al 2016 is used in this study as opposed to representing the vertical mixing effect by osbl turbulence using deterministic functions such as eq 1 a dnn model provides an effective and flexible approximation of non linear mapping between an input layer containing profiles of temperature and salinity and forcing conditions and an output layer containing profiles of the time derivatives of the variables i e the left hand side term in eq 1a the profiles of the time derivative of temperature and salinity are then used to prognostically calculate the profiles of temperature and salinity like using a traditional physics based parameterization we also experimented using the profiles of turbulent fluxes i e the right hand side term in eq 1a as output and the prognostic temperature and salinity profiles are the same the input and output layers are connected by one or multiple hidden layers fig 3 assume there are a total of m layers including the input j 1 hidden j 2 to m 1 and output j m layers the output of neuron i in layer j with n j neurons i e x i j is calculated using outputs from the previous layer i e x i j 1 as goodfellow et al 2016 2 x i j f k 1 n j 1 w k i j 1 x k i j 1 b k i j 1 where w k i j 1 and b k i j 1 are the weight and bias directing from neuron k in layer j 1 to neuron i in layer j respectively and f is the activation function the optimized set of weights and biases are determined through a learning process in other words each neuron represents a simple operation defined by an activation function the output of each neuron is used as input to neurons in the next layer in a feedforward dnn model operations in each neuron collectively contribute to the mapping from the input layer to the output layer in addition to the set of weights and bias there are a few hyperparameters in the model i e those predefined and not optimized during each learning including the activation function the loss function and the numbers of hidden layers and neurons these hyperparameters are selected after the learning stage using data not used in the learning the leaky rectified linear unit leakyrelu f x max 0 1 x x e g maas et al 2013 one of the popular ones in dnn models is used as the nonlinear activation function in this study it was reported by gentine et al 2018 that the leakyrelu shows the best performance among a few activation functions our own sensitivity experiments also showed that the leakyrelu results in the fastest decrease in both the training and validation losses over epochs and best final scores among a few activation functions including rectified linear unit relu tangent hyperbolic f x tan h x and the sigmoid f x 1 e x 1 the loss function used to gauge the performance of the trained model is defined as 3 l o s s x p r e d i c t i o n x t r u t h 2 α d h c d t q h e a t d s c d t q s a l t where x p r e d i c t i o n and x t r u t h are the variables in the output layer and from the data the les solutions in this study respectively hc and sc stand for water column heat and salt content respectively and α is a constant set to 0 1 in this study the first term on the right hand side of eq 3 measures the deviation of the predicted results from the data the second right hand side term is a penalty when the prediction violates heat and salt conservation penalizing the loss when physical principles are violated is one of the popular approaches to add physical constraint to a dnn model with the loss function the trained dnn model not only best re produces the data but also best abides by conservation laws to seek the optimized set of w k i j 1 and b k i j 1 that best map variables in the input layer to those in the output layer available data are first separated into three independent sets a training dataset a validation set and a prediction testing set the determination of the optimal set of w k i j 1 and b k i j 1 is formulated as a supervised learning problem where the main goal is to minimize the loss function based on the training data set the optimization of w k i j 1 and b k i j 1 is achieved by the stochastic gradient descent methods which iteratively choose new values of w k i j 1 and b k i j 1 to reduce the loss function the learning process is repeated for 2000 iterations the parameters that result in the smallest generalization error of the model which is the loss estimated on a validation dataset that is independent of the training set are selected sensitivity experiments with 4000 iterations were conducted to confirm that the generalization error will not further decrease after 2000 iterations the training of the dnn model is conducted using the python library tensorflow http www tensorflow org and the python library keras https keras io the computer code can be accessed through the link in the acknowledgement section using nvidia geforce rtx 2080 ti gpu each training and validation process takes about 10 min to complete a number of tests using the dnn model with different model hyperparameters and inputs are reported in this paper table 1 in the control simulation the dnn model has 1 hidden layer and 256 neurons in the hidden layer the numbers of hidden layer and neuron result in the smallest error and are selected by sensitivity experiments that systematically vary the two numbers the input layer includes profiles of temperature and salinity as well as forcing including wind vector surface buoyancy flux the vertical profiles of the stokes drift at the current time step t and the previous time step t δ t with δ t 30 min here the stokes drift is wave averaged current associated with wave and drives wave driven langmuir turbulence when it interacts with ocean currents e g craik and leibovich 1976 in addition to the control simulation two groups of sensitivity experiments are conducted to decide the input that constructs the best model the first group of sensitivity experiments is devised to explore model performance under different representations of surface wave forcing while the importance of wave forcing is realized how it is represented differs in different parameterizations e g li et al 2019 in addition to the control simulation where the vertical profile of the stokes drift vector is used to represent wave effect three sensitivity experiments using the surface stokes drift magnitude and the surface stokes drift vector respectively are conducted the second group of sensitivity experiments in which the input layer includes forcing without history t and that with a 1 h history t t δ t and t 2 δ t respectively is designed to test the effect of forcing history on the performance of mixing parameterizations 2 2 the general ocean turbulence model gotm the performance of the dnn models is compared with conventional osbl mixing parameterizations with deterministic formulas for this purpose the general ocean turbulence model gotm burchard et al 1999 umlauf and burchard 2005 umlauf et al 2014 is used the gotm is a library and testbed of parameterizations for vertical mixing by osbl turbulence it belongs to the single column model that excludes the impacts of horizontal processes the gotm includes several commonly used osbl mixing parameterizations in this study two variants of the k profile parameterizations kpp large et al 1994 that is a popular first order model including the kpp cvmix e g large et al 1994 li et al 2021 van roekel et al 2018 and the kpp lf17 li and fox kemper 2017 are included in the comparison it is shown in li et al 2019 that the performance of kpp lf17 is similar to some other variants of the kpp including wave effects e g van roekel et al 2012 reichl et al 2016 the kpp cvmix is the kpp in the community ocean vertical mixing cvmix project griffies et al 2015 and is used in a few global ocean models such as the parallel ocean program version 2 pop2 smith et al 2010 it includes the mixing effects of wind and cooling driven turbulence but not those of wave driven langmuir circulations the other kpp variant i e kpp lf17 includes the effect of langmuir turbulence lt in the framework of kpp by enhancing both the magnitude of diffusivity and the entrainment at the base of the osbl they differ in the forms of the enhancement factors for diffusivity and entrainment see li et al 2019 for a detailed comparison of the three parameterizations in addition to the kpp another type of commonly used parameterization is second moment closure schemes e g harcourt 2015 kantha and clayson 2004 it was concluded in li et al 2019 that those schemes perform similarly to the kpp and therefore the comparison between the dnn model and different variants of the kpp is representative of that between the data based dnn model and traditional physics based parameterizations 3 data description the data for training validating and testing the dnn model and for evaluating traditional physics based parameterization in the gotm are turbulence resolving solutions for ocean station papa 50 n 145 w calculated using the national center for atmospheric research large eddy simulation ncar les model e g sullivan et al 1996 the ncar les model has been extensively used to study osbl turbulence driven by one or a combination of wind wave and heating cooling e g sullivan and mcwilliams 2010 and has been shown to accurately reproduce in situ observations when the effect of osbl turbulence dominates e g liang et al 2020 solutions from les models are traditionally used to derive physics based parameterizations with deterministic formulas for the effects of osbl turbulence e g chor et al 2021 yang et al 2015 sinha et al 2015 van roekel et al 2018 as they fully resolve osbl turbulence yet exclude all other larger scale processes those solutions are commonly used to tune and evaluate parameterizations in a 1 d model setting such as within the framework of the gotm e g van roekel et al 2018 li et al 2019 the ocean station papa located at the north pacific subpolar gyre 50 n 145 w fig 1c is selected since continuous high resolution measurements of physical and chemical states and fluxes at and near both sides of the air sea interfaces insights into physical and biogeochemical processes in the upper ocean have been gained through the analysis of observation at the station and accompanying computer simulations e g alford et al 2012 cronin et al 2015 kaminski et al 2021 for this study the ncar les model was run for about nine years from september 2010 to june 2019 during which high resolution observations of wind wave surface heat flux and the profiles of temperature and salinity e g cronin et al 2015 thomson et al 2013 are available there is a period between fall 2017 and spring 2018 when the directional wave spectrum is not available and that period is excluded in the simulation the forcing conditions including wind wave and surface buoyancy both heat and freshwater forcing were applied uniformly across horizontal locations of the domain the model was restarted every ten days during each restart in situ profiles of temperature and salinity were used as initial conditions across horizontal locations of the domain a 6 h simulation with constant forcing at the start of the period was used to spin up the turbulence field observed surface wind wave and surface buoyancy flux were used as surface forcing conditions the forcing conditions at this station during the multi year simulation cover a wide range of meteorological conditions that are representative of mid latitude oceans turbulence is not predominantly governed by one of three types although the dominance of langmuir turbulence is more common than that of the other two types of turbulence compared to the osbl turbulence of the global ocean osbl turbulence at the station is more influenced by wave driven langmuir turbulence and is much less influenced by buoyancy driven convective turbulence fig 2 a to c show the comparison between the les solutions and observation the model agrees generally with the observations slight deviation of model solutions from the observation is expected as the les model includes only osbl turbulence and the effects from larger scale circulations i e submesoscale mesoscale and basin scale currents are not excluded it should be noted that liang et al 2017 showed that the same les model and configuration accurately reproduce the physical and chemical environment in the osbl during a 15 day period without significant influence from processes other than osbl turbulence the exclusion of other processes makes the les solutions superior over in situ data for the purpose of developing osbl mixing parameterization for the study horizontally and temporally averaged temperature and salinity profiles were archived every half hour excluding the first 12 h of each simulation there are approximately 80 000 vertical profiles of temperature and salinity respectively around 72 14 5 and 13 5 of the remaining solutions and the corresponding forcing conditions were used for the training validation and testing of the dnn model respectively 4 results 4 1 performance of the dnn model the skill of the dnn model is evaluated by comparison with the les solutions which are considered the truth and with solutions using the conventional physics based parameterizations note that the performance assessment in this section is based on the testing dataset from the les solutions that is independent of the training and validating datasets and is not used for the learning of the dnn model fig 4 compares the prediction by the dnn model and two different traditional parameterizations kpp cvmix and kpp lf17 for a 9 day period in december 2010 the wind is moderate at the beginning of the period with a speed 10 m above the sea level u 10 around 10 m s fig 4a the wind weakens to about 5 m s at around day 2 and slowly strengthens to more than 18 m s at around day 5 two different forms of langmuir numbers i e msm97 mcwilliams et al 1997 and vr12 van roekel et al 2012 are plotted in fig 4b there is no substantial difference between msm97 and another popular langmuir number proposed by harcourt and d asaro 2008 not shown the difference between vr12 and msm97 is evident as vr12 includes the effect of wind wave mis alignment shows more variability than msm97 langmuir number is mostly close to 0 3 during most of the period implying the existence of wave driven langmuir turbulence during the period it briefly goes above below 0 3 when the wind strengthens weakens implying the dominance of wind wave driven turbulence during those moments the net surface heat flux cools the osbl and there are a few episodic rain events the osbl continuously cools and deepens during the period it also gets saltier when high salinity water in the thermocline is entrained into the osbl fig 4c and d all three models including the dnn model the kpp cvmix and the kpp lf17 capture the trends for mixed layer depth temperature and salinity in the osbl fig 4e to j the predicted mixed layer depth by the dnn model closely follows that by the les model the predicted temperature in the osbl by the dnn model is slightly cooler than the truth the les solutions on the order of 0 1 c fig 4e traditional deterministic parameterizations i e the two variants of the kpp model predict a substantially warmer mixed layer by more than 1 c fig 4g and i similar to that for temperature the error for salinity is smaller for the dnn model than for the two traditional parameterizations fig 4f h and j by comparing the mixed layer depth it is obvious that the two kpp models predict a mixed layer shallower than the truth while the mixed layer depth diagnosed from the dnn solutions closely follows the truth it should be noted that the kpp lf17 i e the kpp that includes wave induced mixing does predict a slightly deeper cooler and saltier osbl than the kpp cvmix does the difference between kpp lf17 and kpp cvmix in our simulations qualitatively agrees with fig 2 in li et al 2019 however the difference between kpp lf17 and kpp cvmix is much smaller than that between the two and the truth therefore is not evident in fig 4 implying that including wave effect in a traditional physics based model still cannot match the truth as well as the dnn model does like over the global ocean the most common meteorological condition at the osp is also when the three types of turbulence are similarly important or when the surface buoyancy flux is stabilizing fig 1 those are the conditions when traditional physics based parameterizations struggle li et al 2019 the skill of the dnn model for all prediction periods is evaluated using the statistics of errors fig 5 both the mean and the standard deviation of the errors for both temperature and salinity are significantly smaller for the solutions using the dnn model than those using the two variants of the kpp model both kpp cvmix and kpp lf17 systematically predict warmer and fresher osbl while the mean error for both temperature and salinity using the dnn model is less obvious the comparison of model error statistics confirms that the data based dnn model on average outperforms the two traditional physics based parameterizations although the learning of dnn model is not based on the testing dataset the dnn model performs well as the forcing conditions in the testing dataset i e the input overlaps with those in the training and validation datasets in the parameter space shown in fig 1 4 2 discussion based on sensitivity experiments in this subsection the sensitivity of the dnn model to model inputs including the forms of wave forcing and the history of forcing is evaluated using the taylor diagrams fig 6 respectively in the taylor diagram three metrics viz the mean absolute error solid grey lines the root mean square error solid black lines and correlation dashed black lines representing the error the scattering of the prediction and the similarity in pattern respectively are presented in the same figure results from the two traditional parameterizations are not included in the comparison as the errors from those two models are much larger than those using the dnn framework it should be noted that the optimal numbers of hidden layers and neurons in each layer are different when input variables for dnn model are different table 1 sensitivity experiments by altering those hyperparameters not shown were conducted to select those optimal numbers 4 2 1 the importance of stokes drift profile the first group of sensitivity experiments examine the choice of wave forcing those two tests include one using surface stokes drift without directional information green cross and one using surface stokes drift vector blue cross the dnn models with surface stokes as input are used to mimic the input of commonly used first order parameterization for langmuir circulations such as the kpp lf17 li and fox kemper 2017 in those parameterizations a turbulent langmuir number that is a function of surface or near surface stokes drift is included as a parameter to quantify the effects of wave driven langmuir turbulence there are a few variants of turbulent langmuir number la t used in different parameterization here the dnn model using stokes drift magnitude as an input corresponds to parameterizations e g mcwilliams and sullivan 2000 using the la t originally defined in mcwilliams et al 1997 the dnn model using stokes drift vector mimics parameterizations e g van roekel et al 2012 li and fox kemper 2017 using la t that considers wind wave misalignment e g van roekel et al 2012 note that there is a third popular variant of la t that uses near surface averaged stokes drift instead of surface stokes drift e g harcourt and d asaro 2008 the solutions of the two sensitivity experiments have larger errors than those of the control simulation fig 6a and b the control simulation red dots out performs the two sensitivity experiments blue pluses and green crosses in terms of root mean square error rmse by more than 15 implying that the detailed stokes drift profile is better than surface stokes drift in representing the effect of waves this is expected as the subsurface profile of stokes drift is complicated when both swell and wind wave are present e g mcwilliams et al 2014 breivik and christensen 2020 and the detailed profile is important in determining the production of turbulent kinetic energy in the osbl 4 2 2 the importance of forcing history the second group of sensitivity experiments are designed to test an important assumption in first order osbl turbulence parameterizations such as the kpp in those parameterizations forcing conditions at the current time step are used and the underlying assumption is that osbl turbulence and its mixing effect are always in equilibrium with surface forcing conditions wind wave and surface buoyancy flux over much of the global ocean however surface forcing conditions are always changing associated with atmospheric variability at the weather and climatic scales consequently osbl turbulence and its mixing effect are seldom in equilibrium with forcing conditions it has never been evaluated how significant the effect of forcing history is the length of the forcing history could be decided by considering the following scaling the velocity scale of ocean surface boundary layer turbulence at mild to moderate forcing is 10 2 m s 1 cm s and the vertical scale of ocean surface boundary layer in most of the global ocean is 101 m so the eddy turnover time and the turbulence response time scale are on the order of 103 s in a recent study by wang and kukulka 2021 where the les model is driven by an abruptly changing wind it is shown that turbulence response time is at a scale of 103 s since the wind abruptly changes direction with that consideration a 30 min history of forcing conditions both t and t δ t with δ t 30 min is used as input in the control simulation and in the first group of sensitivity experiments comparisons of errors in the control simulation driven by a 30 min history of forcing red dots and the sensitivity experiment driven by forcing conditions without history yellow triangles mimicking first order parameterizations fig 6a and b show that the control simulations perform better by more than 15 in terms of rmse another sensitivity experiment driven by a one hour history of forcing conditions purple squares yields similar results as the control simulation and out performs the sensitivity experiment driven by forcing conditions without history therefore including the history forcing in osbl mixing parameterizations improve the prediction of upper ocean states 5 summary and future research directions in this study a deep neural network dnn model that is a type of machine learning model for the effect of ocean surface boundary layer osbl turbulence is trained using 9 year process oriented numerical solutions for the ocean station papa osp that is at the subpolar pacific ocean computer code for training the dnn model is available through a link in the acknowledgement section the dnn model is evaluated and compared against two popular traditional physics based parameterizations using deterministic formulas i e two variants of the k profile parameterizations kpp including the kpp cvmix e g large et al 1994 griffies et al 2015 and the kpp lf17 li and fox kemper 2017 it is also used to investigate the choice of forcing conditions in parameterizations for osbl turbulence important conclusions from the results are 1 the data based machine learning model viz the physics informed deep neural network dnn model outperforms two popular traditional physics based parameterizations namely the kpp cvmix and the kpp lf17 2 including wave forcing improves the performance of the dnn model the use of a stokes drift profile is superior to the use of surface stokes drift 3 including a 30 min or 1 h history of forcing conditions as input for the dnn model improves the prediction over the use of forcing conditions without any history while the profiles of stokes drift and the history of forcing are not in first order parameterizations like the kpp they are inherently in second order closures e g umlauf and burchard 2003 2005 kantha and clayson 2004 harcourt 2015 in second order closures turbulent characteristics such as its intensity dissipation rate and length scale is prognostically calculated using equations that includes the vertical profile of the stokes drift and the history of forcing is retained during time integration our study shows the promise of a dnn model for the parameterization of vertical mixing in the osbl in this study the dnn model was trained and tested for conditions at ocean station papa that is representative of conditions at the mid latitude the model should be applicable to regions under forcing conditions within the parameter space shown in fig 1 a and b before the application of the trained dnn model to a region forcing conditions in that region need to be examined to ensure that they are within the parameter space of the training data fig 1 a and b also show that the training data still miss some turbulence regimes most notably convective turbulence in deep mixed layers that is typical at high latitudes and strongly heated boundary layer that is at the tropical regions process oriented solutions from the large eddy simulation model at a variety of geographic locations such as those at the southern ocean e g large et al 2019 in the tropics and in other ocean regions need to be included in the training and validation datasets to expand the parameter space that the trained dnn model can tackle recently les simulations for the ocean under realistic hurricane conditions are also available e g rabe et al 2015 liang et al 2020 if those solutions are added to the training and validation datasets the trained dnn model will also be applicable for the ocean under those extreme conditions finally while the current study tests the dnn model in a single column model which is an idealized version of a hindcasting forecasting ocean model future research will implement the dnn model in hindcast forecast ocean models and test it in regional and global oceans our ongoing efforts to implement the dnn model in the coupled ocean atmosphere wave sediment transport coawst model

23833,land sea breeze forcing near a land boundary drives both a locally forced response and an associated offshore propagating internal wave response the effects of which can be difficult to separate these processes enhance vertical mixing near the critical latitude for diurnal inertial resonance 30 n s and are a feature of all four major eastern boundary upwelling systems here we employ 1d and 2d vertical model configurations forced by a land sea breeze to quantify the relative contributions of the locally forced and internal wave responses to surface currents and vertical mixing and test sensitivity to latitude and bottom slope we further include a sub inertial alongshore wind to consider the role of the land sea breeze in the context of upwelling systems at the critical latitude the internal waves generated via thermocline pumping near the land boundary are evanescent in agreement with theory and largely absent 50 km offshore the internal waves are shown to contribute to vertical mixing which can be 20 greater than that due to the forced response alone further deepening the surface ekman boundary layer this deepening reduces the sub inertial offshore advection of surface waters thereby retaining the upwelling front closer to the land boundary and driving a net warming of the nearshore surface waters cross shore horizontal oscillations of the upwelling front generated by the land sea breeze drive strong diurnal variability in sea surface temperature in agreement with observations from a cross shore mooring array in the southern benguela 32 3 s keywords land sea breeze inertial oscillations internal waves vertical mixing critical latitude coastal upwelling 1 introduction the land sea breeze is a ubiquitous feature of the world s coastlines driving diurnal wind variability which is detectable several hundred kilometres from the coast gille et al 2003 2005 at latitudes of ϕ 30 n s referred to as the critical latitude throughout this paper the inertial frequency f 2 ω sin ϕ is also diurnal giving rise to resonance between the land sea breeze and the local inertial response of the ocean simpson et al 2002 hyder et al 2002 as the critical latitude intersects all four of the major eastern boundary upwelling systems ebus diurnal inertial resonance is a common feature of these systems indeed many documented observations of surface rotary diurnal currents in ebus have been attributed to land sea breeze wind forcing hyder et al 2011 and references therein the physical and biogeochemical functioning of ebus is however largely understood in terms of the upwelling relaxation paradigm which responds to sub diurnal wind variability i e time scales of longer than one day the influence of the land sea breeze on these systems is therefore typically assumed to be of low importance high amplitude diurnal inertial currents are however known to enhance shear driven vertical mixing in coastal upwelling systems near the critical latitude as revealed from observational evidence aguiar gonzález et al 2011 lucas et al 2014 and numerical experiments fearon et al 2020 here we build on the 1d vertical model experiments of fearon et al 2020 by introducing a 2d vertical model which includes the cross shore dimension allowing us to more fully explore the role of land sea breeze forcing in the context of coastal upwelling systems near the critical latitude near inertial rotary currents are commonly excited by surface wind variability either through an impulsive wind stress such as a storm event e g d asaro et al 1995 or through periodic forcing near the inertial frequency e g simpson et al 2002 in the case of land sea breeze forcing near the critical latitude the surface near inertial currents can be largely attributed to the diurnal anticyclonic rotary component of the winds τ a c as this is the component of the forcing which rotates at the same frequency and in the same direction as the forced surface inertial oscillations fearon et al 2020 simple linearly damped slab models have been widely used to model the surface mixed layer response to wind forcing in some cases showing reasonable agreement with observations of near inertial rotary currents e g pollard and millard 1970 pollard 1980 jarosz et al 2007 the presence of a land boundary introduces a cross shore no flow condition at the coast which drives a barotropic response via a cross shore surface elevation gradient the barotropic response simultaneously dampens the wind driven surface inertial oscillations and introduces subsurface inertial oscillations with an opposite phase to those in the surface layer craig 1989 simpson et al 2002 although the surface elevation gradient response behaves as an offshore propagating barotropic wave high wave speeds c 0 g h cover typical continental shelf widths in a tiny fraction of an inertial period chen et al 2017 shearman 2005 and as such can be interpreted as a locally forced response indeed the first order cross shore surface elevation gradient termed the craig approximation can be applied in 1d vertical models as a forcing term to reproduce the 180 phase shift between surface and subsurface currents hyder et al 2011 fearon et al 2020 throughout this paper we refer to the forced response to land sea breeze forcing near a land boundary as the superposition of the local wind driven surface mixed layer response and the opposing first order barotropic response horizontal convergences divergences in the locally forced near inertial oscillations drive vertical pumping of the pycnocline thereby initiating near inertial internal waves which can propagate away from the generation zone alford et al 2016 near inertial motions near coastlines are therefore a combination of the locally forced response and the offshore propagating internal wave response generated by convergence divergence at the land boundary millot and crépon 1981 simple two dimensional linear flat bottom two layer coastal wall models have been widely used to study the inertial response to an impulsive wind stress near the coast e g millot and crépon 1981 kundu et al 1983 shearman 2005 kelly 2019 such models suggest that the baroclinic wave generation at the land boundary plays an important role in reducing near inertial oscillations towards the coast shearman 2005 variable bottom topography has however also been indirectly identified as a means of controlling the cross shelf variation of near inertial motions through its influence on the cross shore pressure gradient chen and xie 1997 the 3d numerical experiments of zhang et al 2010 elucidated the latitudinal dependence of near inertial motions internal waves and associated diapycnal mixing in response to land sea breeze forcing at a coast the propagation of the internal wave energy away from the coastline is dictated by the dispersion relation for poincare waves which must be satisfied for propagating wave solutions to exist 1 ω 2 f 2 c 1 2 k 2 where ω is the frequency of the waves k is the horizontal wavenumber considering the cross shore dimension alone and c 1 is the phase speed of the first baroclinic mode internal wave zhang et al 2010 showed that under land sea breeze forcing diapycnal mixing is maximised near the critical latitude of 30 n s where internal wave energy is trapped at the coastline due to the low group speed of poincare waves diapycnal mixing is reduced at higher and lower latitudes due to the reduction of the resonance phenomenon while at lower latitudes energy is able to propagate offshore in the form of poincare waves and contribute to weak diapycnal mixing outside of the forcing area while the forced and internal wave responses near a land boundary can be viewed as distinct processes their similar vertical current structures and frequencies complicate the interpretation of observations and model output notably the 180 phase shift between surface and subsurface near inertial oscillations commonly observed near land boundaries can be easily misinterpreted as a true first baroclinic mode this vertical current structure can however be reproduced in 1d models hyder et al 2011 fearon et al 2020 or homogeneous models chen et al 2017 pettigrew 1980 which exclude internal wave physics the apparent first baroclinic mode vertical current structure is often cited as a source of shear driven mixing however the 1d model experiments of fearon et al 2020 showed that local shear driven mixing is maximised in the absence of a land boundary and that the introduction of the 180 phase shift between surface and subsurface layers via the craig approximation serves to dampen shear production and diapycnal mixing true first baroclinic mode near inertial internal waves are however believed to play an important role in driving shear driven turbulence and diapycnal mixing xing et al 2004 zhang et al 2010 separating forced and internal wave motions near a coastline has been achieved in simplified two layer models kelly 2019 or inferred through comparisons of homogeneous vs stratified experiments using primitive equation models chen et al 2017 the relative contribution of the forced and internal wave responses to diapycnal mixing however remains largely unstudied within the context of coastal upwelling systems near the critical latitude enhanced diapycnal mixing driven by diurnal inertial resonance has been identified as an important mechanism for nutrient enrichment of the surface layer with potentially significant implications for primary productivity aguiar gonzález et al 2011 lucas et al 2014 fearon et al 2020 in addition to biological implications the deepening of the surface mixed layer by the land sea breeze can also influence sub inertial processes for instance steepened horizontal isotherms due to land sea breeze driven diapycnal mixing have been identified as playing a role in enhancing sub inertial alongshore geostrophic flows nam and send 2013 however the implications of the land sea breeze on sub inertial upwelling has as far as we know not been explicitly studied here we introduce a cross shore 2d vertical model to study the effects of land sea forcing on coastal upwelling systems near the critical latitude we make use of the 1d vertical model configuration of fearon et al 2020 as a proxy for the forced response allowing us to separate the effects of the forced and internal wave responses the 2d model is used to elucidate the effect of latitude and bottom slope on the cross shore variability in diurnal inertial currents thermocline displacements and diapycnal mixing due to land sea breeze forcing near the critical latitude analytically configured experiments for this purpose are set up in an analogous way to the 1d experiments described in fearon et al 2020 and we employ the 1d model solution as the offshore open boundary condition for the 2d model the quantification of diapycnal mixing is aided by initialising subsurface waters with a passive tracer we then further explore the implications of the land sea in the context of coastal upwelling systems by considering experiments forced by the land sea breeze alone upwelling winds alone and a combination of the two we initialise subsurface waters of these experiments with lagrangian floats to track how subsurface waters are modified through land sea breeze driven diapycnal mixing as in fearon et al 2020 we again compare a realistically configured model to the observations of lucas et al 2014 located in st helena bay in the southern benguela upwelling system fig 1 2 methods 2 1 in situ observations we make use of horizontal current velocity and temperature observations from a mooring array described in lucas et al 2014 located in st helena bay in the southern benguela upwelling system fig 1 the three fixed moorings are aligned roughly perpendicular to the local coastline making them particularly relevant for identifying the cross shore processes of interest in this paper horizontal current velocity data are obtained from bottom mounted acoustic doppler current profilers adcp while temperature data are obtained from wirewalker wave powered profilers rainville and pinkel 2001 pinkel et al 2011 velocity and temperature data are available at a temporal frequency of 10 min and at vertical resolutions of 1 m and 0 25 m respectively all observations are filtered in time to provide a two hour running mean at 30 min intervals sufficient for revealing processes at the diurnal inertial frequency of interest as per fearon et al 2020 we revisit only the 7 14 march 2011 upwelling event having been identified as a period which clearly demonstrates the response of a highly stratified two layer system to a combination of upwelling favourable winds and strong diurnal wind variability lucas et al 2014 the in situ observations are available for download via the following digital object identifiers dois wirewalker data https doi

www croco ocean org an ocean modelling system built upon roms agrif shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 croco is a free surface terrain following coordinate oceanic model which solves the navier stokes primitive equations by following the boussinesq and hydrostatic approximations 1d model experiments employ the standalone 1d version of the code described in fearon et al 2020 in which we retain the coast normal horizontal pressure gradient as a forcing term computed from the craig approximation the 1 d model code can be downloaded via the following doi https doi org 10 15493 dea mims 26052102 2d model experiments are configured using the v1 0 official release of the 3d croco code this is achieved by employing a shore perpendicular grid with only 5 grid cells in the alongshore dimension section 2 2 1 maintaining constant alongshore bathymetry section 2 2 3 and making use of periodic boundary conditions along the cross shore boundaries of the model section 2 2 4 under these conditions alongshore gradients are essentially zero and continuity dictates that divergence convergence of the cross shore flow u x must be compensated by vertical motion w z the parameterisation of vertical eddy viscosity and diffusivity are carried out in the present study in accordance with the k ɛ turbulent closure scheme within the generic length scale gls formulation umlauf and burchard 2003 2005 implementation of the scheme within croco and default settings adopted in this study are provided in appendix a of fearon et al 2020 we use an upstream biased dissipative horizontal advection scheme for momentum while horizontal advection of tracers is discretised using a split and rotated third order upstream biased numerical scheme marchesiello et al 2009 no explicit lateral viscosity is added in the model except in sponge layers at the western open lateral boundary as described in fearon et al 2020 bottom friction is parameterised using a quadratic drag law where the bottom roughness length parameter is taken as 0 1 m a nonlinear equation of state adapted from jackett and mcdougall 1995 is used for the computation of density both analytically and realistically configured experiments are employed in this paper as summarised in table 1 the analytically configured experiments row id s 1 and 2 of table 1 are designed to elucidate the processes of interest and to carry out sensitivity tests to relevant variables while the realistically configured simulation row id 3 of table 1 is compared with observations from the cross shore mooring array of lucas et al 2014 over the 7 14 march 2011 upwelling event for consistency the 1d model configurations presented here are identical to those presented in fearon et al 2020 while the 2d model settings remain consistent with the 1d model settings where possible as described below 2 2 1 spatial and temporal discretisation all 2d experiments use a model domain with horizontal dimensions of 100 km e w 2 5 km n s which is discretised using a regular grid of 500 m resolution i e a 200 5 grid we use 100 sigma layers to discretise the vertical dimension a baroclinic time step of 40 s is used to integrate the model solution over a period of 7 days from initialisation typical of the time scale of upwelling events 40 barotropic time steps are computed within each baroclinic time step instantaneous model output at 30 min intervals is filtered in time to provide a two hour running mean at each time step consistent with the processing of observations 2 2 2 surface forcing in the case of analytically configured experiments row id s 1 and 2 of table 1 the land sea breeze is approximated as a diurnal anticyclonic anticlockwise in the southern hemisphere rotating wind stress τ a c of constant amplitude τ a c 0 which is applied as a spatially constant forcing hyder et al 2011 report diurnal anticyclonic rotary wind stress amplitudes from in situ observations along the namibian coastline of between 0 004 n m 2 and 0 051 n m 2 depending on the location and observation period analysis of surface wind stress derived from a 3 km horizontal resolution atmospheric model indicates large spatial variability in the diurnal rotary component of winds over the southern benguela with a notable enhancement over st helena bay fearon et al 2020 in this region the mean amplitude of the diurnal anticyclonic rotary component of the wind stress as derived from 7 day windows over upwelling favourable months was found to be around 0 03 n m 2 we therefore adopt a value of τ a c 0 0 03 n m 2 for all analytically

and latitude flat bottom analytically configured experiments employ a constant water depth of 100 m depth and we test the sensitivity of the model solution to cross shore bottom slopes of 1 200 and 1 500 row id s 1 and 2 of table 1 flat bottom experiments are considered to be a useful reference against previous flat bottom model studies where internal wave generation at the land boundary controls the onshore decrease in horizontal near inertial current velocities e g shearman 2005 different bottom slopes allow us to test the role of the cross shore pressure gradient which increases with decreasing water depth according to the craig approximation in controlling the cross shelf decrease in near inertial motions this mechanism was found to be a dominant driver of cross shelf variability of near inertial motions in the realistically configured 2d model of chen and xie 1997 a maximum offshore water depth of 100 m is used for all experiments while a minimum water depth of 20 m is employed at the land boundary we maintain a constant alongshore bathymetry in all experiments the realistically configured experiment row id 3 of table 1 employs a nearshore bathymetry i e shallower than 100 m which is interpolated from digital versions of the most detailed available navigation charts for the region as provided by the hydrographer of the south african navy fig 1 baseline experiments adopt a latitude of 30 s for testing the pure case of diurnal inertial resonance however we also test the model sensitivity to latitudes of 20 s and 40 s row id s 1 and 2 of table 1 latitude is expected to play a dominant role in land sea breeze driven near inertial motions both through local resonance effects simpson et al 2002 hyder et al 2002 fearon et al 2020 and internal wave generation zhang et al 2010 the realistically configured experiment adopts the realistic cross shore mooring array latitude of 32 3 s row id 3 of table 1 2 2 4 boundary conditions the northern and southern boundaries are defined as periodic boundary conditions such that all the outflows inflows at the southern boundary are inflows outflows at the northern boundary given the constant alongshore bathymetry the model is effectively a 2d configuration the eastern boundary is defined as a closed land boundary while the western boundary is applied as an open boundary condition the open boundary requires the prescription of temperature t salinity s and velocity components u v additionally we prescribe a passive tracer concentration boundary condition c in arbitrary tracer units per volume atu m 3 used to aid the quantification of diapycnal mixing see section 2 3 relaxation times of 1 4 day and 1 day are adopted for inward and outward radiation respectively implying strong relaxation to the specified boundary values a sponge layer of 10 km 20 grid cells is used to gradually ramp up the model solution in the interior of the domain to the applied boundary values within the sponge layer the prescribed boundary conditions over each experiment are obtained from the solution of an analogously configured 1d model integrated over the simulation period using the same initial condition and forcing as applied at the offshore extent of the 2d model 2 2 5 initial conditions we remain consistent with the 1d model experiments of fearon et al 2020 in defining initial conditions for the 2d model experiments simulations are initialised from rest using a constant salinity of 35 and a temperature profile defined either analytically or from observations in the case of analytically configured experiments row id s 1 and 2 of table 1 the initial vertical profile for temperature is defined using a hyperbolic tangent function which effectively creates a two layer system with 16 c surface water overlaying 10 c subsurface water and a maximum stratification located at 10 m depth see fearon et al 2020 for details the realistic model configuration row id 3 of table 1 is initialised using measured temperature profiles from the three moorings of lucas et al 2014 at the start of the simulation 7 march 2011 linear interpolation is used to define the initial temperature in between the offshore and inshore moorings while temperature data from the offshore inshore mooring is used to extrapolate offshore inshore of the moorings while it is acknowledged that the temperature section will not be realistic at the offshore extent of the model the intention is only to provide a stable offshore boundary so that the nearshore processes in the vicinity of the observations can be assessed the resulting initial temperature section is shown in fig 1b experiments are initialised with passive tracer concentrations of 1 and 0 atu m 3 in the subsurface and surface layers respectively 2 3 data analysis as alongshore variability in the model is negligible we only present plots and analysis of the 2d model output along a cross shore section corresponding to the centre i e third alongshore grid cell we remain consistent in the computation of diapycnal mixing diagnostics as described in fearon et al 2020 the thermocline depth h s is defined as the depth of a given isotherm being the 11 c isotherm in the case of analytically configured experiments and the 12 5 c isotherm in the case of the realistically configured experiment the cumulative diapycnal mixing over each experiment is quantified through the diagnostic variable c s computed by integrating the passive tracer c over the surface layer of the model i e from h s to the surface the depth averaged velocity vector over the surface layer of the model is used to indicate the surface layer current response in the model u s u s v s the analysis of diapycnal mixing is further aided by extracting the vertical turbulent diffusivity k t v as output from the k ɛ turbulent closure scheme of the model k t v is extracted at the thermocline depth as an indication of interfacial mixing in the model we further use the vertical displacement of the thermocline in order to diagnose internal wave generation and propagation in the model to this end the thermocline depth is presented as the displacement from the daily running average thermocline depth allowing us to isolate the super diurnal variability in the thermocline depth induced by the applied land sea breeze forcing thermocline displacements are compared with the theoretical internal rossby radius of deformation r d 2 r d c 1 f and further compared with the theoretical celerity of a long wave propagating at the interface of a two layer system 3 c 1 g h s h b h s h b where g δ ρ ρ g is the reduced gravity acceleration h s and h b are the thicknesses of the surface and bottom layers respectively as defined by the depth of the thermocline g is estimated from the temperature difference between the surface and subsurface layers and a linear expansion coefficient α 2 1 0 4 k 1 when an upwelling favourable wind is included in the model row id s 2 and 3 of table 1 the location of the upwelling front is computed from the outcropping of the diagnostic isotherm used to define the thermocline depth 3 results 3 1 diurnal inertial resonance at a land boundary we begin by considering the response of a flat bottom 100 m deep ocean consisting of an analytically derived two layer water column to a constant amplitude diurnal anticlockwise rotating wind stress at 30 s the pure case of diurnal inertial resonance the amplitude of the applied wind stress is 0 03 n m 2 and we exclude any sub inertial upwelling from a mean alongshore wind stress fig 3 presents the evolution of the model output for both the 1d model configuration as presented in fearon et al 2020 and the 2d model configuration introduced in this paper at distances of 50 km and 10 km from the land boundary fig 4 presents hovmöller diagrams for the 2d experiment showing cross shore variability in thermocline displacements log 10 k t v at the depth of the 11 c isotherm taken to represent the thermocline and the passive tracer concentration integrated from the 11 c isotherm to the surface c s the results indicate that the 1d and 2d model solutions are almost identical at a distance of 50 km offshore in the case of the 1d model the cross shore surface elevation gradient η x is an applied forcing term computed from the craig approximation for the barotropic response imposed by the no flow condition perpendicular to the land boundary while this response is generated dynamically in the 2d model the near perfect agreement between the two models indicates that the reduced physics of the 1d model provides a sufficient description of the processes at this location and therefore the enhanced shear driven vertical mixing here is driven by the locally forced response alone these processes are explored in detail in fearon et al 2020 and are therefore not elaborated further here the excellent agreement also provides support for the methodology of using the 1d model solution as the offshore boundary condition for the 2d model indeed this approach largely prevented spurious internal wave generation at the open boundary at a distance of 10 km offshore the 2d model solution deviates significantly from the 1d solution as the linear assumptions of the craig approximation are invalid here in close proximity to the land boundary horizontal gradients in cross shore currents are high and the non linear advection terms become important onshore offshore surface currents lead to convergence divergence and the downward upward displacement of the thermocline the forced thermocline displacements have a diurnal periodicity consistent with the diurnal periodicity of the wind forcing unlike at 50 km offshore the results at 10 km offshore reveal diurnal variability in surface temperature and surface tracer concentrations fig 3b reflecting the advection of horizontal gradients which are set up by high spatial variability in diapycnal mixing the amplitude of the surface inertial oscillations is significantly weaker at 10 km offshore than at 50 km offshore fig 3c implying reduced vertical shear and therefore reduced diapycnal mixing as reflected in the surface tracer concentration fig 3d we note that although the alongshore current velocity data are not plotted the oscillatory nature of the currents dictates a very similar vertical structure in the alongshore currents the only notable difference being a 6 h phase shift when compared to the cross shore currents hovmöller diagrams of the 2d experiment fig 4 reveal that the vertical displacements of the thermocline propagate offshore but are largely absent 50 km from the land boundary indicating an evanescent internal wave response between 10 km and 50 km offshore diapycnal mixing is shown to respond to a combination of the forced response and the internal wave response generating diurnal peaks of enhanced mixing at the diagnostic thermocline fig 4b the net result is an enhancement of the cumulative diapycnal mixing over and above that induced by the forced response alone as revealed by a locally enhanced passive tracer concentration in the surface layer of the model fig 4c 3 2 sensitivity tests to latitude and bottom slope the evanescent nature of the internal wave response to land sea breeze forcing is governed by the latitude as previously explored by zhang et al 2010 and revealed in fig 5 here we contrast the simulation presented in figs 3 and 4 latitude 30 s against identical simulations run at latitudes of 20 s and 40 s the results are presented as hovmöller diagrams of thermocline displacement as well as the amplitude of the surface layer velocity u s and the passive tracer concentration integrated over the surface layer c s both averaged over the fifth day of each simulation the 1d model output for u s and c s is also shown for comparative purposes allowing us to distinguish the relative influence of the forced response as approximated by the 1d model and the internal waves for consistency u s and c s are the same metrics used to summarise the 1d model sensitivity experiments presented in fearon et al 2020 the forced diurnal displacement of the thermocline is shown to occur landward of the internal rossby radius of deformation r d eq 2 while the offshore propagation of the forced displacement is latitudinally dependent at 20 s the diurnal pumping of the thermocline results in offshore propagating internal waves however these waves are evanescent at latitudes of 30 s and 40 s eq 1 dictates that waves can only freely propagate at latitudes where the inertial frequency f is less than the frequency of the forced diurnal displacements i e equatorward of 30 n s such that f ω the results indicate that the initial propagation of the internal wave away from the land boundary can be reasonably approximated by the theoretical celerity of a long wave propagating at the interface of a two layer system c 1 eq 3 the amplitude of the thermocline displacement is greatest at the critical latitude of 30 s where the amplitude of the forced surface currents and therefore convergence divergence at the land boundary is greatest fig 5b at this latitude the amplitude of the surface current is shown to drop off rapidly within 20 km of the land boundary in good agreement with the flat bottom numerical experiments of chen et al 2017 diapycnal mixing as quantified through the passive tracer concentration integrated over the surface layer c s is shown to be highest at a distance of 25 km offshore and is 20 greater than the offshore value as already described the elevated mixing is attributed to the effect of the evanescent internal waves which contribute to the mixing induced by the forced response both surface current amplitude and diapycnal mixing are predictably lower at latitudes of 20 s and 40 s when compared to 30 s for the 20 s experiment the signature of the offshore propagating internal waves is evident both through deviations of the surface current amplitude fig 5b and elevated diapycnal mixing fig 5c when compared to the forced response this is not seen in the 40 s experiment where the effect of the internal wave response is negligible we now add an element of realism to the experiments by contrasting the 100 m water depth flat bottom configuration at 30 s already presented with two experiments in which the water depth gradually increases away from the land boundary using constant bottom slopes of 1 200 and 1 500 respectively fig 6 by way of comparison the average bottom slope across the st helena bay mooring array is approximately 1 200 fig 1 the dashed lines in fig 6b c are taken from individual 1d model solutions run at 5 km increments from the land boundary using the corresponding water depth of the 2d model these 1d experiments provide insight into how a gradually reducing water depth impacts the forced response alone as explored in fearon et al 2020 the first order surface elevation gradient response serves to reduce surface oscillations and diapycnal mixing providing a mechanism for gradually dampening the forced diurnal inertial oscillations in shallower water depths toward the land boundary the dampened forced response is shown to lead to a reduction in the convergence divergence of the forced oscillations in the surface layer and therefore a reduction in thermocline pumping fig 6a considering the case of the 1 500 bottom slope the 2d model results for both u s and c s are almost identical to the 1d model right panels of fig 6b c indicating that the internal wave effects on currents and diapycnal mixing are negligible as the slope becomes steeper so the convergence divergence in the forced response becomes greater and the effects of the internal waves become apparent in these cases the 1d model over predicts both the amplitude of the surface oscillation and diapycnal mixing within 20 km of the land boundary 3 3 diurnal inertial resonance in the presence of upwelling in the case of upwelling systems the processes associated with diurnal inertial resonance are embedded within ekman dynamics driven by sub inertial wind variability the 2d model allows us to explore the interaction of these processes by comparing simulations forced with a land sea breeze alone τ a c 0 0 03 n m 2 an upwelling wind alone τ y 0 05 n m 2 and a combination of the two the values of τ a c 0 and τ y are specifically chosen so that a combination of the two is representative of a typical upwelling event within st helena bay section 2 2 2 we adopt a bottom slope of 1 200 for these experiments being representative of the bottom slope within st helena bay fig 1 fig 7 presents the temporal evolution of the modelled temperature cross shore currents and passive tracer for each experiment at a distance of 10 km from the land boundary the processes associated with the simulation forced by the land sea breeze alone have already been shown fig 3 whereby diurnal variability in surface temperature is driven by a combination of high spatial variability in diapycnal mixing and advection due to the surface inertial oscillations the simulation forced by the upwelling wind alone shows considerably reduced diapycnal mixing and shows the offshore transport of the surface layer in response to the sustained alongshore wind stress centre panel of fig 7b the combined effect of land sea breeze and upwelling winds generates super diurnal advection of the upwelling front leading to pronounced diurnal variability in surface temperatures the inertial oscillations left panels of fig 7 are superimposed onto the sub inertial transport centre panels of fig 7 resulting in the repeated cross shore back and forth advection of strong horizontal temperature gradients past the shown output location right panels of fig 7 large diurnal variability in temperature will persist provided the location of interest is within one oscillation radius of the steep horizontal temperature gradients associated with the upwelling front an oscillation velocity of 0 5 m s 1 at 30 s has an oscillation radius u f of 6 9 km this phenomenon is invoked in the interpretation of the results of the realistically configured experiment as described in section 3 4 in addition to the super diurnal advection of the upwelling front the inclusion of the land sea breeze is shown to significantly influence the mean cross shore temperature over the modelled upwelling event fig 8 the mean location of the upwelling front is also shown as computed from the outcropping of the 11 c isotherm at the offshore extent of the shown section i e outside the influence of the upwelling front the applied diurnal wind variability is shown to result in a significant cooling of the surface which overlays a commensurate warming despite the surface cooling due to diapycnal mixing the results indicate a net warming of mean surface waters within 20 km of the coast due to the inclusion of land sea breeze forcing relative to the case with upwelling winds alone we posit two explanations for this perhaps unintuitive result firstly although the ekman transport m e τ y ρ f is the same in both cases the cross shore velocity of the surface ekman boundary layer u e m e h s is reduced when the land sea breeze is included due to diapycnal mixing induced deepening of the surface layer h s this leads to a persistently landward location of the upwelling front when land sea breeze forcing is applied effectively resulting in retention of surface waters and a net warming in the nearshore this concept is further discussed in section 4 the second potential explanation for the nearshore warming due to the inclusion of diurnal wind variability is that the enhanced diapycnal mixing leads to a warming of subsurface waters which are carried by the upwelling circulation toward the inshore and surface as it is not immediately apparent which of these two processes the location of the upwelling front vs modified upwelled water is of leading order in explaining the nearshore surface warming the appendix presents diagnostics designed to reveal the relative contribution of each the analysis suggests that the nearshore warming due to the inclusion of the land sea breeze is primarily driven by the location of the upwelling front while the upwelling of warmer waters due to enhanced vertical mixing plays a secondary role 3 4 case study of st helena bay we now present the final more comprehensive experiment being a realistically configured simulation for comparison with the nearshore observations of lucas et al 2014 the model solution is integrated over a 7 day period starting on 7 march 2011 from the temperature section shown in fig 1 and forced with hourly winds and heat fluxes derived from the 3 km resolution csag wrf model output fig 9 compares the observed and modelled temperature across the mooring array including summary statistics of model bias centred root mean square difference rmsd and pearson s correlation coefficient as a function of depth the model is shown to reproduce the salient features of the temperature observations at all three moorings which are characterised by significant diurnal inertial variability in surface temperature and a net cooling of surface waters over the considered period the analytically configured 2d experiments have highlighted the mechanism whereby near the critical latitude of 30 s diurnal inertial oscillations in the presence of sub inertial upwelling produces strong diurnal variability in surface temperature through repeated advection of strong horizontal temperature gradients over the measurement location the pumping of the thermocline characteristic of the internal wave response as revealed in the analytically configured 2d experiments is also evident in both the observations and the model it is expected that the 2d model would tend to over estimate thermocline displacements as the divergence convergence of the cross shore flow u x is compensated by vertical motion w z alone due to the exclusion of alongshore gradients v y in the model alongshore velocity gradients however appeared to have played a minor role over the observation period as revealed by similar amplitude 5 m thermocline displacements in the both model and the observations the model performance is best at the surface as reflected by high correlation coefficients at all three moorings 0 8 for depths shallower than 5 m fig 9c the significant reduction in temperature correlation near the base of the thermocline can in part be explained by an over prediction in sub inertial upwelling and the consequent over prediction in thermocline lifting as reflected in a negative near surface temperature bias across the mooring array left panel of fig 9c this could be attributed to an over prediction in the mean alongshore surface wind stress derived from the csag wrf model or potentially due to the advection of alongshore variability in temperature which is explicitly excluded in the model the low even negative correlations in the subsurface water 20 m depth at the middle and outer moorings are attributed to the lack of a meaningful temperature signal here over the considered event as evidenced by the low rmsd in this region of the water column the time series comparisons at 5 m depth fig 9b indicate a phase lag 6 h in the timing of the diurnal fluctuations in near surface temperature which may reflect shortcomings in the timing of the land sea breeze in the csag wrf model forcing one potential explanation for this could be due to shortcomings in the sea surface temperature sst input to the csag wrf model upwelling is known to impact the timing of the land sea breeze seroka et al 2018 while the wrf model uses daily sst fields derived from satellite observations which contain systematic errors in upwelling regions meneghesso et al 2020 and do not capture super diurnal variability in sst s the observed and modelled cross shore component of velocity for the outer and inner moorings are compared in fig 10 adcp data from the middle mooring were mostly missing over this period and is therefore not shown while the salient features of the vertical structure of the currents are reproduced in the model the time series comparisons fig 10b again reveal phase differences in the diurnal inertial oscillations where the model lags the observations by 6 h at both the outer and inner moorings despite the presence of the time lag correlation coefficients at the outer mooring are between 0 4 and 0 6 for the subsurface currents while a maximum of 0 7 is attained for the near surface currents fig 10c the model correlation coefficients drop to negative values in the region of the thermocline where the 180 phase shift between the surface and subsurface currents is observed poor correlation in this region is not surprising as any misrepresentation in the depth of the 180 phase shift will have a notable impact on the correlations in this region of the water column current correlations are lower at the inner mooring between 0 2 and 0 4 where the amplitude of the diurnal inertial signal is weaker the modelled currents at this mooring appear to be hampered by the signature of an over prediction in sub inertial upwelling circulation as evidenced by negative positive cross shore current biases in the surface subsurface fig 10c these biases are in agreement with the cool surface temperature bias visible in fig 9 4 discussion and conclusions in this paper we have employed novel 2d model experiments to gain insight into the cross shore processes governing the response of coastal upwelling systems to land sea breeze forcing in addition to testing model sensitivity to relevant variables in analytically configured experiments a realistically configured experiment has been compared with three nearshore moorings orientated perpendicular to the local coastline in st helena bay located in the southern benguela upwelling system lucas et al 2014 our analytically configured experiments have focussed on the response of upwelling systems at the critical latitude of 30 n s where the diurnal periodicity of the land sea breeze is resonant with the inertial frequency and the locally forced response is maximised craig 1989 simpson et al 2002 fearon et al 2020 given the mooring array latitude of 32 3 s the observations provide a particularly relevant ground truth for the presented 2d model configuration notwithstanding model shortcomings which include an over prediction in sub inertial upwelling and notable phase lags in the modelled diurnal inertial response the favourable comparison with the observations provides some confidence in the dynamics elucidated by the analytically configured experiments the presented results are relevant for all regions under the influence of land sea breeze forcing near the critical latitude which includes all four of the major eastern boundary upwelling systems ebus the relevance of the results naturally diminishes away from the critical latitude where the locally forced resonance phenomenon becomes weaker e g fig 5 and figure 10 of fearon et al 2020 hyder et al 2011 argue the region of influence to lie between latitudes of 23 and 40 n s the key processes elucidated by the experiments presented in this paper are summarised in fig 11 and discussed below 4 1 separation of the forced and internal wave responses contrasting results from the 2d model with those of the 1d model presented in fearon et al 2020 has allowed us for the first time to identify the respective roles of the locally forced response as approximated by the 1d model and the internal wave response to land sea breeze forcing near the critical latitude while the focus of this paper is on coastal upwelling systems the findings of these purely land sea breeze forced experiments would apply to any two layer coastal systems near the critical latitude as the locally forced response to the land sea breeze is maximised at the critical latitude of 30 n s here we also find the maximum amplitude thermocline displacements due to convergence divergence of the forced oscillations at the land boundary although the internal waves are evanescent at the critical latitude in agreement with theory and the numerical experiments of zhang et al 2010 they provide an additional source of shear driven diapycnal mixing in the considered configuration the effect is maximised at a distance of 25 km from the wave generation zone at the land boundary where diapycnal mixing can be 20 greater than that due to the forced response alone the influence of the internal waves extends to 50 km from the land boundary offshore of which the 1d and 2d model solutions are in near perfect agreement sensitivity tests have revealed the importance of the bottom slope in governing the processes driving the cross shore variability in near inertial motions the steepness of the bottom slope determines the rate at which the locally forced oscillations are dampened toward the coast thereby influencing the convergence divergence of the surface currents and thermocline pumping internal wave generation at the coast is therefore dampened by a gradually sloping bottom this is in agreement with previous 2d primitive equation experiments over the gradually sloping texas louisiana shelf where non linear advection terms were of secondary importance and the first order cross shore surface elevation gradient was found to play a dominant role in the cross shore variability in near inertial oscillations chen and xie 1997 in contrast a simple two layer coastal wall model has been used to identify the internal wave generation at the boundary as the driving mechanism for explaining the drop off in near inertial energy toward the coast shearman 2005 our sensitivity experiments serve to reveal how the bottom slope governs which of these processes first order surface elevation gradient vs internal wave generation dominate the reduction in near inertial motions toward the coast steeper bottom slopes are required to enhance the internal wave response and allow for elevated diapycnal mixing over and above what would be expected from the forced response alone 4 2 the influence of the land sea breeze on sub inertial upwelling the inclusion of a sub inertial alongshore wind stress in the 2d model experiments has allowed for further reflection on the role of diurnal inertial resonance within the context of sub inertial upwelling dynamics our results reveal how the combined effect of sub inertial upwelling and inertial oscillations can produce pronounced diurnal variability in nearshore surface temperatures driven by horizontal diurnal advection of strong cross shore temperature gradients which are ever present in upwelling systems local land sea breeze forcing has been identified as playing a key role in diurnal temperature variability in a number of in situ observations in ebus kaplan et al 2003 woodson et al 2007 bonicelli et al 2014 walter et al 2017 and is evident in the nearshore observations of lucas et al 2014 fig 9 the 2d model experiments presented here clearly demonstrate a driving mechanism of this phenomenon although it is noted that solar irradiance is an additional mechanism which would further contribute to diurnal variability in sea surface temperatures while not explicitly considered in this paper the impact of solar irradiance on surface temperatures over the presented observation period can be inferred from the 1d model results at the outer mooring figure 6 of fearon et al 2020 which included realistic surface heat fluxes comparison of the modelled temperature at the outer mooring from the 2d model fig 9a with that of the 1d model suggests that the advection of horizontal gradients was the dominant mechanism in driving the diurnal sea surface temperature variability over the considered observation period our simulations have further highlighted how deepening of the thermocline due to diurnal inertial resonance near the critical latitude can lead to a reduction in sub inertial offshore advection of the surface ekman boundary layer as illustrated in fig 11 as offshore ekman transport is the same in both fig 11b and c volume conservation dictates that d 1 l 1 d 2 l 2 and therefore the landward offset of the upwelling front will scale linearly with the increased depth in the surface ekman boundary layer for example if a mean alongshore wind drives a 15 m deep ekman boundary layer 10 km offshore the same wind will drive a 20 m deep ekman boundary layer 7 5 km offshore 15 20 10 shallower surface mixed layers elicit higher amplitude oscillations in the surface layer and greater mixing fearon et al 2020 implying that regions prone to the development of shallow surface layers such as retention zones in the lee of capes e g graham and largier 1997 oliveira et al 2009 are likely to be most affected by this process advective losses during active upwelling can contribute to a reduction in productivity within upwelling systems while the retention of upwelled waters is important for the accumulation of high biomass coastal blooms pitcher et al 2010 our results imply that the land sea breeze may play a contributing role in surface water retention in these areas through reduced offshore advection of the surface layer during upwelling events the retention of surface waters due to the inclusion of land sea breeze forcing has been shown to drive a net warming of nearshore surface waters primarily due to the landward displacement of the upwelling front while modification of subsurface waters through enhanced diapycnal mixing plays a secondary role offshore of the influence of the upwelling front surface waters are cooled through the entrainment of subsurface waters via diapycnal mixing these results suggest that the misrepresentation of the land sea breeze in global and regional models of ebus may contribute to nearshore temperature biases in these models such biases are largely attributed to errors in the representation of the low frequency alongshore wind stress in the atmospheric forcing products e g richter 2015 small et al 2015 while the influence of the land sea breeze is over looked as a potential source of systematic error our results suggest that the improvement in the spatial and temporal representation of the land sea breeze could be important in alleviating this source of systematic bias particularly near the critical latitude and in areas susceptible to the development of shallow surface mixed layers we note that our results have been limited to short duration 7 day experiments with a simplified 2d model while these experiments have been useful to elucidate event scale dynamics further work is required to assess the overall role of these processes within ebus where ekman dynamics are also counteracted by eddy effects thomsen et al 2021 inter annual simulations of realistically configured 3d models of ebus which both include and exclude land sea breeze forcing are expected to provide useful insights to this end such regional simulations are typically forced at the surface by an atmospheric model which is itself forced by sea surface temperatures which do not capture land sea breeze effects on the upwelling front this shortcoming was invoked as a possible source of the phase lag error in the realistically configured simulation section 3 4 previous studies have identified coastal upwelling as influencing the land sea breeze both through an earlier onset and enhanced intensity clancy et al 1979 seroka et al 2018 which may in turn have a positive feedback on upwelling favourable winds franchito et al 1998 this paper has further explored how the land sea breeze may impact the location of the upwelling front near the critical latitude processes which themselves appear likely to influence the land sea breeze it is suggested that two way coupled ocean atmosphere experiments may prove to be particularly insightful in exploring this two way feedback near the critical latitude 4 3 improved understanding of the st helena bay observations the results of this paper provide an opportunity for further reflection on the processes governing the nearshore observations of lucas et al 2014 while the forced response as approximated by the 1d model reproduces many of the salient features of the observations at the offshore mooring figure 6 of fearon et al 2020 the 1d model was shown to over predict the deepening of the thermocline through diapycnal mixing under predict net cooling of surface waters and lack sufficient diurnal inertial variability in both surface temperature and vertical displacement of the thermocline the realistically configured 2d model has significantly alleviated these shortcomings figs 9 and 10 suggesting that the analytically configured 2d experiments may be useful in interpreting the observations fig 6 confirms that for a 1 200 bottom slope the approximate slope across the mooring array and an offshore distance of just 12 7 km an over prediction in the amplitude of the surface oscillation and consequent deepening of the thermocline is to be expected in the 1d model here the 2d model experiments reveal the 5 m amplitude thermocline displacements to be the signature of internal waves generated at the land boundary the inclusion of sub inertial upwelling circulation in the 2d model alleviates the 1d model shortcomings of an under prediction of net cooling of surface waters although upwelling is over predicted in the 2d model and provides the mechanism for generating the observed diurnal variability in surface temperatures as already discussed lucas et al 2014 identified vertical mixing driven nutrient flux to be of high importance in governing observed phytoplankton growth across the mooring array while the 2d model confirms shear induced diapycnal mixing to be a feature over the mooring array an important consequence of the presented experiments is that the region of maximum diapycnal mixing is in fact expected to be located offshore of the observations it therefore seems plausible that the effect of the land sea breeze on the phytoplankton response may well have been further enhanced offshore of the mooring array this suggests that our understanding of event scale phytoplankton dynamics in the region would greatly benefit from high frequency observations of the water column which extend across the full width of st helena bay credit authorship contribution statement giles fearon

cape town s icts high performance computing team hpc uct ac za appendix diagnostics explaining warming of nearshore surface waters in response to land sea breeze forcing fig 8 indicates nearshore surface warming due to the inclusion of land sea breeze forcing while two processes are identified as possible drivers of this result 1 the landward location of the upwelling front due to a deepened ekman boundary layer and 2 the warming of subsurface water through diapycnal mixing which is then upwelled to the surface in this appendix we present diagnostics designed to reveal which of these two processes is of leading order in explaining the nearshore surface warming the contribution of the location of the upwelling front blue line in fig a 12b is computed as follows the cross shore temperature profile from the surface layer of the simulation forced by an upwelling wind alone is extracted at each 30 min time step a landward offset to this profile is then applied according to the difference in the upwelling front locations shown in fig a 12a the difference between the original and the offset cross shore temperature profiles is then computed the effect shown in fig a 12b is the mean temperature difference over the entire 7 day simulation the contribution of the upwelling of warmer subsurface waters is computed through the use of croco s online lagrangian floats module both simulations i e excluding and including land sea breeze forcing are initialised with neutrally buoyant lagrangian floats from the depth of the 11 c isotherm to the bottom in vertical increments of 1 m and horizontal increments of 500 m the horizontal grid resolution thereby covering subsurface waters over the entire model domain the temperature at the location of the floats as interpolated from the eulerian model is saved at 30 min intervals over each simulation temperature differences between the eulerian model at the location of the lagrangian floats and the initial temperature of lagrangian floats are used to quantify how subsurface water is modified by land sea breeze driven diapycnal mixing over the upwelling simulations the red line in fig a 12b is computed as follows all lagrangian floats in the upper 5 m of the water column are identified at each 30 min time step and taken to represent upwelled water the difference between the temperature of the eulerian field at the location of the floats and the original temperature of the floats is computed quantifying how the upwelled water has been modified through diapycnal mixing the offshore distance of the floats are used to construct a cross shore profile of the surface temperature difference using 2 m bins in the cross shore direction and averaging the temperature difference from all upwelled lagrangian floats contained within each 2 m bin the effect shown in fig a 12b is the mean temperature difference over the entire 7 day simulation forced by a combination of land sea breeze and upwelling winds over and above that computed from the simulation forced by an upwelling wind alone this approach is designed to capture how the temperature of subsurface water has been modified by enhanced diapycnal mixing offshore of the upwelling front prior to upwelling fig a 12b suggests that the nearshore warming due to the inclusion of the land sea breeze is primarily driven by the location of the upwelling front while the upwelling of warmer waters due to enhanced vertical mixing plays a secondary role 
23833,land sea breeze forcing near a land boundary drives both a locally forced response and an associated offshore propagating internal wave response the effects of which can be difficult to separate these processes enhance vertical mixing near the critical latitude for diurnal inertial resonance 30 n s and are a feature of all four major eastern boundary upwelling systems here we employ 1d and 2d vertical model configurations forced by a land sea breeze to quantify the relative contributions of the locally forced and internal wave responses to surface currents and vertical mixing and test sensitivity to latitude and bottom slope we further include a sub inertial alongshore wind to consider the role of the land sea breeze in the context of upwelling systems at the critical latitude the internal waves generated via thermocline pumping near the land boundary are evanescent in agreement with theory and largely absent 50 km offshore the internal waves are shown to contribute to vertical mixing which can be 20 greater than that due to the forced response alone further deepening the surface ekman boundary layer this deepening reduces the sub inertial offshore advection of surface waters thereby retaining the upwelling front closer to the land boundary and driving a net warming of the nearshore surface waters cross shore horizontal oscillations of the upwelling front generated by the land sea breeze drive strong diurnal variability in sea surface temperature in agreement with observations from a cross shore mooring array in the southern benguela 32 3 s keywords land sea breeze inertial oscillations internal waves vertical mixing critical latitude coastal upwelling 1 introduction the land sea breeze is a ubiquitous feature of the world s coastlines driving diurnal wind variability which is detectable several hundred kilometres from the coast gille et al 2003 2005 at latitudes of ϕ 30 n s referred to as the critical latitude throughout this paper the inertial frequency f 2 ω sin ϕ is also diurnal giving rise to resonance between the land sea breeze and the local inertial response of the ocean simpson et al 2002 hyder et al 2002 as the critical latitude intersects all four of the major eastern boundary upwelling systems ebus diurnal inertial resonance is a common feature of these systems indeed many documented observations of surface rotary diurnal currents in ebus have been attributed to land sea breeze wind forcing hyder et al 2011 and references therein the physical and biogeochemical functioning of ebus is however largely understood in terms of the upwelling relaxation paradigm which responds to sub diurnal wind variability i e time scales of longer than one day the influence of the land sea breeze on these systems is therefore typically assumed to be of low importance high amplitude diurnal inertial currents are however known to enhance shear driven vertical mixing in coastal upwelling systems near the critical latitude as revealed from observational evidence aguiar gonzález et al 2011 lucas et al 2014 and numerical experiments fearon et al 2020 here we build on the 1d vertical model experiments of fearon et al 2020 by introducing a 2d vertical model which includes the cross shore dimension allowing us to more fully explore the role of land sea breeze forcing in the context of coastal upwelling systems near the critical latitude near inertial rotary currents are commonly excited by surface wind variability either through an impulsive wind stress such as a storm event e g d asaro et al 1995 or through periodic forcing near the inertial frequency e g simpson et al 2002 in the case of land sea breeze forcing near the critical latitude the surface near inertial currents can be largely attributed to the diurnal anticyclonic rotary component of the winds τ a c as this is the component of the forcing which rotates at the same frequency and in the same direction as the forced surface inertial oscillations fearon et al 2020 simple linearly damped slab models have been widely used to model the surface mixed layer response to wind forcing in some cases showing reasonable agreement with observations of near inertial rotary currents e g pollard and millard 1970 pollard 1980 jarosz et al 2007 the presence of a land boundary introduces a cross shore no flow condition at the coast which drives a barotropic response via a cross shore surface elevation gradient the barotropic response simultaneously dampens the wind driven surface inertial oscillations and introduces subsurface inertial oscillations with an opposite phase to those in the surface layer craig 1989 simpson et al 2002 although the surface elevation gradient response behaves as an offshore propagating barotropic wave high wave speeds c 0 g h cover typical continental shelf widths in a tiny fraction of an inertial period chen et al 2017 shearman 2005 and as such can be interpreted as a locally forced response indeed the first order cross shore surface elevation gradient termed the craig approximation can be applied in 1d vertical models as a forcing term to reproduce the 180 phase shift between surface and subsurface currents hyder et al 2011 fearon et al 2020 throughout this paper we refer to the forced response to land sea breeze forcing near a land boundary as the superposition of the local wind driven surface mixed layer response and the opposing first order barotropic response horizontal convergences divergences in the locally forced near inertial oscillations drive vertical pumping of the pycnocline thereby initiating near inertial internal waves which can propagate away from the generation zone alford et al 2016 near inertial motions near coastlines are therefore a combination of the locally forced response and the offshore propagating internal wave response generated by convergence divergence at the land boundary millot and crépon 1981 simple two dimensional linear flat bottom two layer coastal wall models have been widely used to study the inertial response to an impulsive wind stress near the coast e g millot and crépon 1981 kundu et al 1983 shearman 2005 kelly 2019 such models suggest that the baroclinic wave generation at the land boundary plays an important role in reducing near inertial oscillations towards the coast shearman 2005 variable bottom topography has however also been indirectly identified as a means of controlling the cross shelf variation of near inertial motions through its influence on the cross shore pressure gradient chen and xie 1997 the 3d numerical experiments of zhang et al 2010 elucidated the latitudinal dependence of near inertial motions internal waves and associated diapycnal mixing in response to land sea breeze forcing at a coast the propagation of the internal wave energy away from the coastline is dictated by the dispersion relation for poincare waves which must be satisfied for propagating wave solutions to exist 1 ω 2 f 2 c 1 2 k 2 where ω is the frequency of the waves k is the horizontal wavenumber considering the cross shore dimension alone and c 1 is the phase speed of the first baroclinic mode internal wave zhang et al 2010 showed that under land sea breeze forcing diapycnal mixing is maximised near the critical latitude of 30 n s where internal wave energy is trapped at the coastline due to the low group speed of poincare waves diapycnal mixing is reduced at higher and lower latitudes due to the reduction of the resonance phenomenon while at lower latitudes energy is able to propagate offshore in the form of poincare waves and contribute to weak diapycnal mixing outside of the forcing area while the forced and internal wave responses near a land boundary can be viewed as distinct processes their similar vertical current structures and frequencies complicate the interpretation of observations and model output notably the 180 phase shift between surface and subsurface near inertial oscillations commonly observed near land boundaries can be easily misinterpreted as a true first baroclinic mode this vertical current structure can however be reproduced in 1d models hyder et al 2011 fearon et al 2020 or homogeneous models chen et al 2017 pettigrew 1980 which exclude internal wave physics the apparent first baroclinic mode vertical current structure is often cited as a source of shear driven mixing however the 1d model experiments of fearon et al 2020 showed that local shear driven mixing is maximised in the absence of a land boundary and that the introduction of the 180 phase shift between surface and subsurface layers via the craig approximation serves to dampen shear production and diapycnal mixing true first baroclinic mode near inertial internal waves are however believed to play an important role in driving shear driven turbulence and diapycnal mixing xing et al 2004 zhang et al 2010 separating forced and internal wave motions near a coastline has been achieved in simplified two layer models kelly 2019 or inferred through comparisons of homogeneous vs stratified experiments using primitive equation models chen et al 2017 the relative contribution of the forced and internal wave responses to diapycnal mixing however remains largely unstudied within the context of coastal upwelling systems near the critical latitude enhanced diapycnal mixing driven by diurnal inertial resonance has been identified as an important mechanism for nutrient enrichment of the surface layer with potentially significant implications for primary productivity aguiar gonzález et al 2011 lucas et al 2014 fearon et al 2020 in addition to biological implications the deepening of the surface mixed layer by the land sea breeze can also influence sub inertial processes for instance steepened horizontal isotherms due to land sea breeze driven diapycnal mixing have been identified as playing a role in enhancing sub inertial alongshore geostrophic flows nam and send 2013 however the implications of the land sea breeze on sub inertial upwelling has as far as we know not been explicitly studied here we introduce a cross shore 2d vertical model to study the effects of land sea forcing on coastal upwelling systems near the critical latitude we make use of the 1d vertical model configuration of fearon et al 2020 as a proxy for the forced response allowing us to separate the effects of the forced and internal wave responses the 2d model is used to elucidate the effect of latitude and bottom slope on the cross shore variability in diurnal inertial currents thermocline displacements and diapycnal mixing due to land sea breeze forcing near the critical latitude analytically configured experiments for this purpose are set up in an analogous way to the 1d experiments described in fearon et al 2020 and we employ the 1d model solution as the offshore open boundary condition for the 2d model the quantification of diapycnal mixing is aided by initialising subsurface waters with a passive tracer we then further explore the implications of the land sea in the context of coastal upwelling systems by considering experiments forced by the land sea breeze alone upwelling winds alone and a combination of the two we initialise subsurface waters of these experiments with lagrangian floats to track how subsurface waters are modified through land sea breeze driven diapycnal mixing as in fearon et al 2020 we again compare a realistically configured model to the observations of lucas et al 2014 located in st helena bay in the southern benguela upwelling system fig 1 2 methods 2 1 in situ observations we make use of horizontal current velocity and temperature observations from a mooring array described in lucas et al 2014 located in st helena bay in the southern benguela upwelling system fig 1 the three fixed moorings are aligned roughly perpendicular to the local coastline making them particularly relevant for identifying the cross shore processes of interest in this paper horizontal current velocity data are obtained from bottom mounted acoustic doppler current profilers adcp while temperature data are obtained from wirewalker wave powered profilers rainville and pinkel 2001 pinkel et al 2011 velocity and temperature data are available at a temporal frequency of 10 min and at vertical resolutions of 1 m and 0 25 m respectively all observations are filtered in time to provide a two hour running mean at 30 min intervals sufficient for revealing processes at the diurnal inertial frequency of interest as per fearon et al 2020 we revisit only the 7 14 march 2011 upwelling event having been identified as a period which clearly demonstrates the response of a highly stratified two layer system to a combination of upwelling

www croco ocean org an ocean modelling system built upon roms agrif shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 croco is a free surface terrain following coordinate oceanic model which solves the navier stokes primitive equations by following the boussinesq and hydrostatic approximations 1d model experiments employ the standalone 1d version of the code described in fearon et al 2020 in which we retain the coast normal horizontal pressure gradient as a forcing term computed from the craig approximation the 1 d model code can be downloaded via the following doi https doi org 10 15493 dea mims 26052102 2d model experiments are configured using the v1 0 official release of the 3d croco code this is achieved by employing a shore perpendicular grid with only 5 grid cells in the alongshore dimension section 2 2 1 maintaining constant alongshore bathymetry section 2 2 3 and making use of periodic boundary conditions along the cross shore boundaries of the model section 2 2 4 under these conditions alongshore gradients are essentially zero and continuity dictates that divergence convergence of the cross shore flow u x must be compensated by vertical motion w z the parameterisation of vertical eddy viscosity and diffusivity are carried out in the present study in accordance with the k ɛ turbulent closure scheme within the generic length scale gls formulation umlauf and burchard 2003 2005 implementation of the scheme within croco and default settings adopted in this study are provided in appendix a of fearon et al 2020 we use an upstream biased dissipative horizontal advection scheme for momentum while horizontal advection of tracers is discretised using a split and rotated third order upstream biased numerical scheme marchesiello et al 2009 no explicit lateral viscosity is added in the model except in sponge layers at the western open lateral boundary as described in fearon et al 2020 bottom friction is parameterised using a quadratic drag law where the bottom roughness length parameter is taken as 0 1 m a nonlinear equation of state adapted from jackett and mcdougall 1995 is used for the computation of density both analytically and realistically configured experiments are employed in this paper as summarised in table 1 the analytically configured experiments row id s 1 and 2 of table 1 are designed to elucidate the processes of interest and to carry out sensitivity tests to relevant variables while the realistically configured simulation row id 3 of table 1 is compared with observations from the cross shore mooring array of lucas et al 2014 over the 7 14 march 2011 upwelling event for consistency the 1d model configurations presented here are identical to those presented in fearon et al 2020 while the 2d model settings remain consistent with the 1d model settings where possible as described below 2 2 1 spatial and temporal discretisation all 2d experiments use a model domain with horizontal dimensions of 100 km e w 2 5 km n s which is discretised using a regular grid of 500 m resolution i e a 200 5 grid we use 100 sigma layers to discretise the vertical dimension a baroclinic time step of 40 s is used to integrate the model solution over a period of 7 days from initialisation typical of the time scale of upwelling events 40 barotropic time steps are computed within each baroclinic time step instantaneous model output at 30 min intervals is filtered in time to provide a two hour running mean at each time step consistent with the processing of observations 2 2 2 surface forcing in the case of analytically configured experiments row id s 1 and 2 of table 1 the land sea breeze is approximated as a diurnal anticyclonic anticlockwise in the southern hemisphere rotating wind stress τ a c of constant amplitude τ a c 0 which is applied as a spatially constant forcing hyder et al 2011 report diurnal anticyclonic rotary wind stress amplitudes from in situ observations along the namibian coastline of between 0 004 n m 2 and 0 051 n m 2 depending on the location and observation period analysis of surface wind stress derived from a 3 km horizontal resolution atmospheric model indicates large spatial variability in the diurnal rotary component of winds over the southern benguela with a notable enhancement over st helena bay fearon et al 2020 in this region the mean amplitude of the diurnal anticyclonic rotary component of the wind stress as derived from 7 day windows over upwelling favourable months was found to be around 0 03 n m 2 we therefore adopt a value of τ a c 0 0 03 n m 2 for all analytically configured experiments presented in this paper time series of the analytically configured rotary surface wind stress components τ a c τ x a c τ y a c are shown in fig 2a when upwelling is included in these experiments row id 2 of table 1 it is simulated through the application of a mean alongshore wind stress τ y of 0 05 n m 2 being typical of the 7 day mean alongshore wind stress for st helena bay over upwelling favourable months fearon et al 2020 τ y is linearly ramped up from zero to 0 05 n m 2 over the second day of the simulation allowing for the preconditioning of the water column by the land sea breeze over the first two days before the full impact of the mean alongshore wind stress is felt by the surface ekman boundary layer time series of the analytically configured surface wind stress components are shown in fig 2a surface heat fluxes are excluded in analytically configured experiments in the case of the realistically configured experiment row id 3 of table 1 bulk parameterisation is adopted for the computation of surface wind stress and surface net heat fluxes fairall et al 1996 2003 using hourly atmospheric model output from a 3 km resolution weather research

wasa project http www wasaproject info and has been validated against a number of land based weather stations including one deployed at the southern end of st helena bay over a three year period lennard et al 2015 fig 2b presents time series of surface wind stress components at the outer mooring ww1 in fig 1 over the duration of the simulated 7 14 march 2011 upwelling event 2 2 3 bathymetry and latitude flat bottom analytically configured experiments employ a constant water depth of 100 m depth and we test the sensitivity of the model solution to cross shore bottom slopes of 1 200 and 1 500 row id s 1 and 2 of table 1 flat bottom experiments are considered to be a useful reference against previous flat bottom model studies where internal wave generation at the land boundary controls the onshore decrease in horizontal near inertial current velocities e g shearman 2005 different bottom slopes allow us to test the role of the cross shore pressure gradient which increases with decreasing water depth according to the craig approximation in controlling the cross shelf decrease in near inertial motions this mechanism was found to be a dominant driver of cross shelf variability of near inertial motions in the realistically configured 2d model of chen and xie 1997 a maximum offshore water depth of 100 m is used for all experiments while a minimum water depth of 20 m is employed at the land boundary we maintain a constant alongshore bathymetry in all experiments the realistically configured experiment row id 3 of table 1 employs a nearshore bathymetry i e shallower than 100 m which is interpolated from digital versions of the most detailed available navigation charts for the region as provided by the hydrographer of the south african navy fig 1 baseline experiments adopt a latitude of 30 s for testing the pure case of diurnal inertial resonance however we also test the model sensitivity to latitudes of 20 s and 40 s row id s 1 and 2 of table 1 latitude is expected to play a dominant role in land sea breeze driven near inertial motions both through local resonance effects simpson et al 2002 hyder et al 2002 fearon et al 2020 and internal wave generation zhang et al 2010 the realistically configured experiment adopts the realistic cross shore mooring array latitude of 32 3 s row id 3 of table 1 2 2 4 boundary conditions the northern and southern boundaries are defined as periodic boundary conditions such that all the outflows inflows at the southern boundary are inflows outflows at the northern boundary given the constant alongshore bathymetry the model is effectively a 2d configuration the eastern boundary is defined as a closed land boundary while the western boundary is applied as an open boundary condition the open boundary requires the prescription of temperature t salinity s and velocity components u v additionally we prescribe a passive tracer concentration boundary condition c in arbitrary tracer units per volume atu m 3 used to aid the quantification of diapycnal mixing see section 2 3 relaxation times of 1 4 day and 1 day are adopted for inward and outward radiation respectively implying strong relaxation to the specified boundary values a sponge layer of 10 km 20 grid cells is used to gradually ramp up the model solution in the interior of the domain to the applied boundary values within the sponge layer the prescribed boundary conditions over each experiment are obtained from the solution of an analogously configured 1d model integrated over the simulation period using the same initial condition and forcing as applied at the offshore extent of the 2d model 2 2 5 initial conditions we remain consistent with the 1d model experiments of fearon et al 2020 in defining initial conditions for the 2d model experiments simulations are initialised from rest using a constant salinity of 35 and a temperature profile defined either analytically or from observations in the case of analytically configured experiments row id s 1 and 2 of table 1 the initial vertical profile for temperature is defined using a hyperbolic tangent function which effectively creates a two layer system with 16 c surface water overlaying 10 c subsurface water and a maximum stratification located at 10 m depth see fearon et al 2020 for details the realistic model configuration row id 3 of table 1 is initialised using measured temperature profiles from the three moorings of lucas et al 2014 at the start of the simulation 7 march 2011 linear interpolation is used to define the initial temperature in between the offshore and inshore moorings while temperature data from the offshore inshore mooring is used to extrapolate offshore inshore of the moorings while it is acknowledged that the temperature section will not be realistic at the offshore extent of the model the intention is only to provide a stable offshore boundary so that the nearshore processes in the vicinity of the observations can be assessed the resulting initial temperature section is shown in fig 1b experiments are initialised with passive tracer concentrations of 1 and 0 atu m 3 in the subsurface and surface layers respectively 2 3 data analysis as alongshore variability in the model is negligible we only present plots and analysis of the 2d model output along a cross shore section corresponding to the centre i e third alongshore grid cell we remain consistent in the computation of diapycnal mixing diagnostics as described in fearon et al 2020 the thermocline depth h s is defined as the depth of a given isotherm being the 11 c isotherm in the case of analytically configured experiments and the 12 5 c isotherm in the case of the realistically configured experiment the cumulative diapycnal mixing over each experiment is quantified through the diagnostic variable c s computed by integrating the passive tracer c over the surface layer of the model i e from h s to the surface the depth averaged velocity vector over the surface layer of the model is used to indicate the surface layer current response in the model u s u s v s the analysis of diapycnal mixing is further aided by extracting the vertical turbulent diffusivity k t v as output from the k ɛ turbulent closure scheme of the model k t v is extracted at the thermocline depth as an indication of interfacial mixing in the model we further use the vertical displacement of the thermocline in order to diagnose internal wave generation and propagation in the model to this end the thermocline depth is presented as the displacement from the daily running average thermocline depth allowing us to isolate the super diurnal variability in the thermocline depth induced by the applied land sea breeze forcing thermocline displacements are compared with the theoretical internal rossby radius of deformation r d 2 r d c 1 f and further compared with the theoretical celerity of a long wave propagating at the interface of a two layer system 3 c 1 g h s h b h s h b where g δ ρ ρ g is the reduced gravity acceleration h s and h b are the thicknesses of the surface and bottom layers respectively as defined by the depth of the thermocline g is estimated from the temperature difference between the surface and subsurface layers and a linear expansion coefficient α 2 1 0 4 k 1 when an upwelling favourable wind is included in the model row id s 2 and 3 of table 1 the location of the upwelling front is computed from the outcropping of the diagnostic isotherm used to define the thermocline depth 3 results 3 1 diurnal inertial resonance at a land boundary we begin by considering the response of a flat bottom 100 m deep ocean consisting of an analytically derived two layer water column to a constant amplitude diurnal anticlockwise rotating wind stress at 30 s the pure case of diurnal inertial resonance the amplitude of the applied wind stress is 0 03 n m 2 and we exclude any sub inertial upwelling from a mean alongshore wind stress fig 3 presents the evolution of the model output for both the 1d model configuration as presented in fearon et al 2020 and the 2d model configuration introduced in this paper at distances of 50 km and 10 km from the land boundary fig 4 presents hovmöller diagrams for the 2d experiment showing cross shore variability in thermocline displacements log 10 k t v at the depth of the 11 c isotherm taken to represent the thermocline and the passive tracer concentration integrated from the 11 c isotherm to the surface c s the results indicate that the 1d and 2d model solutions are almost identical at a distance of 50 km offshore in the case of the 1d model the cross shore surface elevation gradient η x is an applied forcing term computed from the craig approximation for the barotropic response imposed by the no flow condition perpendicular to the land boundary while this response is generated dynamically in the 2d model the near perfect agreement between the two models indicates that the reduced physics of the 1d model provides a sufficient description of the processes at this location and therefore the enhanced shear driven vertical mixing here is driven by the locally forced response alone these processes are explored in detail in fearon et al 2020 and are therefore not elaborated further here the excellent agreement also provides support for the methodology of using the 1d model solution as the offshore boundary condition for the 2d model indeed this approach largely prevented spurious internal wave generation at the open boundary at a distance of 10 km offshore the 2d model solution deviates significantly from the 1d solution as the linear assumptions of the craig approximation are invalid here in close proximity to the land boundary horizontal gradients in cross shore currents are high and the non linear advection terms become important onshore offshore surface currents lead to convergence divergence and the downward upward displacement of the thermocline the forced thermocline displacements have a diurnal periodicity consistent with the diurnal periodicity of the wind forcing unlike at 50 km offshore the results at 10 km offshore reveal diurnal variability in surface temperature and surface tracer concentrations fig 3b reflecting the advection of horizontal gradients which are set up by high spatial variability in diapycnal mixing the amplitude of the surface inertial oscillations is significantly weaker at 10 km offshore than at 50 km offshore fig 3c implying reduced vertical shear and therefore reduced diapycnal mixing as reflected in the surface tracer concentration fig 3d we note that although the alongshore current velocity data are not plotted the oscillatory nature of the currents dictates a very similar vertical structure in the alongshore currents the only notable difference being a 6 h phase shift when compared to the cross shore currents hovmöller diagrams of the 2d experiment fig 4 reveal that the vertical displacements of the thermocline propagate offshore but are largely absent 50 km from the land boundary indicating an evanescent internal wave response between 10 km and 50 km offshore diapycnal mixing is shown to respond to a combination of the forced response and the internal wave response generating diurnal peaks of enhanced mixing at the diagnostic thermocline fig 4b the net result is an enhancement of the cumulative diapycnal mixing over and above that induced by the forced response alone as revealed by a locally enhanced passive tracer concentration in the surface layer of the model fig 4c 3 2 sensitivity tests to latitude and bottom slope the evanescent nature of the internal wave response to land sea breeze forcing is governed by the latitude as previously explored by zhang et al 2010 and revealed in fig 5 here we contrast the simulation presented in figs 3 and 4 latitude 30 s against identical simulations run at latitudes of 20 s and 40 s the results are presented as hovmöller diagrams of thermocline displacement as well as the amplitude of the surface layer velocity u s and the passive tracer concentration integrated over the surface layer c s both averaged over the fifth day of each simulation the 1d model output for u s and c s is also shown for comparative purposes allowing us to distinguish the relative influence of the forced response as approximated by the 1d model and the internal waves for consistency u s and c s are the same metrics used to summarise the 1d model sensitivity experiments presented in fearon et al 2020 the forced diurnal displacement of the thermocline is shown to occur landward of the internal rossby radius of deformation r d eq 2 while the offshore propagation of the forced displacement is latitudinally dependent at 20 s the diurnal pumping of the thermocline results in offshore propagating internal waves however these waves are evanescent at latitudes of 30 s and 40 s eq 1 dictates that waves can only freely propagate at latitudes where the inertial frequency f is less than the frequency of the forced diurnal displacements i e equatorward of 30 n s such that f ω the results indicate that the initial propagation of the internal wave away from the land boundary can be reasonably approximated by the theoretical celerity of a long wave propagating at the interface of a two layer system c 1 eq 3 the amplitude of the thermocline displacement is greatest at the critical latitude of 30 s where the amplitude of the forced surface currents and therefore convergence divergence at the land boundary is greatest fig 5b at this latitude the amplitude of the surface current is shown to drop off rapidly within 20 km of the land boundary in good agreement with the flat bottom numerical experiments of chen et al 2017 diapycnal mixing as quantified through the passive tracer concentration integrated over the surface layer c s is shown to be highest at a distance of 25 km offshore and is 20 greater than the offshore value as already described the elevated mixing is attributed to the effect of the evanescent internal waves which contribute to the mixing induced by the forced response both surface current amplitude and diapycnal mixing are predictably lower at latitudes of 20 s and 40 s when compared to 30 s for the 20 s experiment the signature of the offshore propagating internal waves is evident both through deviations of the surface current amplitude fig 5b and elevated diapycnal mixing fig 5c when compared to the forced response this is not seen in the 40 s experiment where the effect of the internal wave response is negligible we now add an element of realism to the experiments by contrasting the 100 m water depth flat bottom configuration at 30 s already presented with two experiments in which the water depth gradually increases away from the land boundary using constant bottom slopes of 1 200 and 1 500 respectively fig 6 by way of comparison the average bottom slope across the st helena bay mooring array is approximately 1 200 fig 1 the dashed lines in fig 6b c are taken from individual 1d model solutions run at 5 km increments from the land boundary using the corresponding water depth of the 2d model these 1d experiments provide insight into how a gradually reducing water depth impacts the forced response alone as explored in fearon et al 2020 the first order surface elevation gradient response serves to reduce surface oscillations and diapycnal mixing providing a mechanism for gradually dampening the forced diurnal inertial oscillations in shallower water depths toward the land boundary the dampened forced response is shown to lead to a reduction in the convergence divergence of the forced oscillations in the surface layer and therefore a reduction in thermocline pumping fig 6a considering the case of the 1 500 bottom slope the 2d model results for both u s and c s are almost identical to the 1d model right panels of fig 6b c indicating that the internal wave effects on currents and diapycnal mixing are negligible as the slope becomes steeper so the convergence divergence in the forced response becomes greater and the effects of the internal waves become apparent in these cases the 1d model over predicts both the amplitude of the surface oscillation and diapycnal mixing within 20 km of the land boundary 3 3 diurnal inertial resonance in the presence of upwelling in the case of upwelling systems the processes associated with diurnal inertial resonance are embedded within ekman dynamics driven by sub inertial wind variability the 2d model allows us to explore the interaction of these processes by comparing simulations forced with a land sea breeze alone τ a c 0 0 03 n m 2 an upwelling wind alone τ y 0 05 n m 2 and a combination of the two the values of τ a c 0 and τ y are specifically chosen so that a combination of the two is representative of a typical upwelling event within st helena bay section 2 2 2 we adopt a bottom slope of 1 200 for these experiments being representative of the bottom slope within st helena bay fig 1 fig 7 presents the temporal evolution of the modelled temperature cross shore currents and passive tracer for each experiment at a distance of 10 km from the land boundary the processes associated with the simulation forced by the land sea breeze alone have already been shown fig 3 whereby diurnal variability in surface temperature is driven by a combination of high spatial variability in diapycnal mixing and advection due to the surface inertial oscillations the simulation forced by the upwelling wind alone shows considerably reduced diapycnal mixing and shows the offshore transport of the surface layer in response to the sustained alongshore wind stress centre panel of fig 7b the combined effect of land sea breeze and upwelling winds generates super diurnal advection of the upwelling front leading to pronounced diurnal variability in surface temperatures the inertial oscillations left panels of fig 7 are superimposed onto the sub inertial transport centre panels of fig 7 resulting in the repeated cross shore back and forth advection of strong horizontal temperature gradients past the shown output location right panels of fig 7 large diurnal variability in temperature will persist provided the location of interest is within one oscillation radius of the steep horizontal temperature gradients associated with the upwelling front an oscillation velocity of 0 5 m s 1 at 30 s has an oscillation radius u f of 6 9 km this phenomenon is invoked in the interpretation of the results of the realistically configured experiment as described in section 3 4 in addition to the super diurnal advection of the upwelling front the inclusion of the land sea breeze is shown to significantly influence the mean cross shore temperature over the modelled upwelling event fig 8 the mean location of the upwelling front is also shown as computed from the outcropping of the 11 c isotherm at the offshore extent of the shown section i e outside the influence of the upwelling front the applied diurnal wind variability is shown to result in a significant cooling of the surface which overlays a commensurate warming despite the surface cooling due to diapycnal mixing the results indicate a net warming of mean surface waters within 20 km of the coast due to the inclusion of land sea breeze forcing relative to the case with upwelling winds alone we posit two explanations for this perhaps unintuitive result firstly although the ekman transport m e τ y ρ f is the same in both cases the cross shore velocity of the surface ekman boundary layer u e m e h s is reduced when the land sea breeze is included due to diapycnal mixing induced deepening of the surface layer h s this leads to a persistently landward location of the upwelling front when land sea breeze forcing is applied effectively resulting in retention of surface waters and a net warming in the nearshore this concept is further discussed in section 4 the second potential explanation for the nearshore warming due to the inclusion of diurnal wind variability is that the enhanced diapycnal mixing leads to a warming of subsurface waters which are carried by the upwelling circulation toward the inshore and surface as it is not immediately apparent which of these two processes the location of the upwelling front vs modified upwelled water is of leading order in explaining the nearshore surface warming the appendix presents diagnostics designed to reveal the relative contribution of each the analysis suggests that the nearshore warming due to the inclusion of the land sea breeze is primarily driven by the location of the upwelling front while the upwelling of warmer waters due to enhanced vertical mixing plays a secondary role 3 4 case study of st helena bay we now present the final more comprehensive experiment being a realistically configured simulation for comparison with the nearshore observations of lucas et al 2014 the model solution is integrated over a 7 day period starting on 7 march 2011 from the temperature section shown in fig 1 and forced with hourly winds and heat fluxes derived from the 3 km resolution csag wrf model output fig 9 compares the observed and modelled temperature across the mooring array including summary statistics of model bias centred root mean square difference rmsd and pearson s correlation coefficient as a function of depth the model is shown to reproduce the salient features of the temperature observations at all three moorings which are characterised by significant diurnal inertial variability in surface temperature and a net cooling of surface waters over the considered period the analytically configured 2d experiments have highlighted the mechanism whereby near the critical latitude of 30 s diurnal inertial oscillations in the presence of sub inertial upwelling produces strong diurnal variability in surface temperature through repeated advection of strong horizontal temperature gradients over the measurement location the pumping of the thermocline characteristic of the internal wave response as revealed in the analytically configured 2d experiments is also evident in both the observations and the model it is expected that the 2d model would tend to over estimate thermocline displacements as the divergence convergence of the cross shore flow u x is compensated by vertical motion w z alone due to the exclusion of alongshore gradients v y in the model alongshore velocity gradients however appeared to have played a minor role over the observation period as revealed by similar amplitude 5 m thermocline displacements in the both model and the observations the model performance is best at the surface as reflected by high correlation coefficients at all three moorings 0 8 for depths shallower than 5 m fig 9c the significant reduction in temperature correlation near the base of the thermocline can in part be explained by an over prediction in sub inertial upwelling and the consequent over prediction in thermocline lifting as reflected in a negative near surface temperature bias across the mooring array left panel of fig 9c this could be attributed to an over prediction in the mean alongshore surface wind stress derived from the csag wrf model or potentially due to the advection of alongshore variability in temperature which is explicitly excluded in the model the low even negative correlations in the subsurface water 20 m depth at the middle and outer moorings are attributed to the lack of a meaningful temperature signal here over the considered event as evidenced by the low rmsd in this region of the water column the time series comparisons at 5 m depth fig 9b indicate a phase lag 6 h in the timing of the diurnal fluctuations in near surface temperature which may reflect shortcomings in the timing of the land sea breeze in the csag wrf model forcing one potential explanation for this could be due to shortcomings in the sea surface temperature sst input to the csag wrf model upwelling is known to impact the timing of the land sea breeze seroka et al 2018 while the wrf model uses daily sst fields derived from satellite observations which contain systematic errors in upwelling regions meneghesso et al 2020 and do not capture super diurnal variability in sst s the observed and modelled cross shore component of velocity for the outer and inner moorings are compared in fig 10 adcp data from the middle mooring were mostly missing over this period and is therefore not shown while the salient features of the vertical structure of the currents are reproduced in the model the time series comparisons fig 10b again reveal phase differences in the diurnal inertial oscillations where the model lags the observations by 6 h at both the outer and inner moorings despite the presence of the time lag correlation coefficients at the outer mooring are between 0 4 and 0 6 for the subsurface currents while a maximum of 0 7 is attained for the near surface currents fig 10c the model correlation coefficients drop to negative values in the region of the thermocline where the 180 phase shift between the surface and subsurface currents is observed poor correlation in this region is not surprising as any misrepresentation in the depth of the 180 phase shift will have a notable impact on the correlations in this region of the water column current correlations are lower at the inner mooring between 0 2 and 0 4 where the amplitude of the diurnal inertial signal is weaker the modelled currents at this mooring appear to be hampered by the signature of an over prediction in sub inertial upwelling circulation as evidenced by negative positive cross shore current biases in the surface subsurface fig 10c these biases are in agreement with the cool surface temperature bias visible in fig 9 4 discussion and conclusions in this paper we have employed novel 2d model experiments to gain insight into the cross shore processes governing the response of coastal upwelling systems to land sea breeze forcing in addition to testing model sensitivity to relevant variables in analytically configured experiments a realistically configured experiment has been compared with three nearshore moorings orientated perpendicular to the local coastline in st helena bay located in the southern benguela upwelling system lucas et al 2014 our analytically configured experiments have focussed on the response of upwelling systems at the critical latitude of 30 n s where the diurnal periodicity of the land sea breeze is resonant with the inertial frequency and the locally forced response is maximised craig 1989 simpson et al 2002 fearon et al 2020 given the mooring array latitude of 32 3 s the observations provide a particularly relevant ground truth for the presented 2d model configuration notwithstanding model shortcomings which include an over prediction in sub inertial upwelling and notable phase lags in the modelled diurnal inertial response the favourable comparison with the observations provides some confidence in the dynamics elucidated by the analytically configured experiments the presented results are relevant for all regions under the influence of land sea breeze forcing near the critical latitude which includes all four of the major eastern boundary upwelling systems ebus the relevance of the results naturally diminishes away from the critical latitude where the locally forced resonance phenomenon becomes weaker e g fig 5 and figure 10 of fearon et al 2020 hyder et al 2011 argue the region of influence to lie between latitudes of 23 and 40 n s the key processes elucidated by the experiments presented in this paper are summarised in fig 11 and discussed below 4 1 separation of the forced and internal wave responses contrasting results from the 2d model with those of the 1d model presented in fearon et al 2020 has allowed us for the first time to identify the respective roles of the locally forced response as approximated by the 1d model and the internal wave response to land sea breeze forcing near the critical latitude while the focus of this paper is on coastal upwelling systems the findings of these purely land sea breeze forced experiments would apply to any two layer coastal systems near the critical latitude as the locally forced response to the land sea breeze is maximised at the critical latitude of 30 n s here we also find the maximum amplitude thermocline displacements due to convergence divergence of the forced oscillations at the land boundary although the internal waves are evanescent at the critical latitude in agreement with theory and the numerical experiments of zhang et al 2010 they provide an additional source of shear driven diapycnal mixing in the considered configuration the effect is maximised at a distance of 25 km from the wave generation zone at the land boundary where diapycnal mixing can be 20 greater than that due to the forced response alone the influence of the internal waves extends to 50 km from the land boundary offshore of which the 1d and 2d model solutions are in near perfect agreement sensitivity tests have revealed the importance of the bottom slope in governing the processes driving the cross shore variability in near inertial motions the steepness of the bottom slope determines the rate at which the locally forced oscillations are dampened toward the coast thereby influencing the convergence divergence of the surface currents and thermocline pumping internal wave generation at the coast is therefore dampened by a gradually sloping bottom this is in agreement with previous 2d primitive equation experiments over the gradually sloping texas louisiana shelf where non linear advection terms were of secondary importance and the first order cross shore surface elevation gradient was found to play a dominant role in the cross shore variability in near inertial oscillations chen and xie 1997 in contrast a simple two layer coastal wall model has been used to identify the internal wave generation at the boundary as the driving mechanism for explaining the drop off in near inertial energy toward the coast shearman 2005 our sensitivity experiments serve to reveal how the bottom slope governs which of these processes first order surface elevation gradient vs internal wave generation dominate the reduction in near inertial motions toward the coast steeper bottom slopes are required to enhance the internal wave response and allow for elevated diapycnal mixing over and above what would be expected from the forced response alone 4 2 the influence of the land sea breeze on sub inertial upwelling the inclusion of a sub inertial alongshore wind stress in the 2d model experiments has allowed for further reflection on the role of diurnal inertial resonance within the context of sub inertial upwelling dynamics our results reveal how the combined effect of sub inertial upwelling and inertial oscillations can produce pronounced diurnal variability in nearshore surface temperatures driven by horizontal diurnal advection of strong cross shore temperature gradients which are ever present in upwelling systems local land sea breeze forcing has been identified as playing a key role in diurnal temperature variability in a number of in situ observations in ebus kaplan et al 2003 woodson et al 2007 bonicelli et al 2014 walter et al 2017 and is evident in the nearshore observations of lucas et al 2014 fig 9 the 2d model experiments presented here clearly demonstrate a driving mechanism of this phenomenon although it is noted that solar irradiance is an additional mechanism which would further contribute to diurnal variability in sea surface temperatures while not explicitly considered in this paper the impact of solar irradiance on surface temperatures over the presented observation period can be inferred from the 1d model results at the outer mooring figure 6 of fearon et al 2020 which included realistic surface heat fluxes comparison of the modelled temperature at the outer mooring from the 2d model fig 9a with that of the 1d model suggests that the advection of horizontal gradients was the dominant mechanism in driving the diurnal sea surface temperature variability over the considered observation period our simulations have further highlighted how deepening of the thermocline due to diurnal inertial resonance near the critical latitude can lead to a reduction in sub inertial offshore advection of the surface ekman boundary layer as illustrated in fig 11 as offshore ekman transport is the same in both fig 11b and c volume conservation dictates that d 1 l 1 d 2 l 2 and therefore the landward offset of the upwelling front will scale linearly with the increased depth in the surface ekman boundary layer for example if a mean alongshore wind drives a 15 m deep ekman boundary layer 10 km offshore the same wind will drive a 20 m deep ekman boundary layer 7 5 km offshore 15 20 10 shallower surface mixed layers elicit higher amplitude oscillations in the surface layer and greater mixing fearon et al 2020 implying that regions prone to the development of shallow surface layers such as retention zones in the lee of capes e g graham and largier 1997 oliveira et al 2009 are likely to be most affected by this process advective losses during active upwelling can contribute to a reduction in productivity within upwelling systems while the retention of upwelled waters is important for the accumulation of high biomass coastal blooms pitcher et al 2010 our results imply that the land sea breeze may play a contributing role in surface water retention in these areas through reduced offshore advection of the surface layer during upwelling events the retention of surface waters due to the inclusion of land sea breeze forcing has been shown to drive a net warming of nearshore surface waters primarily due to the landward displacement of the upwelling front while modification of subsurface waters through enhanced diapycnal mixing plays a secondary role offshore of the influence of the upwelling front surface waters are cooled through the entrainment of subsurface waters via diapycnal mixing these results suggest that the misrepresentation of the land sea breeze in global and regional models of ebus may contribute to nearshore temperature biases in these models such biases are largely attributed to errors in the representation of the low frequency alongshore wind stress in the atmospheric forcing products e g richter 2015 small et al 2015 while the influence of the land sea breeze is over looked as a potential source of systematic error our results suggest that the improvement in the spatial and temporal representation of the land sea breeze could be important in alleviating this source of systematic bias particularly near the critical latitude and in areas susceptible to the development of shallow surface mixed layers we note that our results have been limited to short duration 7 day experiments with a simplified 2d model while these experiments have been useful to elucidate event scale dynamics further work is required to assess the overall role of these processes within ebus where ekman dynamics are also counteracted by eddy effects thomsen et al 2021 inter annual simulations of realistically configured 3d models of ebus which both include and exclude land sea breeze forcing are expected to provide useful insights to this end such regional simulations are typically forced at the surface by an atmospheric model which is itself forced by sea surface temperatures which do not capture land sea breeze effects on the upwelling front this shortcoming was invoked as a possible source of the phase lag error in the realistically configured simulation section 3 4 previous studies have identified coastal upwelling as influencing the land sea breeze both through an earlier onset and enhanced intensity clancy et al 1979 seroka et al 2018 which may in turn have a positive feedback on upwelling favourable winds franchito et al 1998 this paper has further explored how the land sea breeze may impact the location of the upwelling front near the critical latitude processes which themselves appear likely to influence the land sea breeze it is suggested that two way coupled ocean atmosphere experiments may prove to be particularly insightful in exploring this two way feedback near the critical latitude 4 3 improved understanding of the st helena bay observations the results of this paper provide an opportunity for further reflection on the processes governing the nearshore observations of lucas et al 2014 while the forced response as approximated by the 1d model reproduces many of the salient features of the observations at the offshore mooring figure 6 of fearon et al 2020 the 1d model was shown to over predict the deepening of the thermocline through diapycnal mixing under predict net cooling of surface waters and lack sufficient diurnal inertial variability in both surface temperature and vertical displacement of the thermocline the realistically configured 2d model has significantly alleviated these shortcomings figs 9 and 10 suggesting that the analytically configured 2d experiments may be useful in interpreting the observations fig 6 confirms that for a 1 200 bottom slope the approximate slope across the mooring array and an offshore distance of just 12 7 km an over prediction in the amplitude of the surface oscillation and consequent deepening of the thermocline is to be expected in the 1d model here the 2d model experiments reveal the 5 m amplitude thermocline displacements to be the signature of internal waves generated at the land boundary the inclusion of sub inertial upwelling circulation in the 2d model alleviates the 1d model shortcomings of an under prediction of net cooling of surface waters although upwelling is over predicted in the 2d model and provides the mechanism for generating the observed diurnal variability in surface temperatures as already discussed lucas et al 2014 identified vertical mixing driven nutrient flux to be of high importance in governing observed phytoplankton growth across the mooring array while the 2d model confirms shear induced diapycnal mixing to be a feature over the mooring array an important consequence of the presented experiments is that the region of maximum diapycnal mixing is in fact expected to be located offshore of the observations it therefore seems plausible that the effect of the land sea breeze on the phytoplankton response may well have been further enhanced offshore of the mooring array this suggests that our understanding of event scale phytoplankton dynamics in the region would greatly benefit from high frequency observations of the water column which extend across the full width of st helena bay credit authorship contribution statement giles fearon

cape town s icts high performance computing team hpc uct ac za appendix diagnostics explaining warming of nearshore surface waters in response to land sea breeze forcing fig 8 indicates nearshore surface warming due to the inclusion of land sea breeze forcing while two processes are identified as possible drivers of this result 1 the landward location of the upwelling front due to a deepened ekman boundary layer and 2 the warming of subsurface water through diapycnal mixing which is then upwelled to the surface in this appendix we present diagnostics designed to reveal which of these two processes is of leading order in explaining the nearshore surface warming the contribution of the location of the upwelling front blue line in fig a 12b is computed as follows the cross shore temperature profile from the surface layer of the simulation forced by an upwelling wind alone is extracted at each 30 min time step a landward offset to this profile is then applied according to the difference in the upwelling front locations shown in fig a 12a the difference between the original and the offset cross shore temperature profiles is then computed the effect shown in fig a 12b is the mean temperature difference over the entire 7 day simulation the contribution of the upwelling of warmer subsurface waters is computed through the use of croco s online lagrangian floats module both simulations i e excluding and including land sea breeze forcing are initialised with neutrally buoyant lagrangian floats from the depth of the 11 c isotherm to the bottom in vertical increments of 1 m and horizontal increments of 500 m the horizontal grid resolution thereby covering subsurface waters over the entire model domain the temperature at the location of the floats as interpolated from the eulerian model is saved at 30 min intervals over each simulation temperature differences between the eulerian model at the location of the lagrangian floats and the initial temperature of lagrangian floats are used to quantify how subsurface water is modified by land sea breeze driven diapycnal mixing over the upwelling simulations the red line in fig a 12b is computed as follows all lagrangian floats in the upper 5 m of the water column are identified at each 30 min time step and taken to represent upwelled water the difference between the temperature of the eulerian field at the location of the floats and the original temperature of the floats is computed quantifying how the upwelled water has been modified through diapycnal mixing the offshore distance of the floats are used to construct a cross shore profile of the surface temperature difference using 2 m bins in the cross shore direction and averaging the temperature difference from all upwelled lagrangian floats contained within each 2 m bin the effect shown in fig a 12b is the mean temperature difference over the entire 7 day simulation forced by a combination of land sea breeze and upwelling winds over and above that computed from the simulation forced by an upwelling wind alone this approach is designed to capture how the temperature of subsurface water has been modified by enhanced diapycnal mixing offshore of the upwelling front prior to upwelling fig a 12b suggests that the nearshore warming due to the inclusion of the land sea breeze is primarily driven by the location of the upwelling front while the upwelling of warmer waters due to enhanced vertical mixing plays a secondary role 
23834,a high resolution numerical model based on the regional ocean modeling system roms was used to simulate the yellow sea cold water mass yscwm and revealed an extreme warm event of the yscwm in the summer of 2007 this event was also captured by in situ observations in august 2007 the average temperature of the yscwm was above 1 c higher than its climatological mean the unusually high temperature anomaly of the yscwm could trace back to the winter 2006 07 heat budget of the yellow sea deep water ysdw below 50 m depth indicated that vertical mixing rather than advection in the winter 2006 07 played a crucial role in the generation of the warm event with the seasonal thermocline disappearing in the winter 2006 07 a weak vertical mixing effect due to weak wind speeds and high heat content in the yellow sea upper water ysuw above the ysdw together with strong advection effect caused the ysdw to become quite warmer than its climatological mean after that the seasonal thermocline above the ysdw formed again and the warm ysdw persisted until the summer of 2007 resulting in the extreme warm event of the yscwm keywords temperature extreme warm event the yellow sea

taylor diagram is near 1 here the rstd was calculated by the equation r s t d s t d model s t d oisst s t d oisst and s t d model represent the standard deviations of the monthly oisst and model sst respectively these indicate that the model sst is in agreement with the oisst for the vertical temperature structure in the ys we used the field data in even months february april june august october and december from the world ocean database wod because only these months have more than 100 observation profiles 417 404 391 416 388 and 341 respectively seen from fig 2d i the average differences errors between the model temperatures and in situ observations are about 1 2 c larger standard deviations of errors occur in june august and october compared with those in february april and december this indicates that more uncertainties may appear in summer and autumn when the seasonal thermocline is present and strong in the ys considering the large range of temperature changes in the shallow ys these model errors are acceptable in this work the above validations demonstrate that the model temperatures are credible and good enough for this work fig 3 demonstrates that the model depth averaged currents are consistent with the maps of satellite remote sensing absolute dynamic topography adt provided by the copernicus climate change service c3s the kuroshio axis with the strongest currents in the model which locates in the edge of the east china sea matches well with the location of an adt band with steep cross band slope a northern branch of the kuroshio passes through the tsushima strait in both of summer and winter in the ys the currents along the chinese and korean coasts are mainly anticlockwise in summer however the currents are southward on both sides in winter at the same time a northward current exists in the central ys named the yellow sea warm current these current systems in the model are similar with historical survey results e g nitani 1972 kondo 1985 guan 1994 lie and cho 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 extreme warm event of the yscwm in the summer of 2007 the south boundary of the yscwm is at approximately 34 n weng et al 1988 yang et al 2014 so the study region in this paper was north of 34 n in the ys and we used the average temperature at the depth of 50 m as the temperature of the yscwm because the water at this depth is below seasonal thermocline park 1986 park et al 2011 zhang et al 2008 the simulated yscwm temperature in august was compared with in situ observation data fig 4 the observations shown in fig 4b came from korean oceanographic data center kodc dataset used by park et al 2011 the kodc dataset is bimonthly field data collected by national fisheries research development institute korean although there is some difference in values between the model results and the kodc data their interannual variations are similar both simulated and observed yscwm temperatures presented a peak above 12 c in 2007 about twice the standard deviation σ from the corresponding climatological mean value fig 4a and b fig 4c and d demonstrate that along two zonal sections at 34 n and 36 n in the ys the observed temperatures at 50 m depth in august 2007 were higher than those in other years except the two ends of the 36 n section so all of these data indicate that a remarkable warm event of the yscwm happened in 2007 the vertical structure of temperature in august 2007 at 36 n was examined compared with the corresponding climatological mean structure fig 5 fig 5e shows that temperature below the seasonal thermocline in august 2007 was about 1 2 c higher than its climatological mean while there was very small difference at the sea surface only about 0 3 c the seasonal thermocline in 2007 was obviously weaker than climatology due to higher temperature below the seasonal thermocline this can be confirmed by vertical temperature gradient in fig 5b and d although the vertical gradient of temperature in the climatological mean state is stronger than that in 2007 at the seasonal thermocline they are almost the same above the depth of 10 m from the results above an extreme warm event of the yscwm clearly happened in 2007 although both the sst and the vertical structure of temperature were close to climatology the warm water in the deep layer of the ys probably existed before the summer and weakened the seasonal thermocline to determine the starting time of the warm event the time series of area averaged monthly temperature anomaly at 50 m depth and volume averaged monthly temperature anomaly below 50 m was obtained fig 6 fig 6 demonstrates that the temperatures at 50 m depth and below 50 m varied synchronously during the period from january 2006 to august 2007 from january to november of 2006 the temperature of the yellow sea deep water ysdw the water below 50 m depth was lower than the corresponding climatological mean after that the temperature anomaly rose swiftly up to over 2 σ in february 2007 the high temperature anomaly lasted until august 2007 these suggest that the yscwm warm water was mainly formed in the winter 2006 07 3 2 heat budget of the ysdw a heat budget analysis of the water mass below 50 m depth in the study region was conducted to explore the reasons of the ysdw temperature anomaly increasing during the period from december 2006 to february 2007 using the output data of the model fig 7 shows the dominating dynamical processes which would change the ysdw temperature since the ysdw is surrounded by land except the south and upper boundaries heat exchanges for the ysdw only happen on these open boundaries by mixing and advection horizontal mixing is too weak to take into account according to gan and allen 2005 the temperature change balance equation in the model can be expressed as follows 1 t t r z k h t z d t t x u t y v t z w where t is the water temperature r represents the contributions of net surface heat flux consisting of shortwave radiation net longwave radiation sensible and latent heat fluxes k h is the vertical diffusivity coefficient d t represents horizontal mixing u v and w are eastward northward and upward current components respectively the right hand side terms of eq 1 from left to right represent the contributions of net sea surface heat flux vertical mixing horizontal mixing zonal advection meridional advection and vertical advection to the temperature change respectively since the ysdw is below 50 m net surface heat flux has no direct effect on the temperature change of the ysdw and can be omitted here the contribution of zonal advection is zero for the whole ysdw because its west and east boundaries are land sea bottom the magnitude of the horizontal mixing term is at least one order smaller than the other terms so it is not considered in the following analysis the results of monthly heat budget represented by temperature change namely temperature budget from 2006 to 2007 with the corresponding climatological mean are shown in fig 8a in terms of climatological mean the contribution of total advection vertical plus horizontal to the ysdw temperature change is slightly positive in most of the time and its variation is small fig 8a the net heat transport through the south boundary of the ysdw via horizontal advection is mostly balanced by the heat flux through the upper boundary via vertical advection figure omitted resulting in a weak effect of the total advection on the ysdw temperature the seasonal thermocline in the ys weakens in autumn september november disappears in winter forms in spring and strengthens in summer lan et al 1985 chu et al 1997 park and chu 2007 vertical mixing usually causes the ysdw temperature to decrease remarkably with the thermocline disappearing in winter due to negative losing heat mixing induced heat flux and increase slowly with the thermocline forming and strengthening in other seasons due to small positive absorbing heat heat flux as indicated in fig 8a compared with climatological mean values the advection had a larger positive contribution and the vertical mixing had a quite smaller negative contribution to the temperature change in the winter 2006 07 fig 8a both of them were not conducive to the ysdw temperature drop in the winter actually resulting in significant positive anomalies of the temperature change fig 8b the advection contributed 0 56 c 31 5 and the vertical mixing contributed 1 21 c 68 0 to the accumulated total net temperature anomaly of 1 78 c in the winter 2006 07 therefore heat fluxes induced by the advection and vertical mixing in the winter 2006 07 were responsible for the formation of the abnormally warm ysdw in 2007 according to the values of temperature change anomaly generated in the formation of the warm ysdw the vertical mixing played a more important role than the advection in the winter 2006 07 while it was reversed namely the advection contributed more than the mixing to the formation of the warm ysdw during the period from march to june 2007 fig 8b 3 3 causes of a much weaker vertical mixing effect in the winter 2006 07 according to the heat budget temperature budget of the ysdw vertical mixing at the upper boundary had a quite smaller negative contribution to the temperature change of the ysdw than its climatological mean in the winter 2006 07 which was crucial to the formation of the warm ysdw in other words the vertical mixing effect was much weaker than its climatological mean in the winter 2006 07 for the yellow sea upper water ysuw the water above the ysdw the vertical mixing at the lower boundary the boundary between ysdw and ysuw releases some heat of the ysdw into the ysuw via heat flux through their interface in winter when the ysuw temperature is very low and the ys is completely mixed in the vertical with the seasonal thermocline disappearing by contrast the vertical mixing induced heat flux is suppressed and negligible during other seasons when the ysuw temperature is high and the ys is well stratified with the seasonal thermocline forming this seasonal variation of heat flux by the vertical mixing is clear in fig 9a obviously the vertical mixing effect is closely related to the heat content or temperature of the ysuw and the strength of vertical mixing in winter the ysuw heat content is actually dominant in the vertical mixing effect since the ys is well mixed vertically fig 9a shows that the ysuw net or total heat budget has a prominent seasonal variation positive from march to august when the ysuw absorbs heat and negative from september to february when the ysuw loses heat the ysuw heat budget is mainly determined by sea surface heat flux vertical mixing induced heat flux and heat flux related to advection among these factors the sea surface heat flux is dominant and it has a similar seasonal change to the net heat budget fig 9a in the winter 2006 07 the surface heat flux was negative and its magnitude was smaller than the corresponding climatological mean fig 9a resulting in a large positive anomaly of 14 9 tw 1 tw 1012 w fig 9b although the heat flux related to advection had a small negative anomaly in december and january it totally had a small positive anomaly 1 6 tw in the entire winter contributing little to the net heat budget anomaly of 10 0 tw at the same time the heat flux by vertical mixing was reduced with a negative anomaly of 6 4 tw in the winter indicating less heat input into the ysuw from the ysdw this is consistent with the weaker vertical mixing effect as demonstrated in the temperature budget for the ysdw as the result of their combination the anomaly of the ysuw net heat budget was totally positive in the winter 2006 07 and the sea surface heat flux was the main driving factor fig 9c shows that the heat content anomaly of the ysuw rose quickly up to a large positive value over σ in october 2006 mainly caused by the sea surface heat flux with a large positive anomaly fig 9b this positive heat content anomaly was enlarged due to the positive heat budget in the winter 2006 07 and reached its peak in march 2007 compared with climatological means abnormally higher heat content means higher temperature in the ysuw which is not beneficial to the heat input from the ysdw to the ysuw by vertical mixing in the winter 2006 07 fig 10 shows the comparison of temperature profiles of the area averaged monthly ysuw from october 2006 to march 2007 with corresponding climatological mean profiles apparently the abnormal warm water transmitted downward from october to december 2006 with the seasonal thermocline fading and vertical mixing strengthening subsequently positive temperature anomalies relative to corresponding climatological means increased gradually from december 2006 to march 2007 given that the sea surface heat flux with negative values usually releases heat from ocean into atmosphere in winter as shown in fig 9a the smaller surface heat flux than its climatological mean with positive anomalies in the winter 2006 07 would keep more heat in the ysuw since the sea surface heat flux was the most important factor that induced the positive heat budget and heat content anomalies of the ysuw in the winter 2006 07 we checked its sources shortwave radiation net longwave radiation latent heat flux and sensible heat flux to further determine the reasons for the abnormally high heat content in the ysuw fig 11 shows the contributions of different sources to the monthly sea surface heat flux anomaly during the period from october 2006 to february 2007 when the heat content anomaly of the ysuw was abnormally positive fig 9c the accumulated surface heat flux anomalies related to shortwave radiation net longwave radiation latent heat flux and sensible heat flux were 28 6 w m2 21 7 w m2 52 4 w m2 and 54 7 w m2 respectively among the total accumulated surface heat flux anomaly of 114 0 w m2 obviously sensible heat flux contributed the most to the net surface heat flux anomaly during the period followed by latent heat flux and shortwave radiation the net downward minus upward longwave radiation with a negative accumulated anomaly was actually opposite to the net surface heat flux anomaly indicating that it acted to reduce the increase of heat content anomaly in the ysuw according to fairall et al 1996 and stewart 2008 the sensible heat flux depends on the difference between air temperature and water temperature at the sea surface and wind speed at 10 m above the sea surface the sensible heat flux is in direct proportion to the temperature difference and the wind speed given that the sea surface temperature is higher than air temperature in most months of a year fig 12a a positive anomaly of the temperature difference air temperature minus water temperature in a month means that the temperature difference is smaller than its climatological mean in magnitude fig 12b shows that during the period from october 2006 to february 2007 the accumulated temperature difference anomaly was positive meanwhile the accumulated wind speed anomaly was negative fig 12c indicating that the wind speeds were mostly weaker than the corresponding climatological mean these induced a smaller sensible heat flux since ocean water releases heat into atmosphere by sensible heat flux in the ysuw during the period the smaller sensible heat flux actually kept more heat in the ocean and then was partly responsible for the positive anomaly of the ysuw heat content additionally the contribution of latent heat flux is comparable with the sensible heat flux for the abnormal warm ysuw the latent heat flux is determined by difference δ q between air specific humidity at 10 m above the sea surface and that at the sea surface the former minus the latter and wind speed at 10 m above the sea surface fairall et al 1996 note a fact that the air specific humidity at 10 m above the ys is basically lower than the specific humidity at the sea surface so the latent heat flux is always negative sea water releasing heat into air therefore a negative wind speed anomaly and or a positive δ q anomaly would generate a positive latent heat flux anomaly fig 12d indicates that the δ q anomalies were negative from july 2006 to april 2007 consequently weak wind speeds with negative anomalies were responsible for positive latent heat flux anomalies in october 2006 and winter 2006 07 according to the results presented above wind speeds are crucial in the surface heat flux sensible and latent of the ys change of winds is determined by synoptic systems which can be described by the distribution of air pressure here we chose air pressure fields at the mean sea level msl from era5 reanalysis data in october 2006 and february 2007 to demonstrate the reason of weak winds because in these two months the winds were very weak with negative anomalies fig 12c corresponding to two peaks of surface heat flux anomalies fig 9b fig 13 shows that the southeastern part of a high pressure system the siberian high pressure covered the ys and its surrounding region compared with climatological mean states the pressure contours of the high pressure system basically shrunk northwestward with negative pressure anomalies in the two months indicating that the high pressure system was weaker the weaker siberian high pressure would cause the weaker east asian winter monsoon by reducing zonal pressure gradient resulting in weaker wind speeds in northeastern china miao et al 2020 seen from fig 13 the air pressure anomalies were negative and the spaces between air pressure contours with an interval of 4 hpa were generally larger in the two months than those of their climatological mean states above the ys and its surrounding region these suggest that air pressure gradient was reduced in october 2006 and february 2007 resulting in weak wind speeds additionally the weaker high pressure system with weaker northeast winds tended to bring less cold air to the ys reducing the difference between air temperature and water temperature at the sea surface this is consistent with the temperature differences and their corresponding anomalies for october 2006 and february 2007 shown in fig 12a and b therefore the much weaker vertical mixing effect in the winter 2006 07 was directly and dominantly caused by higher ysuw heat content with positive anomalies compared with corresponding climatological means the reduced sea surface heat flux together with the heat flux related to advection induced the higher heat content of the ysuw less sensible and latent heat fluxes as well as more shortwave radiation were responsible for the reduction of the sea surface heat flux weak winds and small air sea temperature difference made the sensible heat flux smaller than its climatological mean meanwhile the weak winds also decreased the latent heat flux the weak winds and the small air sea temperature difference were related to the weakness of the siberian high pressure and the air pressure gradient above the ys all these factors directly or indirectly caused the vertical mixing effect much weaker than its climatological mean in the winter 2006 07 contributing to the abnormally high positive temperature anomalies of the ysdw in the summer of 2007 3 4 the formation process of the extreme warm event of the yscwm since the heat flux induced by vertical mixing in the winter 2006 07 was crucial and dominant for the formation of the extreme warm event of the yscwm in the summer of 2007 its formation process was closely related to the generation of the unusual warm ysuw above the ysdw in the winter and the evolution of the seasonal thermocline based on the results presented in the above three subsections the formation process of the extreme warm event of the yscwm in the summer of 2007 could be divided into three stages at the first stage from october to november of 2006 the heat content anomaly of the ysuw increased from near zero to a high positive value over σ due to weak sea surface heat flux fig 9 fig 14 shows that the temperature in the upper layer had a positive anomaly over 1 c along the zonal section at 36 n during this period although the ysdw temperature anomaly seemed to be not affected by the ysuw with an abnormally high heat content anomaly at this stage fig 6 because of the existence of the seasonal thermocline it prepared a beneficial initial state with a higher heat content than its climatological mean in the ysuw for the second stage at the second stage from december 2006 to february 2007 when the seasonal thermocline disappeared a much weaker vertical mixing effect at the interface between the ysdw and the ysuw together with a stronger advection effect fig 8 caused the ysdw to become quite warmer figs 6 and 14 compared with the corresponding climatological means weak wind speeds fig 12c and high heat content in the ysuw with a positive anomaly further enlarged by weak sea surface heat flux fig 9 were responsible for the weak vertical mixing effect during this period at the third stage from march to august 2007 the abnormally warm ysdw lasted until august 2007 with the seasonal thermocline forming and strengthening fig 6 finally resulting in the extreme warm event of the yscwm in the summer of 2007 fig 14 during this period the vertical mixing had little effect on the warm ysdw except that it had a negative effect in march by contrast the advection had a positive effect except that it had a negative effect in august fig 8 nonetheless these slightly enhanced the abnormally high temperature anomaly of the ysdw figs 6 and 14 4 summary an extreme warm event of the yscwm below the seasonal thermocline in the summer of 2007 was captured by both of modelingresults and in situ measurements the temperature of the yscwm in august 2007 was abnormally higher over 1 c than the corresponding climatological mean value so called an extreme warm event however the sst in the same month had no significant difference from its climatological mean in the ys fig 5e the time series of both area averaged monthly temperature anomaly at 50 m depth and volume averaged monthly temperature anomaly below 50 m indicate that the warm event started in the winter 2006 07 the heat budget of the ysdw revealed that vertical mixing had remarkable influence on the ysdw temperature change especially in winter because contributions of vertical advection and horizontal advection almost canceled each other out and they had a little net effect on the ysdw temperature change the advection net effect was slightly larger than the corresponding climatological mean in the winter 2006 07 in fact the contribution of vertical mixing in the winter 2006 07 was the crucial factor that induced the warm event of the yscwm in the summer of 2007 the vertical mixing caused a much smaller negative temperature change than its climatological mean in the winter resulting in an obvious positive temperature anomaly for the ysdw the positive temperature anomaly of the ysdw continued to be present until the summer of 2007 while the contributions of the factors mentioned above in the heat budget were all close to their climatological mean after march 2007 the extreme warm event of the yscwm formed via three stages at the first stage more heat content was kept in the ysuw due to weaker sea surface heat flux during the period from october to november 2006 compared with the corresponding climatological means at the second stage with the seasonal thermocline disappearing weak wind speeds and high heat content in the ysuw resulted in a weak vertical mixing effect in the winter 2006 07 the weak vertical mixing effect together with strong advection effect caused the ysdw to become quite warmer than its climatological mean at the third stage the seasonal thermocline above the ysdw formed again after february 2007 and the warm ysdw persisted until the summer of 2007 resulting in an extreme warm event of the yscwm declaration of competing interest the authors

23834,a high resolution numerical model based on the regional ocean modeling system roms was used to simulate the yellow sea cold water mass yscwm and revealed an extreme warm event of the yscwm in the summer of 2007 this event was also captured by in situ observations in august 2007 the average temperature of the yscwm was above 1 c higher than its climatological mean the unusually high temperature anomaly of the yscwm could trace back to the winter 2006 07 heat budget of the yellow sea deep water ysdw below 50 m depth indicated that vertical mixing rather than advection in the winter 2006 07 played a crucial role in the generation of the warm event with the seasonal thermocline disappearing in the winter 2006 07 a weak vertical mixing effect due to weak wind speeds and high heat content in the yellow sea upper water ysuw above the ysdw together with strong advection effect caused the ysdw to become quite warmer than its climatological mean after that the seasonal thermocline above the ysdw formed again and the warm ysdw persisted until the summer of 2007 resulting in the extreme warm event of the yscwm keywords temperature extreme warm event the yellow sea

production and abundant species teng et al 2005 in summer june august the sea surface temperature sst of the ys rises rapidly with intense sunlight radiation a cold water mass below the seasonal thermocline so called the yellow sea cold water mass yscwm occupies approximate 30 of the volume of the ys su and weng 1994 the horizontal boundary of the yscwm was determined by tidal mixing in the ys namely that the yscwm is surrounded by shallow areas with strong tidal mixing lee and beardsley 1999 zhao 1986 the yscwm with high salinity and low temperature is one of the most prominent physical phenomena in the ys uda 1934 first found the yscwm in 1930s and he et al 1959 demonstrated that the northern yscwm in summer is the remnant water formed locally in the previous winter december february then the formation mechanism of the yscwm has been studied for decades low air temperature and strong vertical mixing in winter play an important role in the formation of the yscwm guan 1963 hur et al 1999 sun 1980 weng et al 1988 the sea temperature of the ys and the air temperature above the sea in winter would influence the temperature of the yscwm in the following summer jiang et al 2007 park et al 2011 weng et al 1988 yang et al 2014 zhang and he 1981 applied a regression algorithm to successfully predict the lowest temperature and area of the northern yscwm in spring march may based on the ys water temperature observations in the preceding winter strong stratification in spring and summer is the primary factor to maintain the yscwm hu and wang 2004 ren and zhan 2005 yu et al 2006 in summertime surface radiation can affect the depth of seasonal thermocline and so can vertical currents including upwelling associated with wind curl hu and wang 2004 some studies have been conducted on the interannual or seasonal variations of the yscwm li 1991 suggested that the temperature of the yscwm is higher in the next year to the occurrence of a kuroshio meander but it is lower during an el niño event however bai et al 2004 reported that el niño events can affect the thermocline in the ys but they have no influence on the interannual variation of the yscwm temperature moon et al 2009 and wang et al 2014 revealed the seasonal migration of the yscwm so far the yscwm was investigated extensively but studies on its abnormal temperature events were still few yang et al 1984 found that strong predominant northwest wind and unusually low air temperature above the ys in the winter 1980 81 decreased the sst resulting in an abnormal low temperature phenomenon of the yscwm in the summer of 1981 li et al 2022 found from daily sst data that an abnormally warm water event referred to as an intense marine heatwave mhw occurred in the ys in august 2016 this sea surface warm event was directly caused by higher solar radiation and much weaker wind speeds than normal conditions gao et al 2020 also found that the south ys experienced mhws in the surface layer 0 20 m during three consecutive summers from 2016 to 2018 due to abnormal shortwave radiation and ocean advection reduced surface wind speeds the abnormal variations of ocean temperature may destroy the local ecosystem and breeding bases wernberg et al 2013 smale and wernberg 2013 anomalous warming in the sea upper layer can reduce zooplankton abundance and induce phytoplankton blooms cai et al 2016 gao et al 2020 figuring out the causes of extreme temperature events of the yscwm is beneficial to improve aquaculture and understand the activity of wildlife species in the ys in this paper an extreme warm event of the yscwm was found in 2007 an ocean model was used to demonstrate the causes of the warm event and the dynamics therein 2 model configuration and validation the ocean model used in this study was based on the regional ocean modeling system roms which is a widely used three dimensional model shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2003 2005 zhou et al 2015 the model domain 117 5 e 132 e 23 5 n 41

to 2015 for model validation model results were linearly interpolated to the locations and times of observations before comparing them given that the former have a higher spatial resolution than the latter fig 2 shows the results of model validation in the ys the differences between area averaged monthly model sst and microwave and infrared mw ir optimally interpolated sst oisst reynolds et al 2002 are small fig 2a although the model sst is slightly higher than the oisst in summer the seasonal and interannual variations of model sst are very close to the oisst taylor diagram fig 2b demonstrates the correlation between monthly model sst and oisst is high and significant at the level of 99 and the mean absolute error mae is low 1 12 c the relative standard deviation rstd in the taylor diagram is near 1 here the rstd was calculated by the equation r s t d s t d model s t d oisst s t d oisst and s t d model represent the standard deviations of the monthly oisst and model sst respectively these indicate that the model sst is in agreement with the oisst for the vertical temperature structure in the ys we used the field data in even months february april june august october and december from the world ocean database wod because only these months have more than 100 observation profiles 417 404 391 416 388 and 341 respectively seen from fig 2d i the average differences errors between the model temperatures and in situ observations are about 1 2 c larger standard deviations of errors occur in june august and october compared with those in february april and december this indicates that more uncertainties may appear in summer and autumn when the seasonal thermocline is present and strong in the ys considering the large range of temperature changes in the shallow ys these model errors are acceptable in this work the above validations demonstrate that the model temperatures are credible and good enough for this work fig 3 demonstrates that the model depth

currents in the model which locates in the edge of the east china sea matches well with the location of an adt band with steep cross band slope a northern branch of the kuroshio passes through the tsushima strait in both of summer and winter in the ys the currents along the chinese and korean coasts are mainly anticlockwise in summer however the currents are southward on both sides in winter at the same time a northward current exists in the central ys named the yellow sea warm current these current systems in the model are similar with historical survey results e g nitani 1972 kondo 1985 guan 1994 lie and cho 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 extreme warm event of the yscwm in the summer of 2007 the south boundary of the yscwm is at approximately 34 n weng et al 1988 yang et al 2014 so the study region in this paper was north of 34 n in the ys and we used the average temperature at the depth of 50 m as the temperature of the yscwm because the water at this depth is below seasonal thermocline park 1986 park et al 2011 zhang et al 2008 the simulated yscwm temperature in august was compared with in situ observation data fig 4 the observations shown in fig 4b came from korean oceanographic data center kodc dataset used by park et al 2011 the kodc dataset is bimonthly field data collected by national fisheries research development institute korean although there is some difference in values between the model results and the kodc data their interannual variations are similar both simulated and observed yscwm temperatures presented a peak above 12 c in 2007 about twice the standard deviation σ from the corresponding climatological mean value fig 4a and b fig 4c and d demonstrate that along two zonal sections at 34 n and 36 n in the ys the observed temperatures at 50 m depth in august 2007 were higher than those in other years except the two ends of the 36 n section so all of these data indicate that a remarkable warm event of the yscwm happened in 2007 the vertical structure of temperature in august 2007 at 36 n was examined compared with the corresponding climatological mean structure fig 5 fig 5e shows that temperature below the seasonal thermocline in august 2007 was about 1 2 c higher than its climatological mean while there was very small difference at the sea surface only about 0 3 c the seasonal thermocline in 2007 was obviously weaker than climatology due to higher temperature below the seasonal thermocline this can be confirmed by vertical temperature gradient in fig 5b and d although the vertical gradient of temperature in the climatological mean state is stronger than that in 2007 at the seasonal thermocline they are almost the same above the depth of 10 m from the results above an extreme warm event of the yscwm clearly happened in 2007 although both the sst and the vertical structure of temperature were close to climatology the warm water in the deep layer of the ys probably existed before the summer and weakened the seasonal thermocline to determine the starting time of the warm event the time series of area averaged monthly temperature anomaly at 50 m depth and volume averaged monthly temperature anomaly below 50 m was obtained fig 6 fig 6 demonstrates that the temperatures at 50 m depth and below 50 m varied synchronously during the period from january 2006 to august 2007 from january to november of 2006 the temperature of the yellow sea deep water ysdw the water below 50 m depth was lower than the corresponding climatological mean after that the temperature anomaly rose swiftly up to over 2 σ in february 2007 the high temperature anomaly lasted until august 2007 these suggest that the yscwm warm water was mainly formed in the winter 2006 07 3 2 heat budget of the ysdw a heat budget analysis of the water mass below 50 m depth in the study region was conducted to explore the reasons of the ysdw temperature anomaly increasing during the period from december 2006 to february 2007 using the output data of the model fig 7 shows the dominating dynamical processes which would change the ysdw temperature since the ysdw is surrounded by land except the south and upper boundaries heat exchanges for the ysdw only happen on these open boundaries by mixing and advection horizontal mixing is too weak to take into account according to gan and allen 2005 the temperature change balance equation in the model can be expressed as follows 1 t t r z k h t z d t t x u t y v t z w where t is the water temperature r represents the contributions of net surface heat flux consisting of shortwave radiation net longwave radiation sensible and latent heat fluxes k h is the vertical diffusivity coefficient d t represents horizontal mixing u v and w are eastward northward and upward current components respectively the right hand side terms of eq 1 from left to right represent the contributions of net sea surface heat flux vertical mixing horizontal mixing zonal advection meridional advection and vertical advection to the temperature change respectively since the ysdw is below 50 m net surface heat flux has no direct effect on the temperature change of the ysdw and can be omitted here the contribution of zonal advection is zero for the whole ysdw because its west and east boundaries are land sea bottom the magnitude of the horizontal mixing term is at least one order smaller than the other terms so it is not considered in the following analysis the results of monthly heat budget represented by temperature change namely temperature budget from 2006 to 2007 with the corresponding climatological mean are shown in fig 8a in terms of climatological mean the contribution of total advection vertical plus horizontal to the ysdw temperature change is slightly positive in most of the time and its variation is small fig 8a the net heat transport through the south boundary of the ysdw via horizontal advection is mostly balanced by the heat flux through the upper boundary via vertical advection figure omitted resulting in a weak effect of the total advection on the ysdw temperature the seasonal thermocline in the ys weakens in autumn september november disappears in winter forms in spring and strengthens in summer lan et al 1985 chu et al 1997 park and chu 2007 vertical mixing usually causes the ysdw temperature to decrease remarkably with the thermocline disappearing in winter due to negative losing heat mixing induced heat flux and increase slowly with the thermocline forming and strengthening in other seasons due to small positive absorbing heat heat flux as indicated in fig 8a compared with climatological mean values the advection had a larger positive contribution and the vertical mixing had a quite smaller negative contribution to the temperature change in the winter 2006 07 fig 8a both of them were not conducive to the ysdw temperature drop in the winter actually resulting in significant positive anomalies of the temperature change fig 8b the advection contributed 0 56 c 31 5 and the vertical mixing contributed 1 21 c 68 0 to the accumulated total net temperature anomaly of 1 78 c in the winter 2006 07 therefore heat fluxes induced by the advection and vertical mixing in the winter 2006 07 were responsible for the formation of the abnormally warm ysdw in 2007 according to the values of temperature change anomaly generated in the formation of the warm ysdw the vertical mixing played a more important role than the advection in the winter 2006 07 while it was reversed namely the advection contributed more than the mixing to the formation of the warm ysdw during the period from march to june 2007 fig 8b 3 3 causes of a much weaker vertical mixing effect in the winter 2006 07 according to the heat budget temperature budget of the ysdw vertical mixing at the upper boundary had a quite smaller negative contribution to the temperature change of the ysdw than its climatological mean in the winter 2006 07 which was crucial to the formation of the warm ysdw in other words the vertical mixing effect was much weaker than its climatological mean in the winter 2006 07 for the yellow sea upper water ysuw the water above the ysdw the vertical mixing at the lower boundary the boundary between ysdw and ysuw releases some heat of the ysdw into the ysuw via heat flux through their interface in winter when the ysuw temperature is very low and the ys is completely mixed in the vertical with the seasonal thermocline disappearing by contrast the vertical mixing induced heat flux is suppressed and negligible during other seasons when the ysuw temperature is high and the ys is well stratified with the seasonal thermocline forming this seasonal variation of heat flux by the vertical mixing is clear in fig 9a obviously the vertical mixing effect is closely related to the heat content or temperature of the ysuw and the strength of vertical mixing in winter the ysuw heat content is actually dominant in the vertical mixing effect since the ys is well mixed vertically fig 9a shows that the ysuw net or total heat budget has a prominent seasonal variation positive from march to august when the ysuw absorbs heat and negative from september to february when the ysuw loses heat the ysuw heat budget is mainly determined by sea surface heat flux vertical mixing induced heat flux and heat flux related to advection among these factors the sea surface heat flux is dominant and it has a similar seasonal change to the net heat budget fig 9a in the winter 2006 07 the surface heat flux was negative and its magnitude was smaller than the corresponding climatological mean fig 9a resulting in a large positive anomaly of 14 9 tw 1 tw 1012 w fig 9b although the heat flux related to advection had a small negative anomaly in december and january it totally had a small positive anomaly 1 6 tw in the entire winter contributing little to the net heat budget anomaly of 10 0 tw at the same time the heat flux by vertical mixing was reduced with a negative anomaly of 6 4 tw in the winter indicating less heat input into the ysuw from the ysdw this is consistent with the weaker vertical mixing effect as demonstrated in the temperature budget for the ysdw as the result of their combination the anomaly of the ysuw net heat budget was totally positive in the winter 2006 07 and the sea surface heat flux was the main driving factor fig 9c shows that the heat content anomaly of the ysuw rose quickly up to a large positive value over σ in october 2006 mainly caused by the sea surface heat flux with a large positive anomaly fig 9b this positive heat content anomaly was enlarged due to the positive heat budget in the winter 2006 07 and reached its peak in march 2007 compared with climatological means abnormally higher heat content means higher temperature in the ysuw which is not beneficial to the heat input from the ysdw to the ysuw by vertical mixing in the winter 2006 07 fig 10 shows the comparison of temperature profiles of the area averaged monthly ysuw from october 2006 to march 2007 with corresponding climatological mean profiles apparently the abnormal warm water transmitted downward from october to december 2006 with the seasonal thermocline fading and vertical mixing strengthening subsequently positive temperature anomalies relative to corresponding climatological means increased gradually from december 2006 to march 2007 given that the sea surface heat flux with negative values usually releases heat from ocean into atmosphere in winter as shown in fig 9a the smaller surface heat flux than its climatological mean with positive anomalies in the winter 2006 07 would keep more heat in the ysuw since the sea surface heat flux was the most important factor that induced the positive heat budget and heat content anomalies of the ysuw in the winter 2006 07 we checked its sources shortwave radiation net longwave radiation latent heat flux and sensible heat flux to further determine the reasons for the abnormally high heat content in the ysuw fig 11 shows the contributions of different sources to the monthly sea surface heat flux anomaly during the period from october 2006 to february 2007 when the heat content anomaly of the ysuw was abnormally positive fig 9c the accumulated surface heat flux anomalies related to shortwave radiation net longwave radiation latent heat flux and sensible heat flux were 28 6 w m2 21 7 w m2 52 4 w m2 and 54 7 w m2 respectively among the total accumulated surface heat flux anomaly of 114 0 w m2 obviously sensible heat flux contributed the most to the net surface heat flux anomaly during the period followed by latent heat flux and shortwave radiation the net downward minus upward longwave radiation with a negative accumulated anomaly was actually opposite to the net surface heat flux anomaly indicating that it acted to reduce the increase of heat content anomaly in the ysuw according to fairall et al 1996 and stewart 2008 the sensible heat flux depends on the difference between air temperature and water temperature at the sea surface and wind speed at 10 m above the sea surface the sensible heat flux is in direct proportion to the temperature difference and the wind speed given that the sea surface temperature is higher than air temperature in most months of a year fig 12a a positive anomaly of the temperature difference air temperature minus water temperature in a month means that the temperature difference is smaller than its climatological mean in magnitude fig 12b shows that during the period from october 2006 to february 2007 the accumulated temperature difference anomaly was positive meanwhile the accumulated wind speed anomaly was negative fig 12c indicating that the wind speeds were mostly weaker than the corresponding climatological mean these induced a smaller sensible heat flux since ocean water releases heat into atmosphere by sensible heat flux in the ysuw during the period the smaller sensible heat flux actually kept more heat in the ocean and then was partly responsible for the positive anomaly of the ysuw heat content additionally the contribution of latent heat flux is comparable with the sensible heat flux for the abnormal warm ysuw the latent heat flux is determined by difference δ q between air specific humidity at 10 m above the sea surface and that at the sea surface the former minus the latter and wind speed at 10 m above the sea surface fairall et al 1996 note a fact that the air specific humidity at 10 m above the ys is basically lower than the specific humidity at the sea surface so the latent heat flux is always negative sea water releasing heat into air therefore a negative wind speed anomaly and or a positive δ q anomaly would generate a positive latent heat flux anomaly fig 12d indicates that the δ q anomalies were negative from july 2006 to april 2007 consequently weak wind speeds with negative anomalies were responsible for positive latent heat flux anomalies in october 2006 and winter 2006 07 according to the results presented above wind speeds are crucial in the surface heat flux sensible and latent of the ys change of winds is determined by synoptic systems which can be described by the distribution of air pressure here we chose air pressure fields at the mean sea level msl from era5 reanalysis data in october 2006 and february 2007 to demonstrate the reason of weak winds because in these two months the winds were very weak with negative anomalies fig 12c corresponding to two peaks of surface heat flux anomalies fig 9b fig 13 shows that the southeastern part of a high pressure system the siberian high pressure covered the ys and its surrounding region compared with climatological mean states the pressure contours of the high pressure system basically shrunk northwestward with negative pressure anomalies in the two months indicating that the high pressure system was weaker the weaker siberian high pressure would cause the weaker east asian winter monsoon by reducing zonal pressure gradient resulting in weaker wind speeds in northeastern china miao et al 2020 seen from fig 13 the air pressure anomalies were negative and the spaces between air pressure contours with an interval of 4 hpa were generally larger in the two months than those of their climatological mean states above the ys and its surrounding region these suggest that air pressure gradient was reduced in october 2006 and february 2007 resulting in weak wind speeds additionally the weaker high pressure system with weaker northeast winds tended to bring less cold air to the ys reducing the difference between air temperature and water temperature at the sea surface this is consistent with the temperature differences and their corresponding anomalies for october 2006 and february 2007 shown in fig 12a and b therefore the much weaker vertical mixing effect in the winter 2006 07 was directly and dominantly caused by higher ysuw heat content with positive anomalies compared with corresponding climatological means the reduced sea surface heat flux together with the heat flux related to advection induced the higher heat content of the ysuw less sensible and latent heat fluxes as well as more shortwave radiation were responsible for the reduction of the sea surface heat flux weak winds and small air sea temperature difference made the sensible heat flux smaller than its climatological mean meanwhile the weak winds also decreased the latent heat flux the weak winds and the small air sea temperature difference were related to the weakness of the siberian high pressure and the air pressure gradient above the ys all these factors directly or indirectly caused the vertical mixing effect much weaker than its climatological mean in the winter 2006 07 contributing to the abnormally high positive temperature anomalies of the ysdw in the summer of 2007 3 4 the formation process of the extreme warm event of the yscwm since the heat flux induced by vertical mixing in the winter 2006 07 was crucial and dominant for the formation of the extreme warm event of the yscwm in the summer of 2007 its formation process was closely related to the generation of the unusual warm ysuw above the ysdw in the winter and the evolution of the seasonal thermocline based on the results presented in the above three subsections the formation process of the extreme warm event of the yscwm in the summer of 2007 could be divided into three stages at the first stage from october to november of 2006 the heat content anomaly of the ysuw increased from near zero to a high positive value over σ due to weak sea surface heat flux fig 9 fig 14 shows that the temperature in the upper layer had a positive anomaly over 1 c along the zonal section at 36 n during this period although the ysdw temperature anomaly seemed to be not affected by the ysuw with an abnormally high heat content anomaly at this stage fig 6 because of the existence of the seasonal thermocline it prepared a beneficial initial state with a higher heat content than its climatological mean in the ysuw for the second stage at the second stage from december 2006 to february 2007 when the seasonal thermocline disappeared a much weaker vertical mixing effect at the interface between the ysdw and the ysuw together with a stronger advection effect fig 8 caused the ysdw to become quite warmer figs 6 and 14 compared with the corresponding climatological means weak wind speeds fig 12c and high heat content in the ysuw with a positive anomaly further enlarged by weak sea surface heat flux fig 9 were responsible for the weak vertical mixing effect during this period at the third stage from march to august 2007 the abnormally warm ysdw lasted until august 2007 with the seasonal thermocline forming and strengthening fig 6 finally resulting in the extreme warm event of the yscwm in the summer of 2007 fig 14 during this period the vertical mixing had little effect on the warm ysdw except that it had a negative effect in march by contrast the advection had a positive effect except that it had a negative effect in august fig 8 nonetheless these slightly enhanced the abnormally high temperature anomaly of the ysdw figs 6 and 14 4 summary an extreme warm event of the yscwm below the seasonal thermocline in the summer of 2007 was captured by both of modelingresults and in situ measurements the temperature of the yscwm in august 2007 was abnormally higher over 1 c than the corresponding climatological mean value so called an extreme warm event however the sst in the same month had no significant difference from its climatological mean in the ys fig 5e the time series of both area averaged monthly temperature anomaly at 50 m depth and volume averaged monthly temperature anomaly below 50 m indicate that the warm event started in the winter 2006 07 the heat budget of the ysdw revealed that vertical mixing had remarkable influence on the ysdw temperature change especially in winter because contributions of vertical advection and horizontal advection almost canceled each other out and they had a little net effect on the ysdw temperature change the advection net effect was slightly larger than the corresponding climatological mean in the winter 2006 07 in fact the contribution of vertical mixing in the winter 2006 07 was the crucial factor that induced the warm event of the yscwm in the summer of 2007 the vertical mixing caused a much smaller negative temperature change than its climatological mean in the winter resulting in an obvious positive temperature anomaly for the ysdw the positive temperature anomaly of the ysdw continued to be present until the summer of 2007 while the contributions of the factors mentioned above in the heat budget were all close to their climatological mean after march 2007 the extreme warm event of the yscwm formed via three stages at the first stage more heat content was kept in the ysuw due to weaker sea surface heat flux during the period from october to november 2006 compared with the corresponding climatological means at the second stage with the seasonal thermocline disappearing weak wind speeds and high heat content in the ysuw resulted in a weak vertical mixing effect in the winter 2006 07 the weak vertical mixing effect together with strong advection effect caused the ysdw to become quite warmer than its climatological mean at the third stage the seasonal thermocline above the ysdw formed again after february 2007 and the warm ysdw persisted until the summer of 2007 resulting in an extreme warm event of the yscwm declaration of competing interest the authors
