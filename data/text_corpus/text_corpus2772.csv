13860,in developing countries the continuous need to increase meat production for the growing population has resulted in upsurge in the number of abattoirs or slaughterhouses within their major cities most of these abattoirs release huge amount of wastewater to the environment with little or no concern for resultant health effects in this study anaerobic digestion for biological treatment of abattoir waste in a batch reactor system was investigated correlation parameters that relate average gas production rate and working volume of digester were also developed abattoir wastewater was anaerobically digested for 30 d during the period the ph temperature chemical oxygen demand cod total solid ts and total volatile solid tvs were determined every 24 h in 30 d 30 9 l of biogas was produced with average daily yield of 1 03 l a total of 84 1 of cod 83 of tvs and 77 of ts were removed after the digestion period these parameters were used to develop correlations between the average gas production rate and working volume of digester based on reduced cod tvs and ts and this was found to be in good agreement with the obtained experimental results keywords abattoir wastes anaerobic digestion biogas characterization correlation energy recovery 1 introduction many developing countries are facing enormous environmental problems associated with generation of large volume of organic wastes from industries agriculture and households 1 in nigeria for instance the ever growing need to increase meat production to meet the demand of growing population has resulted in the increased number abattoirs or slaughterhouses springing up in major cities in the process enormous quantities of waste materials including organic and inorganic solids are generated abattoir wastes are characterized by high degree of pollution in terms of organic content 2 3 they consist mainly of bones undigested ingest and occasionally aborted fetuses solid waste while the liquid wastes comprise blood urine water dissolved solids and gut contents 4 studies have also shown that poor abattoir waste disposal are responsible for the pollution of surface and underground waters as well as air quality which indirectly affect the health of residents living within the vicinity of abattoirs 5 7 pollution arising from the disposal of abattoir waste effluents causes severely large organic pollution loads in receiving water bodies this is in terms of amounts of dissolved and suspended materials thus treatment of the effluent is of a necessity in order to protect environment on one hand and for saving water consumption on the other it is therefore important to note that conversion of these wastes to harmless and useful products can provide answer to urban pollution as well as enhancing wastes to energy process anaerobic digestion involves the use of biological processes in the absence of oxygen to break down organic matter converting it to methane and carbon dioxide gases biogas anaerobic digestion does not only contribute to reducing the volume of waste and costs of waste disposal but also provides sanitation by reducing the pathogenic content of substrate materials 8 anaerobic digestion has been adjudged as a suitable technological approach of converting degradable matter to biogas 9 12 several wastes energy crops and agricultural biomass have been treated via anaerobic digestion for the purpose of combating environmental pollution 6 13 15 biogas production especially from abattoir wastes is a valuable method of treating these wastes thereby reducing their harmful bacteria and parasitic content before they are burnt off or released into streams 16 several studies on anaerobic digestion of various wastes for biogas production have been reported 6 10 12 15 17 22 also while few previous studies have been focused on the development of mathematical equations to evaluate the rate of production of biogas and the volume of biogas reactor for continuous process 23 24 related studies on batch process only focused on the development of mathematical equations for low working volume using two parameters 25 however dearth of information on the use of abattoir wastes for biogas production and scarce information on the significance of the biological treatment of the wastes after anaerobic digestion as well as rare information on the correlation between rate of production of biogas and small and large working volumes of digester triggered this study it is conceived that utilization of abattoir waste for biogas production will not only enhance energy generation but also reduce its direct discharge to nearby streams as well as its indifferent abandonment to pollute the environment therefore apart from the assessment of the treatment of abattoir wastes using anaerobic digestion process this study also aimed at developing biogas production parameters and correlations in order to evaluate average gas production rate for both small and large working volumes of a batch reactor system 2 materials and methods 2 1 collection of materials the material employed in this study was abattoir wastewater collected from a commercial abattoir and was rid of impurities such as stones pebbles and other materials after which it was refrigerated at 4 c prior to use fresh rumen contents and cow dung of adequate microbial floral needed for anaerobic digestion to take place were also added to the substrate to act as inoculum using the same digester the experiment was performed six times with different initial conditions of ph total solid ts volatile solid vs and soluble chemical oxygen demand scod the wastewater and inoculum rumen content and cow dung were also characterized before mixing in order to ascertain their initial conditions 2 2 bio methane potential test in order to determine the quantity of methane that abattoir waste can potentially produce under anaerobic condition at standardized temperature and pressure bio methane potential test was carried out according to standard methods 26 the 160 day batch anaerobic experiment was performed in triplicate under controlled and reproducible conditions in a 1000 ml fermentation glass bottles serum bottle the bottles were flushed with n2 co2 80 20 mixture to keep the ph at neutrality at the beginning of the expriment 27 the bottles were partially filled with the substrate and tap water was added up to 500 ml total volume small amounts of na2co3 powder were also added to prevent a critical drop in ph each bottle was sealed with a 5 mm thick silicone disc that was held tightly to the bottle head by a plastic screw cap punched in the middle all the bottles were shaken for 30 min at 80 rpm half of their heights the amount of biogas produced was measured by manometric method 28 using eq 1 1 n g δ p v g r t where vg is the volume of the prefermenter headspace δp is the pressure variation r is the gas constant 8 3145 lkpa mol k and t is the absolute temperature k biogas generated was continuously collected from the digesters and the ch4 content were determined using gas chromatography 2 3 the digester and preparation of the substrate automated anaerobic digester edibon pdanc 0007 144 was used for this work the digester comprises two glass reactor vessels which were air tight with loading opening sample withdrawal outlet and an automated agitation mechanism water tank and water collector were attached to the back of the digester biogas produced entered the water tank through one of the tubes from the digester and discharged equal volume of water to the water collector 2 4 characteristics of abattoir waste prior to digestion there is need for proper characterization of materials meant for digestion in order to understand their inherent properties 29 30 characterization was carried out on the substrate before and after digestion according to standard methods 31 elemental analysis before and after digestion were carried out following the procedures described by 10 12 prior to analyses each sample was centrifuged in order to separate the liquid and the solid parts while the latter was used for all analyses save for the ph ts and vs a pg 990 atomic absorption spectrophotometer wibtoft lutherworth united kingdom was employed to analyze chemical parameters table 1 in triplicates as earlier described 10 12 for cod determination the method of the american public health association 31 was employed while the method of the finnish standard association 1990 i e sfs 3008 protocol was used to determine the concentrations of ts and vs to evaluate the performance of the digester daily analysis of the digesting substrate for cod vs ph ts and temperature were carried out association of official analytical chemists 32 ph and temperature were measured using handheld ph meter and thermometer respectively moisture ash crude fibre nitrogen carbon and crude protein contents were carried out before and after digestion at animal science laboratory obafemi awolowo university ile ife following standard procedures 32 and as subsequently employed by nwosu et al 33 for ash contents determination 2 g of sample slurry was weighed into a crucible the weight of the empty crucible was noted before adding the sample it was then transferred into a muffler furnace and heated at 600 c for 3 h it was removed and cooled in a desiccator and its final weight taken the required percentage ash content vs and carbon contents were calculated as described by aoac 32 for nitrogen and crude protein contents 20 ml of the sample was weighed into the kjeldahl digestion flask followed by addition of a little scoop of digestion catalyst mixture this consists of anhydrous cuso4 blue 50 g na2so4 500 g mercury oxide hg2o 0 5 g then 20 ml of h2so4 98 was dded and transferred the flask to the kjeldahl digestion system tecator digestion system 1007 digester and heated the mixture for 2 h this was then cooled and made the volume up to 50 ml mark with distilled water for the titration the distillate was titrated with standard hcl until the end point was reached i e when there is a clear fluid colour change percentage nitrogen was calculated based on the concentration of the acid titre value and dilution factor aoac 32 2 5 measurement of biogas production the prepared slurry of the substrate was loaded into the digester and allowed to occupy 75 of the reactor space so that there is space above the slurry for gas build up the digester was operated under a mesophilic condition as a batch process for a digestion period of 30 d during which the volume of biogas produced was recorded at interval by water displacement method the volume of water displaced is equivalent to the volume of gas produced 15 34 35 46 samples of digesting slurries were withdrawn from an outlet tightly sealed at interval from the beginning to the end of the anaerobic digestion period for analysis for cod tvs and ts while ph and temperature measurements were taken and recorded on daily basis the experiment was performed six times with different initial conditions the average of all the measurements are reported 2 6 calculation of gas parameters and development of correlations biogas parameters were calculated based on the method proposed by anozie and adeboye 25 the method utilized the experimental data of cod tvs or ts the biogas produced in units of volume per weight of cod reduced per day units volume per weight of reduced tvs per day as well as units volume per weight of reduced ts per day were estimated using the following equations respectively 2 b i o g a s p r o d u c e d p e r c o d r e d u c e d p e r d a y l m g b i o g a s p r o d u c t i o n i n t e r v a l l s i n s o u t m g l x w

influent and effluent cod yin and yout are influent and effluent tvs and zin and zout are influent and effluent ts correlation between the working volume of the reactor and the gas production rate was

for the biogas production x dimensionless constant coefficient y and z constant coefficients with units l and l 1 respectively the term 1 x y v zv is the correlation factor and it makes equation exact the value of z is expected to be small such that at small working volume it has a negligible contribution to the correlation term hence makes equation linear however as working volume becomes large value of z makes a considerable contribution to the correlation term and therefore the equation becomes quadractic therefore eq 5 takes care of both small and large working digester volumes 3 results and discussion 3 1 bio methane potential test bmp as shown in fig 1 the bmp curve shows a steady increase in the pressure built up in the bottle filled with the substrate and the inoculum from the 6th day prior to this period is a lag phase during which the microorganisms acclimatize themselves to the environment from the 6th day however there is a continuous increase in the pressure until 50th day except sudden rise experienced on the 29th day the period between 50th and 60th day corresponds to a stationary phase in microbial cell growth in this period the pressure in the bottles is almost stationary which may have been due to rapid utilization of the substrate and the accumulation of products 36 meanwhile a decrease in pressure observed after 154th indicates that the death phase has set in as a result of decline in the bio catalytic activities which was consequent of the cell age and complete utilization of the substrate the bmp result obtained from the substrate of 0 13 g volatile solid composition analyzed was 0 34 m3ch4 kg vs this result implies that the maximum volume of methane that can be produced by the abattoir waste of 0 13 g composition used is 0 34 m3ch4 kg vs 3 2 characterization and biogas yield according to initial analyses of the material before mixture the mean ph ts vs and scod concentrations in the wastewater were 6 7 0 1 690 2 3 mg ts l 594 7 2 2 mg vs l and 788 5 5 1 mg cod l in the cow dung they were 6 5 0 1 612 7 2 4 mg ts kg 523 2 0 mg vs kg and 1530 88 mg cod l and those of the rumen content were 7 92 0 2 9 56 0 11 mg ts kg and 9 60 2 12 mg vs kg and 172 20 1 12 mg cod l respectively the results of the characterization of the substrate before and after anaerobic digestion are presented in table 1 post digestion moisture content was higher than pre digestion moisture content and thus lower post digestion ash content low ash content could be assumed to be responsible for the absence of phosphorus and potassium in the elemental characterization carbon to nitrogen ratio c n increased from average of 27 44 before anaerobic digestion to 45 36 after digestion period this high c n is thought to be responsible for the stoppage of biogas generation because of insufficient nitrogen for microbial growth c n ratio obtained in this study was higher than c n ratios obtained in earlier similar studies 29 30 37 there was a general reduction in the elemental concentrations observed after the anaerobic digestion and this shows the efficacy of the digester in treating abattoir waste reduction of total carbon and calcium could be attributed to their usage for metabolism and manufacture of microbial cell wall the daily and cumulative volumes of biogas obtained from abattoir wastes are presented in fig 2a and b biogas production started on the 6th day the first 5 day period is thought to correspond to the hydrolysis and acid formation period of the substrates it may also be due to the presence of lignin and wax in the undigested rumen content in the substrate because it cannot easily be degraded by bacteria and it is resistant to hydrolysis hence need long time for digestion 15 34 35 the daily gas volume of the substrate increased steadily and reached its peak volume of 2 5 l per day on the 15th day this is attributed to exponential growth of methanogens after this period the daily volume began to decline as the growth of the methanogens reduced the average daily and cumulative biogas yields produced were 1 03 l day and 30 9 l respectively for a working volume of 7 5 l this quantity is lower than the quantity of biogas recorded by 18 21 from anaerobic digestion of carica papaya fruit peels but comparable to biogas quantity obtained from anaerobic digestion of poultry slaughterhouse wastewater 38 chromatographic analysis showed that methane content in the biogas produced was 65 which agreed with the submission of various reported studies 13 17 19 21 3 3 chemical analysis and removal efficiency the influent ph was 6 4 while that of the digested slurry was 7 5 and these values agree with the values reported in previous studies 18 21 29 30 ph range of 6 5 8 0 ha s been established for optimal anaerobic digestion process 15 34 a suitable ph is necessary for proper microbial activities and increased biogas generation 39 the concentration of cod tvs and ts decreased steadily with time throughout the digestion period the concentrations of these parameters in the fresh slurry samples were 1905 45 mg l 604 01 mg l and 754 20 mg l respectively these concentrations were reduced to 302 19 mg l 102 50 mg l and 173 90 mg l respectively after the digestion this indicates that removal efficiencies were 84 1 83 and 77 for cod tvs and ts respectively the reductions were higher than what was reported in previous studies 10 12 this reduction is attributed to high degree of digestibility or biodegradability of the waste which enhances its solubilization and quick and efficient microbial breakdown of organic matter 18 21 40 it has been reported that solubilization and efficient biodegradability of organic matter make substrates available for the bacteria hence higher rate of biogas generation 41 42 fig 3 shows percentage removal efficiencies of cod tvs and ts during the anaerobic digestion removal of cod and tvs is associated to the rate of biogas generation higher rate of reductions of these components were observed in the first 25 d hence higher rate of biogas generation table 1 3 4 calculation of gas parameters and development of correlations table 2 shows the estimated parameters from eqs 8 9 and 10 the average biogas production of 1 3 10 7 l mg based on reduced cod per day 4 9 10 7 l mg based on reduced tvs per day and 5 1 10 7 l mg based on reduced ts per day were obtained total reduction of 1603 3 mg l 501 5 mg l and 580 3 mg l were obtained for cod tvs and ts respectively during the process after the digestion only 15 9 of the total cod 302 19 mg 17 0 of tvs 102 5 mg l and 23 of the ts 173 9 mg l were retained in the digester as shown in fig 3a c progressive reductions of these parameters are presented in fig 4 and the residual concentrations if released to the environment will constitute no nuisance as they fall below world health organization recommended limits 38 48 correlations between gas production rate g and the digester volume v in a batch reactor system were obtained as shown in eqs 6 8 this implies that for a specific biogas production rate the reactor volume can be estimated using the correlations based on reduced cod 6 g 1 3 10 7 x 1603 3 v 1 840 1308 9 v 1 62 v based on reduced tvs 7 g 4 9 10 7 x 501 5 v 1 720 1125 v 1 40 v based on reduced ts 8 g 5 1 10 7 x 580 3 v 1 599 966 v 1 18 v the developed correlation was validated using a predetermined biogas production rate of 4 35 l day to fabricate a 25 l digester operated for 32 d digestion period cumulative biogas volume of 139 45 l was generated with production rate of 4 36 l per day table s1 supplementary materials this demonstrates the validity of the correlation for both small and large reactor volumes the correlations were also validated with some reported studies experimental data of average gas production rate working volume and total reduced cod tvs or ts per day as well as validation experiment are presented in table 3 4 conclusion anaerobic digestion process was investigated for the treatment of abattoir wastewater and biogas production in a batch reactor system correlation between gas production rate and digester volume in a batch reactor system was also developed the anaerobic digestion produced 30 9 l of biogas in 30 d during which the total cod tvs and ts were reduced below who recommended limits the correlation developed is a useful tool for the determination of reactor size for a specific gas production rate the developed correlation parameters were in good agreement with the experimental results it is concluded that while anaerobic digestion process is a valuable method for the treatment of animal waste for a specific biogas production rate reactor volume can be estimated using the correlation

and discussion 3 1 bio methane potential test bmp as shown in fig 1 the bmp curve shows a steady increase in the pressure built up in the bottle filled with the substrate and the inoculum from the 6th day prior to this period is a lag phase during which the microorganisms acclimatize themselves to the environment from the 6th day however there is a continuous increase in the pressure until 50th day except sudden rise experienced on the 29th day the period between 50th and 60th day corresponds to a stationary phase in microbial cell growth in this period the pressure in the bottles is almost stationary which may have been due to rapid utilization of the substrate and the accumulation of products 36 meanwhile a decrease in pressure observed after 154th indicates that the death phase has set in as a result of decline in the bio catalytic activities which was consequent of the cell age and complete utilization of the substrate the bmp result obtained from the substrate of 0 13 g volatile solid composition analyzed was 0 34 m3ch4 kg vs this result implies that the maximum volume of methane that can be produced by the abattoir waste of 0 13 g composition used is 0 34 m3ch4 kg

mg vs kg and 172 20 1 12 mg cod l respectively the results of the characterization of the substrate before and after anaerobic digestion are presented in table 1 post digestion moisture content was higher than pre digestion moisture content and thus lower post digestion ash content low ash content could be assumed to be responsible for the absence of phosphorus and potassium in the elemental characterization carbon to nitrogen ratio c n increased from average of 27 44 before anaerobic digestion to 45 36 after digestion period this high c n is thought to be responsible for the stoppage of biogas generation because of insufficient nitrogen for microbial growth c n ratio obtained in this study was higher than c n ratios obtained in earlier similar studies 29 30 37 there was a general reduction in the elemental concentrations observed after the anaerobic digestion and this shows the efficacy of the digester in treating abattoir waste reduction of total carbon and calcium could be attributed to their usage for metabolism and manufacture of microbial cell wall the daily and cumulative volumes of biogas obtained from abattoir wastes are presented in fig 2a and b biogas production started on the 6th day the first 5 day period is thought to correspond to the hydrolysis and acid formation period of the substrates it may also be due to the presence of lignin and wax in the undigested rumen content in the substrate because it cannot easily be degraded by bacteria and it is resistant to hydrolysis hence need long time for digestion 15 34 35 the daily gas volume of the substrate increased steadily and reached its peak volume of 2 5 l per day on the 15th day this is attributed to exponential growth of methanogens after this period the daily volume began to decline as the growth of the methanogens reduced the average daily and cumulative biogas yields produced were 1 03 l day and 30 9 l respectively for a working volume of 7 5 l this quantity is lower than the quantity of biogas recorded by 18 21 from anaerobic digestion of carica papaya fruit peels but comparable to biogas quantity obtained from anaerobic digestion of poultry slaughterhouse wastewater 38 chromatographic analysis showed that methane content in the biogas produced was 65 which agreed with the submission of various reported studies 13 17 19 21 3 3 chemical analysis and removal efficiency the influent ph was 6 4 while that of the digested slurry was 7 5 and these values agree with the values reported in previous studies 18 21 29 30 ph range of 6 5 8 0 ha s been established for optimal anaerobic digestion process 15 34 a suitable ph is necessary for proper microbial activities and increased biogas generation 39 the concentration of cod tvs and ts decreased steadily with time throughout the digestion period the concentrations of these parameters in the fresh slurry samples were 1905 45 mg l 604 01 mg l and 754 20 mg l respectively these concentrations were reduced to 302 19 mg l 102 50 mg l and 173 90 mg l respectively after the digestion this indicates that removal efficiencies were 84 1 83 and 77 for cod tvs and ts respectively the reductions were higher than what was reported in previous studies 10 12 this reduction is attributed to high degree of digestibility or biodegradability of the waste which enhances its solubilization and quick and efficient microbial breakdown of organic matter 18 21 40 it has been reported that solubilization and efficient biodegradability of organic matter make substrates available for the bacteria hence higher rate of biogas generation 41 42 fig 3 shows percentage removal efficiencies of cod tvs and ts during the anaerobic digestion removal of cod and tvs is associated to the rate of biogas generation higher rate of reductions of these components were observed in the first 25 d hence higher rate of biogas generation table 1 3 4 calculation of gas parameters and development of correlations table 2 shows the estimated parameters from eqs 8 9 and 10 the average biogas production of 1 3 10 7 l mg based on reduced cod per day 4 9 10 7 l mg based on reduced tvs per day and 5 1 10 7 l mg based on reduced ts per day were obtained total reduction of 1603 3 mg l 501 5 mg l and 580 3 mg l were obtained for cod tvs and ts respectively during the process after the digestion only 15 9 of the total cod 302 19 mg 17 0 of tvs 102 5 mg l and 23 of the ts 173 9 mg l were retained in the digester as shown in fig 3a c progressive reductions of these parameters are presented in fig 4 and the residual concentrations if released to the environment will constitute no nuisance as they fall below world health organization recommended limits 38 48 correlations between gas production rate g and the digester volume v in a batch reactor system were obtained as shown in eqs 6 8 this implies that for a specific biogas production rate the reactor volume can be estimated using the correlations based on reduced cod 6 g 1 3 10 7 x 1603 3 v 1 840 1308 9 v 1 62 v based on reduced tvs 7 g 4 9 10 7 x 501 5 v 1 720 1125 v 1 40 v based on reduced ts 8 g 5 1 10 7 x 580 3 v 1 599 966 v 1 18 v the developed correlation was validated using a predetermined biogas production rate of 4 35 l day to fabricate a 25 l digester operated for 32 d digestion period cumulative biogas volume of 139 45 l was generated with production rate of 4 36 l per day table s1 supplementary materials this demonstrates the validity of the correlation for both small and large reactor volumes the correlations were also validated with some reported studies experimental data of average gas production rate working volume and total reduced cod tvs or ts per day as well as validation experiment are presented in table 3 4 conclusion anaerobic digestion process was investigated for the treatment of abattoir wastewater and biogas production in a batch reactor system correlation between gas production rate and digester volume in a batch reactor system was also developed the anaerobic digestion produced 30 9 l of biogas in 30 d during which the total cod tvs and ts were reduced below who recommended limits the correlation developed is a useful tool for the determination of reactor size for a specific gas production rate the developed correlation parameters were in good agreement with the experimental results it is concluded that while anaerobic digestion process is a valuable method for the treatment of animal waste for a specific biogas production rate reactor volume can be estimated using the correlation

13861,exploring facile and available approaches for resource utilization of liquor grains is in high demand for the brewing industry herein we demonstrate a one step blending method followed by heat treatment to prepare n p codoped mesoporous carbons p nmcs using liquor grains as the carbon source nano sio2 as a template and kh2po4 as an extra phosphorus precursor n2 adsorption desorption raman spectra x ray diffraction fourier transform infrared spectra transmission electron microscopy and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy were used to characterize the textural properties and surface chemistry of p nmcs results showed that the p nmcs that were prepared with a larger amount of the phosphorus precursor demonstrated much higher catalytic activity for persulfate activation the enhanced catalytic activity is ascribed to the relatively large specific area and the greater amount of active surface groups that are induced by n p codoping decolorization of organic dyes reached 95 under a broad operating ph range 3 0 11 0 quenching tests with different radical scavengers revealed that degradation of organic dyes was controlled by a surface bound radicals process and not by a free radical pathway keywords liquor grains mesoporous carbon n p codoping persulfate organic dyes 1 introduction because of their strong oxidizing ability and broad operating ph range advanced oxidation processes based on the sulfate radical so4 have received increasing attention for the elimination of recalcitrant organic pollutants such as pesticides antibiotics dyes and personal care products 1 2 at first so4 can be produced from the activation of peroxymonosulfate pms hso5 or persulfate ps s2o8 2 using uv heating various transition metals e g iron cobalt copper and manganese or metal oxides 1 3 4 however the expense of high energy inputs and the possible secondary pollutions of toxic metal leaching limited their practical applications on the basis of these considerations sustainable and metal free carbon based catalysts including activated carbon ac mesoporous carbon carbon nanotubes cnts and graphene have been demonstrated to be promising alternatives to conventional transition metal based catalysts carbon based catalysts are particularly suitable for liquid phase reactions because they have a high surface area well developed pore structure easily tailored surface chemistry and relatively high hydrothermal stability under oxidizing conditions thus carbon based catalysts are widely used as catalysts for so4 generation 5 7 importantly many research studies have found that doping with heteroatoms n s b or p and especially co or and tri doping with heteroatoms into the porous carbon surface is an effective strategy for modulating the local electronic structure of neighboring carbon atoms and for providing more active sites thus the reactivity of carbon based catalysts can be improved according to recent work by sun et al 5 8 surface nitrogen modification of cnts and graphene oxide rgo significantly increased catalytic activity in phenol oxidation with pms moreover liu et al 6 reported that n and s co doped cnt cooh showed a 5 fold enhancement activity for benzophenone 4 degradation with pms compared to the activity of singly n doped cnt cooh the activity of n and s co doped cnt cooh even exceeded that of the metal catalyst cufe2o4 although n p codoped carbon material have shown excellent activity and durability for various electrochemical reactions such as the oxygen reduction reaction orr and hydrogen evolution reaction her in the last few years 9 11 the effect of n p codoping on so4 generation has rarely been reported compared to n doped carbon n p codoped carbon more effectively modifies structure and performance because of the larger covalent radius distinct effects and lower electronegativity of phosphorus 12 therefore development of a simple environmentally friendly and available synthesis for n p codoped carbon catalysts would be more favorable for ps pms activation in this study we describe a facile approach for synthesizing n p codoped mesoporous carbons p nmcs using liquor grains as biomass materials and nano sio2 as a template liquor grains are a common solid waste that is largely produced in the brewing industry and the resource utilization of liquor grains has become a severe environmental issue in china liquor grains emissions were more than 300 million tons in 2018 on the other hand liquor grains are rich in crude protein crude fiber crude fat starch vitamins and other nutrients 13 14 thus they are promising biomass materials for preparing heteroatom doped carbon catalysts for degrading organic pollution by ps in addition because the phosphorus content in liquor grains is low 14 kh2po4 is added as an extra phosphorus precursor during the preparation of p nmcs the performance of p nmcs for ps activation and degradation of typical organic dye pollutions methyl orange mo rhodamine b rhb acid red 73 ar 73 and methylene blue mb were investigated organic dye pollution has become a key issues in environmental concerns that have triggered worldwide concern the goals of this study were to develop a new approach for resource utilization of liquor grains and to investigate the effects of n p codoping on so4 generation 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials nano sio2 4 nm 99

chemical reagent co ltd chengdu china all of the chemicals were analytical grade reagents liquor grains were purchased from wuliangye yibin co ltd yibin china 2 2 preparation of p nmcs p nmcs were prepared using the following procedure first liquor grains were washed five times with deionized water to remove impurities the grains were then dried at 80 c for 24 h the liquor grains nano sio2 and kh2po4 were then mixed by ball milling and the particle size was controlled to be in the range of 1 5 μm the mass ratio of nano sio2 to liquor grains was fixed at 0 15 1 after ball milling the mixture was calcined at 850 c for 1 h in a tube furnace under a nitrogen atmosphere the resulting sample was then treated with 40 hf for 12 h to remove nano sio2 finally the sample was washed with distilled water until there were no further detectable changes in the ph and then it was dried at 100 c for 12 h the final product was labeled as xp nmc where x denotes the mass ratio of kh2po4 to liquor grains and has values of 2 5 6 5 10 5 and 14 5 the blank catalyst without kh2po4 represents nmc the used 14 5 p nmc after five runs was labeled as14 5 p nmc u the 14 5 p nmc u was regenerated by thermal treatment at 550 c under a n2 atmosphere for 1 h and the obtained sample was donated as 14 5 p nmc ut 2 3 characterizations n2 adsorption desorption isotherms at 77 k were measured on a 3h 2000pm2 instrument beishide instrument technology co ltd beijing china to determine the texture properties of the p nmcs all of the samples were degassed at 120 c for 3 h under vacuum before measurement the specific surface area sbet was obtained using the brunauer emmett teller bet equation and the total pore volume vtotal was calculated from the near saturation uptake p p0 0 99 the pore size

by scanning electron microscopy sem zeiss sigma500 germany 2 4 catalytic degradation experiments catalytic degradation experiments were carried out in three flasks 250 ml with magnetic stirring 600 rpm at a desired temperature h2so4 0 1 m or naoh 0 1 m were used to adjust the ph of the initial solution of organic dyes 200 ml and then a known amount of ps and p nmcs were added to initiate reaction at pre set intervals sample aliquots was withdrawn and filtered using a 0 45 μm filter for analysis blank tests with only ps alone or only catalyst were also carried out using the same process all of the experiments were performed in duplicate and the results are the average value for cycling tests the catalyst was recycled via filtration and it was thoroughly washing with deionized water after each cycle after the 5th run the recycled catalyst was regenerated via thermal treatment ht at 550 c under a n2 stream for 1 h 2 5 analytical methods uv vis spectrophotometry was conducted at 464 nm 554 nm 664 nm and 509 nm to determine the concentration of mo rhb mb and ar73 respectively a sealed catalytic digestion colorimetric method hj t 399 2007 using a hach dr1010 cod analyzer was used to analyze the chemical oxygen demand cod spectrophotometric methods at 352 nm were used to analyze the concentrations of persulfate 15 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of catalysts 3 1 1 n2 adsorption desorption isotherms the p nmcs that were prepared in this work had different texture properties and these were influenced by the dosage of the phosphorus precursor n2 adsorption desorption isotherms and mesoporous size distributions of the p nmcs are shown in fig s1 detailed pore parameters of the p nmcs are summarized in table 1 all of the p nmcs present type iv isotherms each with an h3 hysteresis loop at relative pressures in the range of 0 45 0 95 and this is typical of mesopores structure fig s1a in addition the corresponding pore size distributions were calculated using the bjh method and as appear one narrow peak in the range of 3 4 3 9 nm fig s1b this is close to the size of nano sio2 which suggests that all of the p nmcs are mostly composed of mesopores 2 50 nm this result is further proven by the values of vmeso vtotal 0 70 and dbjh 3 48 3 89 nm the values of sbet and vtotal for the p nmcs exhibit an increasing tendency with an increase in the phosphorus precursor dosage this tendency can be ascribed to the pore making effect of the phosphorus precursor on the one hand the phosphate itself can occupy a certain volume and inhibit the contraction of pore structure 16 on the other hand the phosphate would decompose easily at high temperature and release a large number of radicals which can promote the carbonization and cross linking thereby expanding existing pores and forming a mesopore structure 16 17 indeed 14 5 p nmc presented the highest values for sbet and vtotal 311 6 m2 g and 0 461 cm3 g respectively 3 1 2 xrd analysis wide angle xrd patterns of p nmcs were plotted and the plots are shown in fig 1 a similar patterns indicate that the effect of phosphorus precursor dosage on crystal structure is not obvious all p nmcs exhibit similar patterns and there are two broad diffraction peaks at low diffraction angles of about 25 and 43 5 which correspond to the graphitic 002 plane and 101 plane respectively these observations confirm the amorphous state of p nmcs 11 3 1 3 raman spectra to evaluate the structural defects that are induced by doping with heteroatoms raman spectra of different p nmcs were recorded fig 1b all of the p nmcs showed a g band at around 1580 cm 1 and a d band at around 1350 cm 1 the d band reflects the characteristics of disordered or amorphous carbon defective structures whereas the g band indicates the graphitic carbon structure the ratio of the d band intensity to the g band intensity id ig is an indication of the degree of disorder in carbon materials 5 it is clear that p nmcs have high id ig ratios 1 58 1 87 and the values of id ig increase with an increase in p content these observations indicate that p nmcs were quite amorphous and that more defects in mesoporous carbon are induced after more p is doped into the system 3 1 4 tem and sem analysis tem and sem were used to further characterize the microstructure of the p nmcs the tem image in fig 2 a presents a visual display of the presence of some graphitic carbon layer structure and this validates the formation of graphite crystallite in the p nmcs also atomic lattice fringes of 0 334 nm which represent the 002 crystal lattice of c are clearly observed in the corresponding hrtem image of 14 5 p nmc fig 2b and this further confirms the presence of the graphitic structure this is in good agreement with the presence of the c 002 diffraction peak and the g band that is observed in the xrd and raman spectra respectively for an intuitive demonstration of the distribution of doping elements elemental mappings in the high angle annular dark field haadf images fig 2c g were also recorded for 14 5 p nmc obviously these images display a homogeneous dispersion of c n and o throughout 14 5 p nmc whereas the sporadic dispersion of p can be ascribed to the low contents of p additionally as can be seen from the sem image of 14 5 p nmc fig s2 the developed and abundant mesoporous structure indeed were appeared by the treatment with phosphorus precursor which provided a further proof of the mesoporous structure 3 1 5 ft ir spectra effects of phosphorus precursor dosage on the surface functional groups of p nmcs can be observed in the ft ir spectra fig 3 a the strong band at 3434 cm 1 which is caused by the presence of oh stretching in hydroxyls or chemisorbed water and the stretching vibration of ch2 in the range of 2920 2840 cm 1 18 are observed in all of the samples more detailed information can be obtained from the corresponding enlarged partial view fig 3b all of the samples display similar characteristic peaks at 1730 cm 1 1630 cm 1 1470 cm 1 1385 cm 1 1260 cm 1 and 1120 cm 1 and these can be assigned to vibrations of co stretching cc stretching in an aromatic ring co carboxylic acid or carboxylate symmetric no2 c n c coh c o c stretching and po stretching 19 20 moreover the intensity of the peak that corresponds to co slightly increases after more phosphorus precursor was added and this suggests the phosphorus precursor has an oxidation effect 21 compared to nmc p nmcs show two new peaks at 1050 cm 1 and 890 cm 1 and there are several weaker peaks 760 cm 1 to 680 cm 1 that correspond to the presence of poc poh and pc 22 these ft ir results confirm that n containing and p containing functional groups were successfully introduced into p nmcs 3 1 6 xps analysis more detailed surface chemical compositions and chemical states of p nmcs were further ascertained from the xps spectrum high resolution xps o 1s spectra fig s3 can be fitted to four species o 1 quinone type groups or po 530 4 531 8 ev o 2 co like ether groups oh phenol groups and or poh 532 0 532 4 ev o 3 o c o like lactone or carboxylic groups 533 6 534 2 ev and o 4 chemisorbed o2 or h2o 535 0 530 1 ev 10 23 the n 1s peaks fig 4 a can be deconvoluted into four peaks that are attributed to n py pyridinic nitrogen 398 0 398 4 ev n pyr pyrrolic and or pyridonic nitrogen 400 0 400 4 ev n g graphitic nitrogen 401 3 401 7 ev and n ox pyridine n oxide 403 7 404 5 ev 9 10 23 for the p 2p spectra fig 4b the peak located at 132 0 132 8 ev can be assigned to pc bonds and another peak located at 134 2 134 8 ev can be attributed to po bonds that might be in po4 3 9 24 relative surface concentrations of oxygen nitrogen and phosphorus species were calculated from fitting the o 1s n 1s and p 2p xps spectra all of the data are collected in table s1 and table 2 as observed in table s1 the pristine nmc itself has a low ratio of o 4 39 at n 1 19 at and p 0 20 at because of the heteroatom containing nature of liquor grains as expected a greater amount of added phosphorus precursor resulted in an increase in the surface phosphorus content and the doped phosphorus containing functional groups were predominant in pc bonds which accounts for 58 78 giving evidence for successful doping of phosphorus atoms into the carbon skeleton relatively low p contents may occur because the atomic radius of p 1 30 å is larger than that of either n 0 80 å and c 0 86 å and this makes it more difficult for p to be incorporated into the carbon skeleton it should be noted that more oxygen containing functional groups from 4 39 at to 7 14 at especially for o 1 and o 2 were introduced along with a greater amount of added kh2po4 this can be related to the oxidation effect by kh2po4 at high temperature 21 and to the introduction of an appropriate amount of oxygen from kh2po4 itself meanwhile the presence of more oxygen containing groups especially for acidic oxygen containing groups o 2 provides additional active sites for reaction with nitrogen and this has an enhancing effect on the incorporation of more nitrogen 20 therefore the nitrogen content especially for n py from 0 28 at to 0 39 at n g from 0 16 at to 0 38 at and n ox from 0 16 at to 0 39 at also increased with the addition of kh2po4 it is interesting that the concentration of n pyr from 0 59 at to 0 49 at had an opposite trend and this is ascribed to the instability of n pyr under oxidation conditions 25 26 3 1 7 preliminary study of mo degradation using p nmcs the catalytic oxidation efficiencies of the p nmcs were evaluated in terms of the catalytic activation of ps for mo degradation in water solutions fig 5 shows the results of mo removal and cod removal via adsorption and oxidation by p nmcs reaction conditions ph 5 5 30 c c 0 100 mg l c ps 0 4 g l and c cat 0 4 g l a control experiment using only ps without a catalyst indicates that mo was decolorized when the value of c t c 0 approached 0 85 this was a result of the self decomposition of ps to generate sulfate however it was still necessary to improve the extent of decolorization without ps only 18 mo was removed in 60 min according to the adsorption test using 14 5 p nmc compared to the experiment using only ps the pristine nmc showed a higher efficiency in terms of mo decolorization 50 8 and cod removal 23 8 and this implies that nmc is also able to facilitate decomposition of ps however it is clear that the best performances for mo removal and cod removal were achieved with the carbon samples that were doped with phosphorus and this demonstrates the positive effect of p doping this shows a positive correlation with respect to the dosage of the phosphorus precursor thus among the p nmcs 14 5 p nmc had the highest mo removal 74 2 and cod removal 42 5 after 60 min the difference between mo removal and cod removal is related to the difficulty of degradation of intermediates additionally the result of ps utilization further proved that n p codoping accelerated ps activation 3 1 8 roles of textural and surface properties for the enhanced catalytic activity as discussed above p nmcs were indeed successfully synthesized using a facile approach also introducing the heteroatom p optimized the textural and surface properties of p nmcs and this played significant roles in promoting the performance of ps activation and organic dye pollutions degradation to gain further insight into the effect of textural properties on the mineralization activity of mo the relationship between cod removal after 60 min and sbet of the tested p nmcs is displayed in fig 6 a it clear that even though the cod removal efficiency increased with an increase in sbet the linear correlation value r2 0 825 is lower this indicates that the observed difference in oxidant activity of p nmcs is caused by the textural properties and also related to changes in the surface chemistry although understanding the origin of heteroatom doping to the enhancement and synergistic effect on the catalytic activity of carbon based catalysts remains a significant challenge many research based experimental and theoretical studies have found that electron rich heteroatom containing functional groups such as o 1 n g and n py can activate o2 o3 h2o2 pms ps to generate more reactive radicals 5 27 32 the lone pair of electrons on o 1 n py and n g are considered to facilitate electron transfer from neighboring carbon giving rise to a high charge density of carbon atoms and thereby improving the activation of oxidants to generate active radicals 5 31 32 this is especially true for n g it has also been reported that p containing groups played a vital role in promoting electrocatalytic activity toward orr and this is especially true for pc groups the difference between the electronegativity for p and c and the difference between the covalent radius of p and c can regulate the local electron configuration and structural defects in the carbon crystal lattice thereby creating more active sites 9 10 therefore the enhancement effect of p nmcs on cod removal may also be closely related to active groups such as o 1 n g n py and pc to analyze the combined effect of textural properties and surface active groups on cod removal performance index of specific activity representing cod removal per surface area was first introduced the formation of specific activity was calculated as follows s p e c i f i c a c t i v i t y c o d 0 c o d t v m c a t s b e t m g m 2 where c o d 0 mg l is the initial concentration of cod c o d t mg l is concentration of cod after 60 min determined from fig 5b v l is the volume of wastewater m c a t g is the dosage of catalyst and s b e t m2 g is the specific surface area of the catalyst linear fitting was then used for qualitative analysis of the relationships between specific activity and the contents of heteroatom containing functional groups as determined from xps deconvolution analyses and interesting trends are found as revealed in fig 6b there is a higher correlation coefficient r2 0 956 when the specific activity values were plotted as a function of the sum of n py n g o 1 and pc and this confirms the beneficial and synergistic effect of heteroatom co doping on the catalytic activity with respect to mineralization of organic pollution to the best of our knowledge pc is first considered to be an active p containing functional group for ps activation when n py n g pc or o 1 was omitted and n pyr was added the values of r2 decreased slightly fig s4 and this further suggests that those groups played a part in the enhanced catalytic activity however because of the complex interactions among n py n g pc and o 1 a comparison of the relative importance of each with respect to enhanced catalytic activity is difficult to assess 3 1 9 mechanism of ps activation upon p nmcs heteroatom containing surface active groups on carbon based catalysts have been believed to play a key role in the activation of an oxidant to form reactive species like so4 and ho 5 27 31 32 these then initiated degradation of mo in this study to verify the actual reactive species that are mediated in the process quenching experiments were conducted using meoh tba ki and bq as radical scavengers meoh and tba radical scavengers for so4 and ho respectively tend to inhibit radicals in the liquid phase because of their good hydrophilicity 33 34 ki and bq can effectively capture radicals that are produced on the surface of the catalyst surface bound radicals 35 36 as displayed in fig s5 a b and fig 7 when the concentrations of tba or meoh were increased to 2 0 m there was a minor inhibitory effect on mo removal in 60 min even reducing the adsorption efficiency this minor inhibitory effect suggests that the main active species is something other than so4 and ho during the reaction however when 56 mm ki or bq fig s5 c d and fig 7 was added to the reaction system decolorization of mo were almost completely inhibited and this indicates that the surface bound so4 ads or ho ads played a dominant role in the catalytic oxidation process it is also worth noting that the decolorization of mo was close to the adsorption efficiency when the concentrations of ki or bq were increased to 56 mm these observations indicate that the effect of the nonradical process was negligible and that the free radicals in the liquid phase that were produced from surface bound radicals were intercepted by ki or bq accordingly the combination of characterization results and radical quenching experiments make it possible to summarize and rationalize the mechanism for ps fig 8 in a surface bound radical process s2o8 2 is first transferred to the p nmcs surface and forms surface bounded persulfate s2o8 2 ads free flowing electrons of the sp2 carbon structure and electron rich active groups like quinone type groups pyridinic and graphitic nitrogen groups and pc bond groups then transfer electrons to the electrophilic oxygen of s2o8 2 ads this transfer causes oo bond cleavage into surface bound sulfate radicals so4 ads additionally some so4 ads reacts with h2o to produce ho ads finally adsorbed mo molecules are consequently mineralized by the reactive radicals of so4 ads and ho ads that form meanwhile so4 ads and ho ads can desorb from the carbon surface and form so4 free and ho free in solution and these can also degrade mo molecules 3 1 10 effects of reaction parameters on organic dyes degradation 3 1 10 1 effects of ps concentration ps activation and organic dye degradation depend strongly on several reaction parameters such as ps dosage temperature and ph the effects of these parameters were then examined in depth using 14 5 p nmc which is the best metal free catalyst in the above discussion first the effect of ps dosage on mo degradation was investigated at 30 c with a ph of 5 5 and with 0 4 g l catalyst and various ps concentrations as presented in fig 9 a and fig s6a a 2 5 fold 0 2 0 5 g l increase in ps dosage increased mo removal efficiency from 52 2 92 4 and cod removal efficiency and from 28 9 64 0 each within 60 min this is because more sulfate and or hydroxyl radicals were produced when the ps dosage was increased and this thereby led to higher mo removal and cod removal however there was no significant improvement in the degradation efficiency when the ps dosage was greater than 0 5 g l and this is consistent with a previous observation 37 this tendency is probably attributed to the radical scavenging effect of excess ps and to a lack of active sites on the surface of 14 5 p nmc for ps activation 37 in addition the opposite trend between ps utilization and ps dosage further verified the lack of active sites on the surface of 14 5 p nmc to activate excess ps 3 1 10 2 effects of temperature fig 9b and fig s6b illustrate effects of reaction temperature on mo degradation at different temperatures while other reaction conditions were similar it is clear that higher mo removal and cod removal efficiencies were achieved at higher temperature with an increase in temperature from 20 to 35 c after 60 min mo removal efficiency increased from 87 5 93 5 and cod removal efficiency increased from 45 9 65 3 this may be ascribed to the thermal activation of ps ps utilization was also improved with an increase in temperature mo degradation kinetics were separately analyzed using zero order kinetics pseudo first order kinetics and pseudo second order kinetics results are given in fig s7 higher linear correlation coefficients r2 0 98 were obtained using the pseudo second order kinetics model and this suggests that the pseudo second order kinetics model is suitable for expressing mo conversion the apparent reaction rate constant k app at 20 c is 1 21 10 3 l mg m i n and with a 2 time reduction in 35 c this value increased to 2 59 10 3 l mg m i n revealing that temperature has a positive effect additionally the activation energy for mo degradation was estimated to be 38 45 kj mol r2 0 939 according to the arrhenius equation and this indicates that degradation of mo occurs at a relatively low energy 3 1 10 3 effects of ph it is well accepted that the ph of wastewater is a key factor in ps oxidation processes for water remediation commonly ps has higher performance in acidic conditions than that in neutral and alkaline conditions because of acid catalyzation 2 3 hence developing effective carbon based catalysts that have high activity over a wide range of ph is of great importance for the application of carbon based catalysts on ps activation as seen in fig 9c 14 5 p nmc exhibited high catalytic activity over a wide ph range of 3 0 11 0 and mo removal can reach 92 94 in acidic neutral and even alkaline conditions after reaction for 60 min this excellent performance especially in neutral and even alkaline conditions may be explained as follows on one hand in alkaline conditions ps can also generate the sulfate radical and can react with hydroxyl ions to form hydroxyl radicals 38 the presence of both radicals results in high removal efficiency for mo on the other hand the presence of acidic functional groups such as o 2 o 3 n ox and po on the surface of 14 5 p nmc provides a local acidic environment that buffers neutral and even alkaline conditions as observed by cui et al 39 the local acidic environment improves the fenton like process in addition as a result of the higher ps activating ability in acidic conditions a slight decrease of cod removal was nevertheless observed with an increase in ph fig s6c in contrast ps utilization efficiency increased sharply in alkaline conditions and this may be ascribed to an increase in the self decomposition of ps for an in depth investigation of changes that structural characteristics have on mo degradation uv vis spectra of mo at different reaction times were recorded and the results are shown in fig s8 it is clear that the main absorption band of mo at 464 nm assigned to the azo structure was apparently diminished after 60 min and this proves the high decolorization efficiency of the 14 5 p nmc ps system this is consistent with an obvious color change in the mo solution inset of fig s9 in addition the decay of the absorption band at 300 nm is considered to be evidence of the deep mineralization of the aromatic conjugate structure in the mo molecule and its intermediates 36 3 1 10 4 degradation of different organic dyes moreover various other organic dyes i e rhb mb and ar 73 were also effectively degraded by the 14 5 p nmc ps system with removal efficiencies of 94 3 98 2 and 99 9 respectively in 60 min fig s9 the differences in organic dye removal cod removal and ps utilization may be attributed to differences in molecular structures the image of the corresponding color change further confirm that the 14 5 p nmc ps system has excellent catalytic performance with respect to the degradation of multiple dye pollutants moreover the 14 5 p nmc presented even better catalytic performances for organic dyes degradation than some other carbon materials and metal based catalysts as listed in table 3 for example although the magnetic carbon coated fe c n composite also can remove 98 11 of ar 73 in 10 min the experiment condition was harsher than this study 40 3 1 11 catalytic stability and reusability of p nmcs to test the durability of the p nmc catalyst mo wastewater was treated in consecutive reaction cycles using 14 5 p nmc under the following reaction conditions ph 5 5 30 c c 0 100 m g l c p s 0 5 g l and c c a t 0 4 g l as seen in fig 9d and fig s6d within 60 min and after five runs mo removal decreased from 94 4 47 7 and cod removal decreased from 64 0 25 9 however catalytic activity of 14 5 p nmc was significantly recovered after thermal treatment at 550 c under a n2 atmosphere for 1 h and within 60 min mo removal and cod removal 96 6 and 68 9 were even higher than with fresh 14 5 p nmc generally changes in structure properties and surface chemistry cause deactivation of porous carbon 7 to further elucidate the reasons for deactivation and regeneration of 14 5 p nmc n2 adsorption desorption isotherms and xps spectra were recorded for 14 5 p nmc u and 14 5 p nmc ut as seen in table 1 sbet decreased from 311 6 m2 g to 105 8 m2 g and vtotal decreased from 0 461 cm3 g to 0 279 cm3 g after the fifth run these observations suggest that the surface of 14 5 p nmc was mostly covered because of the adsorption of mo and intermediate products thus the loss of sbet and the subsequent inhibition of ps activation and mo degradation were principally responsible for the deactivation of 14 5 p nmc regeneration of 14 5 p nmc may also be related to the recovery of sbet and vtotal 329 1 m2 g and 0 393 cm3 g respectively after thermal treatment additionally variations in surface composition after thermal treatment were calculated from xps spectra fig s10 and the results are listed in table s1 and table 2 nitrogen contents significantly increased from 1 65 14 5 p nmc to 2 57 14 5 p nmc ut because the residues of mo and intermediate products cause more nitrogen to be introduced into the carbon surface after thermal treatment this would explain the slight increase in mo removal for 14 5 p nmc ut that was observed on the basis of these results it can be concluded that both sbet and surface chemistry play important roles in ps activation and mo oxidation 4 conclusions in summary liquor grain derived n p codoped mesoporous carbon were successfully synthesized using a facile blending method followed by heat treatment p nmc with a higher phosphorus precursor dosage demonstrated a much higher catalytic activity for ps activation decolorization of organic dyes can reach 95 under a wide range of ph 3 0 11 0 enhanced catalytic activity can be attributed to the relatively large specific area and a greater number of active surface groups induced by n p codoping quenching tests indicated that the process is controlled by the surface bound

13861,exploring facile and available approaches for resource utilization of liquor grains is in high demand for the brewing industry herein we demonstrate a one step blending method followed by heat treatment to prepare n p codoped mesoporous carbons p nmcs using liquor grains as the carbon source nano sio2 as a template and kh2po4 as an extra phosphorus precursor n2 adsorption desorption raman spectra x ray diffraction fourier transform infrared spectra transmission electron microscopy and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy were used to characterize the textural properties and surface chemistry of p nmcs results showed that the p nmcs that were prepared with a larger amount of the phosphorus precursor demonstrated much higher catalytic activity for persulfate activation the enhanced catalytic activity is ascribed to the relatively large specific area and the greater amount of active surface groups that are induced by n p codoping decolorization of organic dyes reached 95 under a broad operating ph range 3 0 11 0 quenching tests with different radical scavengers revealed that degradation of organic dyes was controlled by a surface bound radicals process and not by a free radical pathway keywords liquor grains mesoporous carbon n p codoping persulfate organic dyes 1 introduction because of their strong oxidizing ability and broad operating ph range advanced oxidation processes based on the sulfate radical so4 have received increasing attention for the elimination of recalcitrant organic pollutants such as pesticides antibiotics dyes and personal care products 1 2 at first so4 can be produced from the activation of peroxymonosulfate pms hso5 or persulfate ps s2o8 2 using uv heating various transition metals e g iron cobalt copper and manganese or metal oxides 1 3 4 however the expense of high energy inputs and the possible secondary pollutions of toxic metal leaching limited their practical applications on the basis of these considerations sustainable and metal free carbon based catalysts including activated carbon ac mesoporous carbon carbon nanotubes cnts and graphene have been demonstrated to be promising alternatives to conventional transition metal based catalysts carbon based catalysts are particularly suitable for liquid phase reactions because they have a high surface area well developed pore structure easily tailored surface chemistry and relatively high hydrothermal stability under oxidizing conditions thus carbon based catalysts are widely used as catalysts for so4 generation 5 7 importantly many research studies have found that doping with heteroatoms n s b or p and especially co or and tri doping with heteroatoms into the porous carbon surface is an effective strategy for modulating the local electronic structure of neighboring carbon atoms and for providing more active sites thus the reactivity of carbon based catalysts can be improved according to recent work by sun et al 5 8 surface nitrogen modification of cnts and graphene oxide rgo significantly increased catalytic activity in phenol oxidation with pms moreover liu et al 6 reported that n and s co doped cnt cooh showed a 5 fold enhancement activity for benzophenone 4 degradation with pms compared to the activity of singly n doped cnt cooh the activity of n and s co doped cnt cooh even exceeded that of the metal catalyst cufe2o4 although n p codoped carbon material have shown excellent activity and durability for various electrochemical reactions such as the oxygen reduction reaction orr and hydrogen evolution reaction her in the last few years 9 11 the effect of n p codoping on so4 generation has rarely been reported compared to n doped carbon n p codoped carbon more effectively modifies structure and performance because of the larger covalent radius distinct effects and lower electronegativity of phosphorus 12 therefore development of a simple environmentally friendly and available synthesis for n p codoped carbon catalysts would be more favorable for ps pms activation in this study we describe a facile approach for synthesizing n p codoped mesoporous carbons p nmcs using liquor grains as biomass materials and nano sio2 as a template liquor grains are a common solid waste that is largely produced in the brewing industry and the resource utilization of liquor grains has become a severe environmental issue in china liquor grains emissions were more than 300 million tons in 2018 on the other hand liquor grains are rich in crude protein crude fiber crude fat starch vitamins and other nutrients 13 14 thus they are promising biomass materials for preparing heteroatom doped carbon catalysts for degrading organic pollution by ps in addition because the phosphorus content in liquor grains is low 14 kh2po4 is added as an extra phosphorus precursor during the preparation of p nmcs the performance of p nmcs for ps activation and degradation of typical organic dye pollutions methyl orange mo rhodamine b rhb acid red 73 ar 73 and methylene blue mb were investigated organic dye pollution has become a key issues in environmental concerns that have triggered worldwide concern the goals of this study were to develop a new approach for resource utilization of liquor grains and to investigate the effects of n p codoping on so4 generation 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials nano sio2 4 nm 99

prepared using the following procedure first liquor grains were washed five times with deionized water to remove impurities the grains were then dried at 80 c for 24 h the liquor grains nano sio2 and kh2po4 were then mixed by ball milling and the particle size was controlled to be in the range of 1 5 μm the mass ratio of nano sio2 to liquor grains was fixed at 0 15 1 after ball milling the mixture was calcined at 850 c for 1 h in a tube furnace under a nitrogen atmosphere the resulting sample was then treated with 40 hf for 12 h to remove nano sio2 finally the sample was washed with distilled water until there were no further detectable changes in the ph and then it was dried at 100 c for 12 h the final product was labeled as xp nmc where x denotes the mass ratio of kh2po4 to liquor grains and has values of 2 5 6 5 10 5 and 14 5 the blank catalyst without kh2po4 represents nmc the used 14 5 p nmc after five runs was labeled as14 5 p nmc u the 14 5 p nmc u was regenerated by thermal treatment at 550 c under a n2 atmosphere for 1 h and the obtained sample was donated as 14 5 p nmc ut 2 3 characterizations n2 adsorption desorption isotherms at 77 k were measured on a 3h 2000pm2 instrument beishide instrument technology co ltd beijing china to determine the texture properties of the p nmcs all of the samples were degassed at 120 c for 3 h under vacuum before measurement the specific surface area sbet was obtained using the brunauer emmett teller bet equation and the total pore volume vtotal was calculated from the near saturation uptake p p0 0 99 the pore size

by scanning electron microscopy sem zeiss sigma500 germany 2 4 catalytic degradation experiments catalytic degradation experiments were carried out in three flasks 250 ml with magnetic stirring 600 rpm at a desired temperature h2so4 0 1 m or naoh 0 1 m were used to adjust the ph of the initial solution of organic dyes 200 ml and then a known amount of ps and p nmcs were added to initiate reaction at pre set intervals sample aliquots was withdrawn and filtered using a 0 45 μm filter for analysis blank tests with only ps alone or only catalyst were also carried out using the same process all of the experiments were performed in duplicate and the results are the average value for cycling tests the catalyst was recycled via filtration and it was thoroughly washing with deionized water after each cycle after the 5th run the recycled catalyst was regenerated via thermal treatment ht at 550 c under a n2 stream for 1 h 2 5 analytical methods uv vis spectrophotometry was conducted at 464 nm 554 nm 664 nm and 509 nm to determine the concentration of mo rhb mb and ar73 respectively a sealed catalytic digestion colorimetric method hj t 399 2007 using a hach dr1010 cod analyzer was used to analyze the chemical oxygen demand cod spectrophotometric methods at 352 nm were used to analyze the concentrations of persulfate 15 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of catalysts 3 1 1 n2 adsorption desorption isotherms the p nmcs that were prepared in this work had different texture properties and these were influenced by the dosage of the phosphorus precursor n2 adsorption desorption isotherms and mesoporous size distributions of the p nmcs are shown in fig s1 detailed pore parameters of the p nmcs are summarized in table 1 all of the p nmcs present type iv isotherms each with an h3 hysteresis loop at relative pressures in the range of 0 45 0 95 and this is typical of mesopores structure fig s1a in addition the corresponding pore size distributions were calculated using the bjh method and as appear one narrow peak in the range of 3 4 3 9 nm fig s1b this is close to the size of nano sio2 which suggests that all of the p nmcs are mostly composed of mesopores 2 50 nm this result is further proven by the values of vmeso vtotal 0 70 and dbjh 3 48 3 89 nm the values of sbet and vtotal for the p nmcs exhibit an increasing tendency with an increase in the phosphorus precursor dosage this tendency can be ascribed to the pore making effect of the phosphorus precursor on the one hand the phosphate itself can occupy a certain volume and inhibit the contraction of pore structure 16 on the other hand the phosphate would decompose easily at high temperature and release a large number of radicals which can promote the carbonization and cross linking thereby expanding existing pores and forming a mesopore structure 16 17 indeed 14 5 p nmc presented the highest values for sbet and vtotal 311 6 m2 g and 0 461 cm3 g respectively 3 1 2 xrd analysis wide angle xrd patterns of p nmcs were plotted and the plots are shown in fig 1 a similar patterns indicate that the effect of phosphorus precursor dosage on crystal structure is not obvious all p nmcs exhibit similar patterns and there are two broad diffraction peaks at low diffraction angles of about 25 and 43 5 which correspond to the graphitic 002 plane and 101 plane respectively these observations confirm the amorphous state of p nmcs 11 3 1 3 raman spectra to evaluate the structural defects that are induced by doping with heteroatoms raman spectra of different p nmcs were recorded fig 1b all of the p nmcs showed a g band at around 1580 cm 1 and a d band at around 1350 cm 1 the d band reflects the characteristics of disordered or amorphous carbon defective structures whereas the g band indicates the graphitic carbon structure the ratio of the d band intensity to the g band intensity id ig is an indication of the degree of disorder in carbon materials 5 it is clear that p nmcs have high id ig ratios 1 58 1 87 and the values of id ig increase with an increase in p content these observations indicate that p nmcs were quite amorphous and that more defects in mesoporous carbon are induced after more p is doped into the system 3 1 4 tem and sem analysis tem and sem were used to further characterize the microstructure of the p nmcs the tem image in fig 2 a presents a visual display of the presence of some graphitic carbon layer structure and this validates the formation of graphite crystallite in the p nmcs also atomic lattice fringes of 0 334 nm which represent the 002 crystal lattice of c are clearly observed in the corresponding hrtem image of 14 5 p nmc fig 2b and this further confirms the presence of the graphitic structure this is in good agreement with the presence of the c 002 diffraction peak and the g band that is observed in the xrd and raman spectra respectively for an intuitive demonstration of the distribution of doping elements elemental mappings in the high angle annular dark field haadf images fig 2c g were also recorded for 14 5 p nmc obviously these images display a homogeneous dispersion of c n and o throughout 14 5 p nmc whereas the sporadic dispersion of p can be ascribed to the low contents of p additionally as can be seen from the sem image of 14 5 p nmc fig s2 the developed and abundant mesoporous structure indeed were appeared by the treatment with phosphorus precursor which provided a further proof of the mesoporous structure 3 1 5 ft ir spectra effects of phosphorus precursor dosage on the surface functional groups of p nmcs can be observed in the ft ir spectra fig 3 a the strong band at 3434 cm 1 which is caused by the presence of oh stretching in hydroxyls or chemisorbed water and the stretching vibration of ch2 in the range of 2920 2840 cm 1 18 are observed in all of the samples more detailed information can be obtained from the corresponding enlarged partial view fig 3b all of the samples display similar characteristic peaks at 1730 cm 1 1630 cm 1 1470 cm 1 1385 cm 1 1260 cm 1 and 1120 cm 1 and these can be assigned to vibrations of co stretching cc stretching in an aromatic ring co carboxylic acid or carboxylate symmetric no2 c n c coh c o c stretching and po stretching 19 20 moreover the intensity of the peak that corresponds to co slightly increases after more phosphorus precursor was added and this suggests the phosphorus precursor has an oxidation effect 21 compared to nmc p nmcs show two new peaks at 1050 cm 1 and 890 cm 1 and there are several weaker peaks 760 cm 1 to 680 cm 1 that correspond to the presence of poc poh and pc 22 these ft ir results confirm that n containing and p containing functional groups were successfully introduced into p nmcs 3 1 6 xps analysis more detailed surface chemical compositions and chemical states of p nmcs were further ascertained from the xps spectrum high resolution xps o 1s spectra fig s3 can be fitted to four species o 1 quinone type groups or po 530 4 531 8 ev o 2 co like ether groups oh phenol groups and or poh 532 0 532 4 ev o 3 o c o like lactone or carboxylic groups 533 6 534 2 ev and o 4 chemisorbed o2 or h2o 535 0 530 1 ev 10 23 the n 1s peaks fig 4 a can be deconvoluted into four peaks that are attributed to n py pyridinic nitrogen 398 0 398 4 ev n pyr pyrrolic and or pyridonic nitrogen 400 0 400 4 ev n g graphitic nitrogen 401 3 401 7 ev and n ox pyridine n oxide 403 7 404 5 ev 9 10 23 for the p 2p spectra fig 4b the peak located at 132 0 132 8 ev can be assigned to pc bonds and another peak located at 134 2 134 8 ev can be attributed to po bonds that might be in po4 3 9 24 relative surface concentrations of oxygen nitrogen and phosphorus species were calculated from fitting the o 1s n 1s and p 2p xps spectra all of the data are collected in table s1 and table 2 as observed in table s1 the pristine nmc itself has a low ratio of o 4 39 at n 1 19 at and p 0 20 at because of the heteroatom containing nature of liquor grains as expected a greater amount of added phosphorus precursor resulted in an increase in the surface phosphorus content and the doped phosphorus containing functional groups were predominant in pc bonds which accounts for 58 78 giving evidence for successful doping of phosphorus atoms into the carbon skeleton relatively low p contents may occur because the atomic radius of p 1 30 å is larger than that of either n 0 80 å and c 0 86 å and this makes it more difficult for p to be incorporated into the carbon skeleton it should be noted that more oxygen containing functional groups from 4 39 at to 7 14 at especially for o 1 and o 2 were introduced along with a greater amount of added kh2po4 this can be related to the oxidation effect by kh2po4 at high temperature 21 and to the introduction of an appropriate amount of oxygen from kh2po4 itself meanwhile the presence of more oxygen containing groups especially for acidic oxygen containing groups o 2 provides additional active sites for reaction with nitrogen and this has an enhancing effect on the incorporation of more nitrogen 20 therefore the nitrogen content especially for n py from 0 28 at to 0 39 at n g from 0 16 at to 0 38 at and n ox from 0 16 at to 0 39 at also increased with the addition of kh2po4 it is interesting that the concentration of n pyr from 0 59 at to 0 49 at had an opposite trend and this is ascribed to the instability of n pyr under oxidation conditions 25 26 3 1 7 preliminary study of mo degradation using p nmcs the catalytic oxidation efficiencies of the p nmcs were evaluated in terms of the catalytic activation of ps for mo degradation in water solutions fig 5 shows the results of mo removal and cod removal via adsorption and oxidation by p nmcs reaction conditions ph 5 5 30 c c 0 100 mg l c ps 0 4 g l and c cat 0 4 g l a control experiment using only ps without a catalyst indicates that mo was decolorized when the value of c t c 0 approached 0 85 this was a result of the self decomposition of ps to generate sulfate however it was still necessary to improve the extent of decolorization without ps only 18 mo was removed in 60 min according to the adsorption test using 14 5 p nmc compared to the experiment using only ps the pristine nmc showed a higher efficiency in terms of mo decolorization 50 8 and cod removal 23 8 and this implies that nmc is also able to facilitate decomposition of ps however it is clear that the best performances for mo removal and cod removal were achieved with the carbon samples that were doped with phosphorus and this demonstrates the positive effect of p doping this shows a positive correlation with respect to the dosage of the phosphorus precursor thus among the p nmcs 14 5 p nmc had the highest mo removal 74 2 and cod removal 42 5 after 60 min the difference between mo removal and cod removal is related to the difficulty of degradation of intermediates additionally the result of ps utilization further proved that n p codoping accelerated ps activation 3 1 8 roles of textural and surface properties for the enhanced catalytic activity as discussed above p nmcs were indeed successfully synthesized using a facile approach also introducing the heteroatom p optimized the textural and surface properties of p nmcs and this played significant roles in promoting the performance of ps activation and organic dye pollutions degradation to gain further insight into the effect of textural properties on the mineralization activity of mo the relationship between cod removal after 60 min and sbet of the tested p nmcs is displayed in fig 6 a it clear that even though the cod removal efficiency increased with an increase in sbet the linear correlation value r2 0 825 is lower this indicates that the observed difference in oxidant activity of p nmcs is caused by the textural properties and also related to changes in the surface chemistry although understanding the origin of heteroatom doping to the enhancement and synergistic effect on the catalytic activity of carbon based catalysts remains a significant challenge many research based experimental and theoretical studies have found that electron rich heteroatom containing functional groups such as o 1 n g and n py can activate o2 o3 h2o2 pms ps to generate more reactive radicals 5 27 32 the lone pair of electrons on o 1 n py and n g are considered to facilitate electron transfer from neighboring carbon giving rise to a high charge density of carbon atoms and thereby improving the activation of oxidants to generate active radicals 5 31 32 this is especially true for n g it has also been reported that p containing groups played a vital role in promoting electrocatalytic activity toward orr and this is especially true for pc groups the difference between the electronegativity for p and c and the difference between the covalent radius of p and c can regulate the local electron configuration and structural defects in the carbon crystal lattice thereby creating more active sites 9 10 therefore the enhancement effect of p nmcs on cod removal may also be closely related to active groups such as o 1 n g n py and pc to analyze the combined effect of textural properties and surface active groups on cod removal performance index of specific activity representing cod removal per surface area was first introduced the formation of specific activity was calculated as follows s p e c i f i c a c t i v i t y c o d 0 c o d t v m c a t s b e t m g m 2 where c o d 0 mg l is the initial concentration of cod c o d t mg l is concentration of cod after 60 min determined from fig 5b v l is the volume of wastewater m c a t g is the dosage of catalyst and s b e t m2 g is the specific surface area of the catalyst linear fitting was then used for qualitative analysis of the relationships between specific activity and the contents of heteroatom containing functional groups as determined from xps deconvolution analyses and interesting trends are found as revealed in fig 6b there is a higher correlation coefficient r2 0 956 when the specific activity values were plotted as a function of the sum of n py n g o 1 and pc and this confirms the beneficial and synergistic effect of heteroatom co doping on the catalytic activity with respect to mineralization of organic pollution to the best of our knowledge pc is first considered to be an active p containing functional group for ps activation when n py n g pc or o 1 was omitted and n pyr was added the values of r2 decreased slightly fig s4 and this further suggests that those groups played a part in the enhanced catalytic activity however because of the complex interactions among n py n g pc and o 1 a comparison of the relative importance of each with respect to enhanced catalytic activity is difficult to assess 3 1 9 mechanism of ps activation upon p nmcs heteroatom containing surface active groups on carbon based catalysts have been believed to play a key role in the activation of an oxidant to form reactive species like so4 and ho 5 27 31 32 these then initiated degradation of mo in this study to verify the actual reactive species that are mediated in the process quenching experiments were conducted using meoh tba ki and bq as radical scavengers meoh and tba radical scavengers for so4 and ho respectively tend to inhibit radicals in the liquid phase because of their good hydrophilicity 33 34 ki and bq can effectively capture radicals that are produced on the surface of the catalyst surface bound radicals 35 36 as displayed in fig s5 a b and fig 7 when the concentrations of tba or meoh were increased to 2 0 m there was a minor inhibitory effect on mo removal in 60 min even reducing the adsorption efficiency this minor inhibitory effect suggests that the main active species is something other than so4 and ho during the reaction however when 56 mm ki or bq fig s5 c d and fig 7 was added to the reaction system decolorization of mo were almost completely inhibited and this indicates that the surface bound so4 ads or ho ads played a dominant role in the catalytic oxidation process it is also worth noting that the decolorization of mo was close to the adsorption efficiency when the concentrations of ki or bq were increased to 56 mm these observations indicate that the effect of the nonradical process was negligible and that the free radicals in the liquid phase that were produced from surface bound radicals were intercepted by ki or bq accordingly the combination of characterization results and radical quenching experiments make it possible to summarize and rationalize the mechanism for ps fig 8 in a surface bound radical process s2o8 2 is first transferred to the p nmcs surface and forms surface bounded persulfate s2o8 2 ads free flowing electrons of the sp2 carbon structure and electron rich active groups like quinone type groups pyridinic and graphitic nitrogen groups and pc bond groups then transfer electrons to the electrophilic oxygen of s2o8 2 ads this transfer causes oo bond cleavage into surface bound sulfate radicals so4 ads additionally some so4 ads reacts with h2o to produce ho ads finally adsorbed mo molecules are consequently mineralized by the reactive radicals of so4 ads and ho ads that form meanwhile so4 ads and ho ads can desorb from the carbon surface and form so4 free and ho free in solution and these can also degrade mo molecules 3 1 10 effects of reaction parameters on organic dyes degradation 3 1 10 1 effects of ps concentration ps activation and organic dye degradation depend strongly on several reaction parameters such as ps dosage temperature and ph the effects of these parameters were then examined in depth using 14 5 p nmc which is the best metal free catalyst in the above discussion first the effect of ps dosage on mo degradation was investigated at 30 c with a ph of 5 5 and with 0 4 g l catalyst and various ps concentrations as presented in fig 9 a and fig s6a a 2 5 fold 0 2 0 5 g l increase in ps dosage increased mo removal efficiency from 52 2 92 4 and cod removal efficiency and from 28 9 64 0 each within 60 min this is because more sulfate and or hydroxyl radicals were produced when the ps dosage was increased and this thereby led to higher mo removal and cod removal however there was no significant improvement in the degradation efficiency when the ps dosage was greater than 0 5 g l and this is consistent with a previous observation 37 this tendency is probably attributed to the radical scavenging effect of excess ps and to a lack of active sites on the surface of 14 5 p nmc for ps activation 37 in addition the opposite trend between ps utilization and ps dosage further verified the lack of active sites on the surface of 14 5 p nmc to activate excess ps 3 1 10 2 effects of temperature fig 9b and fig s6b illustrate effects of reaction temperature on mo degradation at different temperatures while other reaction conditions were similar it is clear that higher mo removal and cod removal efficiencies were achieved at higher temperature with an increase in temperature from 20 to 35 c after 60 min mo removal efficiency increased from 87 5 93 5 and cod removal efficiency increased from 45 9 65 3 this may be ascribed to the thermal activation of ps ps utilization was also improved with an increase in temperature mo degradation kinetics were separately analyzed using zero order kinetics pseudo first order kinetics and pseudo second order kinetics results are given in fig s7 higher linear correlation coefficients r2 0 98 were obtained using the pseudo second order kinetics model and this suggests that the pseudo second order kinetics model is suitable for expressing mo conversion the apparent reaction rate constant k app at 20 c is 1 21 10 3 l mg m i n and with a 2 time reduction in 35 c this value increased to 2 59 10 3 l mg m i n revealing that temperature has a positive effect additionally the activation energy for mo degradation was estimated to be 38 45 kj mol r2 0 939 according to the arrhenius equation and this indicates that degradation of mo occurs at a relatively low energy 3 1 10 3 effects of ph it is well accepted that the ph of wastewater is a key factor in ps oxidation processes for water remediation commonly ps has higher performance in acidic conditions than that in neutral and alkaline conditions because of acid catalyzation 2 3 hence developing effective carbon based catalysts that have high activity over a wide range of ph is of great importance for the application of carbon based catalysts on ps activation as seen in fig 9c 14 5 p nmc exhibited high catalytic activity over a wide ph range of 3 0 11 0 and mo removal can reach 92 94 in acidic neutral and even alkaline conditions after reaction for 60 min this excellent performance especially in neutral and even alkaline conditions may be explained as follows on one hand in alkaline conditions ps can also generate the sulfate radical and can react with hydroxyl ions to form hydroxyl radicals 38 the presence of both radicals results in high removal efficiency for mo on the other hand the presence of acidic functional groups such as o 2 o 3 n ox and po on the surface of 14 5 p nmc provides a local acidic environment that buffers neutral and even alkaline conditions as observed by cui et al 39 the local acidic environment improves the fenton like process in addition as a result of the higher ps activating ability in acidic conditions a slight decrease of cod removal was nevertheless observed with an increase in ph fig s6c in contrast ps utilization efficiency increased sharply in alkaline conditions and this may be ascribed to an increase in the self decomposition of ps for an in depth investigation of changes that structural characteristics have on mo degradation uv vis spectra of mo at different reaction times were recorded and the results are shown in fig s8 it is clear that the main absorption band of mo at 464 nm assigned to the azo structure was apparently diminished after 60 min and this proves the high decolorization efficiency of the 14 5 p nmc ps system this is consistent with an obvious color change in the mo solution inset of fig s9 in addition the decay of the absorption band at 300 nm is considered to be evidence of the deep mineralization of the aromatic conjugate structure in the mo molecule and its intermediates 36 3 1 10 4 degradation of different organic dyes moreover various other organic dyes i e rhb mb and ar 73 were also effectively degraded by the 14 5 p nmc ps system with removal efficiencies of 94 3 98 2 and 99 9 respectively in 60 min fig s9 the differences in organic dye removal cod removal and ps utilization may be attributed to differences in molecular structures the image of the corresponding color change further confirm that the 14 5 p nmc ps system has excellent catalytic performance with respect to the degradation of multiple dye pollutants moreover the 14 5 p nmc presented even better catalytic performances for organic dyes degradation than some other carbon materials and metal based catalysts as listed in table 3 for example although the magnetic carbon coated fe c n composite also can remove 98 11 of ar 73 in 10 min the experiment condition was harsher than this study 40 3 1 11 catalytic stability and reusability of p nmcs to test the durability of the p nmc catalyst mo wastewater was treated in consecutive reaction cycles using 14 5 p nmc under the following reaction conditions ph 5 5 30 c c 0 100 m g l c p s 0 5 g l and c c a t 0 4 g l as seen in fig 9d and fig s6d within 60 min and after five runs mo removal decreased from 94 4 47 7 and cod removal decreased from 64 0 25 9 however catalytic activity of 14 5 p nmc was significantly recovered after thermal treatment at 550 c under a n2 atmosphere for 1 h and within 60 min mo removal and cod removal 96 6 and 68 9 were even higher than with fresh 14 5 p nmc generally changes in structure properties and surface chemistry cause deactivation of porous carbon 7 to further elucidate the reasons for deactivation and regeneration of 14 5 p nmc n2 adsorption desorption isotherms and xps spectra were recorded for 14 5 p nmc u and 14 5 p nmc ut as seen in table 1 sbet decreased from 311 6 m2 g to 105 8 m2 g and vtotal decreased from 0 461 cm3 g to 0 279 cm3 g after the fifth run these observations suggest that the surface of 14 5 p nmc was mostly covered because of the adsorption of mo and intermediate products thus the loss of sbet and the subsequent inhibition of ps activation and mo degradation were principally responsible for the deactivation of 14 5 p nmc regeneration of 14 5 p nmc may also be related to the recovery of sbet and vtotal 329 1 m2 g and 0 393 cm3 g respectively after thermal treatment additionally variations in surface composition after thermal treatment were calculated from xps spectra fig s10 and the results are listed in table s1 and table 2 nitrogen contents significantly increased from 1 65 14 5 p nmc to 2 57 14 5 p nmc ut because the residues of mo and intermediate products cause more nitrogen to be introduced into the carbon surface after thermal treatment this would explain the slight increase in mo removal for 14 5 p nmc ut that was observed on the basis of these results it can be concluded that both sbet and surface chemistry play important roles in ps activation and mo oxidation 4 conclusions in summary liquor grain derived n p codoped mesoporous carbon were successfully synthesized using a facile blending method followed by heat treatment p nmc with a higher phosphorus precursor dosage demonstrated a much higher catalytic activity for ps activation decolorization of organic dyes can reach 95 under a wide range of ph 3 0 11 0 enhanced catalytic activity can be attributed to the relatively large specific area and a greater number of active surface groups induced by n p codoping quenching tests indicated that the process is controlled by the surface bound

13862,peroxymonosulfate pms is a strong oxidizing agent that can generate reactive oxygen species ross to decompose organic pollutants it can be activated by either chemical catalysis or electrochemical processes both of which are limited by low catalytic efficiency in this study electrochemical oxidation and advanced oxidation of pms on a nico2o4 nanoarray cathode were integrated to decompose rhodamine b rhb the combined method exhibited faster decolourisation rates and increased reaction efficiencies compared to systems using either electrochemistry or pms alone the effects of ph pms dosage initial rhb concentration and current density were investigated the activation of pms 2 g l 1 under a current density of 10 ma cm 2 at neutral ph showed a high decolourisation efficiency of 99 7 for the rhb solution 100 mg l 1 in 60 min the corresponding total organic carbon toc removal efficiency was 28 9 the electrode could be reused for at least four cycles while maintaining its high activity furthermore scavenging experiments were conducted with various radical scavengers to identify the major ross our mechanistic study suggested that o2 and 1o2 play key roles in the degradation process a synergistic effect was promoted by combining electrochemical and chemical processes for pms activation the results presented herein provide fundamental insight into advanced oxidation processes with pms keywords advanced oxidation electrochemistry peroxymonosulfate decolourisation dye wastewater 1 introduction dyes are considered to be one of the major organic pollutants nowadays there are more than 100 000 dyes used in industry and approximately 10 15 of the dyes used are discharged directly into the ecosystem annually because of inefficient dying processes 1 3 this dye containing wastewater is toxic to aquatic animals and plants and damages the groundwater system which ultimately threatens human health thus there is an urgent need to develop an efficient cost effective and environmentally friendly method to decompose dye containing wastewater various physical chemical and biological approaches to waste mitigation have been investigated including adsorption coagulation photocatalytic degradation biological degradation and chemical degradation methods 4 among these technologies advanced oxidation processes aops have attracted particular attention because highly reactive oxygen species ross such as oh and so4 radicals generated during these processes are strong oxidants with high redox potentials ross can decompose a wide variety of organic pollutants peroxymonosulfate pms is a strong stable and environmentally friendly oxidizing agent that can generate ross pms can be activated by heat 5 6 uv radiation 7 electrochemistry 8 10 or transition metals 11 12 in particular cobalt compounds are widely used to activate pms owing to their excellent catalytic activities because cobalt ions in solution are toxic numerous processes have been used to develop heterogeneous cobalt based catalysts such as co3o4 13 15 coooh 16 17 co c 18 19 co carbon nanofibers 20 21 co al2o3 22 23 co c3n4 24 and co oh f mxenes 25 alternatively to limit the use of toxic cobalt complexes of other metals including nickel 2 26 27 manganese 28 29 alumina 30 and iron 3 31 32 have been studied as catalysts as well zhang 2 and tian 26 synthesised nico2o4 catalysts and found that nico2o4 can successfully activate pms to decompose organic pollutants su 33 used a hydrothermal method to synthesise co x fe3 x o4 nanocatalysts that activated pms for rhodamine b rhb decomposition however most catalysts are powders suspended in wastewater solution which necessitates subsequent separation from the solution to recover the catalysts furthermore nano and micro sized powder catalysts can aggregate when dispersed in solution leading to decreased catalytic efficiency electrochemistry ec is a promising method for the activation of pms because of its high efficiency and environmental compatibility 34 35 pms can be electrochemically activated either by cathodic reduction or anodic oxidation to produce radical and nonradical oxidants at the electrodes 36 38 in some investigations electrochemical and chemical activation of pms are combined the electrodes are placed in an organic wastewater solution containing the dispersed heterogeneous catalyst 31 degradation is significantly enhanced when heterogeneous activation is combined with ec boron doped diamond bdd electrodes are most often used for these processes because they provide excellent electrocatalytic activity however the fabrication of bdd electrodes is prohibitively expensive 39 other electrode materials such as ruo2 iro2 and pbo2 also possess drawbacks of high cost or toxicity furthermore these electrodes are inert they regenerate the catalyst but pms activation occurs on the surface of the dispersed catalyst thus the development of economical and effective techniques to enhance aops and improve wastewater degradation remains a challenge herein we report a method to decompose organic pollutants that combines electrochemical oxidation using a nico2o4 nanoarray cathode with an advanced oxidation process using pms to generate ross rhb an azo dye widely used in the dyeing industry was chosen as a model organic pollutant in this process the cathode not only transported electrons but also took part in the catalytic reaction to activate pms a possible mechanism is also proposed o2 1o2 and so4 as well as oh enhanced rhb decomposition considerably 2 experimental 2 1 materials rhb

changsha liyuan co ltd all reagents were used without further purification 2 2 preparation of the nico2o4 nanoarray electrode the nico2o4 nanoarray electrode was prepared according to a previously published method 40 in a typical synthesis 1 mmol of ni no3 2 6h2o and 2 mmol co no3 2 6h2o were dissolved in 70 ml of deionised water to which was added 10 mmol of urea ni foams were cleaned by sonication with acetone ethyl alcohol and deionized water for 30 min each one piece of cleaned ni foam was immersed in the solution next the mixture was transferred to a 100 ml teflon lined stainless steel reactor and kept at 180 c for 6 h to produce the nanoarray structure on the ni foam the obtained nico2o4 precursor grown on ni foam was then washed with deionised water and alcohol and dried completely finally precursor was sintered at 350 c for 2 h in air to achieve nico2o4 2 3 characterisation x ray diffraction xrd was carried out using an x ray diffractometer bruker d8 with cu kα radiation scanning electron microscopy sem was performed using a hitachi s 4800 instrument high resolution transmission electron microscopy hrtem was performed using a jem 200 cx jeol instrument the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm was obtained using micromeritics instruments asap2010 and the surface area and pore size distribution were calculated using the brunauer emmett teller bet and barrett joyner halenda methods respectively x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps was conducted using a thermo scientific k alpha instrument using an a1kα x ray source the total organic carbon toc of the decolourised water was tested using a shimadzu toc vcpn instrument ion leaching was detected by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms conducted on a nexion 300x system 2 4 electrolytic system and evaluation of catalytic degradation the wastewater stock solution was prepared by dissolving 1 g of rhb in 1000 ml of deionised water other desired concentrations were diluted from the stock solution the as prepared nico2o4 nanoarray electrode served as the cathode and a graphite electrode was used as the anode the area of the electrodes was 1 1 cm the cathode and anode were arranged 2 cm apart in parallel in a glass beaker filled with 50 ml of dye wastewater with 0 05 mol l 1 na2so4 as the electrolyte an iviumstat electrochemical workstation ivium technologies b v netherlands supplied the current constant current densities in the range of 6 to 18 ma cm 2 were applied using the electrolytic system throughout the decomposition process a magnetic stirrer was used to achieve uniform dispersion of the solution current density was applied and pms was added to the electrolytic cell simultaneously to initiate the reaction aliquots of the aqueous solution were withdrawn periodically and analysed for rhb concentration using an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer uv 5500pc rhb absorbance was measured at 554 nm decolourisation efficiency was calculated according to eq 1 1 decolourisation efficiency c0 ct c0 100 where c0 and ct represent the concentrations of rhb at times 0 and t respectively in a reusability evaluation study the electrode was washed after each batch for 60 min with deionised water and alcohol thoroughly and dried completely then the electrode was arranged in an electrolytic system with 50 ml of dye wastewater with the initial concentration for another batch 1o2 was detected using 910 diphenylanthracene dpa 41 42 and o2 was analysed using nitrotetrazolium blue chloride nbt 43 the method was similar to the former decolourisation test by replacing rhb solution with dpa or nbt solutions 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterisation of the nico2o4 nanoarray electrode the xrd pattern of the nico2o4 nanoarray shown in fig 1 a exhibits diffraction peaks consistent with pure nico2o4 jcpds card no 73 1702 sem results fig 1 b and c indicated that the nickel foam surface was covered with a uniform distribution of nanowires several micrometres long and 50 100 nm in diameter detailed morphologies from tem revealed that the nanowires were porous structures comprising nanoparticles approximately 10 nm in diameter fig 1 d and e this special structure was expected to provide a large surface area to allow pms and dye molecules to access the electrode solution interface hrtem indicated a lattice spacing of 0 47 nm fig 1 f corresponding to the 111 face of the nico2o4 spinel structure nitrogen adsorption desorption analysis was performed the isotherm curve and pore size distribution plot are shown in fig s1 the isotherm exhibits a typical type iv curve for a porous material in which a hysteresis loop appears when p p0 is in the range of 0 7 1 0 furthermore the pore size distribution indicates that most pores measured 2 20 nm and that the material had an average pore size of 11 5 nm the specific bet surface area and pore volume were 48 7 m2 g 1 and 0 16 cm3 g 1 respectively hence the high bet surface area and narrow pore size distribution provided abundant active sites for pms activation 3 2 decolorization of rhb under different systems to study the combined effect of advanced oxidation and electrochemical catalysis rhb degradation was performed using different systems as shown in fig 2 a experiments were carried out for each of the following conditions a nico2o4 electrode ec no pms b nico2o4 electrode pms no ec applied c ti plate instead of nico2o4 electrode pms ec no active electrode was used d co3o4 electrode pms ec co3o4 electrode instead of nico2o4 electrode and e nico2o4 electrode pms ec when the nico2o4 nanoarray was used as the electrode without pms system a approximately 49 0 of rhb was removed after 60 min because of hydroxyl radicals generated by the oxidation of water at the anode 8 in the process using nico2o4 pms without applied ec system b the decolourisation efficiency improved to 73 3 indicating that the nico2o4 nanoarray can react with pms to generate sulphate radicals 2 44 however when the catalyst was used as electrode the reaction between the cobalt ions and pms was less efficient than the process in which the catalyst powder was well dispersed in the dye solution 26 44 with the nico2o4 pms ec system e approximately 99 7 of rhb was decolourised in 30 min and almost 100 0 was removed in 60 min however other electrodes such as the ti plate system c 84 8 at 30 min and co3o4 electrode system d 96 1 at 30 min exhibited inferior decolourisation abilities compared to co3o4 which has sufficient catalytic ability according to many published studies nico2o4 exhibited significantly enhanced decolourisation efficiency it is widely acknowledged that the electronic conductivity of nico2o4 is higher than that of co3o4 by at least two orders of magnitude which can significantly enhance its electrochemical catalytic ability 45 46 these results demonstrate that the nico2o4 pms ec system system e generated the most reactive radicals or nonradical oxidants to remove rhb illustrating the excellent synergetic effect of the nico2o4 pms and ec combination the kinetics of decolourisation were evaluated using a pseudo first order equation as described in eq 2 and in table s1 2 ct c0 exp kt where t is the decolourisation time ct and c0 are the concentrations at times t and 0 respectively and k is the apparent rate constant as shown in table s1 k follows the order nico2o4 pms ec e co3o4 pms ec d ti pms ec c nico2o4 pms b nico2o4 ec a demonstrating that the nico2o4 pms ec system achieved the best catalytic performance to illustrate the structural change of the rhb chromophore during decolourisation the uv vis spectra of rhb solutions were collected as a function of decolourisation time in the presence of nico2o4 pms ec fig 2 b two main absorption bands were observed at 554 and 310 nm for the initial rhb solution as the degradation process continued absorption intensified in both the visible and ultraviolet regions the absorption bands continuously decreased finally disappearing within 40 min corresponding to a change in the colour of the solution from red to light red and finally to colourless no new absorption peaks or obvious peak shifts were detected in either the visible or ultraviolet region indicating that the rhb chromophoric and aromatic ring structures were oxidized 47 toc was measured to evaluate mineralization of the rhb degradation process and the results are shown in fig 2 c the toc removal efficiencies of rhb degraded in ti pms ec system a nico2o4 pms system b nico2o4 ec system c co3o4 pms ec system d and nico2o4 pms ec system e were 4 4 9 3 18 0 24 4 and 28 9 respectively compared with fig 2 a we can see that although the rhb of system e was almost completely removed after 60 min the remaining amounts of organic components were still high this suggests that most of the rhb was decomposed to small intermediates and some of those were mineralised 3 3 effect of pms dosage because pms dosage affects rhb decolourisation the effect of pms dosage on rhb removal was evaluated over the range of 1 4 g l 1 pms as shown in fig 3 a the decolourisation efficiency increased with increasing pms concentration table s2 lists pseudo first order rate constants under various conditions k increased from 0 1 min 1 to 0 24 min 1 with increasing pms dosage pms when activated by cobalt ions and ec accelerated the generation of ross thus increased concentrations of pms enhanced rhb oxidation 3 4 effect of initial dye concentration rhb decolourisation was investigated as a function of initial dye concentration as shown in fig 3 b the decolourisation rate and efficiency increased with decreasing initial dye concentration rhb was almost completely decolourised within 30 min at initial rhb concentrations below 100 mg l 1 whereas approximately 90 5 of rhb was removed at an initial concentration of 200 mg l 1 the rate constants were 0 18 min 1 0 15 min 1 and 0 085 min 1 for initial concentrations of 50 mg l 1 100 mg l 1 and 200 mg l 1 respectively table s2 pms dosage and current density were kept constant and the amount of ross generated in the dye solution remained constant hence more time was needed to achieve the same decolourisation effect at higher rhb concentrations 3 5 effect of current density the effect of applied current density was evaluated at 6 10 14 and 18 ma cm 2 and the results are illustrated in fig 3 c decolourisation efficiency improved when the current density increased from 6 to 10 ma cm 2 however further increases in the current density to 14 and 18 ma cm 2 led to decreased decolourisation efficiencies the rate constants for these conditions exhibited a similar trend k increased from 0 11 min 1 to 0 15 min 1 at applied current densities of 6 and 10 ma cm 2 respectively then decreased to 0 092 min 1 and 0 079 min 1 at 14 and 18 ma cm 2 respectively because electron transfer improves with increasing current density at lower densities increasing current densities would provide more opportunities to produce oxidic reactants such as hydrogen peroxide as shown in eqs 3 7 thus accelerating the decolourising reaction however at high current densities the consumption of oxidation material is favoured eq 6 which reduces the concentration of h2o2 in the wastewater solution 35 48 3 hso5 e so4 oh 4 h2o oh h e 5 2h2o h2o2 2h e 6 2h2o o2 4h 4e 7 o2 2h 2e h2o2 8 h2o2 2h 2e 2 h2o 3 6 effect of initial ph the decolourisation efficiency of rhb was investigated at different initial ph values 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 0 and 10 0 as shown in fig 3 d the best decolourisation efficiency was obtained at around the point of zero charge phzpc of nico2o4 when the initial ph decreased from 6 to 2 the decolourisation efficiency decreased and k changed from 0 16 to 0 060 min 1 when the initial ph increased from 6 0 to 10 0 the decolourisation rate and efficiency decreased within the first 10 min then the decolourisation rate started to increase and efficiencies were almost the same as that of ph 6 after 30 min decolourisation is affected by three factors i the existing form of pms ii the surface charge property of the electrode and iii the existing form of rhb first the form of pms existing in solution is mainly determined by solution ph and the dissociation constant pka of pms which was reported to be 9 4 49 thus hso5 is the main species in acid and neutral solutions second the point of zero charge phzpc of nico2o4 is essential to the surface charge it has been reported that the phzpc of nico2o4 is approximately 6 50 the surface of the nico2o4 electrode was positively charged when the solution ph was below 6 whereas it was negatively charged when ph was above 6 third rhb has the form rhb or rhb depending on ph and pka2 51 when the ph is below pka2 3 7 the amino group is positively charged and rhb is formed when the ph is above 3 7 the amino group is protonated and thus forms zwitterionic form rhb in this decolourisation process when the ph is below 6 the repulsion between positively charged nico2o4 and rhb would inhibit the adsorption of rhb on the electrode surface thus decreasing the degradation rate furthermore more h ions would scavenge the generated so4 and oh ions limiting the removal rate 52 when the ph is greater than 6 the surface of nico2o4 becomes negative due to deprotonation although the combination of nico2o4 and rhb is not prevented the difficulty for hso5 to be adsorbed on nico2o4 surface reduces the decolourisation process in this study the decolourisation rate increased suddenly after 10 min for alkaline conditions this may be attributed to the h ions generated from pms in the system which reduced the ph to a value close to phzpc 3 7 reusability evaluation reusability of the nico2o4 electrode was investigated and the results are shown in fig 4 decolourisation efficiencies were 99 8 94 6 89 3 and 89 2 at 60 min for the first second third and fourth cycles respectively thus exhibiting good recyclability deactivation of the electrode resulted from cobalt leaching and intermediate products adsorbed on the electrode surface 53 the leaching ions in solution were detected by icp ms the leaching ratios of co and ni ions in the system were 0 028 and 0 085 respectively which indicates negligible metal leaching however in this study reusability tests were conducted on the recycled electrodes after simple washing it has been reported that additional annealing in inert gas can remove adsorbed organics to recover the activity of the electrode 10 22 future work will focus on methods of reactivating used electrodes in our laboratory 3 8 mechanism of decolourisation 3 8 1 xps study to elucidate the mechanism of pms activation at the nico2o4 electrode xps analyses were conducted on both fresh and cycled nico2o4 electrodes as shown in fig 5 slight peak shifts were observed for both co 2p and ni 2p when the fresh and cycled samples were compared indicating that valence states changed during activation the co 2p high resolution spectra for fresh and cycled samples exhibited two spin orbit doublets characteristic of co ii and co iii as well as two shake up satellites gaussian fitting indicated that the ratio of co iii co ii for fresh and cycled electrodes changed from 0 42 to 0 60 implying part of co ii was converted to co iii after use similarly the ni 2p spectra comprised two spin orbit doublets for ni ii and ni iii and two shake up satellites the ratio of ni iii ni ii for the fresh electrodes was 4 8 and that for the cycled electrodes was 6 8 the o 1s spectrum contained four oxygen contributions denoted as o1 o2 o3 and o4 for the fresh electrode the o1 peak at 528 9 ev is ascribed to metal oxygen bonds mo the peak at 530 6 ev o2 is attributed to the hydroxyl group oxygen oh the o3 peak observed at 531 6 ev corresponds to oxygen atoms in defects and the o4 peak at 533 1 ev is consistent with the multiplicity of physically or chemically absorbed water on the surface 40 a significant change was observed in the ratio of oh to mo peaks for the cycled electrode an increase in the ratio from 0 67 to 1 60 suggests that oh was generated during activation 7 these results show that the oxidation of surface m ii to m iii happened for activation pms 3 8 2 identification of ross with radical scavengers to identify the major active radicals in the system scavenging experiments were conducted with various radical scavengers such as p benzoquinone histidine methanol and tert butyl alcohol tba with the same concentration of 20 mm p benzoquinone is a scavenger for the superoxide anion radical o2 k 9 0 108 m 1 s 1 54 histidine scavenges for singlet oxygen 1o2 k 3 2 108 m 1 s 1 55 methanol can capture both oh and so4 k 2 5 107 m 1 s 1 and 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 respectively 56 whereas tba is a more effective scavenger of oh k 6 0 108 m 1 s 1 than of so4 k 4 0 105 m 1 s 1 33 as displayed in fig 6 compared to the process without a scavenger the efficiency of rhb decolourisation decreased slightly in the presence of methanol and tba as reflected in rhb removal efficiencies of 99 4 99 0 and 98 5 respectively however p benzoquinone and histidine significantly inhibited decomposition decolourisation efficiency decreased to 62 4 after adding p benzoquinone an even lower efficiency of 31 5 was obtained with histidine the existence of 1o2 was confirmed by using dpa as the probe dpa can indicate the presence of 1o2 due to the rapid reaction between dpa and 1o2 which decreases the absorbance in the range of 320 420 nm 42 fig 7 a demonstrates a decrease of absorption bands in uv vis spectra of dpa with increasing electrolysis time proving the existence of 1o2 in the nico2o4 pmc ec system similarly nbt measurements were applied to detect o2 fig 7 b in the nico2o4 pmc ec system the absorption band at 255 nm weakened over time which indicates nbt was consumed by o2 in the environment these results suggest that although both so4 and oh radicals contributed somewhat to the degradation o2 and 1o2 played major roles in the degradation process using these results we propose the mechanism illustrated in fig 8 and eqs 3 20 16 27 46 which states that rhb degradation occurs via a pms activation process that combines electrochemical activation and chemical activation with generated radicals and nonradicals first ec contributes to the degradation of rhb pms can be activated by ec though eq 3 to generate sulphate radicals meanwhile h2o is easily discharged on the electrode surface leading to the formation of oh eq 4 furthermore h2o2 is produced from water electrolysis eqs 5 7 these species are powerful oxidants that can degrade organic matter in wastewater second pms can be activated by a catalytic process on nico2o4 the negatively charged nico2o4 electrode arouses the adsorption of rhb and pms followed by an activation reaction between nico2o4 and pms as illustrated in eq 9 partial so4 can react with h2o via eq 12 to generate oh later h2o2 the product reacted from eqs 13 14 readily generates o2 according to eqs 15 17 meanwhile self decomposition of pms occurs slowly to generate 1o2 via the process shown in eq 18 57 59 the generated oh and o2 can also react with each other to form 1o2 eqs 19 20 which could be the main pathway for 1o2 generation 17 together with so4 and oh these radical and nonradical species attack and degrade rhb rapidly which is then absorbed on the electrode third the chemical activation of pms is effectively enhanced with the assistance of ec when m ii co or ni reacts with pms to generate so4 the oxidation of m ii to m iii eq 9 occurs m ii can be regenerated according to the reaction shown in eq 10 at a rate much slower than the rate of consumption of m ii eq 9 60 as a result eq 10 is the rate limiting step for chemical activation of pms with co or ni however in the ec and nico2o4 system m iii can be reduced to m ii at the electrode eq 11 thus the electroreduction of m iii to active m ii is significantly improved and the recycling of the reaction can be continuous therefore a synergistic effect between catalytic activation and ec

13862,peroxymonosulfate pms is a strong oxidizing agent that can generate reactive oxygen species ross to decompose organic pollutants it can be activated by either chemical catalysis or electrochemical processes both of which are limited by low catalytic efficiency in this study electrochemical oxidation and advanced oxidation of pms on a nico2o4 nanoarray cathode were integrated to decompose rhodamine b rhb the combined method exhibited faster decolourisation rates and increased reaction efficiencies compared to systems using either electrochemistry or pms alone the effects of ph pms dosage initial rhb concentration and current density were investigated the activation of pms 2 g l 1 under a current density of 10 ma cm 2 at neutral ph showed a high decolourisation efficiency of 99 7 for the rhb solution 100 mg l 1 in 60 min the corresponding total organic carbon toc removal efficiency was 28 9 the electrode could be reused for at least four cycles while maintaining its high activity furthermore scavenging experiments were conducted with various radical scavengers to identify the major ross our mechanistic study suggested that o2 and 1o2 play key roles in the degradation process a synergistic effect was promoted by combining electrochemical and chemical processes for pms activation the results presented herein provide fundamental insight into advanced oxidation processes with pms keywords advanced oxidation electrochemistry peroxymonosulfate decolourisation dye wastewater 1 introduction dyes are considered to be one of the major organic pollutants nowadays there are more than 100 000 dyes used in industry and approximately 10 15 of the dyes used are discharged directly into the ecosystem annually because of inefficient dying processes 1 3 this dye containing wastewater is toxic to aquatic animals and plants and damages the groundwater system which ultimately threatens human health thus there is an urgent need to develop an efficient cost effective and environmentally friendly method to decompose dye containing wastewater various physical chemical and biological approaches to waste mitigation have been investigated including adsorption coagulation photocatalytic degradation biological degradation and chemical degradation methods 4 among these technologies advanced oxidation processes aops have attracted particular attention because highly reactive oxygen species ross such as oh and so4 radicals generated during these processes are strong oxidants with high redox potentials ross can decompose a wide variety of organic pollutants peroxymonosulfate pms is a strong stable and environmentally friendly oxidizing agent that can generate ross pms can be activated by heat 5 6 uv radiation 7 electrochemistry 8 10 or transition metals 11 12 in particular cobalt compounds are widely used to activate pms owing to their excellent catalytic activities because cobalt ions in solution are toxic numerous processes have been used to develop heterogeneous cobalt based catalysts such as co3o4 13 15 coooh 16 17 co c 18 19 co carbon nanofibers 20 21 co al2o3 22 23 co c3n4 24 and co oh f mxenes 25 alternatively to limit the use of toxic cobalt complexes of other metals including nickel 2 26 27 manganese 28 29 alumina 30 and iron 3 31 32 have been studied as catalysts as well zhang 2 and tian 26 synthesised nico2o4 catalysts and found that nico2o4 can successfully activate pms to decompose organic pollutants su 33 used a hydrothermal method to synthesise co x fe3 x o4 nanocatalysts that activated pms for rhodamine b rhb decomposition however most catalysts are powders suspended in wastewater solution which necessitates subsequent separation from the solution to recover the catalysts furthermore nano and micro sized powder catalysts can aggregate when dispersed in solution leading to decreased catalytic efficiency electrochemistry ec is a promising method for the activation of pms because of its high efficiency and environmental compatibility 34 35 pms can be electrochemically activated either by cathodic reduction or anodic oxidation to produce radical and nonradical oxidants at the electrodes 36 38 in some investigations electrochemical and chemical activation of pms are combined the electrodes are placed in an organic wastewater solution containing the dispersed heterogeneous catalyst 31 degradation is significantly enhanced when heterogeneous activation is combined with ec boron doped diamond bdd electrodes are most often used for these processes because they provide excellent electrocatalytic activity however the fabrication of bdd electrodes is prohibitively expensive 39 other electrode materials such as ruo2 iro2 and pbo2 also possess drawbacks of high cost or toxicity furthermore these electrodes are inert they regenerate the catalyst but pms activation occurs on the surface of the dispersed catalyst thus the development of economical and effective techniques to enhance aops and improve wastewater degradation remains a challenge herein we report a method to decompose organic pollutants that combines electrochemical oxidation using a nico2o4 nanoarray cathode with an advanced oxidation process using pms to generate ross rhb an azo dye widely used in the dyeing industry was chosen as a model organic pollutant in this process the cathode not only transported electrons but also took part in the catalytic reaction to activate pms a possible mechanism is also proposed o2 1o2 and so4 as well as oh enhanced rhb decomposition considerably 2 experimental 2 1 materials rhb

changsha liyuan co ltd all reagents were used without further purification 2 2 preparation of the nico2o4 nanoarray electrode the nico2o4 nanoarray electrode was prepared according to a previously published method 40 in a typical synthesis 1 mmol of ni no3 2 6h2o and 2 mmol co no3 2 6h2o were dissolved in 70 ml of deionised water to which was added 10 mmol of urea ni foams were cleaned by sonication with acetone ethyl alcohol and deionized water for 30 min each one piece of cleaned ni foam was immersed in the solution next the mixture was transferred to a 100 ml teflon lined stainless steel reactor and kept at 180 c for 6 h to produce the nanoarray structure on the ni foam the obtained nico2o4 precursor grown on ni foam was then washed with deionised water and alcohol and dried completely finally precursor was sintered at 350 c for 2 h in air to achieve nico2o4 2 3 characterisation x ray diffraction xrd was carried out using an x ray diffractometer bruker d8 with cu kα radiation scanning electron microscopy sem was performed using a hitachi s 4800 instrument high resolution transmission electron microscopy hrtem was performed using a jem 200 cx jeol instrument the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm was obtained using micromeritics instruments asap2010 and the surface area and pore size distribution were calculated using the brunauer emmett teller bet and barrett joyner halenda methods respectively x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps was conducted using a thermo scientific k alpha instrument using an a1kα x ray source the total organic carbon toc of the decolourised water was tested using a shimadzu toc vcpn instrument ion leaching was detected by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms conducted on a nexion 300x system 2 4 electrolytic system and evaluation of catalytic degradation the wastewater stock solution was prepared by dissolving 1 g of rhb in 1000 ml of deionised water other desired concentrations were diluted from the stock solution the as prepared nico2o4 nanoarray electrode served as the cathode and a graphite electrode was used as the anode the area of the electrodes was 1 1 cm the cathode and anode were arranged 2 cm apart in parallel in a glass beaker filled with 50 ml of dye wastewater with 0 05 mol l 1 na2so4 as the electrolyte an iviumstat electrochemical workstation ivium technologies b v netherlands supplied the current constant current densities in the range of 6 to 18 ma cm 2 were applied using the electrolytic system throughout the decomposition process a magnetic stirrer was used to achieve uniform dispersion of the solution current density was applied and pms was added to the electrolytic cell simultaneously to initiate the reaction aliquots of the aqueous solution were withdrawn periodically and analysed for rhb concentration using an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer uv 5500pc rhb absorbance was measured at 554 nm decolourisation efficiency was calculated according to eq 1 1 decolourisation efficiency c0 ct c0 100 where c0 and ct represent the concentrations of rhb at times 0 and t respectively in a reusability evaluation study the electrode was washed after each batch for 60 min with deionised water and alcohol thoroughly and dried completely then the electrode was arranged in an electrolytic system with 50 ml of dye wastewater with the initial concentration for another batch 1o2 was detected using 910 diphenylanthracene dpa 41 42 and o2 was analysed using nitrotetrazolium blue chloride nbt 43 the method was similar to the former decolourisation test by replacing rhb solution with dpa or nbt solutions 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterisation of the nico2o4 nanoarray electrode the xrd pattern of the nico2o4 nanoarray shown in fig 1 a exhibits diffraction peaks consistent with pure nico2o4 jcpds card no 73 1702 sem results fig 1 b and c indicated that the nickel foam surface was covered with a uniform distribution of nanowires several micrometres long and 50 100 nm in diameter detailed morphologies from tem revealed that the nanowires were porous structures comprising nanoparticles approximately 10 nm in diameter fig 1 d and e this special structure was expected to provide a large surface area to allow pms and dye molecules to access the electrode solution interface hrtem indicated a lattice spacing of 0 47 nm fig 1 f corresponding to the 111 face of the nico2o4 spinel structure nitrogen adsorption desorption analysis was performed the isotherm curve and pore size distribution plot are shown in fig s1 the isotherm exhibits a typical type iv curve for a porous material in which a hysteresis loop appears when p p0 is in the range of 0 7 1 0 furthermore the pore size distribution indicates that most pores measured 2 20 nm and that the material had an average pore size of 11 5 nm the specific bet surface area and pore volume were 48 7 m2 g 1 and 0 16 cm3 g 1 respectively hence the high bet surface area and narrow pore size distribution provided abundant active sites for pms activation 3 2 decolorization of rhb under different systems to study the combined effect of advanced oxidation and electrochemical catalysis rhb degradation was performed using different systems as shown in fig 2 a experiments were carried out for each of the following conditions a nico2o4 electrode ec no pms b nico2o4 electrode pms no ec applied c ti plate instead of nico2o4 electrode pms ec no active electrode was used d co3o4 electrode pms ec co3o4 electrode instead of nico2o4 electrode and e nico2o4 electrode pms ec when the nico2o4 nanoarray was used as the electrode without pms system a approximately 49 0 of rhb was removed after 60 min because of hydroxyl radicals generated by the oxidation of water at the anode 8 in the process using nico2o4 pms without applied ec system b the decolourisation efficiency improved to 73 3 indicating that the nico2o4 nanoarray can react with pms to generate sulphate radicals 2 44 however when the catalyst was used as electrode the reaction between the cobalt ions and pms was less efficient than the process in which the catalyst powder was well dispersed in the dye solution 26 44 with the nico2o4 pms ec system e approximately 99 7 of rhb was decolourised in 30 min and almost 100 0 was removed in 60 min however other electrodes such as the ti plate system c 84 8 at 30 min and co3o4 electrode system d 96 1 at 30 min exhibited inferior decolourisation abilities compared to co3o4 which has sufficient catalytic ability according to many published studies nico2o4 exhibited significantly enhanced decolourisation efficiency it is widely acknowledged that the electronic conductivity of nico2o4 is higher than that of co3o4 by at least two orders of magnitude which can significantly enhance its electrochemical catalytic ability 45 46 these results demonstrate that the nico2o4 pms ec system system e generated the most reactive radicals or nonradical oxidants to remove rhb illustrating the excellent synergetic effect of the nico2o4 pms and ec combination the kinetics of decolourisation were evaluated using a pseudo first order equation as described in eq 2 and in table s1 2 ct c0 exp kt where t is the decolourisation time ct and c0 are the concentrations at times t and 0 respectively and k is the apparent rate constant as shown in table s1 k follows the order nico2o4 pms ec e co3o4 pms ec d ti pms ec c nico2o4 pms b nico2o4 ec a demonstrating that the nico2o4 pms ec system achieved the best catalytic performance to illustrate the structural change of the rhb chromophore during decolourisation the uv vis spectra of rhb solutions were collected as a function of decolourisation time in the presence of nico2o4 pms ec fig 2 b two main absorption bands were observed at 554 and 310 nm for the initial rhb solution as the degradation process continued absorption intensified in both the visible and ultraviolet regions the absorption bands continuously decreased finally disappearing within 40 min corresponding to a change in the colour of the solution from red to light red and finally to colourless no new absorption peaks or obvious peak shifts were detected in either the visible or ultraviolet region indicating that the rhb chromophoric and aromatic ring structures were oxidized 47 toc was measured to evaluate mineralization of the rhb degradation process and the results are shown in fig 2 c the toc removal efficiencies of rhb degraded in ti pms ec system a nico2o4 pms system b nico2o4 ec system c co3o4 pms ec system d and nico2o4 pms ec system e were 4 4 9 3 18 0 24 4 and 28 9 respectively compared with fig 2 a we can see that although the rhb of system e was almost completely removed after 60 min the remaining amounts of organic components were still high this suggests that most of the rhb was decomposed to small intermediates and some of those were mineralised 3 3 effect of pms dosage because pms dosage affects rhb decolourisation the effect of pms dosage on rhb removal was evaluated over the range of 1 4 g l 1 pms as shown in fig 3 a the decolourisation efficiency increased with increasing pms concentration table s2 lists pseudo first order rate constants under various conditions k increased from 0 1 min 1 to 0 24 min 1 with increasing pms dosage pms when activated by cobalt ions and ec accelerated the generation of ross thus increased concentrations of pms enhanced rhb oxidation 3 4 effect of initial dye concentration rhb decolourisation was investigated as a function of initial dye concentration as shown in fig 3 b the decolourisation rate and efficiency increased with decreasing initial dye concentration rhb was almost completely decolourised within 30 min at initial rhb concentrations below 100 mg l 1 whereas approximately 90 5 of rhb was removed at an initial concentration of 200 mg l 1 the rate constants were 0 18 min 1 0 15 min 1 and 0 085 min 1 for initial concentrations of 50 mg l 1 100 mg l 1 and 200 mg l 1 respectively table s2 pms dosage and current density were kept constant and the amount of ross generated in the dye solution remained constant hence more time was needed to achieve the same decolourisation effect at higher rhb concentrations 3 5 effect of current density the effect of applied current density was evaluated at 6 10 14 and 18 ma cm 2 and the results are illustrated in fig 3 c decolourisation efficiency improved when the current density increased from 6 to 10 ma cm 2 however further increases in the current density to 14 and 18 ma cm 2 led to decreased decolourisation efficiencies the rate constants for these conditions exhibited a similar trend k increased from 0 11 min 1 to 0 15 min 1 at applied current densities of 6 and 10 ma cm 2 respectively then decreased to 0 092 min 1 and 0 079 min 1 at 14 and 18 ma cm 2 respectively because electron transfer improves with increasing current density at lower densities increasing current densities would provide more opportunities to produce oxidic reactants such as hydrogen peroxide as shown in eqs 3 7 thus accelerating the decolourising reaction however at high current densities the consumption of oxidation material is favoured eq 6 which reduces the concentration of h2o2 in the wastewater solution 35 48 3 hso5 e so4 oh 4 h2o oh h e 5 2h2o h2o2 2h e 6 2h2o o2 4h 4e 7 o2 2h 2e h2o2 8 h2o2 2h 2e 2 h2o 3 6 effect of initial ph the decolourisation efficiency of rhb was investigated at different initial ph values 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 0 and 10 0 as shown in fig 3 d the best decolourisation efficiency was obtained at around the point of zero charge phzpc of nico2o4 when the initial ph decreased from 6 to 2 the decolourisation efficiency decreased and k changed from 0 16 to 0 060 min 1 when the initial ph increased from 6 0 to 10 0 the decolourisation rate and efficiency decreased within the first 10 min then the decolourisation rate started to increase and efficiencies were almost the same as that of ph 6 after 30 min decolourisation is affected by three factors i the existing form of pms ii the surface charge property of the electrode and iii the existing form of rhb first the form of pms existing in solution is mainly determined by solution ph and the dissociation constant pka of pms which was reported to be 9 4 49 thus hso5 is the main species in acid and neutral solutions second the point of zero charge phzpc of nico2o4 is essential to the surface charge it has been reported that the phzpc of nico2o4 is approximately 6 50 the surface of the nico2o4 electrode was positively charged when the solution ph was below 6 whereas it was negatively charged when ph was above 6 third rhb has the form rhb or rhb depending on ph and pka2 51 when the ph is below pka2 3 7 the amino group is positively charged and rhb is formed when the ph is above 3 7 the amino group is protonated and thus forms zwitterionic form rhb in this decolourisation process when the ph is below 6 the repulsion between positively charged nico2o4 and rhb would inhibit the adsorption of rhb on the electrode surface thus decreasing the degradation rate furthermore more h ions would scavenge the generated so4 and oh ions limiting the removal rate 52 when the ph is greater than 6 the surface of nico2o4 becomes negative due to deprotonation although the combination of nico2o4 and rhb is not prevented the difficulty for hso5 to be adsorbed on nico2o4 surface reduces the decolourisation process in this study the decolourisation rate increased suddenly after 10 min for alkaline conditions this may be attributed to the h ions generated from pms in the system which reduced the ph to a value close to phzpc 3 7 reusability evaluation reusability of the nico2o4 electrode was investigated and the results are shown in fig 4 decolourisation efficiencies were 99 8 94 6 89 3 and 89 2 at 60 min for the first second third and fourth cycles respectively thus exhibiting good recyclability deactivation of the electrode resulted from cobalt leaching and intermediate products adsorbed on the electrode surface 53 the leaching ions in solution were detected by icp ms the leaching ratios of co and ni ions in the system were 0 028 and 0 085 respectively which indicates negligible metal leaching however in this study reusability tests were conducted on the recycled electrodes after simple washing it has been reported that additional annealing in inert gas can remove adsorbed organics to recover the activity of the electrode 10 22 future work will focus on methods of reactivating used electrodes in our laboratory 3 8 mechanism of decolourisation 3 8 1 xps study to elucidate the mechanism of pms activation at the nico2o4 electrode xps analyses were conducted on both fresh and cycled nico2o4 electrodes as shown in fig 5 slight peak shifts were observed for both co 2p and ni 2p when the fresh and cycled samples were compared indicating that valence states changed during activation the co 2p high resolution spectra for fresh and cycled samples exhibited two spin orbit doublets characteristic of co ii and co iii as well as two shake up satellites gaussian fitting indicated that the ratio of co iii co ii for fresh and cycled electrodes changed from 0 42 to 0 60 implying part of co ii was converted to co iii after use similarly the ni 2p spectra comprised two spin orbit doublets for ni ii and ni iii and two shake up satellites the ratio of ni iii ni ii for the fresh electrodes was 4 8 and that for the cycled electrodes was 6 8 the o 1s spectrum contained four oxygen contributions denoted as o1 o2 o3 and o4 for the fresh electrode the o1 peak at 528 9 ev is ascribed to metal oxygen bonds mo the peak at 530 6 ev o2 is attributed to the hydroxyl group oxygen oh the o3 peak observed at 531 6 ev corresponds to oxygen atoms in defects and the o4 peak at 533 1 ev is consistent with the multiplicity of physically or chemically absorbed water on the surface 40 a significant change was observed in the ratio of oh to mo peaks for the cycled electrode an increase in the ratio from 0 67 to 1 60 suggests that oh was generated during activation 7 these results show that the oxidation of surface m ii to m iii happened for activation pms 3 8 2 identification of ross with radical scavengers to identify the major active radicals in the system scavenging experiments were conducted with various radical scavengers such as p benzoquinone histidine methanol and tert butyl alcohol tba with the same concentration of 20 mm p benzoquinone is a scavenger for the superoxide anion radical o2 k 9 0 108 m 1 s 1 54 histidine scavenges for singlet oxygen 1o2 k 3 2 108 m 1 s 1 55 methanol can capture both oh and so4 k 2 5 107 m 1 s 1 and 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 respectively 56 whereas tba is a more effective scavenger of oh k 6 0 108 m 1 s 1 than of so4 k 4 0 105 m 1 s 1 33 as displayed in fig 6 compared to the process without a scavenger the efficiency of rhb decolourisation decreased slightly in the presence of methanol and tba as reflected in rhb removal efficiencies of 99 4 99 0 and 98 5 respectively however p benzoquinone and histidine significantly inhibited decomposition decolourisation efficiency decreased to 62 4 after adding p benzoquinone an even lower efficiency of 31 5 was obtained with histidine the existence of 1o2 was confirmed by using dpa as the probe dpa can indicate the presence of 1o2 due to the rapid reaction between dpa and 1o2 which decreases the absorbance in the range of 320 420 nm 42 fig 7 a demonstrates a decrease of absorption bands in uv vis spectra of dpa with increasing electrolysis time proving the existence of 1o2 in the nico2o4 pmc ec system similarly nbt measurements were applied to detect o2 fig 7 b in the nico2o4 pmc ec system the absorption band at 255 nm weakened over time which indicates nbt was consumed by o2 in the environment these results suggest that although both so4 and oh radicals contributed somewhat to the degradation o2 and 1o2 played major roles in the degradation process using these results we propose the mechanism illustrated in fig 8 and eqs 3 20 16 27 46 which states that rhb degradation occurs via a pms activation process that combines electrochemical activation and chemical activation with generated radicals and nonradicals first ec contributes to the degradation of rhb pms can be activated by ec though eq 3 to generate sulphate radicals meanwhile h2o is easily discharged on the electrode surface leading to the formation of oh eq 4 furthermore h2o2 is produced from water electrolysis eqs 5 7 these species are powerful oxidants that can degrade organic matter in wastewater second pms can be activated by a catalytic process on nico2o4 the negatively charged nico2o4 electrode arouses the adsorption of rhb and pms followed by an activation reaction between nico2o4 and pms as illustrated in eq 9 partial so4 can react with h2o via eq 12 to generate oh later h2o2 the product reacted from eqs 13 14 readily generates o2 according to eqs 15 17 meanwhile self decomposition of pms occurs slowly to generate 1o2 via the process shown in eq 18 57 59 the generated oh and o2 can also react with each other to form 1o2 eqs 19 20 which could be the main pathway for 1o2 generation 17 together with so4 and oh these radical and nonradical species attack and degrade rhb rapidly which is then absorbed on the electrode third the chemical activation of pms is effectively enhanced with the assistance of ec when m ii co or ni reacts with pms to generate so4 the oxidation of m ii to m iii eq 9 occurs m ii can be regenerated according to the reaction shown in eq 10 at a rate much slower than the rate of consumption of m ii eq 9 60 as a result eq 10 is the rate limiting step for chemical activation of pms with co or ni however in the ec and nico2o4 system m iii can be reduced to m ii at the electrode eq 11 thus the electroreduction of m iii to active m ii is significantly improved and the recycling of the reaction can be continuous therefore a synergistic effect between catalytic activation and ec activation for pms is formed 9 m ii hso5 m iii so4 h2o 10 m iii hso5 m ii so5 h2o 11 m iii e m ii 12 h2o so4 so4 2 oh h 13 hso5 h2o hso4 h2o2 14 so5 2 h2o so4 2 h2o2 15 h2o2 h ho2 16 h2o2 oh ho2 h2o 17 ho2 h o2 18 hso5 so5 hso4 so4 2 1o2 19 o2 oh 1o2 oh 20 2o2 2h 1o2 h2o2 4 conclusions in this study nico2o4 nanoarrays prepared via a hydrothermal method were used as high efficiency electrodes to activate pms to decolour an rhb solution compared to co3o4 pms ec ti pms ec nico2o4 pms and nico2o4 ec systems the nico2o4 pmc ec system exhibited the highest decolourisation rate and efficiency its excellent performance can be attributed to the outstanding catalytic ability of nico2o4 combined with electrochemical oxidation and advanced oxidation processes ros experiments indicated that o2 and 1o2 contributed primarily to the oxidation of rhb so4 and oh were also reactive radicals in the system our method represents an important new strategy to improve the efficiency of advanced oxidation

use behaviors toilet flushing clothes washing bathing showering and cleaning and associated greenhouse gas emissions and environmental costs six hundred and fifty face to face interviews were conducted in 12 districts of taipei the results showed that the respondents individual attributes were not significantly related to water use behaviors the highest volume of water was used for cleaning 27 7 followed by clothes washing 26 2 bathing showering 26 1 and toilet flushing 20 0 five water management scenarios with 5 20 reductions in water volume from different water use behaviors were simulated the maximum reduction in water use 6 27 t was found in the fifth scenario 20 reduction which reflected the priority the respondents gave to save water if its price increased 27 2 of respondents had water saving appliances 20 5 and 16 4 of the appliances were toilets and shower heads respectively the environmental cost of ghg emissions associated with water use behavior was us 0

the world accounting for one sixth of the global land area 1 and more than 740 million people live on these islands 2 small islands comprising over one sixth of the global land area are facing struggles associated with global climate change taiwan has a population of 23 8 million and an average gdp of us 27 437 capita in 2020 3 the unique topographical and geological characteristics in taiwan affect water availability water use and conservation about two thirds of the island is mountainous which means that water flows into the ocean quickly and cannot easily be stored total rainfall is hugely different in the dry and wet seasons november to april and may to october respectively leading to water shortages in the dry season in addition extreme events such as typhoons increase the deposition of sand and rock in rivers and reservoirs gradually reducing their storage volumes and increasing water turbidity furthermore the groundwater in southern taiwan has been over pumped for years due to the development of agricultural and aquacultural industries domestic use accounts for only 19 of freshwater usage with industry and agriculture accounting for 9 and 72 respectively 4 taiwan is already struggling to meet the growing demand for water particularly in summer the residential water demand will continue to grow due to urbanization households are high consumers of water and are therefore important sites for water conservation 5 6 domestic water consumption in most developed countries is higher than the 85 or 100 l d specified as being sufficient to fully meet household water requirements 7 it ranges from as low as 120 l capita d in the netherlands 8 to 144 l capita d in the uk 9 250 l capita d in taiwan 10 and 371 l capita d in the usa 11 researchers have investigated household water consumption by types of appliance 12 and behavior 13 previous findings confirm that attributes including gender 14 age 15 education 16 and income 17 significantly affect household water consumption women are more likely to participate in environmental behavior and activism such as water resources conservation age is inversely related to environmental concern in other words younger people are more likely to engage in environmental behaviors 18 however chenoweth et al 7 reported that older water users were slightly more likely to consider water saving options people with a higher level of education often consume more water 19 in one study as income level increased so did reported participation in water conservation 18 household water use can help make water consumption a key indicator of human behavior 20 water saving behavior can be sorted into similar groups based on location indoor or outdoor and behavior type efficiency curtailment or maintenance 21 however water use behavior has not been fully assessed even though it can lead to considerable reductions in water consumption 13 household water use is frequently assessed by questionnaire or established models yu et al 19 used a face to face interview method to estimate residential water use associated with three types of behavior bathing cooking and cleaning they found a strong correlation between water use and energy consumption chenoweth et al 7 investigated the links between household water consumption and wellbeing in southern england via a household survey the results showed that actual water use appears to be unlinked to willingness to adopt water saving measures wolter 18 conducted a survey in oregon and found that environmental concern and sociodemographic attributes predicted water conservation behaviors daioglou et al 22 modeled domestic water demand at the end use level and indicated that cooking was the main end use function other functions such as space heating and cooling appliances become more important ren et al 23 developed a tool to predict energy consumption at the end use level and related greenhouse gas ghg emissions of australian households researchers further compared energy related ghg emissions from the water systems of various cities without analyzing the behavior of end users 24 26 the pumping treatment and distribution processes in water systems are the major contributors to ghg emissions 27 ghg emissions is a prominent environmental indicator that primarily determines the sustainability of urban water systems studies have indicated that water conservation at the household level is one of the effective ways to reduce ghg emissions originating from water systems 28 system dynamics sd modeling has been used to evaluate environmental and water systems at various scales the sd model introduced by jay forrester in the 1960s is a well established methodology for understanding visualizing and analyzing complex dynamic feedback systems 29 it attempts to quantify qualitative aspects without altering the accuracy of the original statement providing a much more explicit basis for communication 30 sd models are useful for considering dynamic interrelationship among variables within social and economic systems 31 water resources quantity and quality are integrated with five sectors that drive industrial growth population agriculture economy nonrenewable resources and persistent pollution 32 an sd model was used to increase public understanding of the value of water conservation in las vegas 33 the results of sd model simulations show that water scarcity unlike other limitations such as nonrenewable resources and persistent pollution results in severe problems within a short time of its occurrence 34 qi and chang 35 proposed an sd model based on a coupled modeling structure that takes into account the interactions among economic and social dimensions offering a realistic platform for practical use a reservoir balance sd model was developed and presented for the pedra e othoni reservoir in italy to assess resilience to climate and development changes 36 an sd model to evaluate the water energy food nexus at the household scale was developed by hussien et al 37 the model successfully estimated a water energy food demand and the impact of change in user behavior diet income family size and climate more work is needed to develop systematic and detailed approaches to assess household water use in terms of ghg emissions and environmental costs the aim of this study was to develop an integrated sd model addressing the interactions between household water use and ghg emissions at the household scale taking taipei city as a case study the model captures more water use behaviors including toilet flushing clothes washing bathing showering and cleaning than previous studies the number of water saving appliances and the priority given to saving water with different appliances were also innovatively evaluated in this study the potential ghg emissions were internalized into environmental costs to reflect increases in the water price the price of water has a direct influence on household water use 38 39 unlike tax 40 otherwise water has been considered as a natural resource with little economic and utilization values 41 this kind of research is needed to better understand household behaviors regarding the use of potable water globally emissions of ghg can be mitigated by taking a bottom up approach 2 materials and methods 2 1 system boundaries used in this study taipei city which has a high water quality standard total coliform 1 cfu ml turbidity 0 1 ntu heavy metal and nitrite nitrogen are none detected 42 was taken as a case study the city has 12 districts fig 1 and 2 69 million residents with us 48 400 captia gdp on average 3 ghg emissions from the water supply system have been evaluated in several published studies as noted in the introduction this study focused on ghg emissions caused by different household water use behaviors respondents were asked to complete a questionnaire about their water use the results of the questionnaire were incorporated into an sd model the water quality in households reached the government s quality standard with little variation and therefore is not discussed in this study 2 2 the survey face to face surveys can be clearly structured flexible and adaptable 43 in this study at least 384 questionnaires were required when applying a convenience sampling method with a 95 confidence interval therefore six hundred and fifty face to face interviews were conducted during the spring vacation april 1 to april 8 of 2018 in different districts of taipei city the questionnaire which could be completed within 5 min consisted of three sections the first section collected information about the houses owned by the respondents such as age and floor area it was based on a survey of hong kong residents 44 the second section contained seventeen questions about the respondents water use behavior the questions were designed with reference to shan et al 45 and covered frequencies of bathing showering drinking water and cleaning the number of water saving appliances e g low flow taps and or shower heads dual flush toilet was also recorded the respondents were also asked about the priority they would give to saving water if the water price increased the final section elicited the respondents socio economic information such as gender income age and education 2 3 formulation of system dynamics model an sd model is constructed from building blocks variables and includes four main components stocks flows connectors and converters fig 2 stock variables symbolized by rectangles are the state variables and they represent the accumulation water in the system flow variables symbolized by valves are the rate of change in stock variables and they represent those activities and decision functions that fill up or drain the stocks converters represented by circles are intermediate variables used for miscellaneous calculations finally the connectors represented by simple arrows are information links representing the cause and effects within the model an example relating to household water volume is as follows the overall volume of water used for clothes washing depends on the water volume used each time and the frequency of clothes washing fig 2 the mathematical mapping of an sd stock flow diagram occurs via a system of differential equations which are solved numerically in the simulation the specifications of the sd model are shown in table s1 six equations were modeled using stella software in this study the year 2018 was taken as the base time and 12 year simulations from 2019 to 2030 with a step size time variable of 1 year were modeled 2 4 calculation of water volume and its associated ghg emissions household water use in taiwan can be divided into five major categories toilet flushing clothes washing bathing showering cleaning and other uses 10 the categories of cleaning and other uses were frequently confused by respondents in pretests of the survey and were integrated in this study the detailed calculations of water volume are described below 2 4 1 calculation of water use volume the formulae to calculate water use volume was based on yu et al 19 and redesigned as follows 1 v f l u s h α f f α q f α β f f β q f β p 365 where v f l u s h is water volume used for toilet flushing l y f f α and f f β are the frequency of toilet flushing times capita d q f α and q f β are the water volume of toilet flushing l times α is the percentage of households that own water saving toilets β is the percentage of households without water saving toilets equal to 1 α p is the population of taipei city equal to 2 688 430 in 2018 46 and 365 is the conversion factor from year to day 2 v c l o t h f c q c p 365 where v c l o t h is water volume used for clothes washing l y f c is the frequency of clothes washing times capita d and q c is the water volume of clothes washing l times clothes washing is not classified with without water saving appliances by the government in 2018 3 v b a t h α f s α q s α β f s β q s β f b q b p 365 where v b a t h is bath shower volume l y with or without water saving appliances f s α and f s β are the frequency of taking a shower times capita d q s α and q s β are the water volume of taking a shower l times f b is the frequency of taking a bath times capita d and q b is the water volume of taking a bath l times 4 v c l e a n v c l e a n v o t h e r p 365 where v c l e a n and v o t h e r are water volume for cleaning and other purposes respectively l y 2 4 2 calculation of ghg emissions therefore ghg emissions from household water use can be calculated as follows 5 g h g v i 1 7 10 4 where v i is water volume and i can stand for toilet flushing clothes washing bathing showering or cleaning l y one ton of tap water has been reported to produce 0 17 kg co2 eq ghgs in 2018 47 therefore the converting factor is 1 7 10 4 t co2 eq l y in this study 2 5 calculation of environmental cost the ghg calculations are mainly used to represent environmental costs as monetary values the environmental costs e c g h g us of ghg emissions can be calculated as follows 48 6 e c g h g p i t q c f t 1 r t where p i t is the carbon price at year t us t co2 eq for the year of 2018 the carbon price announced by the european union emission trading scheme eu ets was 5 76 eur t co2 eq equal to 7 02 us t co2 eq 49 q c f t is the ghg emission from unit water volume each year t co2 eq y and r is the discount rate of 4 0 48 therefore the water price in terms of the environmental costs of ghgs is as follows 7 w a t e r p r i c e p v e c g h g a 1 where p v is the operating and maintenance costs us and a is the external profits of the water department currently the operating and maintenance costs in taiwan are us 0 33 t and basic external profits for the water company should be 8 50 2 6 water saving scenarios it is known that water saving measures and or appliances can reduce water usage by 5 20 51 therefore this study simulated five different water management scenarios fig 3 5 10 15 and 20 reductions in water volume from different water use behaviors and a scenario to reduce 20 water volume in which respondents gave priority to saving water if the water price increased 3 results and discussion 3 1 results of the survey an effective water management system must be accepted by the public 52 the 650 randomly sampled people resided in 12 different districts of taipei city among the questionnaires 409 63 were suitable for analysis 37 were excluded due to non responses as shown in table 1 30 of the sample was male and 70 was female 40 5 of the respondents had four family members i e two children in the family 65 7 of the respondents were educated to college level and 48 1 were aged between 16 and 25 the monthly income of half of the respondents ranged from us 667 to us 1 667 the respondents individual attributes gender age education and income were cross analyzed with their water use behaviors it is interesting that 73 of the respondents said they took less than 30 s to wash their hands 1 3 min for cleaning and 3 5 min to take a bath shower the unicef 53 suggests to scrub all surfaces of the hands for at least 20 s to protect against coronavirus covid 19 which was successfully controlled in taiwan the promotion of population s awareness of hand washing will still provide the greatest benefit to mitigate the pandemic 54 male respondents took shorter showers than female respondents in this study high school students took longer baths showers than college students did confirming the finding of yu et al 19 that older people use less bathing water respondents with an income level between us 667 and us 1667 would take 10 20 min shower versus other respondents 5 10 min the water used for clothes washing and shower is greater for lower income areas 55 in other words higher levels of income demonstrated more engagement in water conservation behaviors 56 57 rosinger et al 58 found that income was linearly associated with tap water consumption among us citizens however the individual attributes were not significantly related to water use behaviors in this study 3 2 water volumes associated with different water use behaviors in this study 27 7 of water volume was used for cleaning followed by clothes washing 26 2 bathing showering 26 1 and toilet flushing 20 0 fig 4 in the netherlands a population survey indicated that the main end uses of household water were showering 40 toilet flushing 28 and clothes washing 12 8 an analysis of the north american residential end uses of water study indicated that the top three indoor end uses of water were toilet flushing 26 7 clothes washing 21 7 and showering 16 8 59 the amount of water for lawn and landscape irrigation is rapidly increasing in the us and is estimated at a total of 9 billion gallons per day nationwide 56 average water end use consumption in australia has been reported as showering 25 outdoor uses 21 9 taps 19 0 clothes washing 17 6 and toilet flushing 12 7 60 garden watering and showering are two of the largest contributors to water use in households in australia 61 in poland water used for showering and clothes washing accounts for 40 and 12 of total household water use respectively 45 showering is the greatest consumer of domestic water in portugal accounting for 38 of total water consumption 13 taiwan s water resources agency 62 found that toilet flushing 27 clothes washing 21 and bathing showering 20 were the highest contributors to household water use fig 4 in this study the volume of water used for toilet flushing had reduced to 7 perhaps because of an increase in the use of water saving appliances during the past 10 years other water use behaviors were increased as shown in table 2 27 2 of respondents had water saving appliances 20 5 and 16 4 of the appliances were toilets and shower heads respectively asian countries like korea japan and taiwan had 20 24 water saving toilets however other europe countries had higher percentage of using water saving toilet 63 a saving of 3 l can be made each time a water saving toilet is used most respondents reported using 48 l and 150 l each time for clothes washing and bathing respectively family size and seasons were positive related to frequency of clothes washing 19 taking a shower with or without a water saving shower head would save ca 30 60 water compared to bathing showering frequency rather than duration played a dominant role in use of water for bathing 19 the participants in this study used 49 7 l d for cleaning the average volume of water used for cleaning was 40 3 l d in taiwan in the past 10 years 62 water use efficiency can be significantly increased by the installation of more efficient water use devices 13 for example solar hot water systems are marketed to households on the basis of reduced energy costs through reduced ghg emissions 64 some households adopt water saving appliances and practices to continue their high consumption habits 56 65 3 3 results of different water saving scenarios kenway 66 found that behavioral changes play a vital role in water savings and ghg emissions different water use behaviors will have their own best water saving scenarios as shown in fig 5 the highest reduction in water volume 6 27 t was reached in the fifth scenario which reflected the priority respondents gave to saving water if the price increased the 5 20 water volume reduction from different water use behaviors would only reduce water use by 1 52 t first scenario to 5 32 t fourth scenario the water volume reduces very fast in the first 5 years 2019 2023 and stays steady in the following years showing that water saving measures or strategies would lead to targets being met in a short time fig 6 the reduction in water used by toilet flushing was highest in the fourth scenario in which 1 1 t was saved during the study period the reduction in water used for clothes washing was lower in the fifth scenario 0 76 t than in the fourth scenario 1 4 t the volume of water used for clothes washing may be limited by the size of washing machines that only work when there is a full load other water use behaviors would be related to the targets for water use reduction the volume of water used for bathing showering and cleaning would reduce by 0 4 1 9 and 0 4 2 5 t respectively in the different scenarios shove s 67 work on changes in showering practices in the uk over time is particularly important domestic water saving may be increased through economic incentives technical improvements or policy instruments and regulations 41 in sum establishing water saving targets for different water use behavior depending on water prices would be more efficient than a single target which is frequently applied by the government as water reuse systems are less efficient than conventional water supply systems 68 this option is not suggested in this study 3 4 results of environmental costs the environmental cost of ghg emissions from water use behavior was us 0 001 t in 2018 the direct and indirect costs of water management in taiwan are ca us 0 3 t and us 0 01 t respectively 50 the direct costs are incurred by purifying treating supplying and managing water resources the indirect costs include employee training disaster losses retirement and interest the water price would be increased to us 0 33 t according to eq 7 after monetizing the environmental costs of ghg emissions us 0 001 t an 8 increase was accepted by respondents in this study if the government keeps providing clean and safe water resources in taiwan the majority 80 of survey respondents are willing to pay 100 240 of the household monthly water bill for reliable water service in banda aceh indonesia 69 houtven et al 70 suggested that households are willing to pay approximately us 3 30 per month for improvements in water access expenditure on water in taiwan was the third from last when water price was divided by gdp for different countries 71 facing a price increase households will generally adjust their consumption by reducing it renwick and archibald 72 found that marginal water price had a strong effect on the number of water efficient devices in households however some people would be willing to pay extra not to compromise their daily showering rituals 61 the water price should be increased to reflect environmental costs not only ghg emissions but also the costs of protection conservation the costs of water scarcity could reach 6 of gdp in some regions 73 pricing has been found to be a cost effective tool for promoting water conservation 74 in addition environmental education and attitudinal change might be more effective in influencing water use 7 it is advisable to educate general public the importance advantage of water and alterative water resources 75 4 conclusions taiwan is a small island surrounded by sea domestic water use accounts for only 19 of total freshwater usage in taiwan ghg emissions from water systems have received attention as a prominent environmental indicator in recent years an integrated sd model addressing the interactions between household water use and ghg emissions was therefore developed in this study taking taipei city as a case study the model captures different behaviors including toilet flushing clothes washing bathing showering and cleaning potential ghg emissions were represented as environmental costs to reflect an increase in water price a total of 650 face to face interviews were conducted during the spring vacation april 1 to april 4 of 2018 in 12 districts of taipei city the results revealed that the respondents individual attributes were not significantly related to water use behaviors the largest volume of water 27 7 was used for cleaning followed by clothes washing 26 2 bathing showering 26 1 and toilet flushing 20 0 five different water management scenarios with 5 20 reductions in water volume from different water use behaviors were modeled it is appropriate to establish water saving targets within 5 years the maximum reduction in water use 6 27 t was found in the fifth scenario which reflected the priority respondents gave to saving water if the water price increased the environmental cost of ghg emissions associated with water use behavior was us 0 001 t causing an 8 cost increase which was acceptable to the respondents in this study further research of this kind is needed to better understand household behaviors

the world accounting for one sixth of the global land area 1 and more than 740 million people live on these islands 2 small islands comprising over one sixth of the global land area are facing struggles associated with global climate change taiwan has a population of 23 8 million and an average gdp of us 27 437 capita in 2020 3 the unique topographical and geological characteristics in taiwan affect water availability water use and conservation about two thirds of the island is mountainous which means that water flows into the ocean quickly and cannot easily be stored total rainfall is hugely different in the dry and wet seasons november to april and may to october respectively leading to water shortages in the dry season in addition extreme events such as typhoons increase the deposition of sand and rock in rivers and reservoirs gradually reducing their storage volumes and increasing water turbidity furthermore the groundwater in southern taiwan has been over pumped for years due to the development of agricultural and aquacultural industries domestic use accounts for only 19 of freshwater usage with industry and agriculture accounting for 9 and 72 respectively 4 taiwan is already struggling to meet the growing demand for water particularly in summer the residential water demand will continue to grow due to urbanization households are high consumers of water and are therefore important sites for water conservation 5 6 domestic water consumption in most developed countries is higher than the 85 or 100 l d specified as being sufficient to fully meet

by 5 20 51 therefore this study simulated five different water management scenarios fig 3 5 10 15 and 20 reductions in water volume from different water use behaviors and a scenario to reduce 20 water volume in which respondents gave priority to saving water if the water price increased 3 results and discussion 3 1 results of the survey an effective water management system must be accepted by the public 52 the 650 randomly sampled people resided in 12 different districts of taipei city among the questionnaires 409 63 were suitable for analysis 37 were excluded due to non responses as shown in table 1 30 of the sample was male and 70 was female 40 5 of the respondents had four family members i e two children in the family 65 7 of the respondents were educated to college level and 48 1 were aged between 16 and 25 the monthly income of half of the respondents ranged from us 667 to us 1 667 the respondents individual attributes gender age education and income were cross analyzed with their water use behaviors it is interesting that 73 of the respondents said they took less than 30 s to wash their hands 1 3 min for cleaning and 3 5 min to take a bath shower the unicef 53 suggests to scrub all surfaces of the hands for at least 20 s to protect against coronavirus covid 19 which was successfully controlled in taiwan the promotion of population s awareness of hand washing will still provide the greatest benefit to mitigate the pandemic 54 male respondents took shorter showers than female respondents in this study high school students took longer baths showers than college students did confirming the finding of yu et al 19 that older people use less bathing water respondents with an income level between us 667 and us 1667 would take 10 20 min shower versus other respondents 5 10 min the water used for clothes washing and shower is greater for lower income areas 55 in other words higher levels of income demonstrated more engagement in water conservation behaviors 56 57 rosinger et al 58 found that income was linearly associated with tap water consumption among us citizens however the individual attributes were not significantly related to water use behaviors in this study 3 2 water volumes associated with different water use behaviors in this study 27 7 of water volume was used for cleaning followed by clothes washing 26 2 bathing showering 26 1 and toilet flushing 20 0 fig 4 in the netherlands a population survey indicated that the main end uses of household water were showering 40 toilet flushing 28 and clothes washing 12 8 an analysis of the north american residential end uses of water study indicated that the top three indoor end uses of water were toilet flushing 26 7 clothes washing 21 7 and showering 16 8 59 the amount of water for lawn and landscape irrigation is rapidly increasing in the us and is estimated at a total of 9 billion gallons per day nationwide 56 average water end use consumption in australia has been reported as showering 25 outdoor uses 21 9 taps 19 0 clothes washing 17 6 and toilet flushing 12 7 60 garden watering and showering are two of the largest contributors to water use in households in australia 61 in poland water used for showering and clothes washing accounts for 40 and 12 of total household water use respectively 45 showering is the greatest consumer of domestic water in portugal accounting for 38 of total water consumption 13 taiwan s water resources agency 62 found that toilet flushing 27 clothes washing 21 and bathing showering 20 were the highest contributors to household water use fig 4 in this study the volume of water used for toilet flushing had reduced to 7 perhaps because of an increase in the use of water saving appliances during the past 10 years other water use behaviors were increased as shown in table 2 27 2 of respondents had water saving appliances 20 5 and 16 4 of the appliances were toilets and shower heads respectively asian countries like korea japan and taiwan had 20 24 water saving toilets however other europe countries had higher percentage of using water saving toilet 63 a saving of 3 l can be made each time a water saving toilet is used most respondents reported using 48 l and 150 l each time for clothes washing and bathing respectively family size and seasons were positive related to frequency of clothes washing 19 taking a shower with or without a water saving shower head would save ca 30 60 water compared to bathing showering frequency rather than duration played a dominant role in use of water for bathing 19 the participants in this study used 49 7 l d for cleaning the average volume of water used for cleaning was 40 3 l d in taiwan in the past 10 years 62 water use efficiency can be significantly increased by the installation of more efficient water use devices 13 for example solar hot water systems are marketed to households on the basis of reduced energy costs through reduced ghg emissions 64 some households adopt water saving appliances and practices to continue their high consumption habits 56 65 3 3 results of different water saving scenarios kenway 66 found that behavioral changes play a vital role in water savings and ghg emissions different water use behaviors will have their own best water saving scenarios as shown in fig 5 the highest reduction in water volume 6 27 t was reached in the fifth scenario which reflected the priority respondents gave to saving water if the price increased the 5 20 water volume reduction from different water use behaviors would only reduce water use by 1 52 t first scenario to 5 32 t fourth scenario the water volume reduces very fast in the first 5 years 2019 2023 and stays steady in the following years showing that water saving measures or strategies would lead to targets being met in a short time fig 6 the reduction in water used by toilet flushing was highest in the fourth scenario in which 1 1 t was saved during the study period the reduction in water used for clothes washing was lower in the fifth scenario 0 76 t than in the fourth scenario 1 4 t the volume of water used for clothes washing may be limited by the size of washing machines that only work when there is a full load other water use behaviors would be related to the targets for water use reduction the volume of water used for bathing showering and cleaning would reduce by 0 4 1 9 and 0 4 2 5 t respectively in the different scenarios shove s 67 work on changes in showering practices in the uk over time is particularly important domestic water saving may be increased through economic incentives technical improvements or policy instruments and regulations 41 in sum establishing water saving targets for different water use behavior depending on water prices would be more efficient than a single target which is frequently applied by the government as water reuse systems are less efficient than conventional water supply systems 68 this option is not suggested in this study 3 4 results of environmental costs the environmental cost of ghg emissions from water use behavior was us 0 001 t in 2018 the direct and indirect costs of water management in taiwan are ca us 0 3 t and us 0 01 t respectively 50 the direct costs are incurred by purifying treating supplying and managing water resources the indirect costs include employee training disaster losses retirement and interest the water price would be increased to us 0 33 t according to eq 7 after monetizing the environmental costs of ghg emissions us 0 001 t an 8 increase was accepted by respondents in this study if the government keeps providing clean and safe water resources in taiwan the majority 80 of survey respondents are willing to pay 100 240 of the household monthly water bill for reliable water service in banda aceh indonesia 69 houtven et al 70 suggested that households are willing to pay approximately us 3 30 per month for improvements in water access expenditure on water in taiwan was the third from last when water price was divided by gdp for different countries 71 facing a price increase households will generally adjust their consumption by reducing it renwick and archibald 72 found that marginal water price had a strong effect on the number of water efficient devices in households however some people would be willing to pay extra not to compromise their daily showering rituals 61 the water price should be increased to reflect environmental costs not only ghg emissions but also the costs of protection conservation the costs of water scarcity could reach 6 of gdp in some regions 73 pricing has been found to be a cost effective tool for promoting water conservation 74 in addition environmental education and attitudinal change might be more effective in influencing water use 7 it is advisable to educate general public the importance advantage of water and alterative water resources 75 4 conclusions taiwan is a small island surrounded by sea domestic water use accounts for only 19 of total freshwater usage in taiwan ghg emissions from water systems have received attention as a prominent environmental indicator in recent years an integrated sd model addressing the interactions between household water use and ghg emissions was therefore developed in this study taking taipei city as a case study the model captures different behaviors including toilet flushing clothes washing bathing showering and cleaning potential ghg emissions were represented as environmental costs to reflect an increase in water price a total of 650 face to face interviews were conducted during the spring vacation april 1 to april 4 of 2018 in 12 districts of taipei city the results revealed that the respondents individual attributes were not significantly related to water use behaviors the largest volume of water 27 7 was used for cleaning followed by clothes washing 26 2 bathing showering 26 1 and toilet flushing 20 0 five different water management scenarios with 5 20 reductions in water volume from different water use behaviors were modeled it is appropriate to establish water saving targets within 5 years the maximum reduction in water use 6 27 t was found in the fifth scenario which reflected the priority respondents gave to saving water if the water price increased the environmental cost of ghg emissions associated with water use behavior was us 0 001 t causing an 8 cost increase which was acceptable to the respondents in this study further research of this kind is needed to better understand household behaviors

13864,combined ion exchange cix treatment of wastewater effluent and ion exchange regeneration using flue gas carbon dioxide co2 was investigated as a way of beneficially joining the water and energy sectors cix treatment removed calcium magnesium sulfate nitrate phosphate and dissolved organic carbon from wastewater effluent regeneration of cix using sodium chloride sodium bicarbonate hydrochloric acid and co2 was investigated carbon dioxide had a lower regeneration efficiency compared with the other regeneration solutions alternative co2 regeneration conditions were evaluated to gain insight on the effects of increased gas pressure increased contact time and increased rate of co2 dissolution on regeneration efficiency keywords carbon dioxide cooling water hardness power plants sustainability 1 introduction the thermoelectric power generation sector constitutes the single largest sector for fresh water withdrawal in the united states with water being used primarily for cooling 1 however with climate change impacting water supplies there is increasing interest in alternative sources for cooling water of interest is treated municipal wastewater as an alternative make up for industrial cooling water 2 5 for thermoelectric power plants li et al 5 estimated that approximately 50 of the existing power plants in the u s can obtain enough cooling water from publicly owned treatment works within a 10 mi 16 km radius of the plant with that number increasing to 76 if the radius is extended to 25 mi 40 km for proposed power plants utilizing recirculating cooling nearly all 97 are estimated to be able to obtain enough water from publicly owned treatment works within a 25 mi 40 km radius of the power plant 5 however when treated municipal wastewater is used for cooling it is critical to control fouling scaling and corrosion tertiary treatment whether at the wastewater plant or power plant can be used to improve the quality of wastewater before it is used for cooling 5 14 combined ion exchange cix is a low energy water treatment process that can remove multiple types of contaminants from water including hardness nitrate perchlorate and dissolved organic matter 15 17 additionally previous work shows that cix is flexible and can use a single vessel of cation exchange resin cer and anion exchange resin aer or cer and aer vessels in series 16 18 in some cases combining cer and aer in the same vessel can improve the regeneration of one or both resins 19 hence cix offers a simple and effective approach for treating wastewater effluent to remove multiple types of contaminants and thereby reduce its fouling and scaling potential in industrial cooling applications previous research has shown the potential of using dissolved carbon dioxide co2 as an environmentally benign alternative to salt regeneration of ion exchange materials 20 24 carbon dioxide which can be provided from captured flue gas creates carbonic acid when dissolved in water and dissociates into hydrogen ion h and bicarbonate ion hco3 according to its pka and the ph of the water theoretically the dissociated ions can be used to regenerate a bed of cer and or aer greenleaf et al used light microscopy to illustrate that co2 regeneration of fully converted resin beads is low due to resistance to intraparticle diffusion within the exhausted resin bead which cannot be overcome by the concentration gradient provided by the dissolved co2 solution 20 this resistance can be overcome when the ion exchanger is small e g with fibers rather than beads 20 however ion exchange fibers have limited commercial availability and are not used in practice hence with ion exchange fibers unavailable this work provides a comprehensive evaluation of using dissolved co2 as the primary regeneration agent for a bed of combined cer and aer compared with other regeneration solutions this research proposes a way of combining and improving both the energy and water sectors by using a waste product of one sector the co2 in flue gas from power generation to treat another waste product wastewater for use in a process that benefits both sectors i e treated wastewater is used in place of fresh water as cooling water in thermoelectric power plants the goal of this research was to evaluate the potential for treated wastewater effluent to be used as cooling water for power generating plants by treatment with co2 regenerated cix the specific objectives of this research were to 1 compare the regeneration efficiency of exhausted cix resin beads with dissolved co2 gas with traditional regeneration solutions based on salt and mineral acid 2 evaluate the regeneration conditions that could improve the effectiveness of co2 regeneration and 3 evaluate the removal of scale forming and fouling chemicals from synthetic and real wastewater effluent by cix 2 experimental 2 1 materials 2 1 1 source waters and regeneration solutions the synthetic wastewater used in this research was composed of acs grade cacl2 2h2o nano3 and nahco3 salts dissolved in deionized di water and based on the composition of an actual wastewater used and characterized by hsieh et al 10 detailed composition of the synthetic wastewater is given in table 1 calcium was selected as the model cationic contaminant in synthetic wastewater due its prevalence in water as well as its scale forming potential nitrate was selected as the model anionic contaminant in synthetic wastewater to have an anion that would not interact with calcium but is still problematic in terms of nutrient for biological fouling the combination of calcium and nitrate in the synthetic wastewater made it appropriate to evaluate cix because weak acid cer requires the presence of alkalinity 25 26 bicarbonate was added to the synthetic wastewater on a 1 1 equivalent ratio with calcium to neutralize h released by the weak acid cer during cix treatment real wastewater used in experiments was collected from the university of florida water reclamation facility located in gainesville fl usa after primary treatment wastewater at the plant goes through advanced biological treatment for the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus before being filtered and chlorinated for discharge wastewater samples used in experiments were taken after chlorination collected from the plant once per day and were dechlorinated prior to use with sodium thiosulfate at a dose of 9 mg l na2s2o3 from na2s2o3 5h2o real wastewater was collected the same day it was used the average composition of the real wastewater is reported in table 1 the regeneration solutions were made by dissolving the appropriate acs grade salts either nacl or nahco3 diluting concentrated hcl or dissolving co2 into di water carbon dioxide regeneration solution was prepared using food grade co2 airgas dissolved in 1 l di water under moderately low pressures in a stainless steel 3 8 l vessel millipore 2 1 2 ion exchange resins three ion exchange resins were used in this work the weak acid cer wa cer chosen for calcium removal was the dowex mac 3 resin by dow chemical it is a weak acid polyacrylic macroporous cer with carboxylic acid functional groups the strong acid cer sa cer chosen for calcium removal was c100 resin by purolite it is a strong acid polystyrene gel cer with sulfonic acid functional groups for anion removal the a520e resin by purolite was chosen it is a type 1 strong base polystyrene macroporous aer with divinylbenzene sb aer it has triethyl amine functional groups and is designed for nitrate removal experiments were conducted with the aer in its original chloride form as well as in the bicarbonate form conversion to the bicarbonate form was done in batch using 6 w v nahco3 solution mixing continuously for 12 h 2 2 column experiments column experiments were done in 10 mm diameter glass columns with a downward flow for treatment and countercurrent regeneration step flow was controlled using a pump drive equipped with a stainless steel pump head cole parmer and composite samples were collected every 6 h during the day and 12 h overnight table 2 outlines conditions for all column experiments including superficial liquid velocity slv and empty bed contact time ebct all experiments were conducted at ambient laboratory temperature 2 2 1 comparison of regeneration solutions for cix for the comparison of various regeneration solution chemistry on cix cer and aer were measured out in an 8 1 equivalents capacity ratio based on the synthetic wastewater composition detailed in table 1 the resins were measured as wet settled volume by fluidizing the resins in di water into a graduated cylinder after measuring the resin volume both the cer and aer were transferred into a small beaker using di water to mix before being loaded into a glass column for preconditioning with regeneration solution indicated in table 2 preconditioning for the co2 regenerated column was done for each resin separately using 4 v v hcl solution for the cer and 6 w v nahco3 solution for the aer the resins were separately rinsed with di water to remove excess regeneration solution mixed in a beaker and loaded together into the column the resins were rinsed again with di water before beginning the service cycle columns for comparison of regeneration solutions were run to exhaustion ebct was calculated separately for each resin and is included in table 2 regeneration with nacl was run in duplicate and similar treatment and regeneration efficiencies were seen for both runs subsequently all other columns were run singly with the understanding that a single run is closely representative of performance columns were put through two successive service cycles and the resins were rinsed and regenerated after each cycle for regeneration using salt 10 bed volumes bvs of regeneration solution was passed through the column at one half the flow rate of the service cycle the bvs were selected based on the resin bed cation or anion that had the most volume to ensure at least minimum treatment for one resin for regeneration using co2 flow of the gas into the pressure vessel was controlled by a single stage regulator with outlet pressure of 2 7 or 4 1 atm flow of the pressurized regeneration solution out of the vessel was controlled using a flow control valve cole parmer and a stainless steel pump cole parmer initial investigations of regeneration solution strength showed that a ph of 3 5 was reached in the vessel effluent after 1 h and remained at that ph after 90 min so the regeneration solution was pressurized with co2 for 1 h before beginning regeneration regeneration after the first cycle was done with 10 bvs of regeneration solution based on the longer cation resin bed and regeneration after the second cycle was done with 50 bvs based on the cer bed to evaluate the impact of increased regeneration solution volume on regeneration efficiency 2 2 2 evaluation of co2 regeneration carbon dioxide gas was used to evaluate its effectiveness as an alternative regeneration chemical to salts and mineral acids for cix conditions used in the experiments are summarized in table 2 equal bvs were used in these experiments to achieve similar breakthrough times for both resins measurement and preconditioning were the same as described above for the co2 column columns were run to a predetermined breakthrough point effluent concentration of calcium was approximately 10 of influent concentration using the synthetic wastewater described in table 1 then rinsed and regenerated within 1 h of stopping the column carbon dioxide regeneration experiments were done under two successive service cycles an nacl column was also run as a control to compare multiple regeneration cycles using a typical regeneration solution two milliliters each of c100 and a520e resins were measured and mixed in a glass column as described above and the bed was run through 5 service cycles as described above 2 2 3 wastewater cix column study two wastewater cix studies were done using 2 ml dowex mac 3 resin and 2 ml purolite a520e resin or 2 ml c100 resin and 2 ml a520e resin following experiments done for co2 regeneration evaluation experiments were run in a 10 mm diameter glass column under identical flow conditions as described for co2 regeneration evaluation above the columns were run for two 42 h service cycles to match the volume treated during the nacl column run during the co2 regeneration evaluation 2 3 analytical methods ph was measured using a thermoscientific orion refillable ph probe with a thermoscientific orion dual star ph ise meter which was calibrated before each use with ph 4 7 and 10 buffer solutions calcium concentrations were measured using standard method 3500 ca d edta titrimetric method 27 by using an ion selective electrode thermoscientific or by ion chromatography using a dionex ics 3000 nitrate as nitrogen was measured by a shimadzu tn analyzer or by ion chromatography using a dionex ics 3000 samples of regeneration solution were acidified with 1 2 drops of 12 1 n hydrochloric acid to dissolve any precipitate that may have formed between calcium and bicarbonate and then were diluted with ultrapure water 18 2 mω cm barnstead thermoscientific prior to analysis samples were also filtered before analysis 0 45 μm calibration standards for calcium and nitrate were made using ultrapure water and the appropriate salts single measurements were done with ph conductivity titration and ion selective electrode all other measurements were done in duplicate ion analysis of treated wastewater was done using a dionex ics 3000 ion chromatograph for magnesium and calcium cations and sulfate and nitrate anions phosphate was measured using epa standard method 365 1 colorimetric method 28 dissolved organic carbon doc was measured on a shimadzu toc v analyzer equipped with an asv i autosampler calibration standards for the ics 3000 were made using ultrapure water and the appropriate salt and diluting to the desired concentration calibration standards for toc v were made using ultrapure water and potassium hydrogen phthalate and diluting to the desired concentration measurements were done in duplicate quality control standards for tn ion chromatography and toc were included in all runs and were within 10 of known values 2 4 data analysis the concentration of chemicals in the column effluent and regeneration samples were plotted versus total volume of water treated regeneration efficiency was calculated based on mass adsorbed and mass desorbed from the resin during service and regeneration cycles respectively mass adsorbed onto the resin was determined by integrating the area above the service cycle curve mass desorbed or removed from resin during regeneration was determined by integrating the area beneath the regeneration curve 3 results and discussion 3 1 regeneration of cix column using nacl nahco3 hcl and co2 the results in this section address specific objective 1 with data corresponding to column experiments 1 through 4 see table 2 the regeneration chemicals were selected to provide new insights on cix regeneration with emphasis on co2 regenerated cix two forms of cix were investigated sa cer sb aer and wa cer sb aer with the difference being the acidity of the cer functional group sa and sb resins are typically regenerated with salt solutions whereas wa or weak base wb resins are regenerated with acid or alkaline solutions nacl is the most widely used salt for regeneration of sa cer i e na counterion and sb aer i e cl counterion and hcl is commonly used acid to regenerate wa cer i e h counterion hcl also supplied cl counterion for the sb aer with additional cl provided by nacl the co2 regeneration solution contains h and hco3 that serve as counterions for wa cer and sb aer respectively nahco3 regeneration solution was investigated as an alternative source of hco3 counterion for sb aer other possible regeneration solutions include potassium salts e g kcl sulfate salts e g na2so4 and alkaline solutions e g naoh factors to consider when selecting a regeneration chemical include effectiveness and impact on the treated water for instance the counterion used for regeneration will be added to the treated water so it needs to be safe for human consumption and or equipment table 3 gives the concentration of the regeneration solutions including the ratio of equivalent concentration of counterion relative to equivalent concentration of ion exchange resin which is referred to as stoichiometric ratio in general the equivalent concentration of salt must be several times in excess of the equivalent concentration of sa or sb resin i e stoichiometric ratio 1 whereas the equivalent concentration of acid or alkaline solution only needs to equal the equivalent concentration of wa or wb resin stoichiometric ratio 1 for the salt based regeneration solutions nacl and nahco3 the counterions had stoichiometric ratios much greater 1 whereas for hcl the h counterion had stoichiometric ratio 1 for the co2 regeneration solution the counterions has stoichiometric ratios much less than 1 based on the concentration of the regeneration solutions in concert with ion exchange theory nacl nahco3 and hcl were expected to perform well as regeneration solutions while co2 required further investigation fig 1 shows the effectiveness of each regeneration solution tested nacl nahco3 hcl and co2 over two regeneration cycles regeneration efficiency was determined by percent recovery which in this work is defined as the mass of ion desorbed from the resin divided by the total mass of ion removed from solution i e adsorbed to the resin multiplied by 100 error bars within fig 1 represent one standard deviation from the average when applicable for desorption of calcium from cer regeneration efficiency showed the following trends co2 nahco3 nacl hcl nacl and sa cer i e na regenerant ion wa cer h regenerant ion for desorption of nitrate from aer regeneration efficiency showed the following trends co2 nacl hcl nacl nahco3 and cl regenerant ion hco3 regenerant ion the regeneration efficiency was comparable between the first cycle and second cycle for each regeneration solution type the reasons for these trends include concentration of the regenerant ion selectivity of the resin functional group for the regenerant ion and secondary reactions such as precipitation as described below overall the cix process using cer for calcium removal and aer for nitrate removal was effectively regenerated using either salt or acid solution the nacl regeneration solution was able to recover an average of 73 and 63 of the adsorbed calcium mass from sa cer and 78 and 73 of adsorbed nitrate mass from sb aer during regeneration cycles 1 and 2 respectively given the prevalence of nacl regeneration the results are taken as the baseline performance to compare with other regeneration solutions the regeneration efficiency of the sa cer using nahco3 was lower than with nacl despite the same equivalents of sodium ion provided see table 3 whereas the regeneration efficiency for sb aer using nahco3 was higher than with nacl again despite the same stoichiometric ratios visible amounts of precipitate were found to have formed in the column during the regeneration step with nahco3 the observed precipitation is believed to be the cause of the lower calculated regeneration efficiency i e calcium was desorbed from the resin but became solid calcium carbonate and was not included in solute analysis and subsequent mass balance calculation the formation of precipitate within the column and surrounding the beads is speculated to have also contributed to reduced regeneration due to particulate interference at the bead surface regeneration of the sb aer using nahco3 was high over 80 and greater than nacl which differs from previous work by maul et al where chloride regeneration of polystyrene resins such as a520e achieved greater regeneration efficiency than bicarbonate 29 it is believed that differences in both the definition of regeneration efficiency as well as experimental design column versus batch between this study and the previous study 29 explain the difference in results on nahco3 regeneration overall nacl and nahco3 exhibited similar capability to regenerate sa cer exhausted with calcium and sb aer exhausted with nitrate and as such these results are expected to apply to other contaminants including magnesium sulfate and dissolved organic carbon both nacl and nahco3 supply na counterion for regeneration of cer the key difference is cl versus hco3 counterion for regeneration of aer the effectiveness of the hco3 counterion for aer regeneration is favorable for co2 based regeneration hcl showed very high regeneration for wa cer 90 with higher or comparable regeneration to sb cer with sodium despite the lower stoichiometric ratio of counterion provided table 3 the results demonstrate that it is not necessary to provide excessive stoichiometric amounts of the regenerant ion to a wa cer in order to achieve near complete regeneration whereas sa cer requires stoichiometric excess for effective regeneration the high affinity of wa cer for the hydrogen ion is a known property of carboxylic acid functional groups 20 25 which is beneficial for co2 regeneration where the hydrogen ion concentration is much lower than mineral acid together the results for nahco3 and hcl show that hco3 and h are effective counterions for cix regeneration due to the high regeneration efficiency observed for aer using bicarbonate ion and cer using hydrogen ion it is reasonable that carbonic acid from dissolved co2 would also perform well due to the provision of both hydrogen ion and bicarbonate ion the caveat however is that sufficient concentration of counterions is needed as a result relatively low regeneration efficiency using co2 was observed even with regeneration using nearly 50 bvs see fig 1 the high affinity of wa cer for hydrogen ion explains why regeneration using co2 follows the same trend as other regeneration solutions i e high initial exchange and gradual decrease during regeneration see fig s1 in supplementary data the low stoichiometric ratios see table 3 of both the hydrogen and bicarbonate ions when using dissolved co2 makes it difficult for the concentration gradient across the resin bead to overcome resistance to intraparticle diffusion across the bead causing regeneration to be comparatively slow for dissolved co2 compared with other regeneration solution chemistry for cix these results agree with previous work that showed that co2 regeneration of ion exchange beads is controlled by intraparticle diffusion and thus results in poor regeneration 20 23 low or incomplete regeneration of resins leads to reduced treatment capacity for subsequent service cycles when compared with fresh resin 16 which is explored further in section 3 3 considering real wastewater effluent although co2 regeneration solution contains counterions that are known to be effective for regeneration i e h and hco3 the low concentration of counterions decreases the effectiveness of co2 regeneration for cix 3 2 evaluation of co2 regeneration efficiency for cix the results in this section address specific objective 2 with data corresponding to column experiments 6 through 9 see table 2 the resin volumes for column experiments 6 through 9 were adjusted to achieve similar breakthrough times for both the cer bed and aer bed by using the same volume of resin as preparation for column experiments 6 9 a cix column containing sa cer sb aer using nacl as the regeneration solution see column experiment 5 table 2 showed that the first regeneration and second service cycle were representative of subsequent service cycles see fig s2 in supplementary data as a result cix columns with co2 regeneration were only run for two service cycles column experiment 6 represented the baseline condition forco2 regeneration with other column experiments trying to improve the process all co2 regeneration conditions in fig 2 achieved calcium and nitrate recoveries of less than 10 indicating low regeneration of resin beads using dissolved co2 as the sole regenerant the regeneration efficiency was similar between the first and second regeneration cycles given the lower regeneration efficiencies overall relative to the baseline regeneration condition of 2 7 atm co2 and 6 min ebct none of the alternative regeneration conditions resulted in a major increase in regeneration efficiency i e increasing the partial pressure of co2 increasing the ebct during the service cycle or using diffuser for co2 sparging one clear result in fig 2 was that the cer in the cix column exhibited higher regeneration efficiency than the aer this was due to the high selectivity of wa cer for the hydrogen ion whereas sb aer has a low selectivity for the bicarbonate ion table s1 provides additional insight on the co2 regeneration conditions by tabulating the stoichiometric ratios for 2 7 and 4 1 atm co2 increasing the partial pressure results in essentially no change in the stoichiometric ratios and as seen in table 3 the stoichiometric ratios are much less than 1 as discussed in section 3 1 and in previous work 20 low stoichiometric ratios result in kinetic limitations of resin bead regeneration with co2 previous studies have investigated other ways of improving the regeneration of exhausted ion exchangers when using co2 such as changing the morphology fibers versus beads 20 23 30 or adding another carbonate source to the regeneration solution 24 the higher regeneration efficiency of wa cer than sb aer in fig 2 supports the approach of adding supplemental carbonate to the regeneration solution greenleaf and sengupta 20 22 have also studied the impact of partial pressure on regeneration efficiency with similar low regeneration efficiency results as seen in this study while increasing the partial pressure of co2 increases the concentration of dissolved gas dissolution results in lower ph which limits the dissociation of carbonic acid into hydrogen ion and bicarbonate ion and hence limits any increase in regeneration efficiency this is observed in fig 2 where the regeneration efficiency first cycle was greater for 2 7 atm co2 than 4 1 atm co2 in the second cycle it is not clear whether the higher regeneration efficiency for 4 1 atm co2 than 2 7 atm co2 was due to slightly higher concentration of counterions see table s1 or experimental variation the presence of wa cer would theoretically raise the ph by the removal of hydrogen ion from solution and shift the carbonate balance in favor of dissociated bicarbonate ion rather than undissociated carbonic acid but under the conditions investigated wa cer did not have enough impact to appreciably increase bicarbonate concentration increasing the ebct for the service cycle may have increased contaminant removal however it did not have any impact on the regeneration process finally it is not known why using the diffuser resulted in the lowest regeneration efficiency 3 3 removal of scale forming chemicals from wastewater using cix the results in this section address specific objective 3 with data corresponding to column experiments 1 4 10 and 11 see table 2 column experiments 1 4 used synthetic wastewater while column experiments 10 and 11 used real wastewater the inclusion of real wastewater is critical for evaluating the potential for cix to reduce subsequent scaling and fouling during cooling applications fig 3 shows the service cycles for column experiments 2 and 4 where cix columns were run to exhaustion and the cix column using nacl regeneration was replicated and the replicates are shown the influent composition of the synthetic wastewater is given in table 1 and the column conditions are given in table 2 results for column experiments 1 and 3 are shown in fig s3 in supplementary data because different volumes of cer were used compared with aer in column experiments 1 4 the total number of bvs treated by cation exchange differed than the bvs treated by anion exchange cer and aer bvs were the same for column experiments 10 and 11 both sa cer and wa cer showed high removal 95 of scale forming calcium form synthetic wastewater over approximately 1000 bvs during the first service cycle see figs 3a and s3a in supplementary data sa cer for both nacl regeneration and nahco3 regeneration exhibited a sharper exhaustion curve than wa cer for both co2 regeneration and hcl regeneration indicating faster sorption kinetics compared with wa cer while regeneration of sa cer with nacl was over 70 see fig 1 incomplete regeneration of sa cer between service cycles resulted in the lower number of bvs needed to reach breakthrough e g 800 bvs for cycle 2 compared with 900 bvs for cycle 1 see fig 3a due to reduced number of exchange sites available for further calcium sorption 16 although nahco3 showed low calcium regeneration efficiency in fig 1 the breakthrough profiles in fig s3a indicate similar regeneration efficiency as nacl hence the low regeneration of nahco3 in fig 1 is an artifact of calcium carbonate precipitation cycle 1 using wa cer continued treating water to 3000 bvs before reaching exhaustion see fig 3a the wa cer regenerated with 2 7 atm co2 removed 20 of influent calcium after regeneration before reaching exhaustion again after 2700 5700 cumulative bvs in contrast the wa cer regenerated with hcl returned to nearly complete calcium removal in cycle 2 see fig s3a in supplementary data indicating that the hydrogen ion was an effective regenerant ion the sb aer resin used in all cix columns removed over 95 of influent nitrate for approximately 1000 bvs during cycle 1 see figs 3b and s3b in supplementary data with approximately 2300 bvs of water treated before the resin reached exhaustion because the volume of sb aer was constant for all column experiments nitrate removal during cycle 1 was expected to be identical for all cix columns with differences in treatment occurring in cycle 2 after regeneration for example figs 3b and s3b show nearly identical breakthrough curves for sb aer nacl sb aer co2 sb aer nahco3 and sb aer hcl columns for cycle 1 however in cycle 2 the sb aer nacl and sb aer nahco3 columns achieved 95 nitrate removal whereas the sb aer co2 column achieved a maximum of 47 nitrate removal the high and similar levels of nitrate removal in cycles 1 and 2 using nacl and nahco3 regeneration solutions confirm that either chloride or bicarbonate ion can function as effective regenerant ion service cycle curves for column experiments 10 nacl regeneration and 11 co2 regeneration using real wastewater effluent are shown in figs 4 and 5 respectively constituents present in the real wastewater effluent that can impact its use for cooling water make up include calcium magnesium phosphate sulfate nitrate and doc for example calcium magnesium and phosphate contribute to inorganic scaling in recirculating cooling systems 13 sulfate can have varying impacts including corrosion and inorganic scaling in cooling systems 4 31 32 doc and nitrate can contribute to biological fouling calcium was completely removed up to 450 bvs by sa cer in the sodium ion form in the presence of other wastewater cations and nitrate was completely removed by sb aer in the chloride form up to 550 bvs in the presence of other wastewater anions see fig 4 after nacl regeneration sa cer was able to remove nearly all calcium and sb aer was able to remove nearly all nitrate for approximately 300 bvs in addition sa cer removed magnesium and sb aer removed sulfate phosphate and doc based on the number of bvs treated and the shape for the breakthrough curves the selectivity trends were calcium magnesium for sa cer and nitrate sulfate phosphate doc for sb aer see fig 4 the removal trends for cation exchange and anion exchange shown here are a result of the resins used in this work and can be altered by selecting resins with different properties such as polymer composition pore structure and functional group type 33 34 for example a520e resin is known to be selective for nitrate if removal of sulfate phosphate or doc was a higher priority than an alternative aer could be used the breakthrough curves for cycle 2 indicate that nacl regeneration was able to desorb magnesium sulfate phosphate and doc to varying extents wa cer in the hydrogen ion form and sb aer in the bicarbonate form showed similar levels of removal of wastewater constituents in cycle 1 see fig 5 as the cix treatment results using nacl regeneration see fig 4 the difference occurred when comparing cycle 2 following co2 regeneration fig 5 with cycle 2 following nacl regeneration fig 4 carbon dioxide regeneration was not able to effectively desorb the wastewater constituents from the wa cer or the sb aer and as result cycle 2 shows minimal contaminant removal the cix treatment results show lower treatment capacity in real wastewater effluent figs 4 and 5 compared with synthetic wastewater effluent figs 3 and s3 this is to be expected as the presence of competing ions will result in lower removal when compared with ions in isolation 35 the results in this section show that cix is an effective option for wastewater treatment in preparation for industrial cooling applications because it can remove a variety of chemicals that contribute to scaling fouling and corrosion 3 4 implications for energy water nexus many thermoelectric power plants in the u s are within reasonable distance 40 km or 25 mi of wastewater plants that can supply enough treated wastewater to replace or augment their cooling water needs 5 so the quantity of wastewater is not an issue neither is the amount of co2 produced at thermoelectric power plants an issue ample co2 is emitted regularly from power plants to provide enough carbonic acid to regenerate ion exchange systems such as cix 21 fig 6 summarizes these realities and shows the links between the water and energy sectors that need to be considered 3 4 1 use of wastewater treated with cix in recirculated cooling this research shows that cix treatment can remove constituents from wastewater effluent that are problematic in terms of inorganic scaling corrosion and biological fouling of cooling systems the exact number of bvs treated will depend on design of the cix system running cix columns for shorter times i e volume treated will result in higher quality water with low calcium and magnesium and reduced sulfate and phosphate concentrations which would reduce the frequency of cooling tower blowdown while sulfate and phosphate ions were removed to variable extent using cix the nearly complete removal of calcium and magnesium by cix is expected to limit scaling potential limited removal of sulfate can still be cause for corrosion concern depending on the amount of chloride that is also present in the water 31 32 to understand the impact cix treatment of wastewater on cooling systems downstream impacts of the counterions used in the process must be considered as well fig 6b for example using nacl regeneration releases sodium and chloride as counterions into the treated water sodium does not impact scaling or corrosion 36 however chloride can increase corrosion potential for lead 31 copper 31 and steel piping 4 sulfate in the presence of chloride has been shown to inhibit or accelerate corrosion depending on the ratio of chloride to sulfate ions present 31 32 a cix process of sa cer paired with sb aer regenerated nahco3 will not have corrosion potential from high chloride concentrations but bicarbonate is known to form scale in the presence of calcium and such behavior was seen in the regeneration results in this research wa cer on its own or combined with sb aer in the chloride form will likely increase corrosion from both chloride ion and low ph when sb aer in the bicarbonate form is paired with wa cer in hydrogen ion form however bicarbonate alkalinity can be neutralized and lead to reduced carbonate scaling potential while still removing problematic ions cix fig 6a with hydrogen ion and bicarbonate ion is particularly advantageous if using a weak acid ph dependent solution such as dissolved co2 to improve regeneration conditions for both resins 37 38 in this study the chlorine residual in the wastewater effluent was neutralized prior to treatment with cix to protect the resins from oxidation although the disinfectant was deactivated potential biological interactions were not included as part of this study methods for controlling biological fouling in the cooling system as well as the cix process must be considered and accounted for before implementation 3 4 2 use of captured co2 for regeneration of cix current carbon capture and sequestration ccs technology includes absorption of co2 into an amine solution adsorption onto a solid phase cryogenic distillation as well as a number of other emerging technologies 39 implementation of ccs fig 6c in many cases is economically challenging and results in decreased power plant efficiency increased operational costs as well as increased fuel and water needs 39 increasing gas partial pressure is one way of increasing amount of dissolved gas thus increasing the strength of the regeneration solution while the partial pressure of co2 used in these experiments only ranges from 2 7 to 4 1 atm 40 60 psi it should be noted that these pressures were of pure food grade co2 flue gas is rarely pure and subsequently either the pressures of gas needed to regenerate would be much higher to achieve the same co2 partial pressure or power plants would need to install separation technologies that achieve high separation of co2 from the other gases present furthermore the presence of impurities such as sulfur oxides sox that can dissolve and form ions that may potentially increase regenerant strength for cer from added acidity 21 but decrease the efficiency of aer by the introduction of a contaminant ion e g so4 2 increasing the partial pressure of co2 carbonic acid can also shift the solution ph to a point where the weak acid formed only dissociates to a limited extent restricting the presence of counterions needed for regeneration flow through columns such as those used in this study result in a gradient of converted ion exchange resins due to the plug flow nature of the reactor 40 that is those resin beads within the mass transfer zone closest to the inlet become exhausted first while those at the end are exhausted only after the resin before them are exhausted however alternate reactor designs such as a completely mixed stirred tank reactor can achieve partial conversion of resin beads more equally due to the fluid being well mixed 26 regeneration of partially exhausted cix resin with dissolved co2 may then be achievable because when only the outer exchange sites need to be regenerated the counterions do not need to overcome as much resistance to intraparticle diffusion to convert sites deep within the resin bead and kinetics of regeneration are improved under this design it may be that flue gas does not need to be pressurized extensively to achieve the amount of regeneration needed 4 conclusions the major conclusions of this work are as follows both nacl and nahco3 were effective regeneration solutions for cix process consisting of sa cer beads exhausted with calcium and sb aer beads exhausted with nitrate hcl was an effective regeneration solution for cix process consisting of wa cer beads exhausted with calcium and sb aer beads exhausted with nitrate regeneration of cix process showed that hydrogen ion and bicarbonate ion were as effective as sodium ion and chloride ion at desorbing contaminants and as a result co2 is a viable source for ion exchange regeneration results using co2 to regenerate cix process consisting of cer and aer beads showed lower regeneration efficiency than nacl nahco3 and hcl due to low stoichiometric ratios of regenerant ions regeneration of cix process using co2 should be evaluated in a completely mixed reactor as opposed to a plug flow reactor to limit exhaustion and regeneration to the outer shell of the resin beads cix treatment can remove a wide range of constituents present in wastewater effluent that are problematic in cooling water including calcium magnesium nitrate sulfate phosphate and doc

13864,combined ion exchange cix treatment of wastewater effluent and ion exchange regeneration using flue gas carbon dioxide co2 was investigated as a way of beneficially joining the water and energy sectors cix treatment removed calcium magnesium sulfate nitrate phosphate and dissolved organic carbon from wastewater effluent regeneration of cix using sodium chloride sodium bicarbonate hydrochloric acid and co2 was investigated carbon dioxide had a lower regeneration efficiency compared with the other regeneration solutions alternative co2 regeneration conditions were evaluated to gain insight on the effects of increased gas pressure increased contact time and increased rate of co2 dissolution on regeneration efficiency keywords carbon dioxide cooling water hardness power plants sustainability 1 introduction the thermoelectric power generation sector constitutes the single largest sector for fresh water withdrawal in the united states with water being used primarily for cooling 1 however with climate change impacting water supplies there is increasing interest in alternative sources for cooling water of interest is treated municipal wastewater as an alternative make up for industrial cooling water 2 5 for thermoelectric power plants li et al 5 estimated that approximately 50 of the existing power plants in the u s can obtain enough cooling water from publicly owned treatment works within a 10 mi 16 km radius of the plant with that number increasing to 76 if the radius is extended to 25 mi 40 km for proposed power plants utilizing recirculating cooling nearly all 97 are estimated to be able to obtain enough water from publicly owned treatment works within a 25 mi 40 km radius of the power plant 5 however when treated municipal wastewater is used for cooling it is critical to control fouling scaling and corrosion tertiary treatment whether at the wastewater plant or power plant can be used to improve the quality of wastewater before it is used for cooling 5 14 combined ion exchange cix is a low energy water treatment process that can remove multiple types of contaminants from water including hardness nitrate perchlorate and dissolved organic matter 15 17 additionally previous work shows that cix is flexible and can use a single vessel of cation exchange resin cer and anion exchange resin aer or cer and aer vessels in series 16 18 in some cases combining cer and aer in the same vessel can improve the regeneration of one or both resins 19 hence cix offers a simple and effective approach for treating wastewater effluent to remove multiple types of contaminants and thereby reduce its fouling and scaling potential in industrial cooling applications previous research has shown the potential of using dissolved carbon dioxide co2 as an environmentally benign alternative to salt regeneration of ion exchange materials 20 24 carbon dioxide which can be provided from captured flue gas creates carbonic acid when dissolved in water and dissociates into hydrogen ion h and bicarbonate ion hco3 according to its pka and the ph of the water theoretically the dissociated ions can be used to regenerate a bed of cer and or aer greenleaf et al used light microscopy to illustrate that co2 regeneration of fully converted resin beads is low due to resistance to intraparticle diffusion within the exhausted resin bead which cannot be overcome by the concentration gradient provided by the dissolved co2 solution 20 this resistance can be overcome when the ion exchanger is small e g with fibers rather than beads 20 however ion exchange fibers have limited commercial availability and are not used in practice hence with ion exchange fibers unavailable this work provides a comprehensive evaluation of using dissolved co2 as the primary regeneration agent for a bed of combined cer and aer compared with other regeneration solutions this research proposes a way of combining and improving both the energy and water sectors by using a waste product of one sector the co2 in flue gas from power generation to treat another waste product wastewater for use in a process that benefits both sectors i e treated wastewater is used in place of fresh water as cooling water in thermoelectric power plants the goal of this research was to evaluate the potential for treated wastewater effluent to be used as cooling water for power generating plants by treatment with co2 regenerated cix the specific objectives of this research were to 1 compare the regeneration efficiency of exhausted cix resin beads with dissolved co2 gas with traditional regeneration solutions based on salt and mineral acid 2 evaluate the regeneration conditions that could improve the effectiveness of co2 regeneration and 3 evaluate the removal of scale forming and fouling chemicals from synthetic and real wastewater effluent by cix 2 experimental 2 1 materials 2 1 1 source waters and regeneration solutions the synthetic wastewater used in this research was composed of acs grade cacl2 2h2o nano3 and nahco3 salts dissolved in deionized di water and based on the composition of an actual wastewater used and characterized by hsieh et al 10 detailed composition of the synthetic wastewater is given in table 1 calcium was selected as the model cationic contaminant in synthetic wastewater due its prevalence in water as well as its scale forming potential nitrate was selected as the model anionic contaminant in synthetic wastewater to have an anion that would not interact with calcium but is still problematic in terms of nutrient for biological fouling the combination of calcium and nitrate in the synthetic wastewater made it appropriate to evaluate cix because weak acid cer requires the presence of alkalinity 25 26 bicarbonate was added to the synthetic wastewater on a 1 1 equivalent ratio with calcium to neutralize h released by the weak acid cer during cix treatment real wastewater used in experiments was collected from the university of florida water reclamation facility located in gainesville fl usa after primary treatment wastewater at the plant goes through advanced biological treatment for the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus before being filtered and chlorinated for discharge wastewater samples used in experiments were taken after chlorination collected from the plant once per day and were dechlorinated prior to use with sodium thiosulfate at a dose of 9 mg l na2s2o3 from na2s2o3 5h2o real wastewater was collected the same day it was used the average composition of the real wastewater is reported in table 1 the regeneration solutions were made by dissolving the appropriate acs grade salts either nacl or nahco3 diluting concentrated hcl or dissolving co2 into di water carbon dioxide regeneration solution was prepared using food grade co2 airgas dissolved in 1 l di water under moderately low pressures in a stainless steel 3 8 l vessel millipore 2 1 2 ion exchange resins three ion exchange resins were used in this work the weak acid cer wa cer chosen for calcium removal was the dowex mac 3 resin by dow chemical it is a weak acid polyacrylic macroporous cer with carboxylic acid functional groups the strong acid cer sa cer chosen for calcium removal was c100 resin by purolite it is a strong acid polystyrene gel cer with sulfonic acid functional groups for anion removal the a520e resin by purolite was chosen it is a type 1 strong base polystyrene macroporous aer with divinylbenzene sb aer it has triethyl amine functional groups and is designed for nitrate removal experiments were conducted with the aer in its original chloride form as well as in the bicarbonate form conversion to the bicarbonate form was done in batch using 6 w v nahco3 solution mixing continuously for 12 h 2 2 column experiments column experiments were done in 10 mm diameter glass columns with a downward flow for treatment and countercurrent regeneration step flow was controlled using a pump drive equipped with a stainless steel pump head cole parmer and composite samples were collected every 6 h during the day and 12 h overnight table 2 outlines conditions for all column experiments including superficial liquid velocity slv and empty bed contact time ebct all experiments were conducted at ambient laboratory temperature 2 2 1 comparison of regeneration solutions for cix for the comparison of various regeneration solution chemistry on cix cer and aer were measured out in an 8 1 equivalents capacity ratio based on the synthetic wastewater composition detailed in table 1 the resins were measured as wet settled volume by fluidizing the resins in di water into a graduated cylinder after measuring the resin volume both the cer and aer were transferred into a small beaker using di water to mix before being loaded into a glass column for preconditioning with regeneration solution indicated in table 2 preconditioning for the co2 regenerated column was done for each resin separately using 4 v v hcl solution for the cer and 6 w v nahco3 solution for the aer the resins were separately rinsed with di water to remove excess regeneration solution mixed in a beaker and loaded together into the column the resins were rinsed again with di water before beginning the service cycle columns for comparison of regeneration solutions were run to exhaustion ebct was calculated separately for each resin and is included in table 2 regeneration with nacl was run in duplicate and similar treatment and regeneration efficiencies were seen for both runs subsequently all other columns were run singly with the understanding that a single run is closely representative of performance columns were put through two successive service cycles and the resins were rinsed and regenerated after each cycle for regeneration using salt 10 bed volumes bvs of regeneration solution was passed through the column at one half the flow rate of the service cycle the bvs were selected based on the resin bed cation or anion that had the most volume to ensure at least minimum treatment for one resin for regeneration using co2 flow of the gas into the pressure vessel was controlled by a single stage regulator with outlet pressure of 2 7 or 4 1 atm flow of the pressurized regeneration solution out of the vessel was controlled using a flow control valve cole parmer and a stainless steel pump cole parmer initial investigations of regeneration solution strength showed that a ph of 3 5 was reached in the vessel effluent after 1 h and remained at that ph after 90 min so the regeneration solution was pressurized with co2 for 1 h before beginning regeneration regeneration after the first cycle was done with 10 bvs of regeneration solution based on the longer cation resin bed and regeneration after the second cycle was done with 50 bvs based on the cer bed to evaluate the impact of increased regeneration solution volume on regeneration efficiency 2 2 2 evaluation of co2 regeneration carbon dioxide gas was used to evaluate its effectiveness as an alternative regeneration chemical to salts and mineral acids for cix conditions used in the experiments are summarized in table 2 equal bvs were used in these experiments to achieve similar breakthrough times for both resins measurement and preconditioning were the same as described above for the co2 column columns were run to a predetermined breakthrough point effluent concentration of calcium was approximately 10 of influent concentration using the synthetic wastewater described in table 1 then rinsed and regenerated within 1 h of stopping the column carbon dioxide regeneration experiments were done under two successive service cycles an nacl column was also run as a control to compare multiple regeneration cycles using a typical regeneration solution two milliliters each of c100 and a520e resins were measured and mixed in a glass column as described above and the bed was run through 5 service cycles as described above 2 2 3 wastewater cix column study two wastewater cix studies were done using 2 ml dowex mac 3 resin and 2 ml purolite a520e resin or 2 ml c100 resin and 2 ml a520e resin following experiments done for co2 regeneration evaluation experiments were run in a 10 mm diameter glass column under identical flow conditions as described for co2 regeneration evaluation above the columns were run for two 42 h service cycles to match the volume treated during the nacl column run during the co2 regeneration evaluation 2 3 analytical methods ph was measured using a thermoscientific orion refillable ph probe with a thermoscientific orion dual star ph ise meter which was calibrated before each use with ph 4 7 and 10 buffer solutions calcium concentrations were measured using standard method 3500 ca d edta titrimetric method 27 by using an ion selective electrode thermoscientific or by ion chromatography using a dionex ics 3000 nitrate as nitrogen was measured by a shimadzu tn analyzer or by ion chromatography using a dionex ics 3000 samples of regeneration solution were acidified with 1 2 drops of 12 1 n hydrochloric acid to dissolve any precipitate that may have formed between calcium and bicarbonate and then were diluted with ultrapure water 18 2 mω cm barnstead thermoscientific prior to analysis samples were also filtered before analysis 0 45 μm calibration standards for calcium and nitrate were made using ultrapure water and the appropriate salts single measurements were done with ph conductivity titration and ion selective electrode all other measurements were done in duplicate ion analysis of treated wastewater was done using a dionex ics 3000 ion chromatograph for magnesium and calcium cations and sulfate and nitrate anions phosphate was measured using epa standard method 365 1 colorimetric method 28 dissolved organic carbon doc was measured on a shimadzu toc v analyzer equipped with an asv i autosampler calibration standards for the ics 3000 were made using ultrapure water and the appropriate salt and diluting to the desired concentration calibration standards for toc v were made using ultrapure water and potassium hydrogen phthalate and diluting to the desired concentration measurements were done in duplicate quality control standards for tn ion chromatography and toc were included in all runs and were within 10 of known values 2 4 data analysis the concentration of chemicals in the column effluent and regeneration samples were plotted versus total volume of water treated regeneration efficiency was calculated based on mass adsorbed and mass desorbed from the resin during service and regeneration cycles respectively mass adsorbed onto the resin was determined by integrating the area above the service cycle curve mass desorbed or removed from resin during regeneration was determined by integrating the area beneath the regeneration curve 3 results and discussion 3 1 regeneration of cix column using nacl nahco3 hcl and co2 the results in this section address specific objective 1 with data corresponding to column experiments 1 through 4 see table 2 the regeneration chemicals were selected to provide new insights on cix regeneration with emphasis on co2 regenerated cix two forms of cix were investigated sa cer sb aer and wa cer sb aer with the difference being the acidity of the cer functional group sa and sb resins are typically regenerated with salt solutions whereas wa or weak base wb resins are regenerated with acid or alkaline solutions nacl is the most widely used salt for regeneration of sa cer i e na counterion and sb aer i e cl counterion and hcl is commonly used acid to regenerate wa cer i e h counterion hcl also supplied cl counterion for the sb aer with additional cl provided by nacl the co2 regeneration solution contains h and hco3 that serve as counterions for wa cer and sb aer respectively nahco3 regeneration solution was investigated as an alternative source of hco3 counterion for sb aer other possible regeneration solutions include potassium salts e g kcl sulfate salts e g na2so4 and alkaline solutions e g naoh factors to consider when selecting a regeneration chemical include effectiveness and impact on the treated water for instance the counterion used for regeneration will be added to the treated water so it needs to be safe for human consumption and or equipment table 3 gives the concentration of the regeneration solutions including the ratio of equivalent concentration of counterion relative to equivalent concentration of ion exchange resin which is referred to as stoichiometric ratio in general the equivalent concentration of salt must be several times in excess of the equivalent concentration of sa or sb resin i e stoichiometric ratio 1 whereas the equivalent concentration of acid or alkaline solution only needs to equal the equivalent concentration of wa or wb resin stoichiometric ratio 1 for the salt based regeneration solutions nacl and nahco3 the counterions had stoichiometric ratios much greater 1 whereas for hcl the h counterion had stoichiometric ratio 1 for the co2 regeneration solution the counterions has stoichiometric ratios much less than 1 based on the concentration of the regeneration solutions in concert with ion exchange theory nacl nahco3 and hcl were expected to perform well as regeneration solutions while co2 required further investigation fig 1 shows the effectiveness of each regeneration solution tested nacl nahco3 hcl and co2 over two regeneration cycles regeneration efficiency was determined by percent recovery which in this work is defined as the mass of ion desorbed from the resin divided by the total mass of ion removed from solution i e adsorbed to the resin multiplied by 100 error bars within fig 1 represent one standard deviation from the average when applicable for desorption of calcium from cer regeneration efficiency showed the following trends co2 nahco3 nacl hcl nacl and sa cer i e na regenerant ion wa cer h regenerant ion for desorption of nitrate from aer regeneration efficiency showed the following trends co2 nacl hcl nacl nahco3 and cl regenerant ion hco3 regenerant ion the regeneration efficiency was comparable between the first cycle and second cycle for each regeneration solution type the reasons for these trends include concentration of the regenerant ion selectivity of the resin functional group for the regenerant ion and secondary reactions such as precipitation as described below overall the cix process using cer for calcium removal and aer for nitrate removal was effectively regenerated using either salt or acid solution the nacl regeneration solution was able to recover an average of 73 and 63 of the adsorbed calcium mass from sa cer and 78 and 73 of adsorbed nitrate mass from sb aer during regeneration cycles 1 and 2 respectively given the prevalence of nacl regeneration the results are taken as the baseline performance to compare with other regeneration solutions the regeneration efficiency of the sa cer using nahco3 was lower than with nacl despite the same equivalents of sodium ion provided see table 3 whereas the regeneration efficiency for sb aer using nahco3 was higher than with nacl again despite the same stoichiometric ratios visible amounts of precipitate were found to have formed in the column during the regeneration step with nahco3 the observed precipitation is believed to be the cause of the lower calculated regeneration efficiency i e calcium was desorbed from the resin but became solid calcium carbonate and was not included in solute analysis and subsequent mass balance calculation the formation of precipitate within the column and surrounding the beads is speculated to have also contributed to reduced regeneration due to particulate interference at the bead surface regeneration of the sb aer using nahco3 was high over 80 and greater than nacl which differs from previous work by maul et al where chloride regeneration of polystyrene resins such as a520e achieved greater regeneration efficiency than bicarbonate 29 it is believed that differences in both the definition of regeneration efficiency as well as experimental design column versus batch between this study and the previous study 29 explain the difference in results on nahco3 regeneration overall nacl and nahco3 exhibited similar capability to regenerate sa cer exhausted with calcium and sb aer exhausted with nitrate and as such these results are expected to apply to other contaminants including magnesium sulfate and dissolved organic carbon both nacl and nahco3 supply na counterion for regeneration of cer the key difference is cl versus hco3 counterion for regeneration of aer the effectiveness of the hco3 counterion for aer regeneration is favorable for co2 based regeneration hcl showed very high regeneration for wa cer 90 with higher or comparable regeneration to sb cer with sodium despite the lower stoichiometric ratio of counterion provided table 3 the results demonstrate that it is not necessary to provide excessive stoichiometric amounts of the regenerant ion to a wa cer in order to achieve near complete regeneration whereas sa cer requires stoichiometric excess for effective regeneration the high affinity of wa cer for the hydrogen ion is a known property of carboxylic acid functional groups 20 25 which is beneficial for co2 regeneration where the hydrogen ion concentration is much lower than mineral acid together the results for nahco3 and hcl show that hco3 and h are effective counterions for cix regeneration due to the high regeneration efficiency observed for aer using bicarbonate ion and cer using hydrogen ion it is reasonable that carbonic acid from dissolved co2 would also perform well due to the provision of both hydrogen ion and bicarbonate ion the caveat however is that sufficient concentration of counterions is needed as a result relatively low regeneration efficiency using co2 was observed even with regeneration using nearly 50 bvs see fig 1 the high affinity of wa cer for hydrogen ion explains why regeneration using co2 follows the same trend as other regeneration solutions i e high initial exchange and gradual decrease during regeneration see fig s1 in supplementary data the low stoichiometric ratios see table 3 of both the hydrogen and bicarbonate ions when using dissolved co2 makes it difficult for the concentration gradient across the resin bead to overcome resistance to intraparticle diffusion across the bead causing regeneration to be comparatively slow for dissolved co2 compared with other regeneration solution chemistry for cix these results agree with previous work that showed that co2 regeneration of ion exchange beads is controlled by intraparticle diffusion and thus results in poor regeneration 20 23 low or incomplete regeneration of resins leads to reduced treatment capacity for subsequent service cycles when compared with fresh resin 16 which is explored further in section 3 3 considering real wastewater effluent although co2 regeneration solution contains counterions that are known to be effective for regeneration i e h and hco3 the low concentration of counterions decreases the effectiveness of co2 regeneration for cix 3 2 evaluation of co2 regeneration efficiency for cix the results in this section address specific objective 2 with data corresponding to column experiments 6 through 9 see table 2 the resin volumes for column experiments 6 through 9 were adjusted to achieve similar breakthrough times for both the cer bed and aer bed by using the same volume of resin as preparation for column experiments 6 9 a cix column containing sa cer sb aer using nacl as the regeneration solution see column experiment 5 table 2 showed that the first regeneration and second service cycle were representative of subsequent service cycles see fig s2 in supplementary data as a result cix columns with co2 regeneration were only run for two service cycles column experiment 6 represented the baseline condition forco2 regeneration with other column experiments trying to improve the process all co2 regeneration conditions in fig 2 achieved calcium and nitrate recoveries of less than 10 indicating low regeneration of resin beads using dissolved co2 as the sole regenerant the regeneration efficiency was similar between the first and second regeneration cycles given the lower regeneration efficiencies overall relative to the baseline regeneration condition of 2 7 atm co2 and 6 min ebct none of the alternative regeneration conditions resulted in a major increase in regeneration efficiency i e increasing the partial pressure of co2 increasing the ebct during the service cycle or using diffuser for co2 sparging one clear result in fig 2 was that the cer in the cix column exhibited higher regeneration efficiency than the aer this was due to the high selectivity of wa cer for the hydrogen ion whereas sb aer has a low selectivity for the bicarbonate ion table s1 provides additional insight on the co2 regeneration conditions by tabulating the stoichiometric ratios for 2 7 and 4 1 atm co2 increasing the partial pressure results in essentially no change in the stoichiometric ratios and as seen in table 3 the stoichiometric ratios are much less than 1 as discussed in section 3 1 and in previous work 20 low stoichiometric ratios result in kinetic limitations of resin bead regeneration with co2 previous studies have investigated other ways of improving the regeneration of exhausted ion exchangers when using co2 such as changing the morphology fibers versus beads 20 23 30 or adding another carbonate source to the regeneration solution 24 the higher regeneration efficiency of wa cer than sb aer in fig 2 supports the approach of adding supplemental carbonate to the regeneration solution greenleaf and sengupta 20 22 have also studied the impact of partial pressure on regeneration efficiency with similar low regeneration efficiency results as seen in this study while increasing the partial pressure of co2 increases the concentration of dissolved gas dissolution results in lower ph which limits the dissociation of carbonic acid into hydrogen ion and bicarbonate ion and hence limits any increase in regeneration efficiency this is observed in fig 2 where the regeneration efficiency first cycle was greater for 2 7 atm co2 than 4 1 atm co2 in the second cycle it is not clear whether the higher regeneration efficiency for 4 1 atm co2 than 2 7 atm co2 was due to slightly higher concentration of counterions see table s1 or experimental variation the presence of wa cer would theoretically raise the ph by the removal of hydrogen ion from solution and shift the carbonate balance in favor of dissociated bicarbonate ion rather than undissociated carbonic acid but under the conditions investigated wa cer did not have enough impact to appreciably increase bicarbonate concentration increasing the ebct for the service cycle may have increased contaminant removal however it did not have any impact on the regeneration process finally it is not known why using the diffuser resulted in the lowest regeneration efficiency 3 3 removal of scale forming chemicals from wastewater using cix the results in this section address specific objective 3 with data corresponding to column experiments 1 4 10 and 11 see table 2 column experiments 1 4 used synthetic wastewater while column experiments 10 and 11 used real wastewater the inclusion of real wastewater is critical for evaluating the potential for cix to reduce subsequent scaling and fouling during cooling applications fig 3 shows the service cycles for column experiments 2 and 4 where cix columns were run to exhaustion and the cix column using nacl regeneration was replicated and the replicates are shown the influent composition of the synthetic wastewater is given in table 1 and the column conditions are given in table 2 results for column experiments 1 and 3 are shown in fig s3 in supplementary data because different volumes of cer were used compared with aer in column experiments 1 4 the total number of bvs treated by cation exchange differed than the bvs treated by anion exchange cer and aer bvs were the same for column experiments 10 and 11 both sa cer and wa cer showed high removal 95 of scale forming calcium form synthetic wastewater over approximately 1000 bvs during the first service cycle see figs 3a and s3a in supplementary data sa cer for both nacl regeneration and nahco3 regeneration exhibited a sharper exhaustion curve than wa cer for both co2 regeneration and hcl regeneration indicating faster sorption kinetics compared with wa cer while regeneration of sa cer with nacl was over 70 see fig 1 incomplete regeneration of sa cer between service cycles resulted in the lower number of bvs needed to reach breakthrough e g 800 bvs for cycle 2 compared with 900 bvs for cycle 1 see fig 3a due to reduced number of exchange sites available for further calcium sorption 16 although nahco3 showed low calcium regeneration efficiency in fig 1 the breakthrough profiles in fig s3a indicate similar regeneration efficiency as nacl hence the low regeneration of nahco3 in fig 1 is an artifact of calcium carbonate precipitation cycle 1 using wa cer continued treating water to 3000 bvs before reaching exhaustion see fig 3a the wa cer regenerated with 2 7 atm co2 removed 20 of influent calcium after regeneration before reaching exhaustion again after 2700 5700 cumulative bvs in contrast the wa cer regenerated with hcl returned to nearly complete calcium removal in cycle 2 see fig s3a in supplementary data indicating that the hydrogen ion was an effective regenerant ion the sb aer resin used in all cix columns removed over 95 of influent nitrate for approximately 1000 bvs during cycle 1 see figs 3b and s3b in supplementary data with approximately 2300 bvs of water treated before the resin reached exhaustion because the volume of sb aer was constant for all column experiments nitrate removal during cycle 1 was expected to be identical for all cix columns with differences in treatment occurring in cycle 2 after regeneration for example figs 3b and s3b show nearly identical breakthrough curves for sb aer nacl sb aer co2 sb aer nahco3 and sb aer hcl columns for cycle 1 however in cycle 2 the sb aer nacl and sb aer nahco3 columns achieved 95 nitrate removal whereas the sb aer co2 column achieved a maximum of 47 nitrate removal the high and similar levels of nitrate removal in cycles 1 and 2 using nacl and nahco3 regeneration solutions confirm that either chloride or bicarbonate ion can function as effective regenerant ion service cycle curves for column experiments 10 nacl regeneration and 11 co2 regeneration using real wastewater effluent are shown in figs 4 and 5 respectively constituents present in the real wastewater effluent that can impact its use for cooling water make up include calcium magnesium phosphate sulfate nitrate and doc for example calcium magnesium and phosphate contribute to inorganic scaling in recirculating cooling systems 13 sulfate can have varying impacts including corrosion and inorganic scaling in cooling systems 4 31 32 doc and nitrate can contribute to biological fouling calcium was completely removed up to 450 bvs by sa cer in the sodium ion form in the presence of other wastewater cations and nitrate was completely removed by sb aer in the chloride form up to 550 bvs in the presence of other wastewater anions see fig 4 after nacl regeneration sa cer was able to remove nearly all calcium and sb aer was able to remove nearly all nitrate for approximately 300 bvs in addition sa cer removed magnesium and sb aer removed sulfate phosphate and doc based on the number of bvs treated and the shape for the breakthrough curves the selectivity trends were calcium magnesium for sa cer and nitrate sulfate phosphate doc for sb aer see fig 4 the removal trends for cation exchange and anion exchange shown here are a result of the resins used in this work and can be altered by selecting resins with different properties such as polymer composition pore structure and functional group type 33 34 for example a520e resin is known to be selective for nitrate if removal of sulfate phosphate or doc was a higher priority than an alternative aer could be used the breakthrough curves for cycle 2 indicate that nacl regeneration was able to desorb magnesium sulfate phosphate and doc to varying extents wa cer in the hydrogen ion form and sb aer in the bicarbonate form showed similar levels of removal of wastewater constituents in cycle 1 see fig 5 as the cix treatment results using nacl regeneration see fig 4 the difference occurred when comparing cycle 2 following co2 regeneration fig 5 with cycle 2 following nacl regeneration fig 4 carbon dioxide regeneration was not able to effectively desorb the wastewater constituents from the wa cer or the sb aer and as result cycle 2 shows minimal contaminant removal the cix treatment results show lower treatment capacity in real wastewater effluent figs 4 and 5 compared with synthetic wastewater effluent figs 3 and s3 this is to be expected as the presence of competing ions will result in lower removal when compared with ions in isolation 35 the results in this section show that cix is an effective option for wastewater treatment in preparation for industrial cooling applications because it can remove a variety of chemicals that contribute to scaling fouling and corrosion 3 4 implications for energy water nexus many thermoelectric power plants in the u s are within reasonable distance 40 km or 25 mi of wastewater plants that can supply enough treated wastewater to replace or augment their cooling water needs 5 so the quantity of wastewater is not an issue neither is the amount of co2 produced at thermoelectric power plants an issue ample co2 is emitted regularly from power plants to provide enough carbonic acid to regenerate ion exchange systems such as cix 21 fig 6 summarizes these realities and shows the links between the water and energy sectors that need to be considered 3 4 1 use of wastewater treated with cix in recirculated cooling this research shows that cix treatment can remove constituents from wastewater effluent that are problematic in terms of inorganic scaling corrosion and biological fouling of cooling systems the exact number of bvs treated will depend on design of the cix system running cix columns for shorter times i e volume treated will result in higher quality water with low calcium and magnesium and reduced sulfate and phosphate concentrations which would reduce the frequency of cooling tower blowdown while sulfate and phosphate ions were removed to variable extent using cix the nearly complete removal of calcium and magnesium by cix is expected to limit scaling potential limited removal of sulfate can still be cause for corrosion concern depending on the amount of chloride that is also present in the water 31 32 to understand the impact cix treatment of wastewater on cooling systems downstream impacts of the counterions used in the process must be considered as well fig 6b for example using nacl regeneration releases sodium and chloride as counterions into the treated water sodium does not impact scaling or corrosion 36 however chloride can increase corrosion potential for lead 31 copper 31 and steel piping 4 sulfate in the presence of chloride has been shown to inhibit or accelerate corrosion depending on the ratio of chloride to sulfate ions present 31 32 a cix process of sa cer paired with sb aer regenerated nahco3 will not have corrosion potential from high chloride concentrations but bicarbonate is known to form scale in the presence of calcium and such behavior was seen in the regeneration results in this research wa cer on its own or combined with sb aer in the chloride form will likely increase corrosion from both chloride ion and low ph when sb aer in the bicarbonate form is paired with wa cer in hydrogen ion form however bicarbonate alkalinity can be neutralized and lead to reduced carbonate scaling potential while still removing problematic ions cix fig 6a with hydrogen ion and bicarbonate ion is particularly advantageous if using a weak acid ph dependent solution such as dissolved co2 to improve regeneration conditions for both resins 37 38 in this study the chlorine residual in the wastewater effluent was neutralized prior to treatment with cix to protect the resins from oxidation although the disinfectant was deactivated potential biological interactions were not included as part of this study methods for controlling biological fouling in the cooling system as well as the cix process must be considered and accounted for before implementation 3 4 2 use of captured co2 for regeneration of cix current carbon capture and sequestration ccs technology includes absorption of co2 into an amine solution adsorption onto a solid phase cryogenic distillation as well as a number of other emerging technologies 39 implementation of ccs fig 6c in many cases is economically challenging and results in decreased power plant efficiency increased operational costs as well as increased fuel and water needs 39 increasing gas partial pressure is one way of increasing amount of dissolved gas thus increasing the strength of the regeneration solution while the partial pressure of co2 used in these experiments only ranges from 2 7 to 4 1 atm 40 60 psi it should be noted that these pressures were of pure food grade co2 flue gas is rarely pure and subsequently either the pressures of gas needed to regenerate would be much higher to achieve the same co2 partial pressure or power plants would need to install separation technologies that achieve high separation of co2 from the other gases present furthermore the presence of impurities such as sulfur oxides sox that can dissolve and form ions that may potentially increase regenerant strength for cer from added acidity 21 but decrease the efficiency of aer by the introduction of a contaminant ion e g so4 2 increasing the partial pressure of co2 carbonic acid can also shift the solution ph to a point where the weak acid formed only dissociates to a limited extent restricting the presence of counterions needed for regeneration flow through columns such as those used in this study result in a gradient of converted ion exchange resins due to the plug flow nature of the reactor 40 that is those resin beads within the mass transfer zone closest to the inlet become exhausted first while those at the end are exhausted only after the resin before them are exhausted however alternate reactor designs such as a completely mixed stirred tank reactor can achieve partial conversion of resin beads more equally due to the fluid being well mixed 26 regeneration of partially exhausted cix resin with dissolved co2 may then be achievable because when only the outer exchange sites need to be regenerated the counterions do not need to overcome as much resistance to intraparticle diffusion to convert sites deep within the resin bead and kinetics of regeneration are improved under this design it may be that flue gas does not need to be pressurized extensively to achieve the amount of regeneration needed 4 conclusions the major conclusions of this work are as follows both nacl and nahco3 were effective regeneration solutions for cix process consisting of sa cer beads exhausted with calcium and sb aer beads exhausted with nitrate hcl was an effective regeneration solution for cix process consisting of wa cer beads exhausted with calcium and sb aer beads exhausted with nitrate regeneration of cix process showed that hydrogen ion and bicarbonate ion were as effective as sodium ion and chloride ion at desorbing contaminants and as a result co2 is a viable source for ion exchange regeneration results using co2 to regenerate cix process consisting of cer and aer beads showed lower regeneration efficiency than nacl nahco3 and hcl due to low stoichiometric ratios of regenerant ions regeneration of cix process using co2 should be evaluated in a completely mixed reactor as opposed to a plug flow reactor to limit exhaustion and regeneration to the outer shell of the resin beads cix treatment can remove a wide range of constituents present in wastewater effluent that are problematic in cooling water including calcium magnesium nitrate sulfate phosphate and doc
