6395,saturated hydraulic conductivity ks is a singular parameter in earth system science ks not only governs the rate of flow of water under a hydraulic gradient as specified by the darcy equation for saturated conditions but also acts as a scaling factor in many unsaturated flow and transport applications that involve pore size distribution models without knowledge of saturated hydraulic conductivity it would be difficult to accurately describe the transport of water and dissolved or suspended constituents in soils and sediments or calculate groundwater transport and recharge and quantify the exchange between soils and the atmosphere while the determination of ks is not especially difficult it is expensive and in many cases infeasible to carry out field or lab experiments for large scale applications pedotransfer functions ptfs are a class of largely data driven empirical models that aim to estimate ks and often other hydraulic quantities such as water retention characteristics from easily available data in this review we first briefly discuss the history of the development of the concept of saturated hydraulic conductivity and its relation to the kozeny carman kc equation the kc equation serves as a central point in this review because it determines which soil variables affect saturated flow at the pore scale a domain which now can also be visited by computational fluid dynamics models the kc equation also provides us with a structure in which we can classify the large number of ptfs that have been developed for estimating ks datasets and statistical techniques available for ptf development are discussed and we also describe common metrics used to assess the accuracy and reliability of ptf estimates the mutual agreement of two main classes i e an effective porosity kc based and soil texture based of ptfs is analyzed using a number of global maps of predicted ks finally we discuss challenges and perspectives that might lead to ptfs with improved estimates of ks in particular we suggest establishing and utilizing large and completely independent databases to assess the accuracy and reliability of ptfs for global use while also drawing in information from pedological and remote sensing sources keywords pedotransfer function saturated hydraulic conductivity permeability kozeny carman vadose zone soil 1 introduction soil plays a fundamental role in the earth s terrestrial biosphere by controlling the transfer of mass and energy between land surface and atmosphere amundson et al 2015 bittelli et al 2015 near surface soil is especially important because it regulates the local water balance through infiltration evapotranspiration surface runoff groundwater recharge and hence has a substantial effect on regional and global land surface water and energy balances montzka et al 2017 vereecken et al 2016 verhoef and egea 2014 for example nearly 60 of the terrestrial precipitation is returned to the atmosphere through the soil plant atmosphere continuum katul et al 2012 oki and kanae 2006 while around half of the global biomass production and related carbon cycle depend on soil processes cleveland et al 2013 accurate characterization and prediction of these soil processes usually require an accurate parameterization of soil hydraulic properties i e the soil water retention curve the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity curve and saturated hydraulic conductivity in many cases however direct measurement of soil hydraulic properties is time consuming and labor intensive and especially impractical for large scale applications dai et al 2013 vereecken et al 2010 as an alternative soil scientists have developed pedotransfer functions ptfs to estimate soil hydraulic properties from commonly available soil information such as soil texture and bulk density in the past few decades numerous ptfs have been developed for a variety of purposes and objectives ranging from theoretical studies to small plot scale empirical relations to considerable efforts that meet the needs of regional and global scale weather and climate modeling thorough reviews of the work in this field have previously been given by wösten et al 2001 pachepsky and rawls 2004 vereecken et al 2010 and van looy et al 2017 wösten et al 2001 reviewed ptfs to estimate soil hydraulic parameters including soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity characteristics vereecken et al 2010 specifically reviewed ptfs to estimate van genuchten mualem mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 soil hydraulic properties van looy et al 2017 reviewed ptfs in different disciplines of the earth system science including ptfs for water solute heat and biogeochemical soil processes previous reviews did not focus primarily on the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity k s which is a simple yet critical soil property saturated hydraulic conductivity is needed to calculate flow rates in saturated soils using darcy s equation however ks is also important in the richards equation for unsaturated flow where it is needed to scale relative hydraulic conductivity predicted by the pore scale models of burdine 1953 mualem 1976 and alexander and skaggs 1987 into unsaturated hydraulic conductivity in a broader sense our ability to estimate un saturated flow is crucial to many earth systems science applications including oil and gas recovery from geological reservoirs the protection of natural groundwater resources the remediation of polluted soil and groundwater and the long term stewardship of waste disposal sites the main thrust of this paper is to review the state of the art ptfs for estimating saturated hydraulic conductivity in soil science and hydrology in order to provide a comprehensive overview we will first provide a brief historical context of saturated hydraulic conductivity this overview starts with the empirical darcy equation for saturated flow and proceeds to the physically based kozeny carman equation see kozeny 1927 carman 1956 1937 the kozeny carman kc equation subsequently provides us with a convenient framework to briefly discuss computational fluid dynamics cfd methods which are able to simulate saturated flow networks at the pore scale the flow fields computed with cfd allow us to compute saturated hydraulic conductivity and other quantities in a mechanistic way from observed or specified pore structure the kc equation as well as cfd methods subsequently provide us with insight which soil variables should affect saturated hydraulic conductivity which we will use as a guide to group the many existing empirical ptfs according to their predictors we will subsequently discuss datasets and statistical techniques available for ptf development and evaluate a number of ptfs comprehensively accuracy and reliability of ptfs are analyzed based on commonly used criteria key challenges for the development and using ptfs are finally identified by evaluating a selection of widely used ptfs on a global data set it is noted that throughout most of the review we will use the term saturated hydraulic conductivity which is abbreviated by ks with units of length over time however it should be pointed out that other disciplines such as civil engineering designates this quantity as permeability sanchez vila et al 2006 whereas soil sciences geology and petroleum engineering use permeability to indicate the more fundamental concept of intrinsic permeability k which is related to ks as follows 1 k s k ρ g μ where ρ g and μ are fluid density acceleration of gravity and dynamic viscosity respectively this expression indicates that k s depends on both fluid properties the density and dynamic viscosity and the intrinsic fluid independent permeability of the porous medium the units of intrinsic permeability are squared length units with one darcy unit being equivalent to a permeability of 9 869233 10 13 m2 and defined in terms of standard atmospheric pressure and unit viscosity and flow rate 2 a brief history of saturated hydraulic conductivity and estimation from ptfs the concept of saturated hydraulic conductivity originated in the middle of the 19 th century with henry darcy 1856 as an inspector for roads and bridges in the french city of dijon he wrote a publication that mainly dealt with the distribution of water through the city s aqueducts however in his appendix d darcy 1856 also reported on a series of experiments on the flow of water through sand filters fig 1 darcy stated that the flow ecoulement in french is proportional to the pressure difference and inversely proportional to the thickness of the filter which allowed him to establish the original equation 2 q k s e h e where q is the flow in volume over time s and e are the area and thickness of the filter respectively h is the thickness of the layer of water above the filter the bottom of the filter is assumed to be at atmospheric pressure the variable k is translated a coefficient dependent on the nature of the sand with material specific values shown in the last column of the table contained in fig 1 after eliminating the area s and for the simplified case of vertical flow darcy s law is now commonly written in terms of flux q with length over time units and hydraulic gradient δ h δ z 3 q k s δ h δ z where δ h is the difference between water levels imposed on the inflow and outflow darcy s h e along a column of length δ z darcy s e all expressed in length units darcy s k is now written as k s and interpreted as the saturated hydraulic conductivity units length over time for a homogeneous permeable porous medium that is fully permeated with water under laminar flow conditions the negative sign is needed to make the direction of the flow consistent with the coordinate system saturated hydraulic conductivity in darcy s law is equivalent to thermal conductivity in fourier s law diffusion coefficient in fick s law and electrical conductivity in ohm s low all of which are conceptually similar and mathematically identical relationships the first application of saturated hydraulic conductivity to soil process modeling was proposed by richardson 1922 in his book weather prediction by numerical process fig 2 a see the landscape grids for velocity and pressure calculation in fig 2b also refer to dani or 2018 walter b langbein lecture which was lost during the first world war but was accidentally found and published in 1922 in this book richardson was attempting to solve the challenges of representation of land surface and water flux at the soil surface richardson s pioneering notion to combine the hydrological processes of land surface and climate modeling not only marks the beginning of the numerical weather forecasting but also permitted richardson to derive what is now known as the richards equation in 1917 see the equation in fig 2c long before lorenzo a richards published his work in 1931 richards 1931 in the present the richards equation for vertical unsaturated flow along axis z is commonly given as 4 θ t z k s k r h z 1 where ks scales the relative unsaturated hydraulic conductivity kr with the latter varying orders of magnitude as a function of matric potential or moisture content ks is therefore also an important quantity for unsaturated flow for example see mualem 1976 and van genuchten 1980 though there are some complexities if macropore flow is involved for example see schaap and van genuchten 2006 and references therein motivated by an empirical übelstand roughly nuisance in agricultural soil water balances kozeny 1927 was able to provide a theoretical basis to hydraulic conductivity by relating intrinsic permeability to pore volume and pore shape this approach was later modified by carman 1937 1956 into what is now known as the kozeny carman equation in which intrinsic permeability is written in terms of particle diameter d kozeny 1927 carman 1937 5 k c d 2 φ 3 1 φ 2 where φ is the porosity and c is a constant of proportionality alternatively intrinsic permeability can also be defined in terms of hydraulic radius rh carman 1937 see also berryman 1985 berryman and blair 1986 blair et al 1996 6 k φ r h 2 g t 2 where porosity φ clearly provides the volume available to flow the hydraulic radius r h can be defined as pore volume over pore solid surface area which means that r h is one half of the physical radius of a cylindrical pore tortuosity t and the pore shape factor g account for the lengthening of the flow path and non cylindrical pores respectively it is interesting to note here that the definitions by eqs 5 and 6 are somewhat complementary the first equation defines permeability in terms of particle phase particle diameter whereas the second equation relies on a length scale of the pore space hydraulic radius particle diameter is easy to measure but hydraulic radius typically relies on analysis of two dimensional or three dimensional images obtained of the pore space e g blair et al 1996 schaap and lebron 2001 both approaches are interesting however because they relate intrinsic permeability to pore volume shape and size and the complexity of the flow path all of which have a distinct physical interpretation we also note here that with eq 5 carman established a pedotransfer function avant la lettre in 1937 relying on measurements bear 1972 and later freeze and cherry 1979 summarized the values of hydraulic conductivity and intrinsic permeability for aquifer soil and rocks with saturated soil hydraulic conductivity ranging between 102 and 10 12 cm s from textures ranging between clean gravel to unweathered clay see table 1 campbell 1974 listed a table of saturated hydraulic conductivity for five types of soils and derived an equation to estimate unsaturated hydraulic conductivity it is noted that soil water retention parameters and saturated hydraulic conductivity were provided together because of the requirement to derive unsaturated soil hydraulic conductivity for soil modeling clapp and hornberger 1978 improved a soil water retention model and provided a lookup table of water retention parameters and saturated hydraulic conductivity for 11 usda soil classes using 1446 soil samples from holtan 1968 cosby et al 1984 derived retention parameters and saturated hydraulic conductivity by utilizing 1448 samples from holtan 1968 and rawls et al 1976 both the lookup tables from clapp and hornberger 1978 and cosby et al 1984 see table 2 have been extensively used in the community land model clm and general circulation models gcm see the land surface models in chen and dudhia 2001 dai et al 2003 kowalczyk et al 2006 niu et al 2011 oleson et al 2013 to characterize many of the previous efforts the term pedotransfer function ptf was finally introduced by bouma 1989 in general ptfs aim to estimate difficult to obtain soil hydraulic thermal characteristics solute transport coefficients or other soil properties from easy to measure and or widely available soil properties e g soil texture and bulk density from soil survey the development of ptfs therefore bridges the gap between the available soil data and required soil information and facilitates the extensive application of water flow energy transition and solute transport at the field and large scales van looy et al 2017 3 predictors of saturated hydraulic conductivity the kozeny carman expression for permeability equation 6 indicates that soil saturated hydraulic conductivity ks depends on particle size i e soil constituents and soil porosity i e soil voids hydraulic radius and a pore shape factor in section 3 1 we use computational fluid dynamics simulations on artificially generated medium to show how these factors affect the permeability from a mechanistic viewpoint however while insightful the pore scale imaging process and the computational simulations are expensive and not practical for most applications section 3 2 will therefore focus on empirical ptfs that estimate permeability from readily measured quantities such as soil particle size and soil porosity 3 1 image analysis and computational fluid dynamics recent advances in both observational and computational techniques make it now possible to obtain the three dimensional structure of the pore space and conduct simulations of fluid flow at the pore scale allowing us to derive permeability numerically several studies have carried out three dimensional imaging of porous medium with computed tomography ct ketcham and carlson 2001 wildenschild and sheppard 2013 followed by segmentation of the gray scale volumes into pore space and particle space houston et al 2013 iassonov et al 2009 iassonov and tuller 2010 kaestner et al 2008 kulkarni et al 2012 the segmented pore structure can subsequently be used for image analysis berryman and blair 1986 blair et al 1996 schaap and lebron 2001 or be used in computational fluid dynamics cfd to yield estimates of permeability e g hilpert 2011 spanne et al 1994 sukop et al 2013 zhou et al 2018 drawbacks of the ct imaging segmentation cfd approach is that it is expensive as it requires ct imaging equipment as well as substantial amounts of computation time and that the quality of the simulations and derived permeability depends on the quality of the image data and the chosen segmentation algorithm iassonov et al 2009 larsen 2018 as an example of the cfd approach we provide here some results obtained with a series of lattice boltzmann simulations e g camargo et al 2012 keehm et al 2004 martys and chen 1996 sukop et al 2013 zhang et al 2005 to obtain the pore scale flow network in a synthetic porous medium generated with a particle packing algorithm baranau and tallarek 2014 to this end we initially packed 150 particles of a nominal diameter of 100 pixels into a box of 5003 voxels volume elements using the packinggeneration software package baranov 2017 the volume was subsequently cropped to a centered 400 400 400 voxel volume to eliminate boundary effects as particles cannot be packed across the boundary of the volume a single fluid lattice boltzmann lb simulation with pressure boundaries schaap et al 2007 was subsequently run on the resulting pore structure to obtain the pore scale flow network and velocities twelve more simulations were run in which we replaced single particles by eight half diameter ones of 50 pixel diameter thus decreasing average particle size while maintaining total particle volume specifically 5 10 15 20 25 30 45 60 75 90 120 and 150 large particles were thus replaced by smaller spheres with the latter consisting 1200 smaller particles total in house computation time amounted to about 1500 cpu hours which would cost approximately 300 on an equivalent amazon ec2 system https aws amazon com ec2 pricing on demand a1 2xlarge platform retrieved on february 26 2019 fig 3 provides a depiction of packing of 1200 small particles all large particles converted top left in fig 3 the midpoint 75 large particles remaining 75 particles converted into 600 smaller ones and packing of large particles only top right in fig 3 the figure also shows the resulting flow fields indicating that the highest flow rates are reached in the volume with the largest particles top right following hilpert 2011 permeability for each of the volumes can be computed from the pressure difference between inlet and outlet top and bottom volume mean fluid velocity along the pressure gradient the length of the flow domain 400 pixels and the lb and physical fluid viscosity along with some lb topology constants a physical voxel size would subsequently provide a real permeability but was arbitrarily set to 1 in this example the tortuosity of the flow field can be computed as 7 t u u z where u is the magnitude of the velocity is the volume mean u z is the volume mean velocity along the pressure gradient fig 4 provides a plot of permeability versus relative particle size by mass computed as 1 b 2l0 with l0 the initial number of large particles and b the number of particles broken up into smaller ones the figure shows that the simulated permeability red line with dots generally increases with particle size from the dimensional analysis of the units of permeability square of length and eq 5 it follows that permeability should increase with the square of a characteristic length scale of the porous medium this relation is indicated by the dashed black line which is referenced to the simulation at a particle size of 1 however the figure shows that it is not entirely correct to use particle size as a proxy for the length scale even though the permeability at a particle size of 0 5 is roughly a quarter of that at a particle size of 1 0 as expected from eq 5 the region in between exhibits lower than expected permeability i e the red line is under the dashed line the deviation is not caused by variation in the porosity or tortuosity these values are almost constant as shown in the figure it turns out that hydraulic radius as used in eq 6 provides a better relation with permeability as shown by the green line with solid diamonds in fig 4 hydraulic radius r h was here computed as the ratio of porosity and surface area i e the ratio of pore voxels and pore solid vertices of the voxel related volume this implies that the hydraulic radius is a more appropriate length scale to characterize the porous medium than is particle size this also means that at least for these synthetic samples there is no direct relation between particle size and permeability but that particle and pore arrangement is also important referring again to fig 3 it is clear that the particle packing and flow pattern is rather ordered at a relative particle size at 1 fig 3 top right and 0 5 fig 3 top left but appears to be unordered at a particle size of 0 75 the middle column of fig 3 the random packing apparently leads to a hydraulic radius that is smaller than expected from particle size finally fig 4 also shows an evaluation of the kozeny carman equation using data obtained from the generated volumes for tortuosity we assume the value of 1 25 which is the mean value obtained with the lb simulations it is interesting to note here that porosity based tortuosity estimates by koponen et al 1996 yu et al 2003 and other approaches see larsen 2018 all yield much higher values 1 5 to 2 than computed with eq 7 a possible explanation is that the koponen et al 1996 and yu et al 2003 approaches rely on the total porosity whereas eq 7 relies on the velocity distribution in the actual flow field this approach accounts for the possibility that there is no or low flow in some parts of the pore space which then does not contribute to tortuosity we point out here that this is reminiscent of the concept of effective porosity that is discussed in section 3 1 the only unknown that remains is the geometry factor g eq 4 by setting g equal to 1 2 the kozeny carman formulation according to eq 6 yields a near exact match with the simulated lb data the above example shows that cfd can provide a detailed insight into the actual flow patterns inside the porous medium provided that the pore structure can somehow be obtained with ct imaging statistical reconstruction keehm et al 2004 yeong and torquato 1998 or particle packing as done here such analyses are computationally intensive but provide detailed data about the relations between particle arrangement particle size pore topology see vogel et al 2005 and permeability evident here and relevant for this review is that the relation between particle size and permeability is more complicated than a simple linear relation and that particle ordering and pore network effects play a role as well 3 2 empirical approaches a number of recent studies have endeavored to identify the factors controlling k s in an empirical data driven way for example using the hypres hydraulic properties of european soil soil hydraulic database lilly et al 2008 found that soil textural and structural information are the most useful input for deriving ptfs to estimate k s papanicolaou et al 2015 found that soil texture is the dominant factor in determining ks values for high sand content 15 soils and low agricultural activities while bulk density dominated low sand content and high agricultural practices at three hillslopes in southeast iowa jarvis et al 2013 and jorda et al 2015 found that ks are strongly depended on soil bulk density and land use instead of soil texture for the top soils 0 3 m depth based on published literature in order to prevent too much tedious enumeration in discussing the empirical estimation of ks we have grouped available methods in three general classes porosity based approaches particle size based approaches and ptfs that use soil structural information the first two classes parallel the kc formulations according to eqs 5 and 6 respectively the third class soil structural effects deals with ptfs where the effect of porosity and particle size is less clear and the effects of soil inhomogeneity due to structure or macropores are apparent 3 2 1 estimation using soil porosity eqs 5 and 6 clearly show the dominating role of soil porosity in permeability not only because it sets the volume available to saturated flow but also because together with surface area it defines the hydraulic radius several of the parameters in eqs 5 and 6 are difficult to measure which motivated ahuja et al 1984 1989 to simplify the kc equation carman 1956 by utilizing the concept of effective porosity φ e as 8 k s b φ e n where b and n are empirically determined constants effective porosity is defined here as the difference between the total porosity and water content at 330 cm pressure head effective porosity is therefore related to soil water retention and involves the volume fraction of large pores that would contribute to saturated flow in a meaningful way in this context it is interesting to note that the water content at the 330 cm pressure head value is at least in the usa considered to be field capacity i e the pressure head where gravity drainage of unsaturated soil conceptually ceases moisture content at 330 cm pressure head is also routinely measured in us soil surveys national cooperative soil survey 2017 ahuja et al 1989 showed that there was good agreement between estimated ks from eq 8 and experimental data by utilizing independent validation data considering the large uncertainty in measured ks values further details regarding the empirical constant b and n can be found in appendix a1 rawls et al 1998 improved the estimation of ks by including the brooks corey pore size distribution index brooks and corey 1964 into eq 8 eq a 2 in the appendix timlin et al 1999 found that further improvements were possible when the brooks corey pore size distribution index was included in the coefficient b appendix a3 although the improvement was not significant compared with the results from eq 8 spychalski et al 2007 also modified the coefficients of eq 8 and obtained a model that performed better than published ptfs when evaluated on independent data obtained from the unsoda data set although estimation of ks based on effective porosity from eq 8 is satisfying accurate estimation of effective porosity is still difficult sobieraj et al 2001 evaluated the performance of nine published ptfs and found estimates were not reliable for the la cuenca catchment in peru which in turn made them unsuitable for modeling stormflow events they suggested that an improved estimation of effective porosity should be pursued revil cathles 1999 used the classical kozeny carman according to eq 6 and derived a new equation very similar to eq 5 for pure shale and clay free sands by including the electrical formation factor separating pore throat from total porosity and effective from total hydraulic radius the resulting model captured the effective porosity and an effective hydraulic radius and was able to estimate permeability over 11 orders of magnitude for a wide variety of materials obtained from the literature the model error was within one order of magnitude bulk density can also be used to provide information about soil porosity as well as soil compaction rabot et al 2018 generally bulk density is shown to be negatively correlated with ks high bulk density indicates tightly packed soils with low porosities and presumably low hydraulic radii which should result in low ks values hierarchical ptfs such as schaap et al 2001 and zhang et al 2018 have shown that including bulk density as an additional predictor can increase r2 between estimated and measured ks values from around 0 45 by employing only soil textural percentages as predictors to 0 55 based on the same calibrated rosetta dataset ptfs that use bulk density as predictors include rawls and brakensiek 1985 vereecken et al 1990 campbell and shiozawa 1992 jabro 1992 schaap et al 2001 2004 jarvis et al 2002 li et al 2007 aimrun and amin 2009 twarakavi et al 2009 merdun 2010 tóth et al 2015 yang et al 2018 among others bulk density is shown to have a negative correlation with soil oc content heuscher et al 2005 zacharias and wessolek 2007 and therefore soil oc content has been employed to estimate bulk density in previous works such as adams 1973 and rawls 1983 a scatter plot between soil bulk density and oc content for 49 855 soil samples from the ncss national cooperative soil survey 2017 dataset is provided in fig 5 a by averaging soil bulk density and oc content within ranges there is a clear decreasing relationship between these two quantities fig 5b with narrow 95 confidence intervals which shows that there is indeed an inverse relationship between bulk density and soil oc content oc content as a predictor to estimate ks includes work by vereecken et al 1990 tamari et al 1996 wösten 1997 wösten et al 1999 weynants et al 2009 among others wagner et al 2001 compared several ptfs by utilizing oc content and those ptfs without oc as predictors based on an independent 63 german soil horizons and found that wösten 1997 s work by including oc content as a predictor performed the best however wagner et al 2001 suggested that the evaluation dataset is too small and the conclusions might not be general enough and therefore larger dataset is suggested to be used for the comparison nemes et al 2005 found a negative correlation between soil organic carbon content and ks based on four ptfs including vereecken et al 1990 wösten et al 1999 2001 and their newly developed ptfs from effective porosity by utilizing ahuja et al 1984 s approach based on three soil databases they found results that contradict findings by mbagwu and auerswald 1999 and lado et al 2004 an explanation may be that the latter authors used repacked soil columns for their experiments whereas nemes et al 2005 used undisturbed soil cores nemes et al 2005 suggested that soil oc content retains water well and allows less water to flow thus reducing ks values in addition larger cracks and clods will be replaced by more aggregated material with increasing oc content leading to more tortuous and thin pathways for water to go in summary models that rely on effective porosity are promising but empirical studies discussed above also indicate that the effects of bulk density and organic carbon affect the estimation of ks further work is needed to gauge whether these are local or study specific effects or whether they can be generalized to a global scale 3 2 2 soil textural information soil textural information includes soil textural classes soil textural percentages sand silt clay portions and soil particle size distribution since soil texture is easy to measure it is used in almost all ptfs that estimate ks unfortunately different countries or regions use different soil textural classification systems such that defined by the usda the united states department of agriculture or the european hypres hydraulic properties of european soil ssew soil survey of england and wales from uk and aisne french texture triangle of the aisne region soil survey from france currently the usda classification is the most extensively used system in the literature with soil particle size of sand silt and clay being within 0 05 and 2 00 mm 0 002 and 0 05 mm and less than 0 002 mm respectively probably the simplest method to express the relation between soil texture and ks is by averaging observed ks values for each textural class e g sandy loam silty clay etc this leads to simple tables of values and perhaps standard deviations also known as class ptfs such as those published by clapp and hornberger 1978 cosby et al 1984 and rosetta3 zhang and schaap 2017 several of these lookup tables are listed in table 2 and indicate that there are substantial differences among estimates for the same class differences of half an order of magnitude are not uncommon the lookup tables of rawls et al 1982 and carsel and parrish 1988 are widely used in soil science and vadose zone hydrology although class ptfs are straightforward and can be used even when hand classifying soil texture in the field a disadvantage is that saturated hydraulic conductivity changes discontinuously across class boundaries e g for sandy loam the rawls et al 1982 class ptf provides 62 cm day but for the adjacent loam class it lists 16 cm day in table 2 when class ptfs are used small changes in the actual sand silt and clay percentages may yield rather large changes in ks which may not be appropriate for some applications the discontinuity problem of class ptfs can be alleviated by deriving linear nonlinear regression models that predict ks from continuously varying variables that characterize the particle size distribution the most commonly used variables to express the relationship between particle size distribution and ks are sand silt and clay percentages technically only two of these should be sufficient other quantities used to express particle size distribution include geometric mean particle diameter from mishra et al 1989 or the approach of araya and paris 1981 and arya et al 1999 in the latter approach the pore size distribution is estimated from particle size distribution saturated and also unsaturated hydraulic conductivity is subsequently computed using the hagen poiseuille law using a small subset of the unsoda data set leij et al 1996 nemes et al 2001 arya et al 1999 obtained r 2 of 0 807 with an average root mean square error rmse see section 4 3 of 0 878 because of the large amount of ptfs that are based on soil texture data information we do not list them in detail here but we provide some commonly used ptfs as well as some recently developed ones in appendix b also table 3 indicates that substantial improvements are possible when bulk density is included in the predictive model showing again the role of porosity here we also remind the readers that the lattice boltzmann simulations in section 3 1 indicated an imperfect relation between particle size and ks even for an idealized medium while important soil texture data is likely an insufficient predictor for ks this may become especially relevant for highly structured soil as was suggested by wösten et al 2001 and some tropical soils in which stable clay aggregates tend to act as a sand fraction tomasella and hodnett 1997 3 2 3 soil structure information soil structure pertains to the spatial arrangement of both soil voids and solid constituents i e soil particles and organic matter dexter 1988 soil structure can be used to reflect biological activity earthworms and roots abiotic factors wetting drying and freezing thawing process or the effects of tillage practices and farmland operations in the soil romero ruiz et al 2018 suggested that traditionally measured bulk soil properties such as bulk density or porosity provide very limited soil information regarding soil structure fig 6 shows three different soils with similar soil texture and bulk density but with major differences in soil structure due to differences in soil structure different preferential flow pathways exist which may result in significantly different soil hydraulic conductivity for the three panels in fig 6 o neal 1949 is probably the first to suggest to use soil structure to predict ks by stating in general it would seem that structure is the most significant factor in evaluating permeability but permeability cannot be correctly evaluated on the basis of type of structure alone in some section heavy textures go along with slow permeability and light textures with rapid permeability but in the main texture alone not a reliable clue permeability cannot be evaluated on the basis of one characteristic alone o neal 1949 1952 further suggested that the most critical step to determine permeability is to determine the structural type followed by the relative size of the horizontal and vertical cracks and fissures and other factors he also suggested that climate condition is like to be a useful indicator of soil structure development as also indicated by tomasella and hodnett 1997 however soil structural effects on ks have not received widespread attention and recognition in the estimation of ks mckeague et al 1982 suggested that high ks values were predominantly controlled by soil biopores based on 78 soil horizons from north america we note here that the ks for the clay textural class is higher than other classes for several of the class ptfs listed in table 2 this may point to the effects of soil structure causing the ks of fine textures e g clay to be higher than some textures with more coarser particles work that investigates the effects of soil structure on ks includes wang et al 1985 coen and wang 1989 hollis and woods 1989 griffiths et al 1999 and lilly 2000 and gamie and de smedt 2018 predictors described in sections 3 1 and 3 2 have been widely used to predict ks however with the exception of lilly et al 2008 soil structure is usually missing in most ptfs the main reason for this is that soil structure e g the size shape quantity and continuity are generally less well recorded difficult to quantify and expensive to measure although structures such as the plant roots and visible pores are often documented in field descriptions vereecken et al 2010 quantification of this property and standardization of measurement techniques will help to derive continuous ptfs by including soil structure as input the same as the other quantitative predictors such as soil texture lilly and lin 2004 which will be essential in quantifying large scale fluxes and climate in the application of land surface modeling and global climate modeling we also point out that there are at least some conceptual similarities between the structured soils displayed in fig 6 and the cfd simulations in fig 3 provided that relevant macro and micro pore representations of structured soil can be obtained see larsen 2018 it may be possible to also use cfd to resolve the effect of soil structure on saturated flow in soils and other dual porosity domains e g see sukop et al 2013 4 datasets and statistical techniques available for ptf development 4 1 calibration and evaluation data ptf development typically aims to estimate difficult to measure soil properties by establishing relations between accessible input data and estimands in order to achieve this the ptf developer must have access to data sets that contain both observed hydraulic data as well as the predictors the requirements that these data sets need to meet depends on the objectives being pursued if the aim is merely to identify which variables affect ks e g in our numerical example in section 3 1 different data may be needed than in an effort where the primary objective is to develop a ptf that is representative for a population of soils in the former case a small data set with limited variability may suffice but in the latter case a much larger dataset would be needed to cover the variability relevant for a population of soils this is especially important when data driven approaches e g artificial neural networks as well as some more traditional statistical techniques are used to develop ptfs in a hypothesis driven approach e g the kozeny carman model as modified by ahuja et al 1984 the model and its input variables are known a priori and model coefficients are obtained in a calibration procedure in a data driven approach however the model its coefficients as well as the relevant input variables are found in the calibration or training procedure this requires that the calibration data set is representative and covers all the variability of the soils to which the model will be applied the authors know of few large databases that were established with the primary objective of ptf development most large databases that are available e g unsoda 2 0 nemes et al 2001 hypres wösten 2000 and grenoble soil catalog grizzly haverkamp et al 1997 were assembled from literature searches or other data gathering efforts as a result the large databases often contain data that happen to be available without a guarantee that the data are representative for a target population of soils in many cases the availability of hydraulic properties is the limiting factor with in the experience of the authors an overrepresentation of sandy soils presumably because hydraulic measurements are easier in these soils large pedological databases such as ncss and wosis are more representative of the global population of soils but are of somewhat limited use for ptf development because of limited retention data and the unavailability of observed ks values rahmati et al 2018 recently published soil water infiltration global database swig containing 5023 infiltration curves with a subset of 1896 ks dataset from 54 different countries with broad coverage of soil types and climate regions these datasets are valuable for the development and evaluation of ptfs for saturated hydraulic conductivity however as was pointed out by wösten et al 2001 pachepsky and rawls 2004 and vereecken et al 2010 that soil structural properties support scale and other soil information are also critical for the development of ptfs and this information is usually missing from most databases the set of data used for ptf development is often much smaller than the independent national datasets or worldwide collections of soil survey data such as the ncss national cooperative soil survey 2017 and wosis batjes et al 2017 that are useful for ptf evaluation this can be problematic because different calibration databases lead to systematically different ptfs schaap and leij 1998b although the combined dataset had a larger support and resulted in the rosetta ptf schaap et al 2001 there is no guarantee that this model is universal in a global sense evidence for this appears in fig 7 a which shows that the textural distribution of rosetta calibration dataset is significantly different from the distribution of ncss and wosis datasets fig 7b and c respectively sandy soils are well represented in rosetta database while silty clay loam soils have higher densities in the ncss dataset and the frequencies of silty clay loam sandy soils are high in wosis dataset a related problem is that although they are georeferenced the comprehensive ncss and wosis databases cannot provide the soil properties at any arbitrary global location additional geospatial techniques are needed to produce gridded maps of soil properties such as soilgrids hengl et al 2014 and global soil dataset for esms gsde shangguan et al 2014 even though soilgrids relies on data from the ncss and wosis datasets fig 7d indicates that its textural distribution of the 1 km2 data is more limited than either of those databases extreme silt and clay soil samples are missing this effect is found for all seven layers of soilgrids data set the possible explanation for the discrepancy is that the kriging interpolation that was used by hengl et al 2014 smoothed out the extreme values of the original point dataset a less likely competing explanation is that loam soils are more common globally than represented by the ncss and wosis data the implication of differences in the distribution among development and evaluation datasets is that ptf estimates are not necessarily representative of the true global distribution of soil texture and other relevant variables this may produce a bias for practical applications at both pedon and global scales care must be taken when using ptfs in a different environment compared with the conditions of ptf development schaap and leij 1998a 4 2 statistical techniques used to develop ptfs a wide variety of statistical or mathematical techniques is available to establish the relationship between predictors texture density organic carbon content and estimand ks because of their general empirical nature the methods available to derive ptfs are extremely diverse for a detailed overview we refer to van looy et al 2017 who reviewed a variety of the available methods that have been widely used to establish ptfs including lookup table regression techniques artificial neural networks support vector machines k nearest neighbor methods decision regression trees and the random forest method there is still a demand to develop and apply new statistical techniques based on existing or newly obtained databases many statistical packages such as the open source programming language r and open source software libraries such as google s tensorflow allow the relationship between input and output data to be mined with increased efficiency advanced techniques also bring along the temptation to increase model complexity which may be able to find patterns in data that are hidden to simple models however more complex models usually require more parameters which may lead to overfitting problems in these cases model calibration latches on to noise in the calibration data e g see fig 4 in schaap and bouten 1996 the resultant model may perform surprisingly well on the calibration data but poorly on independent data because noise or other data artifacts were incorporated in the model splitting the dataset into calibration and validation is useful for determining whether the model is overfitted by using calibration dataset for fitting and validation dataset for testing most statistical packages now have facilities to ensure proper model generalization in addition advanced model selection criteria such as aic aicc bic and kic e g ye et al 2008 can be used to rank and select models that provide an optimal balance between predictive capabilities and model complexity hastie et al 2001 ye et al 2008 finally wösten et al 2001 and minasny and hartemink 2011 suggest the importance of reliable data rather than more complex models since most ptfs were developed using a data driven approach and therefore are heavily dependent on high quality and reliable datasets accurate measurement of soil hydraulic conductivity is probably the most important factor that controls the accuracy and reliability of ptfs the authors would also like to stress that all data that were used for the development should be published along with the ptfs although open data repositories are currently more or less a requirement for publication in many journals and data used for ptf development is available this was not the case for some models that were established several decades ago several ptfs that remain in widespread use have a data provenance that is either uncertain or hard or impossible to trace 4 3 accuracy and reliability of ptfs when considering the use of ptfs several straightforward but critical questions can be raised should a new ptf specific for a population of soils be developed or should one or more ptfs be selected from the literature if so which ones what is the accuracy of the ptfs are predictions by ptfs reliable to answer these questions the differences between estimated and measured values must be quantified the term accuracy in this regard is used to quantify the correspondence between estimated and measured values during ptf calibration whereas reliability is used to determine the correspondence between estimates and measurements on independent data i e data not used for ptf calibration this latter step is often called validation which can be done independently from calibration or be integrated into the calibration procedure using techniques such as k fold cross validation bootstrap leave one out cross validation and the jackknife hastie et al 2001 the accuracy of ptfs varies considerably the reason for the variability may result from the data and methodology used for ptf development a ptf can make accurate estimates for calibration data but estimates may not be reliable when the ptf is applied to independent data especially when the characteristics of the input data differ significantly from the calibration data the accuracy of estimation can serve as benchmark values for reliability assessment because it is unlikely that a ptf will perform better on data that was not used for calibration apart from the fact that the distribution of input data may differ from that of the calibration data the reliability of ptfs may further depend on factors that were not considered as predictors such as soil characteristics climate conditions landscape features and geographical regions of the soils for example ptfs developed for soils in temperate climate regions may produce significant errors for tropical soils minasny and hartemink 2011 donatelli et al 2004 and schaap 2004 have comprehensively reviewed various criteria for assessing the accuracy and reliability of ptfs among them the most commonly used indicators for evaluating model performance are probably root mean square error rmse mean error me and coefficient of determination r 2 the rmse is defined as 9 rmse 1 n i 1 n log 10 k i log 10 k i 2 where k i and k i indicate measured and estimated saturated hydraulic conductivity ks the subscript s in ks was removed for brevity n is the number of measurement for ks the me is used to assess systematic bias of estimations relative to the measurements of ks defined as 10 me 1 n i 1 n log 10 k i log 10 k i me is negative value when the ptf underestimates ks on average positive if overestimation log 10 transformations are used here because ks can vary several orders of magnitude e g table 2 untransformed use of ks would yield error metrics that are biased to high conductivity soils because of the log 10 transformations the rmse and me values are dimensionless since log a log b log a b r2 is defined as 11 r 2 1 i 1 n log 10 k i log 10 k i 2 i 1 n log 10 k i log 10 k 2 where k is the average of k table 3 provides the error metrics for a selection of ptfs found in the literature for which these are available here reliability results validation values are shown if both accuracy calibration values and reliability validation values quantities are listed in the original literature we found that most publications listed both calibration and validation results and few showed only calibration results the number of soil samples used to develop ptfs is also listed and ideally should be large and representative for the soils to which the ptfs is being applied overall the rmse values vary considerably among ptfs shown in table 3 and range from 0 53 to 1 39 from ptfs respectively from li et al 2007 and tóth et al 2015 however in general we cannot conclude that the ptf in li et al 2007 will outperform the ptf of tóth et al 2015 this is because li et al 2007 only used 36 samples from a small area in china fengqui county for calibration and validation by contrast tóth et al 2015 used a significantly larger number of soil samples 3206 from the european hydropedological data inventory eu hydi with a much wider soil coverage in continental scales this assessment is confirmed by wang et al 2012 who validated published ptfs rosetta schaap et al 2001 wösten et al 1999 li et al 2007 and site specific ptfs based 252 soil samples developed for the loess plateau of china by utilizing 130 additional samples they found that r 2 for the site specific ptf rosetta wösten et al 1999 were 0 400 0 305 0 272 respectively while the value for li et al 2007 was 0 001 indicating no correlation between estimated ks and measured data although the data used to develop the li et al 2007 ptf were also from china me values were provided only in schaap et al 2001 tóth et al 2015 zhang and schaap 2017 and zhang et al 2018 me values range from 0 1 to 0 13 in the work of tóth et al 2015 while schaap et al 2001 zhang and schaap 2017 and zhang et al 2018 showed that me values range from 0 004 to 0 0055 all of which are based on the rosetta database the differences between the me values might result from the database they used it is also noted that positive and negative residuals will cancel out and the results can be misleading a ptf may have substantial positive and negative me for sub populations of the data to properly characterize bias in ptf estimates it may therefore be better to stratify the evaluation data in relevant classes e g by textural class and calculate me values for each in terms of r2 the values range from 0 150 to 0 872 which are respectively from the work of jorda et al 2015 and cosby et al 1984 cosby et al 1984 employed a large number of soil samples with a total of 1448 with a wide coverage from 23 states in the united states however cosby et al 1984 provided only calibration results and the performance outside the calibrated dataset should be investigated the lowest r2 value in table 3 0 150 is from jorda et al 2015 which utilized 353 soil samples from 85 different peer reviewed articles with diverse land use and soil samples being measured through different methods and devices however it is worth noting that jorda et al 2015 used a different validation method called source wise cross validation which indicated that the dataset used for validation are not from any data in the same studies from calibration dataset within the same sampling loop since no single location was included in more than one study from the peer reviewed articles collected in jorda et al 2015 this work guaranteed the soil samples from the same study will not be included in calibration and validation dataset simultaneously which is stricter than the commonly used k fold cross validation and bootstrapping methods the latter methods split the data set into calibration and validation with the possibility of correlated data in calibration and validation datasets when tested using 10 fold cross validation in jorda et al 2015 r2 was increased to 0 39 which suggested that k fold cross validation and bootstrapping sampling might over estimate the predictive performance of developed ptfs if calibration and validation are not completely independent these results indicate that we might be overly optimistic about the predictive reliability of ptfs likewise vereecken et al 2010 suggested that the validation of ptfs is best carried out by utilizing totally independent dataset rather than validation based on splitting the dataset into calibration and validation hierarchical ptfs shown in table 3 such as the work of schaap et al 2001 with rmse values decreased from 0 739 to 0 581 and r2 increased from 0 427 to 0 647 suggested that the performance of ptfs can be increased with the increasing of predictors which will facilitate the practical applications in data poor to data rich situations similar hierarchical ptfs were published by schaap and leij 1998a tóth et al 2015 zhang and schaap 2017 and zhang et al 2018 in summary it is problematic to compare different ptfs based on published error metrics small and homogeneous databases tend to yield better error metrics than large datasets that include significant variability in soil types porosity texture and structure given the increased need for detailed global distribution of soil hydraulic properties to meet a variety of modeling and evaluation goals comprehensive evaluation of ptfs on a consistent and well documented database with ptf input and observed ks values would be both timely and useful 5 a comparison of global estimates of saturated hydraulic conductivity it is currently difficult to objectively evaluate how reliable ks estimates by ptfs are at a global scale because global scale data currently are lacking while large databases with substantial global coverage such as ncss and wosis contain observed retention data they lack observed ks values no definitive statements can be made which ptf or combination of ptfs provides the best estimates at a global scale however the relative agreement among ptfs for estimating ks can be tested by evaluating these on a global data set for which we will use the previously discussed gridded data set of hengl et al 2014 two approaches are followed an indirect approach which relies on estimated effective porosity and a second approach which evaluates six ptfs directly from particle size and other soil data 5 1 effective porosity in work that is currently under review zhang et al 2019 see the preprint version in arxiv provided a high resolution global map of effective porosity by utilizing multi model ensemble of 13 widely used water retention ptfs based on ncss dataset and using the soilgrids 10 km dataset from hengl et al 2014 an evaluation of ncss data indicates that the estimated effective porosity by the ensemble is more accurate than individual ptfs that are currently being used in earth system models by utilizing the ahuja ptf 1984 eq 8 in this study global maps of saturated hydraulic conductivity and the corresponding coefficient of variation cv values are produced in fig 8 these cv values represent the agreement among estimated ks values derived from effective porosity estimated from the 13 ptfs high ks values in fig 8a are mainly found in desert regions such as the sahara and arabian deserts and high latitude north of 50 n such as northeast of north america which is likely due to high sand content in the desert and high soil oc content at high latitudes low ks values can be found in india southeast to the sahara where clay soil prevails however cv values at the low ks regions turn out to be high with the values in india exceeding the color scale limits used in fig 8b high cv values suggest significant disagreement of effective porosity estimated among individual ptfs which might help for future ptf development that more attention should be focused on clay soils this global map is promising and provides a way of moving forward to estimate unsaturated hydraulic conductivity mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 5 2 texture based ptfs six soil texture based ptfs were used to produce global maps of ks using the soilgrids 1 km dataset from hengl et al 2014 contrary to the previous section which used the soilgrids data set indirectly through effective porosities estimates validated on ncss data this section applies six ptfs directly to the global soilgrids data four of the six ptfs used only soil texture data i e textural class or sand silt and clay percentages clapp and hornberger 1978 rawls et al 1982 cosby et al 1984 lookup table carsel and parrish 1988 while the rosetta3 model zhang and schaap 2017 also used bulk density as input the weynants et al 2009 ptf used bulk density and organic carbon content some well known ptfs were excluded from this analysis because they produced unreasonable values for example wösten et al 1999 utilized the terms of 1 silt log silt and 1 organic matter in the equations to calculate ks values and we found that silt and organic matter om data can be zero in the hengl et al 2014 data leading to infinite values for the estimated ks generally there are considerable variations among ks values estimated from different ptfs ks values estimated by weynants et al 2009 ptf fig 9 f are significantly smaller than the estimates from the other ptfs the dataset used to develop the weynants et al 2009 ptf was limited to belgium and is therefore not representative of the global distribution of soils ks values obtained from ptfs from clapp and hornberger 1978 rawls et al 1982 cosby et al 1984 carsel and parrish 1988 all used only soil textural information as input while soil bulk density information are not included which might produce biased results because bulk density is related to porosity as discussed in section 3 2 arya et al 1999 suggested that similarities of soil textural data do not necessarily indicate similarities of soil hydraulic properties because significant variability in bulk density and organic matter can be present for the same texture compared with the effective porosity based ensemble model shown in fig 8a the rosetta3 model which uses texture and bulk density as predictors produces much higher ks values in the mid to high latitude of the northern hemisphere fig 9a ptfs that use only soil textural information produce lower ks values in these regions compared with cosby et al 1984 ptf clapp and hornberger 1978 and rawls et al 1982 ptfs the work of carsel and parrish 1988 produced higher ks values warm color in eurasia and north america the carsel and parrish 1988 ptf generated the highest ks values in the southern hemisphere especially in australia and south america mean values of ks obtained by averaging the six ptfs produce smoothed out results fig 9g with consequently less severe and extreme values high cv values for ks fig 9h are found in west india gabon and southeast of ethiopia in the african continent southeast of brazil iowa and missouri states in the us and some areas in canada and siberia high cv values suggest significant different estimates obtained from different ptfs and might serve as a reference to conduct future ptf improvement 6 challenges and perspectives for ptfs to estimate saturated hydraulic conductivity in this review we have introduced the history predictors and statistical techniques for ptf development of saturated hydraulic conductivity and summarized the accuracy and reliability of existing ptfs some issues and areas that might improve the ptf development have been highlighted here we summarize the challenges and perspectives for further improving ptfs to estimate saturated hydraulic conductivity 6 1 increasing the reliability of measurement of saturated hydraulic conductivity there are diverse methods and devices for measuring saturated hydraulic conductivity in laboratory and in situ such as constant head well permeameters pressure and tension infiltrometers single double ring infiltrometers undisturbed soil core methods morbidelli et al 2017 these methods have different systematic errors and biases and produce inconsistent and sometimes conflicting results which should be considered in ptf development standard methods procedures and protocols for measuring saturated hydraulic conductivity will be beneficial and improve the development of ptfs 6 2 including relevant predictors we have summarized the predictors that have been extensively used in ptf development in section 3 for increasing the predictive power and estimation accuracy more materially relevant predictors should be included however this requires that such predictors are available when the ptfs are used which may limit their general applicability due to lack of required input data considering the importance of soil structure as predictors imaging techniques are promising and attractive non invasive methods to investigate the details of soil structure these techniques may also yield additional insight when combined with cfd methods commonly used approaches include optical or electron thin section microscopy x ray tomography gamma ray and neutron tomography and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging rabot et al 2018 however there is no unified protocol to characterize soil structure and it is critical to identify agents and find proxies to quantify soil structure remote sensing products are revolutionary and provide valuable information for ptf development employing the wealth of remote sensing products such as moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis advanced land observing satellite alos sentinel 2 landsat medium resolution imaging spectrometer meris will provide information such as the vegetation types and dynamics leaf area index lai with further processing these observations may yield further soil and landscape information by which ptfs can be improved or validated other useful information and possible predictors include land use tillage activity soil horizon and direction of tension sequence dry to wet or wet to dry which will be beneficial to build new data infrastructure and improve ptf development 6 3 new statistical techniques and ensemble model with the increasing accessibility of big data relevant to the soil sciences and the breakthrough advances being developed in machine learning we see great opportunities in enhancing our physical understanding and insights new scientific discovery and predictive power statistical techniques such as linear regression neural networks support vector machines regression trees and random forest have been widely used for the development of ptfs other statistical techniques such as gaussian process ju et al 2018 raissi et al 2017 naive bayes classifiers frank et al 2000 tsangaratos and ilia 2016 have to our knowledge not been explored in ptf development and might be worthwhile investigating recently developed deep learning algorithms such as convolutional neural network krizhevsky et al 2012 mo et al 2019 deep neural network silver et al 2016 a currently hot topic in artificial intelligence seem to be very promising in this field another technique that needs to be explored is multi model ensemble prediction ensemble model combines different independent models which are consists of various data theory methodology and model structure hagedorn et al 2005 suggested that a single model may outperform in some cases but the overall ensemble model will be more reliable in the long term the overall accuracy of the ensemble model depends much more on how individual models are combined i e by assigning proper weights of each model figs 9g and h provided unweighted ensemble values for ks and its cv new national and international computing and data infrastructures facilitate the development and evaluation of ensemble models at a global scale in turn uncertainty estimates produced by ensemble models can be useful in many stochastic applications but also point out soil types or geographic areas that deserve more detailed attention from future ptf development 6 4 data assimilation and inverse modeling despite the fact that extensive development of ptfs using various predictors and more advanced machine learning methods we should be aware that the accuracy and reliability of ks estimates is modest data assimilation and inverse modeling are critical and valuable to improve the estimation of ks and moisture content by conditioning on field observed system variables such as moisture content and capillary pressure pachepsky et al 2014 pan et al 2012 shi et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 man et al 2016 ju et al 2018 yu et al 2018 zheng et al 2019 we suggest performing inverse modeling or data assimilation if observed state variables are available 6 5 application in land surface models and global climate models traditional measurement and representation of ks are carried out at laboratory soil column scale and field scales however land surface models and global climate models require the parameters in kilometer and even larger scales which poses challenges for the estimation by ptfs for these applications saturated hydraulic conductivity is known to vary with scales pachepsky and hill 2017 pachepsky and rawls 2004 vereecken et al 2010 neuman 1994 suggested that log permeability of porous medium can be considered as multiscale random functions over a continuum he demonstrated that the logarithm of effective permeability varies as a power of the characteristic length with the latter being treated as the support scale of a permeability test for geologic media the data used to develop ptfs for saturated hydraulic conductivity therefore should be scale consistent e g all at the laboratory soil column scale because ks is scale dependent by nature the scaling effects of saturated hydraulic conductivity should be considered in the application of ptfs used in catchment regional and global scales it is difficult to measure ks at kilometer scales and even harder to quantify the associated error and bias the parameters therefore should be evaluated and accessed by utilizing numerical experiments such as land surface models numerical weather forecast models and global climate models by quantifying the hydrological processes vegetation feedbacks surface energy and global climate responses 7 conclusions saturated hydraulic conductivity ks is crucial to many earth systems science applications obtaining this soil property heavily depends on soil pedotransfer functions ptfs by utilizing easily measurable basic soil properties in this review we have given an overview of the historical background of deriving and utilizing saturated hydraulic conductivity by using computational fluid dynamics model based on synthetic data we showed how permeability extendable to saturated hydraulic conductivity is affected by different predictors in pore scale simulations different predictors were systematically reviewed in the context of the kozeny carman equation in soil column scales whereas we emphasized soil structural information for future ptf development by utilizing readily available soil mapping products of basic soil properties global maps and associated uncertainty of saturated hydraulic conductivity were obtained we highlighted that accuracy and reliability of ptfs for estimating ks should be carried out based on large and completely independent databases ptf development on small and correlated databases often over estimate the reliability of ptfs to improve data quality and ptf development we suggest consistent methods and protocols for measuring saturated hydraulic conductivity given the many factors that may influence the ks estimation we suggest including relevant predictors including soil structure should be selected employing new statistical techniques and ensemble models for ptf development should be employed data assimilation and inverse modeling are valuable and promising to improve the estimation of ks by conditioning on available soil state variables such as soil moisture content saturated hydraulic conductivity in large scale simulations should be evaluated and accessed by utilizing numerical experiments such as

6395,saturated hydraulic conductivity ks is a singular parameter in earth system science ks not only governs the rate of flow of water under a hydraulic gradient as specified by the darcy equation for saturated conditions but also acts as a scaling factor in many unsaturated flow and transport applications that involve pore size distribution models without knowledge of saturated hydraulic conductivity it would be difficult to accurately describe the transport of water and dissolved or suspended constituents in soils and sediments or calculate groundwater transport and recharge and quantify the exchange between soils and the atmosphere while the determination of ks is not especially difficult it is expensive and in many cases infeasible to carry out field or lab experiments for large scale applications pedotransfer functions ptfs are a class of largely data driven empirical models that aim to estimate ks and often other hydraulic quantities such as water retention characteristics from easily available data in this review we first briefly discuss the history of the development of the concept of saturated hydraulic conductivity and its relation to the kozeny carman kc equation the kc equation serves as a central point in this review because it determines which soil variables affect saturated flow at the pore scale a domain which now can also be visited by computational fluid dynamics models the kc equation also provides us with a structure in which we can classify the large number of ptfs that have been developed for estimating ks datasets and statistical techniques available for ptf development are discussed and we also describe common metrics used to assess the accuracy and reliability of ptf estimates the mutual agreement of two main classes i e an effective porosity kc based and soil texture based of ptfs is analyzed using a number of global maps of predicted ks finally we discuss challenges and perspectives that might lead to ptfs with improved estimates of ks in particular we suggest establishing and utilizing large and completely independent databases to assess the accuracy and reliability of ptfs for global use while also drawing in information from pedological and remote sensing sources keywords pedotransfer function saturated hydraulic conductivity permeability kozeny carman vadose zone soil 1 introduction soil plays a fundamental role in the earth s terrestrial biosphere by controlling the transfer of mass and energy between land surface and atmosphere amundson et al 2015 bittelli et al 2015 near surface soil is especially important because it regulates the local water balance through infiltration evapotranspiration surface runoff groundwater recharge and hence has a substantial effect on regional and global land surface water and energy balances montzka et al 2017 vereecken et al 2016 verhoef and egea 2014 for example nearly 60 of the terrestrial precipitation is returned to the atmosphere through the soil plant atmosphere continuum katul et al 2012 oki and kanae 2006 while around half of the global biomass production and related carbon cycle depend on soil processes cleveland et al 2013 accurate characterization and prediction of these soil processes usually require an accurate parameterization of soil hydraulic properties i e the soil water retention curve the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity curve and saturated hydraulic conductivity in many cases however direct measurement of soil hydraulic properties is time consuming and labor intensive and especially impractical for large scale applications dai et al 2013 vereecken et al 2010 as an alternative soil scientists have developed pedotransfer functions ptfs to estimate soil hydraulic properties from commonly available soil information such as soil texture and bulk density in the past few decades numerous ptfs have been developed for a variety of purposes and objectives ranging from theoretical studies to small plot scale empirical relations to considerable efforts that meet the needs of regional and global scale weather and climate modeling thorough reviews of the work in this field have previously been given by wösten et al 2001 pachepsky and rawls 2004 vereecken et al 2010 and van looy et al 2017 wösten et al 2001 reviewed ptfs to estimate soil hydraulic parameters including soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity characteristics vereecken et al 2010 specifically reviewed ptfs to estimate van genuchten mualem mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 soil hydraulic properties van looy et al 2017 reviewed ptfs in different disciplines of the earth system science including ptfs for water solute heat and biogeochemical soil processes previous reviews did not focus primarily on the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity k s which is a simple yet critical soil property saturated hydraulic conductivity is needed to calculate flow rates in saturated soils using darcy s equation however ks is also important in the richards equation for unsaturated flow where it is needed to scale relative hydraulic conductivity predicted by the pore scale models of burdine 1953 mualem 1976 and alexander and skaggs 1987 into unsaturated hydraulic conductivity in a broader sense our ability to estimate un saturated flow is crucial to many earth systems science applications including oil and gas recovery from geological reservoirs the protection of natural groundwater resources the remediation of polluted soil and groundwater and the long term stewardship of waste disposal sites the main thrust of this paper is to review the state of the art ptfs for estimating saturated hydraulic conductivity in soil science and hydrology in order to provide a comprehensive overview we will first provide a brief historical context of saturated hydraulic conductivity this overview starts with the empirical darcy equation for saturated flow and proceeds to the physically based kozeny carman equation see kozeny 1927 carman 1956 1937 the kozeny carman kc equation subsequently provides us with a convenient framework to briefly discuss computational fluid dynamics cfd methods which are able to simulate saturated flow networks at the pore scale the flow fields computed with cfd allow us to compute saturated hydraulic conductivity and other quantities in a mechanistic way from observed or specified pore structure the kc equation as well as cfd methods subsequently provide us with insight which soil variables should affect saturated hydraulic conductivity which we will use as a guide to group the many existing empirical ptfs according to their predictors we will subsequently discuss datasets and statistical techniques available for ptf development and evaluate a number of ptfs comprehensively accuracy and reliability of ptfs are analyzed based on commonly used criteria key challenges for the development and using ptfs are finally identified by evaluating a selection of widely used ptfs on a global data set it is noted that throughout most of the review we will use the term saturated hydraulic conductivity which is abbreviated by ks with units of length over time however it should be pointed out that other disciplines such as civil engineering designates this quantity as permeability sanchez vila et al 2006 whereas soil sciences geology and petroleum engineering use permeability to indicate the more fundamental concept of intrinsic permeability k which is related to ks as follows 1 k s k ρ g μ where ρ g and μ are fluid density acceleration of gravity and dynamic viscosity respectively this expression indicates that k s depends on both fluid properties the density and dynamic viscosity and the intrinsic fluid independent permeability of the porous medium the units of intrinsic permeability are squared length units with one darcy unit being equivalent to a permeability of 9 869233 10 13 m2 and defined in terms of standard atmospheric pressure and unit viscosity and flow rate 2 a brief history of saturated hydraulic conductivity and estimation from ptfs the concept of saturated hydraulic conductivity originated in the middle of the 19 th century with henry darcy 1856 as an inspector for roads and bridges in the french city of dijon he wrote a publication that mainly dealt with the distribution of water through the city s aqueducts however in his appendix d darcy 1856 also reported on a series of experiments on the flow of water through sand filters fig 1 darcy stated that the flow ecoulement in french is proportional to the pressure difference and inversely proportional to the thickness of the filter which allowed him to establish the original equation 2 q k s e h e where q is the flow in volume over time s and e are the area and thickness of the filter respectively h is the thickness of the layer of water above the filter the bottom of the filter is assumed to be at atmospheric pressure the variable k is translated a coefficient dependent on the nature of the sand with material specific values shown in the last column of the table contained in fig 1 after eliminating the area s and for the simplified case of vertical flow darcy s law is now commonly written in terms of flux q with length over time units and hydraulic gradient δ h δ z 3 q k s δ h δ z where δ h is the difference between water levels imposed on the inflow and outflow darcy s h e along a column of length δ z darcy s e all expressed in length units darcy s k is now written as k s and interpreted as the saturated hydraulic conductivity units length over time for a homogeneous permeable porous medium that is fully permeated with water under laminar flow conditions the negative sign is needed to make the direction of the flow consistent with the coordinate system saturated hydraulic conductivity in darcy s law is equivalent to thermal conductivity in fourier s law diffusion coefficient in fick s law and electrical conductivity in ohm s low all of which are conceptually similar and mathematically identical relationships the first application of saturated hydraulic conductivity to soil process modeling was proposed by richardson 1922 in his book weather prediction by numerical process fig 2 a see the landscape grids for velocity and pressure calculation in fig 2b also refer to dani or 2018 walter b langbein lecture which was lost during the first world war but was accidentally found and published in 1922 in this book richardson was attempting to solve the challenges of representation of land surface and water flux at the soil surface richardson s pioneering notion to combine the hydrological processes of land surface and climate modeling not only marks the beginning of the numerical weather forecasting but also permitted richardson to derive what is now known as the richards equation in 1917 see the equation in fig 2c long before lorenzo a richards published his work in 1931 richards 1931 in the present the richards equation for vertical unsaturated flow along axis z is commonly given as 4 θ t z k s k r h z 1 where ks scales the relative unsaturated hydraulic conductivity kr with the latter varying orders of magnitude as a function of matric potential or moisture content ks is therefore also an important quantity for unsaturated flow for example see mualem 1976 and van genuchten 1980 though there are some complexities if macropore flow is involved for example see schaap and van genuchten 2006 and references therein motivated by an empirical übelstand roughly nuisance in agricultural soil water balances kozeny 1927 was able to provide a theoretical basis to hydraulic conductivity by relating intrinsic permeability to pore volume and pore shape this approach was later modified by carman 1937 1956 into what is now known as the kozeny carman equation in which intrinsic permeability is written in terms of particle diameter d kozeny 1927 carman 1937 5 k c d 2 φ 3 1 φ 2 where φ is the porosity and c is a constant of proportionality alternatively intrinsic permeability can also be defined in terms of hydraulic radius rh carman 1937 see also berryman 1985 berryman and blair 1986 blair et al 1996 6 k φ r h 2 g t 2 where porosity φ clearly provides the volume available to flow the hydraulic radius r h can be defined as pore volume over pore solid surface area which means that r h is one half of the physical radius of a cylindrical pore tortuosity t and the pore shape factor g account for the lengthening of the flow path and non cylindrical pores respectively it is interesting to note here that the definitions by eqs 5 and 6 are somewhat complementary the first equation defines permeability in terms of particle phase particle diameter whereas the second equation relies on a length scale of the pore space hydraulic radius particle diameter is easy to measure but hydraulic radius typically relies on analysis of two dimensional or three dimensional images obtained of the pore space e g blair et al 1996 schaap and lebron 2001 both approaches are interesting however because they relate intrinsic permeability to pore volume shape and size and the complexity of the flow path all of which have a distinct physical interpretation we also note here that with eq 5 carman established a pedotransfer function avant la lettre in 1937 relying on measurements bear 1972 and later freeze and cherry 1979 summarized the values of hydraulic conductivity and intrinsic permeability for aquifer soil and rocks with saturated soil hydraulic conductivity ranging between 102 and 10 12 cm s from textures ranging between clean gravel to unweathered clay see table 1 campbell 1974 listed a table of saturated hydraulic conductivity for five types of soils and derived an equation to estimate unsaturated hydraulic conductivity it is noted that soil water retention parameters and saturated hydraulic conductivity were provided together because of the requirement to derive unsaturated soil hydraulic conductivity for soil modeling clapp and hornberger 1978 improved a soil water retention model and provided a lookup table of water retention parameters and saturated hydraulic conductivity for 11 usda soil classes using 1446 soil samples from holtan 1968 cosby et al 1984 derived retention parameters and saturated hydraulic conductivity by utilizing 1448 samples from holtan 1968 and rawls et al 1976 both the lookup tables from clapp and hornberger 1978 and cosby et al 1984 see table 2 have been extensively used in the community land model clm and general circulation models gcm see the land surface models in chen and dudhia 2001 dai et al 2003 kowalczyk et al 2006 niu et al 2011 oleson et al 2013 to characterize many of the previous efforts the term pedotransfer function ptf was finally introduced by bouma 1989 in general ptfs aim to estimate difficult to obtain soil hydraulic thermal characteristics solute transport coefficients or other soil properties from easy to measure and or widely available soil properties e g soil texture and bulk density from soil survey the development of ptfs therefore bridges the gap between the available soil data and required soil information and facilitates the extensive application of water flow energy transition and solute transport at the field and large scales van looy et al 2017 3 predictors of saturated hydraulic conductivity the kozeny carman expression for permeability equation 6 indicates that soil saturated hydraulic conductivity ks depends on particle size i e soil constituents and soil porosity i e soil voids hydraulic radius and a pore shape factor in section 3 1 we use computational fluid dynamics simulations on artificially generated medium to show how these factors affect the permeability from a mechanistic viewpoint however while insightful the pore scale imaging process and the computational simulations are expensive and not practical for most applications section 3 2 will therefore focus on empirical ptfs that estimate permeability from readily measured quantities such as soil particle size and soil porosity 3 1 image analysis and computational fluid dynamics recent advances in both observational and computational techniques make it now possible to obtain the three dimensional structure of the pore space and conduct simulations of fluid flow at the pore scale allowing us to derive permeability numerically several studies have carried out three dimensional imaging of porous medium with computed tomography ct ketcham and carlson 2001 wildenschild and sheppard 2013 followed by segmentation of the gray scale volumes into pore space and particle space houston et al 2013 iassonov et al 2009 iassonov and tuller 2010 kaestner et al 2008 kulkarni et al 2012 the segmented pore structure can subsequently be used for image analysis berryman and blair 1986 blair et al 1996 schaap and lebron 2001 or be used in computational fluid dynamics cfd to yield estimates of permeability e g hilpert 2011 spanne et al 1994 sukop et al 2013 zhou et al 2018 drawbacks of the ct imaging segmentation cfd approach is that it is expensive as it requires ct imaging equipment as well as substantial amounts of computation time and that the quality of the simulations and derived permeability depends on the quality of the image data and the chosen segmentation algorithm iassonov et al 2009 larsen 2018 as an example of the cfd approach we provide here some results obtained with a series of lattice boltzmann simulations e g camargo et al 2012 keehm et al 2004 martys and chen 1996 sukop et al 2013 zhang et al 2005 to obtain the pore scale flow network in a synthetic porous medium generated with a particle packing algorithm baranau and tallarek 2014 to this end we initially packed 150 particles of a nominal diameter of 100 pixels into a box of 5003 voxels volume elements using the packinggeneration software package baranov 2017 the volume was subsequently cropped to a centered 400 400 400 voxel volume to eliminate boundary effects as particles cannot be packed across the boundary of the volume a single fluid lattice boltzmann lb simulation with pressure boundaries schaap et al 2007 was subsequently run on the resulting pore structure to obtain the pore scale flow network and velocities twelve more simulations were run in which we replaced single particles by eight half diameter ones of 50 pixel diameter thus decreasing average particle size while maintaining total particle volume specifically 5 10 15 20 25 30 45 60 75 90 120 and 150 large particles were thus replaced by smaller spheres with the latter consisting 1200 smaller particles total in house computation time amounted to about 1500 cpu hours which would cost approximately 300 on an equivalent amazon ec2 system https aws amazon com ec2 pricing on demand a1 2xlarge platform retrieved on february 26 2019 fig 3 provides a depiction of packing of 1200 small particles all large particles converted top left in fig 3 the midpoint 75 large particles remaining 75 particles converted into 600 smaller ones and packing of large particles only top right in fig 3 the figure also shows the resulting flow fields indicating that the highest flow rates are reached in the volume with the largest particles top right following hilpert 2011 permeability for each of the volumes can be computed from the pressure difference between inlet and outlet top and bottom volume mean fluid velocity along the pressure gradient the length of the flow domain 400 pixels and the lb and physical fluid viscosity along with some lb topology constants a physical voxel size would subsequently provide a real permeability but was arbitrarily set to 1 in this example the tortuosity of the flow field can be computed as 7 t u u z where u is the magnitude of the velocity is the volume mean u z is the volume mean velocity along the pressure gradient fig 4 provides a plot of permeability versus relative particle size by mass computed as 1 b 2l0 with l0 the initial number of large particles and b the number of particles broken up into smaller ones the figure shows that the simulated permeability red line with dots generally increases with particle size from the dimensional analysis of the units of permeability square of length and eq 5 it follows that permeability should increase with the square of a characteristic length scale of the porous medium this relation is indicated by the dashed black line which is referenced to the simulation at a particle size of 1 however the figure shows that it is not entirely correct to use particle size as a proxy for the length scale even though the permeability at a particle size of 0 5 is roughly a quarter of that at a particle size of 1 0 as expected from eq 5 the region in between exhibits lower than expected permeability i e the red line is under the dashed line the deviation is not caused by variation in the porosity or tortuosity these values are almost constant as shown in the figure it turns out that hydraulic radius as used in eq 6 provides a better relation with permeability as shown by the green line with solid diamonds in fig 4 hydraulic radius r h was here computed as the ratio of porosity and surface area i e the ratio of pore voxels and pore solid vertices of the voxel related volume this implies that the hydraulic radius is a more appropriate length scale to characterize the porous medium than is particle size this also means that at least for these synthetic samples there is no direct relation between particle size and permeability but that particle and pore arrangement is also important referring again to fig 3 it is clear that the particle packing and flow pattern is rather ordered at a relative particle size at 1 fig 3 top right and 0 5 fig 3 top left but appears to be unordered at a particle size of 0 75 the middle column of fig 3 the random packing apparently leads to a hydraulic radius that is smaller than expected from particle size finally fig 4 also shows an evaluation of the kozeny carman equation using data obtained from the generated volumes for tortuosity we assume the value of 1 25 which is the mean value obtained with the lb simulations it is interesting to note here that porosity based tortuosity estimates by koponen et al 1996 yu et al 2003 and other approaches see larsen 2018 all yield much higher values 1 5 to 2 than computed with eq 7 a possible explanation is that the koponen et al 1996 and yu et al 2003 approaches rely on the total porosity whereas eq 7 relies on the velocity distribution in the actual flow field this approach accounts for the possibility that there is no or low flow in some parts of the pore space which then does not contribute to tortuosity we point out here that this is reminiscent of the concept of effective porosity that is discussed in section 3 1 the only unknown that remains is the geometry factor g eq 4 by setting g equal to 1 2 the kozeny carman formulation according to eq 6 yields a near exact match with the simulated lb data the above example shows that cfd can provide a detailed insight into the actual flow patterns inside the porous medium provided that the pore structure can somehow be obtained with ct imaging statistical reconstruction keehm et al 2004 yeong and torquato 1998 or particle packing as done here such analyses are computationally intensive but provide detailed data about the relations between particle arrangement particle size pore topology see vogel et al 2005 and permeability evident here and relevant for this review is that the relation between particle size and permeability is more complicated than a simple linear relation and that particle ordering and pore network effects play a role as well 3 2 empirical approaches a number of recent studies have endeavored to identify the factors controlling k s in an empirical data driven way for example using the hypres hydraulic properties of european soil soil hydraulic database lilly et al 2008 found that soil textural and structural information are the most useful input for deriving ptfs to estimate k s papanicolaou et al 2015 found that soil texture is the dominant factor in determining ks values for high sand content 15 soils and low agricultural activities while bulk density dominated low sand content and high agricultural practices at three hillslopes in southeast iowa jarvis et al 2013 and jorda et al 2015 found that ks are strongly depended on soil bulk density and land use instead of soil texture for the top soils 0 3 m depth based on published literature in order to prevent too much tedious enumeration in discussing the empirical estimation of ks we have grouped available methods in three general classes porosity based approaches particle size based approaches and ptfs that use soil structural information the first two classes parallel the kc formulations according to eqs 5 and 6 respectively the third class soil structural effects deals with ptfs where the effect of porosity and particle size is less clear and the effects of soil inhomogeneity due to structure or macropores are apparent 3 2 1 estimation using soil porosity eqs 5 and 6 clearly show the dominating role of soil porosity in permeability not only because it sets the volume available to saturated flow but also because together with surface area it defines the hydraulic radius several of the parameters in eqs 5 and 6 are difficult to measure which motivated ahuja et al 1984 1989 to simplify the kc equation carman 1956 by utilizing the concept of effective porosity φ e as 8 k s b φ e n where b and n are empirically determined constants effective porosity is defined here as the difference between the total porosity and water content at 330 cm pressure head effective porosity is therefore related to soil water retention and involves the volume fraction of large pores that would contribute to saturated flow in a meaningful way in this context it is interesting to note that the water content at the 330 cm pressure head value is at least in the usa considered to be field capacity i e the pressure head where gravity drainage of unsaturated soil conceptually ceases moisture content at 330 cm pressure head is also routinely measured in us soil surveys national cooperative soil survey 2017 ahuja et al 1989 showed that there was good agreement between estimated ks from eq 8 and experimental data by utilizing independent validation data considering the large uncertainty in measured ks values further details regarding the empirical constant b and n can be found in appendix a1 rawls et al 1998 improved the estimation of ks by including the brooks corey pore size distribution index brooks and corey 1964 into eq 8 eq a 2 in the appendix timlin et al 1999 found that further improvements were possible when the brooks corey pore size distribution index was included in the coefficient b appendix a3 although the improvement was not significant compared with the results from eq 8 spychalski et al 2007 also modified the coefficients of eq 8 and obtained a model that performed better than published ptfs when evaluated on independent data obtained from the unsoda data set although estimation of ks based on effective porosity from eq 8 is satisfying accurate estimation of effective porosity is still difficult sobieraj et al 2001 evaluated the performance of nine published ptfs and found estimates were not reliable for the la cuenca catchment in peru which in turn made them unsuitable for modeling stormflow events they suggested that an improved estimation of effective porosity should be pursued revil cathles 1999 used the classical kozeny carman according to eq 6 and derived a new equation very similar to eq 5 for pure shale and clay free sands by including the electrical formation factor separating pore throat from total porosity and effective from total hydraulic radius the resulting model captured the effective porosity and an effective hydraulic radius and was able to estimate permeability over 11 orders of magnitude for a wide variety of materials obtained from the literature the model error was within one order of magnitude bulk density can also be used to provide information about soil porosity as well as soil compaction rabot et al 2018 generally bulk density is shown to be negatively correlated with ks high bulk density indicates tightly packed soils with low porosities and presumably low hydraulic radii which should result in low ks values hierarchical ptfs such as schaap et al 2001 and zhang et al 2018 have shown that including bulk density as an additional predictor can increase r2 between estimated and measured ks values from around 0 45 by employing only soil textural percentages as predictors to 0 55 based on the same calibrated rosetta dataset ptfs that use bulk density as predictors include rawls and brakensiek 1985 vereecken et al 1990 campbell and shiozawa 1992 jabro 1992 schaap et al 2001 2004 jarvis et al 2002 li et al 2007 aimrun and amin 2009 twarakavi et al 2009 merdun 2010 tóth et al 2015 yang et al 2018 among others bulk density is shown to have a negative correlation with soil oc content heuscher et al 2005 zacharias and wessolek 2007 and therefore soil oc content has been employed to estimate bulk density in previous works such as adams 1973 and rawls 1983 a scatter plot between soil bulk density and oc content for 49 855 soil samples from the ncss national cooperative soil survey 2017 dataset is provided in fig 5 a by averaging soil bulk density and oc content within ranges there is a clear decreasing relationship between these two quantities fig 5b with narrow 95 confidence intervals which shows that there is indeed an inverse relationship between bulk density and soil oc content oc content as a predictor to estimate ks includes work by vereecken et al 1990 tamari et al 1996 wösten 1997 wösten et al 1999 weynants et al 2009 among others wagner et al 2001 compared several ptfs by utilizing oc content and those ptfs without oc as predictors based on an independent 63 german soil horizons and found that wösten 1997 s work by including oc content as a predictor performed the best however wagner et al 2001 suggested that the evaluation dataset is too small and the conclusions might not be general enough and therefore larger dataset is suggested to be used for the comparison nemes et al 2005 found a negative correlation between soil organic carbon content and ks based on four ptfs including vereecken et al 1990 wösten et al 1999 2001 and their newly developed ptfs from effective porosity by utilizing ahuja et al 1984 s approach based on three soil databases they found results that contradict findings by mbagwu and auerswald 1999 and lado et al 2004 an explanation may be that the latter authors used repacked soil columns for their experiments whereas nemes et al 2005 used undisturbed soil cores nemes et al 2005 suggested that soil oc content retains water well and allows less water to flow thus reducing ks values in addition larger cracks and clods will be replaced by more aggregated material with increasing oc content leading to more tortuous and thin pathways for water to go in summary models that rely on effective porosity are promising but empirical studies discussed above also indicate that the effects of bulk density and organic carbon affect the estimation of ks further work is needed to gauge whether these are local or study specific effects or whether they can be generalized to a global scale 3 2 2 soil textural information soil textural information includes soil textural classes soil textural percentages sand silt clay portions and soil particle size distribution since soil texture is easy to measure it is used in almost all ptfs that estimate ks unfortunately different countries or regions use different soil textural classification systems such that defined by the usda the united states department of agriculture or the european hypres hydraulic properties of european soil ssew soil survey of england and wales from uk and aisne french texture triangle of the aisne region soil survey from france currently the usda classification is the most extensively used system in the literature with soil particle size of sand silt and clay being within 0 05 and 2 00 mm 0 002 and 0 05 mm and less than 0 002 mm respectively probably the simplest method to express the relation between soil texture and ks is by averaging observed ks values for each textural class e g sandy loam silty clay etc this leads to simple tables of values and perhaps standard deviations also known as class ptfs such as those published by clapp and hornberger 1978 cosby et al 1984 and rosetta3 zhang and schaap 2017 several of these lookup tables are listed in table 2 and indicate that there are substantial differences among estimates for the same class differences of half an order of magnitude are not uncommon the lookup tables of rawls et al 1982 and carsel and parrish 1988 are widely used in soil science and vadose zone hydrology although class ptfs are straightforward and can be used even when hand classifying soil texture in the field a disadvantage is that saturated hydraulic conductivity changes discontinuously across class boundaries e g for sandy loam the rawls et al 1982 class ptf provides 62 cm day but for the adjacent loam class it lists 16 cm day in table 2 when class ptfs are used small changes in the actual sand silt and clay percentages may yield rather large changes in ks which may not be appropriate for some applications the discontinuity problem of class ptfs can be alleviated by deriving linear nonlinear regression models that predict ks from continuously varying variables that characterize the particle size distribution the most commonly used variables to express the relationship between particle size distribution and ks are sand silt and clay percentages technically only two of these should be sufficient other quantities used to express particle size distribution include geometric mean particle diameter from mishra et al 1989 or the approach of araya and paris 1981 and arya et al 1999 in the latter approach the pore size distribution is estimated from particle size distribution saturated and also unsaturated hydraulic conductivity is subsequently computed using the hagen poiseuille law using a small subset of the unsoda data set leij et al 1996 nemes et al 2001 arya et al 1999 obtained r 2 of 0 807 with an average root mean square error rmse see section 4 3 of 0 878 because of the large amount of ptfs that are based on soil texture data information we do not list them in detail here but we provide some commonly used ptfs as well as some recently developed ones in appendix b also table 3 indicates that substantial improvements are possible when bulk density is included in the predictive model showing again the role of porosity here we also remind the readers that the lattice boltzmann simulations in section 3 1 indicated an imperfect relation between particle size and ks even for an idealized medium while important soil texture data is likely an insufficient predictor for ks this may become especially relevant for highly structured soil as was suggested by wösten et al 2001 and some tropical soils in which stable clay aggregates tend to act as a sand fraction tomasella and hodnett 1997 3 2 3 soil structure information soil structure pertains to the spatial arrangement of both soil voids and solid constituents i e soil particles and organic matter dexter 1988 soil structure can be used to reflect biological activity earthworms and roots abiotic factors wetting drying and freezing thawing process or the effects of tillage practices and farmland operations in the soil romero ruiz et al 2018 suggested that traditionally measured bulk soil properties such as bulk density or porosity provide very limited soil information regarding soil structure fig 6 shows three different soils with similar soil texture and bulk density but with major differences in soil structure due to differences in soil structure different preferential flow pathways exist which may result in significantly different soil hydraulic conductivity for the three panels in fig 6 o neal 1949 is probably the first to suggest to use soil structure to predict ks by stating in general it would seem that structure is the most significant factor in evaluating permeability but permeability cannot be correctly evaluated on the basis of type of structure alone in some section heavy textures go along with slow permeability and light textures with rapid permeability but in the main texture alone not a reliable clue permeability cannot be evaluated on the basis of one characteristic alone o neal 1949 1952 further suggested that the most critical step to determine permeability is to determine the structural type followed by the relative size of the horizontal and vertical cracks and fissures and other factors he also suggested that climate condition is like to be a useful indicator of soil structure development as also indicated by tomasella and hodnett 1997 however soil structural effects on ks have not received widespread attention and recognition in the estimation of ks mckeague et al 1982 suggested that high ks values were predominantly controlled by soil biopores based on 78 soil horizons from north america we note here that the ks for the clay textural class is higher than other classes for several of the class ptfs listed in table 2 this may point to the effects of soil structure causing the ks of fine textures e g clay to be higher than some textures with more coarser particles work that investigates the effects of soil structure on ks includes wang et al 1985 coen and wang 1989 hollis and woods 1989 griffiths et al 1999 and lilly 2000 and gamie and de smedt 2018 predictors described in sections 3 1 and 3 2 have been widely used to predict ks however with the exception of lilly et al 2008 soil structure is usually missing in most ptfs the main reason for this is that soil structure e g the size shape quantity and continuity are generally less well recorded difficult to quantify and expensive to measure although structures such as the plant roots and visible pores are often documented in field descriptions vereecken et al 2010 quantification of this property and standardization of measurement techniques will help to derive continuous ptfs by including soil structure as input the same as the other quantitative predictors such as soil texture lilly and lin 2004 which will be essential in quantifying large scale fluxes and climate in the application of land surface modeling and global climate modeling we also point out that there are at least some conceptual similarities between the structured soils displayed in fig 6 and the cfd simulations in fig 3 provided that relevant macro and micro pore representations of structured soil can be obtained see larsen 2018 it may be possible to also use cfd to resolve the effect of soil structure on saturated flow in soils and other dual porosity domains e g see sukop et al 2013 4 datasets and statistical techniques available for ptf development 4 1 calibration and evaluation data ptf development typically aims to estimate difficult to measure soil properties by establishing relations between accessible input data and estimands in order to achieve this the ptf developer must have access to data sets that contain both observed hydraulic data as well as the predictors the requirements that these data sets need to meet depends on the objectives being pursued if the aim is merely to identify which variables affect ks e g in our numerical example in section 3 1 different data may be needed than in an effort where the primary objective is to develop a ptf that is representative for a population of soils in the former case a small data set with limited variability may suffice but in the latter case a much larger dataset would be needed to cover the variability relevant for a population of soils this is especially important when data driven approaches e g artificial neural networks as well as some more traditional statistical techniques are used to develop ptfs in a hypothesis driven approach e g the kozeny carman model as modified by ahuja et al 1984 the model and its input variables are known a priori and model coefficients are obtained in a calibration procedure in a data driven approach however the model its coefficients as well as the relevant input variables are found in the calibration or training procedure this requires that the calibration data set is representative and covers all the variability of the soils to which the model will be applied the authors know of few large databases that were established with the primary objective of ptf development most large databases that are available e g unsoda 2 0 nemes et al 2001 hypres wösten 2000 and grenoble soil catalog grizzly haverkamp et al 1997 were assembled from literature searches or other data gathering efforts as a result the large databases often contain data that happen to be available without a guarantee that the data are representative for a target population of soils in many cases the availability of hydraulic properties is the limiting factor with in the experience of the authors an overrepresentation of sandy soils presumably because hydraulic measurements are easier in these soils large pedological databases such as ncss and wosis are more representative of the global population of soils but are of somewhat limited use for ptf development because of limited retention data and the unavailability of observed ks values rahmati et al 2018 recently published soil water infiltration global database swig containing 5023 infiltration curves with a subset of 1896 ks dataset from 54 different countries with broad coverage of soil types and climate regions these datasets are valuable for the development and evaluation of ptfs for saturated hydraulic conductivity however as was pointed out by wösten et al 2001 pachepsky and rawls 2004 and vereecken et al 2010 that soil structural properties support scale and other soil information are also critical for the development of ptfs and this information is usually missing from most databases the set of data used for ptf development is often much smaller than the independent national datasets or worldwide collections of soil survey data such as the ncss national cooperative soil survey 2017 and wosis batjes et al 2017 that are useful for ptf evaluation this can be problematic because different calibration databases lead to systematically different ptfs schaap and leij 1998b although the combined dataset had a larger support and resulted in the rosetta ptf schaap et al 2001 there is no guarantee that this model is universal in a global sense evidence for this appears in fig 7 a which shows that the textural distribution of rosetta calibration dataset is significantly different from the distribution of ncss and wosis datasets fig 7b and c respectively sandy soils are well represented in rosetta database while silty clay loam soils have higher densities in the ncss dataset and the frequencies of silty clay loam sandy soils are high in wosis dataset a related problem is that although they are georeferenced the comprehensive ncss and wosis databases cannot provide the soil properties at any arbitrary global location additional geospatial techniques are needed to produce gridded maps of soil properties such as soilgrids hengl et al 2014 and global soil dataset for esms gsde shangguan et al 2014 even though soilgrids relies on data from the ncss and wosis datasets fig 7d indicates that its textural distribution of the 1 km2 data is more limited than either of those databases extreme silt and clay soil samples are missing this effect is found for all seven layers of soilgrids data set the possible explanation for the discrepancy is that the kriging interpolation that was used by hengl et al 2014 smoothed out the extreme values of the original point dataset a less likely competing explanation is that loam soils are more common globally than represented by the ncss and wosis data the implication of differences in the distribution among development and evaluation datasets is that ptf estimates are not necessarily representative of the true global distribution of soil texture and other relevant variables this may produce a bias for practical applications at both pedon and global scales care must be taken when using ptfs in a different environment compared with the conditions of ptf development schaap and leij 1998a 4 2 statistical techniques used to develop ptfs a wide variety of statistical or mathematical techniques is available to establish the relationship between predictors texture density organic carbon content and estimand ks because of their general empirical nature the methods available to derive ptfs are extremely diverse for a detailed overview we refer to van looy et al 2017 who reviewed a variety of the available methods that have been widely used to establish ptfs including lookup table regression techniques artificial neural networks support vector machines k nearest neighbor methods decision regression trees and the random forest method there is still a demand to develop and apply new statistical techniques based on existing or newly obtained databases many statistical packages such as the open source programming language r and open source software libraries such as google s tensorflow allow the relationship between input and output data to be mined with increased efficiency advanced techniques also bring along the temptation to increase model complexity which may be able to find patterns in data that are hidden to simple models however more complex models usually require more parameters which may lead to overfitting problems in these cases model calibration latches on to noise in the calibration data e g see fig 4 in schaap and bouten 1996 the resultant model may perform surprisingly well on the calibration data but poorly on independent data because noise or other data artifacts were incorporated in the model splitting the dataset into calibration and validation is useful for determining whether the model is overfitted by using calibration dataset for fitting and validation dataset for testing most statistical packages now have facilities to ensure proper model generalization in addition advanced model selection criteria such as aic aicc bic and kic e g ye et al 2008 can be used to rank and select models that provide an optimal balance between predictive capabilities and model complexity hastie et al 2001 ye et al 2008 finally wösten et al 2001 and minasny and hartemink 2011 suggest the importance of reliable data rather than more complex models since most ptfs were developed using a data driven approach and therefore are heavily dependent on high quality and reliable datasets accurate measurement of soil hydraulic conductivity is probably the most important factor that controls the accuracy and reliability of ptfs the authors would also like to stress that all data that were used for the development should be published along with the ptfs although open data repositories are currently more or less a requirement for publication in many journals and data used for ptf development is available this was not the case for some models that were established several decades ago several ptfs that remain in widespread use have a data provenance that is either uncertain or hard or impossible to trace 4 3 accuracy and reliability of ptfs when considering the use of ptfs several straightforward but critical questions can be raised should a new ptf specific for a population of soils be developed or should one or more ptfs be selected from the literature if so which ones what is the accuracy of the ptfs are predictions by ptfs reliable to answer these questions the differences between estimated and measured values must be quantified the term accuracy in this regard is used to quantify the correspondence between estimated and measured values during ptf calibration whereas reliability is used to determine the correspondence between estimates and measurements on independent data i e data not used for ptf calibration this latter step is often called validation which can be done independently from calibration or be integrated into the calibration procedure using techniques such as k fold cross validation bootstrap leave one out cross validation and the jackknife hastie et al 2001 the accuracy of ptfs varies considerably the reason for the variability may result from the data and methodology used for ptf development a ptf can make accurate estimates for calibration data but estimates may not be reliable when the ptf is applied to independent data especially when the characteristics of the input data differ significantly from the calibration data the accuracy of estimation can serve as benchmark values for reliability assessment because it is unlikely that a ptf will perform better on data that was not used for calibration apart from the fact that the distribution of input data may differ from that of the calibration data the reliability of ptfs may further depend on factors that were not considered as predictors such as soil characteristics climate conditions landscape features and geographical regions of the soils for example ptfs developed for soils in temperate climate regions may produce significant errors for tropical soils minasny and hartemink 2011 donatelli et al 2004 and schaap 2004 have comprehensively reviewed various criteria for assessing the accuracy and reliability of ptfs among them the most commonly used indicators for evaluating model performance are probably root mean square error rmse mean error me and coefficient of determination r 2 the rmse is defined as 9 rmse 1 n i 1 n log 10 k i log 10 k i 2 where k i and k i indicate measured and estimated saturated hydraulic conductivity ks the subscript s in ks was removed for brevity n is the number of measurement for ks the me is used to assess systematic bias of estimations relative to the measurements of ks defined as 10 me 1 n i 1 n log 10 k i log 10 k i me is negative value when the ptf underestimates ks on average positive if overestimation log 10 transformations are used here because ks can vary several orders of magnitude e g table 2 untransformed use of ks would yield error metrics that are biased to high conductivity soils because of the log 10 transformations the rmse and me values are dimensionless since log a log b log a b r2 is defined as 11 r 2 1 i 1 n log 10 k i log 10 k i 2 i 1 n log 10 k i log 10 k 2 where k is the average of k table 3 provides the error metrics for a selection of ptfs found in the literature for which these are available here reliability results validation values are shown if both accuracy calibration values and reliability validation values quantities are listed in the original literature we found that most publications listed both calibration and validation results and few showed only calibration results the number of soil samples used to develop ptfs is also listed and ideally should be large and representative for the soils to which the ptfs is being applied overall the rmse values vary considerably among ptfs shown in table 3 and range from 0 53 to 1 39 from ptfs respectively from li et al 2007 and tóth et al 2015 however in general we cannot conclude that the ptf in li et al 2007 will outperform the ptf of tóth et al 2015 this is because li et al 2007 only used 36 samples from a small area in china fengqui county for calibration and validation by contrast tóth et al 2015 used a significantly larger number of soil samples 3206 from the european hydropedological data inventory eu hydi with a much wider soil coverage in continental scales this assessment is confirmed by wang et al 2012 who validated published ptfs rosetta schaap et al 2001 wösten et al 1999 li et al 2007 and site specific ptfs based 252 soil samples developed for the loess plateau of china by utilizing 130 additional samples they found that r 2 for the site specific ptf rosetta wösten et al 1999 were 0 400 0 305 0 272 respectively while the value for li et al 2007 was 0 001 indicating no correlation between estimated ks and measured data although the data used to develop the li et al 2007 ptf were also from china me values were provided only in schaap et al 2001 tóth et al 2015 zhang and schaap 2017 and zhang et al 2018 me values range from 0 1 to 0 13 in the work of tóth et al 2015 while schaap et al 2001 zhang and schaap 2017 and zhang et al 2018 showed that me values range from 0 004 to 0 0055 all of which are based on the rosetta database the differences between the me values might result from the database they used it is also noted that positive and negative residuals will cancel out and the results can be misleading a ptf may have substantial positive and negative me for sub populations of the data to properly characterize bias in ptf estimates it may therefore be better to stratify the evaluation data in relevant classes e g by textural class and calculate me values for each in terms of r2 the values range from 0 150 to 0 872 which are respectively from the work of jorda et al 2015 and cosby et al 1984 cosby et al 1984 employed a large number of soil samples with a total of 1448 with a wide coverage from 23 states in the united states however cosby et al 1984 provided only calibration results and the performance outside the calibrated dataset should be investigated the lowest r2 value in table 3 0 150 is from jorda et al 2015 which utilized 353 soil samples from 85 different peer reviewed articles with diverse land use and soil samples being measured through different methods and devices however it is worth noting that jorda et al 2015 used a different validation method called source wise cross validation which indicated that the dataset used for validation are not from any data in the same studies from calibration dataset within the same sampling loop since no single location was included in more than one study from the peer reviewed articles collected in jorda et al 2015 this work guaranteed the soil samples from the same study will not be included in calibration and validation dataset simultaneously which is stricter than the commonly used k fold cross validation and bootstrapping methods the latter methods split the data set into calibration and validation with the possibility of correlated data in calibration and validation datasets when tested using 10 fold cross validation in jorda et al 2015 r2 was increased to 0 39 which suggested that k fold cross validation and bootstrapping sampling might over estimate the predictive performance of developed ptfs if calibration and validation are not completely independent these results indicate that we might be overly optimistic about the predictive reliability of ptfs likewise vereecken et al 2010 suggested that the validation of ptfs is best carried out by utilizing totally independent dataset rather than validation based on splitting the dataset into calibration and validation hierarchical ptfs shown in table 3 such as the work of schaap et al 2001 with rmse values decreased from 0 739 to 0 581 and r2 increased from 0 427 to 0 647 suggested that the performance of ptfs can be increased with the increasing of predictors which will facilitate the practical applications in data poor to data rich situations similar hierarchical ptfs were published by schaap and leij 1998a tóth et al 2015 zhang and schaap 2017 and zhang et al 2018 in summary it is problematic to compare different ptfs based on published error metrics small and homogeneous databases tend to yield better error metrics than large datasets that include significant variability in soil types porosity texture and structure given the increased need for detailed global distribution of soil hydraulic properties to meet a variety of modeling and evaluation goals comprehensive evaluation of ptfs on a consistent and well documented database with ptf input and observed ks values would be both timely and useful 5 a comparison of global estimates of saturated hydraulic conductivity it is currently difficult to objectively evaluate how reliable ks estimates by ptfs are at a global scale because global scale data currently are lacking while large databases with substantial global coverage such as ncss and wosis contain observed retention data they lack observed ks values no definitive statements can be made which ptf or combination of ptfs provides the best estimates at a global scale however the relative agreement among ptfs for estimating ks can be tested by evaluating these on a global data set for which we will use the previously discussed gridded data set of hengl et al 2014 two approaches are followed an indirect approach which relies on estimated effective porosity and a second approach which evaluates six ptfs directly from particle size and other soil data 5 1 effective porosity in work that is currently under review zhang et al 2019 see the preprint version in arxiv provided a high resolution global map of effective porosity by utilizing multi model ensemble of 13 widely used water retention ptfs based on ncss dataset and using the soilgrids 10 km dataset from hengl et al 2014 an evaluation of ncss data indicates that the estimated effective porosity by the ensemble is more accurate than individual ptfs that are currently being used in earth system models by utilizing the ahuja ptf 1984 eq 8 in this study global maps of saturated hydraulic conductivity and the corresponding coefficient of variation cv values are produced in fig 8 these cv values represent the agreement among estimated ks values derived from effective porosity estimated from the 13 ptfs high ks values in fig 8a are mainly found in desert regions such as the sahara and arabian deserts and high latitude north of 50 n such as northeast of north america which is likely due to high sand content in the desert and high soil oc content at high latitudes low ks values can be found in india southeast to the sahara where clay soil prevails however cv values at the low ks regions turn out to be high with the values in india exceeding the color scale limits used in fig 8b high cv values suggest significant disagreement of effective porosity estimated among individual ptfs which might help for future ptf development that more attention should be focused on clay soils this global map is promising and provides a way of moving forward to estimate unsaturated hydraulic conductivity mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 5 2 texture based ptfs six soil texture based ptfs were used to produce global maps of ks using the soilgrids 1 km dataset from hengl et al 2014 contrary to the previous section which used the soilgrids data set indirectly through effective porosities estimates validated on ncss data this section applies six ptfs directly to the global soilgrids data four of the six ptfs used only soil texture data i e textural class or sand silt and clay percentages clapp and hornberger 1978 rawls et al 1982 cosby et al 1984 lookup table carsel and parrish 1988 while the rosetta3 model zhang and schaap 2017 also used bulk density as input the weynants et al 2009 ptf used bulk density and organic carbon content some well known ptfs were excluded from this analysis because they produced unreasonable values for example wösten et al 1999 utilized the terms of 1 silt log silt and 1 organic matter in the equations to calculate ks values and we found that silt and organic matter om data can be zero in the hengl et al 2014 data leading to infinite values for the estimated ks generally there are considerable variations among ks values estimated from different ptfs ks values estimated by weynants et al 2009 ptf fig 9 f are significantly smaller than the estimates from the other ptfs the dataset used to develop the weynants et al 2009 ptf was limited to belgium and is therefore not representative of the global distribution of soils ks values obtained from ptfs from clapp and hornberger 1978 rawls et al 1982 cosby et al 1984 carsel and parrish 1988 all used only soil textural information as input while soil bulk density information are not included which might produce biased results because bulk density is related to porosity as discussed in section 3 2 arya et al 1999 suggested that similarities of soil textural data do not necessarily indicate similarities of soil hydraulic properties because significant variability in bulk density and organic matter can be present for the same texture compared with the effective porosity based ensemble model shown in fig 8a the rosetta3 model which uses texture and bulk density as predictors produces much higher ks values in the mid to high latitude of the northern hemisphere fig 9a ptfs that use only soil textural information produce lower ks values in these regions compared with cosby et al 1984 ptf clapp and hornberger 1978 and rawls et al 1982 ptfs the work of carsel and parrish 1988 produced higher ks values warm color in eurasia and north america the carsel and parrish 1988 ptf generated the highest ks values in the southern hemisphere especially in australia and south america mean values of ks obtained by averaging the six ptfs produce smoothed out results fig 9g with consequently less severe and extreme values high cv values for ks fig 9h are found in west india gabon and southeast of ethiopia in the african continent southeast of brazil iowa and missouri states in the us and some areas in canada and siberia high cv values suggest significant different estimates obtained from different ptfs and might serve as a reference to conduct future ptf improvement 6 challenges and perspectives for ptfs to estimate saturated hydraulic conductivity in this review we have introduced the history predictors and statistical techniques for ptf development of saturated hydraulic conductivity and summarized the accuracy and reliability of existing ptfs some issues and areas that might improve the ptf development have been highlighted here we summarize the challenges and perspectives for further improving ptfs to estimate saturated hydraulic conductivity 6 1 increasing the reliability of measurement of saturated hydraulic conductivity there are diverse methods and devices for measuring saturated hydraulic conductivity in laboratory and in situ such as constant head well permeameters pressure and tension infiltrometers single double ring infiltrometers undisturbed soil core methods morbidelli et al 2017 these methods have different systematic errors and biases and produce inconsistent and sometimes conflicting results which should be considered in ptf development standard methods procedures and protocols for measuring saturated hydraulic conductivity will be beneficial and improve the development of ptfs 6 2 including relevant predictors we have summarized the predictors that have been extensively used in ptf development in section 3 for increasing the predictive power and estimation accuracy more materially relevant predictors should be included however this requires that such predictors are available when the ptfs are used which may limit their general applicability due to lack of required input data considering the importance of soil structure as predictors imaging techniques are promising and attractive non invasive methods to investigate the details of soil structure these techniques may also yield additional insight when combined with cfd methods commonly used approaches include optical or electron thin section microscopy x ray tomography gamma ray and neutron tomography and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging rabot et al 2018 however there is no unified protocol to characterize soil structure and it is critical to identify agents and find proxies to quantify soil structure remote sensing products are revolutionary and provide valuable information for ptf development employing the wealth of remote sensing products such as moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis advanced land observing satellite alos sentinel 2 landsat medium resolution imaging spectrometer meris will provide information such as the vegetation types and dynamics leaf area index lai with further processing these observations may yield further soil and landscape information by which ptfs can be improved or validated other useful information and possible predictors include land use tillage activity soil horizon and direction of tension sequence dry to wet or wet to dry which will be beneficial to build new data infrastructure and improve ptf development 6 3 new statistical techniques and ensemble model with the increasing accessibility of big data relevant to the soil sciences and the breakthrough advances being developed in machine learning we see great opportunities in enhancing our physical understanding and insights new scientific discovery and predictive power statistical techniques such as linear regression neural networks support vector machines regression trees and random forest have been widely used for the development of ptfs other statistical techniques such as gaussian process ju et al 2018 raissi et al 2017 naive bayes classifiers frank et al 2000 tsangaratos and ilia 2016 have to our knowledge not been explored in ptf development and might be worthwhile investigating recently developed deep learning algorithms such as convolutional neural network krizhevsky et al 2012 mo et al 2019 deep neural network silver et al 2016 a currently hot topic in artificial intelligence seem to be very promising in this field another technique that needs to be explored is multi model ensemble prediction ensemble model combines different independent models which are consists of various data theory methodology and model structure hagedorn et al 2005 suggested that a single model may outperform in some cases but the overall ensemble model will be more reliable in the long term the overall accuracy of the ensemble model depends much more on how individual models are combined i e by assigning proper weights of each model figs 9g and h provided unweighted ensemble values for ks and its cv new national and international computing and data infrastructures facilitate the development and evaluation of ensemble models at a global scale in turn uncertainty estimates produced by ensemble models can be useful in many stochastic applications but also point out soil types or geographic areas that deserve more detailed attention from future ptf development 6 4 data assimilation and inverse modeling despite the fact that extensive development of ptfs using various predictors and more advanced machine learning methods we should be aware that the accuracy and reliability of ks estimates is modest data assimilation and inverse modeling are critical and valuable to improve the estimation of ks and moisture content by conditioning on field observed system variables such as moisture content and capillary pressure pachepsky et al 2014 pan et al 2012 shi et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 man et al 2016 ju et al 2018 yu et al 2018 zheng et al 2019 we suggest performing inverse modeling or data assimilation if observed state variables are available 6 5 application in land surface models and global climate models traditional measurement and representation of ks are carried out at laboratory soil column scale and field scales however land surface models and global climate models require the parameters in kilometer and even larger scales which poses challenges for the estimation by ptfs for these applications saturated hydraulic conductivity is known to vary with scales pachepsky and hill 2017 pachepsky and rawls 2004 vereecken et al 2010 neuman 1994 suggested that log permeability of porous medium can be considered as multiscale random functions over a continuum he demonstrated that the logarithm of effective permeability varies as a power of the characteristic length with the latter being treated as the support scale of a permeability test for geologic media the data used to develop ptfs for saturated hydraulic conductivity therefore should be scale consistent e g all at the laboratory soil column scale because ks is scale dependent by nature the scaling effects of saturated hydraulic conductivity should be considered in the application of ptfs used in catchment regional and global scales it is difficult to measure ks at kilometer scales and even harder to quantify the associated error and bias the parameters therefore should be evaluated and accessed by utilizing numerical experiments such as land surface models numerical weather forecast models and global climate models by quantifying the hydrological processes vegetation feedbacks surface energy and global climate responses 7 conclusions saturated hydraulic conductivity ks is crucial to many earth systems science applications obtaining this soil property heavily depends on soil pedotransfer functions ptfs by utilizing easily measurable basic soil properties in this review we have given an overview of the historical background of deriving and utilizing saturated hydraulic conductivity by using computational fluid dynamics model based on synthetic data we showed how permeability extendable to saturated hydraulic conductivity is affected by different predictors in pore scale simulations different predictors were systematically reviewed in the context of the kozeny carman equation in soil column scales whereas we emphasized soil structural information for future ptf development by utilizing readily available soil mapping products of basic soil properties global maps and associated uncertainty of saturated hydraulic conductivity were obtained we highlighted that accuracy and reliability of ptfs for estimating ks should be carried out based on large and completely independent databases ptf development on small and correlated databases often over estimate the reliability of ptfs to improve data quality and ptf development we suggest consistent methods and protocols for measuring saturated hydraulic conductivity given the many factors that may influence the ks estimation we suggest including relevant predictors including soil structure should be selected employing new statistical techniques and ensemble models for ptf development should be employed data assimilation and inverse modeling are valuable and promising to improve the estimation of ks by conditioning on available soil state variables such as soil moisture content saturated hydraulic conductivity in large scale simulations should be evaluated and accessed by utilizing numerical experiments such as

6396,forests are important components of the terrestrial ecosystem that play major roles in carbon cycling and associated environmental changes but more knowledge of the processes involved is required therefore carbon wet deposition and rainfall runoff processes were examined as well as carbon fluxes and sources in water in the xiangxi river watershed a typical subtropical forested watershed in china wet deposition of carbon amounted to 1 31 104 kg km 2 between june 2015 and may 2016 inclusive the concentration of measured forms of carbon in rainwater of single rainfall event peaked in summer when the concentration of dissolved total carbon dtc was 16 5 mg l 1 in 2016 rainfall runoff amounted to 7440 kg km 2 accounting for about 57 of the carbon wet deposition in the watershed the forest ecosystem in the watershed was found to be a carbon sink every month of the year with net ecosystem co2 exchange nee in 2016 of 5 11 105 kg c km 2 and monthly nee was lowest in july 8 93 104 kg c km 2 the 13c 12c ratio in dissolved inorganic carbon in the river water relative to pee dee belemnite δ13cdic was higher in the dry season range 12 00 to 9 70 mean 11 0 than in the rainy season range 14 00 to 12 20 mean 12 90 and higher in downstream reaches mean values in winter and spring 10 45 and 12 35 respectively than in upstream and middle reaches 10 63 and 13 30 11 63 and 12 87 in addition atmospheric precipitation made the highest contributions to the c concentration in the river water in spring and winter 48 6 and 43 2 respectively keywords subtropical watershed wet deposition of carbon rainfall runoff carbon flux isotope analysis 1 introduction forest ecosystems play major roles in global carbon cycling and balances moreover forests collectively comprise the largest carbon sink in terrestrial ecosystems fixing co2 photosynthetically in primary production and storing about two thirds of the total carbon sequestered in the entire terrestrial ecosystem watson et al 2000 canadell et al 2007 beer et al 2010 pan et al 2011 varying amounts of the carbon is subsequently released as co2 to the atmosphere on various time scales through complex respiratory processes thereby closing the atmosphere vegetation soil atmosphere carbon cycle valentini et al 2000 yan 2016 rates of carbon emission and absorption known as net ecosystem co2 exchange nee rates respectively indicating the strength of ecosystems or their components as carbon sources and sinks are key variables baldocchi 2008 other important variables of c fluxes in an ecosystem are the gross ecosystem exchange gee and ecosystem respiration re rates flanagan and johnson 2005 detailed knowledge of the processes involved is crucial for predicting changes in the global or local carbon cycle and associated ecological and climatic changes complex biogeochemical processes and human activities interactively release carbon of various forms from diverse sources in watersheds into river systems in southern china the main form of carbon in the rivers is dissolved inorganic carbon dic and its stable isotope composition reflects the local watershed s geochemical characteristics qian 2017 thus analysis of the stable isotopes in the dic in watersheds especially the 13c to 12c ratio relative to a standard δ13c is valuable for tracing the sources geochemical behavior and circulation of carbon barth et al 2003 lee et al 2007 huang et al 2017 xiangxi river is located near qianyanzhou ecological station chinese academy of sciences it belongs to the typical subtropical monsoon climateand has a wide range of plantations the biogeochemical characteristics of carbon cycle in subtropical regions have gradually become a research hotspot due to its high vegetation coverage and obvious carbon sink effect of forest ecosystems and in the context of the increasing area of plantation ecosystems china s plantation forest area ranks first in the world and plantation ecosystem has become an important part of china s forest ecosystem liu et al 2005 so exploring the biogeochemical cycling process and characteristics of carbon in these areas at the forest watershed scale is conducive to formulating targeted measures and forming favorable guidance for the carbon cycling process such analysis is generally more straightforward in small watersheds because they facilitate representative sampling and generally have more homogeneous geological and geomorphic environments than large watersheds further study of the carbon budget of plantation ecosystems in subtropical regions is of great significance for evaluating the carbon sequestration rate and potential of forest ecosystems in china δ13cdic patterns in the lower reaches of the xiangxi river recorded by sun et al 2015 indicate that the dic concentration in the river is affected not only by weathering of the rock but also by photosynthesis in the river however despite this and numerous other relevant studies the mechanisms involved in the transport and export of c between river water and soil are complex as numerous factors influence geological and pedological environmental compartments anderson and robert 2010 it is highly important to increase knowledge of the sources and dynamic processes affecting carbon in these compartments inter alia via stable isotopic analyses of key carbon pools in watersheds thus aims of the study reported here were to examine carbon distributions and fluxes in a typical forested watershed in the subtropical region of china where plantations account for more than 65 of total terrestrial carbon sequestration in china specific objectives were to characterize c concentrations and distributions during baseflow and rainfall runoff conditions summarize characteristics of the c fluxes quantitatively evaluate the carbon budget of the ecosystem and identify sources of carbon in the baseflow by stable isotopic analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study focused on the xiangxi river watershed in the jitai basin taihe county jiangxi province 115 04 13 e 26 44 48 n china fig 1 a where the qianyanzhou ecological station of the chinese academy of sciences has been gathering data since 1983 water from the xiangxi river flows into the second branch of the ganjiang river fig 1b c the average altitude is 110 8 m and the watershed has a typical subtropical monsoon climate with an annual relative humidity of 84 gao et al 2017 the mean annual precipitation and mean annual temperature are 1540 mm and 16 5 respectively annual rainfall is strongly seasonally distributed more than 80 falls from march to september but severe dry period frequently occur in july and august mainly due to high temperature and lack of rainfall the total area of the watershed is 0 98 km2 it is located in hilly terrain and the soil type is red loam classified as oxisol usda soil taxonomy and clay the main types of land use are forestland farmland grassland dry land and orange orchards with forest accounting for about 63 of the watershed s total area in the past 20 years there has been no significant change in land use and land cover types 2 2 sampling and analysis eight river water sampling points were selected to cover inputs from diverse land use types covering most of the watershed sampling points a b and c were located in upstream reaches d e and f in middle reaches while g and h were located in downstream reaches a hydrological monitoring station was established at sampling point g fig 1d baseflow water samples 100 ml from the upper 30 cm water layer at each sampling point were collected on the 9th and 19th day of each month in addition auto samplers model 6712 isco inc lincoln ne usa were installed at sampling point g to collect river water samples automatically during periods of rainfall runoff indicating the runoff during rainfall process triggered by 5 mm rainfall events the instrument collected 200 ml samples of surface runoff every 30 min until 24 samples were collected following each trigger rainwater was collected for further analysis by rain gauges installed in upstream middle and downstream locations during every rainfall event the water samples were collected quarterly for determination of the isotopic composition of samples associated with each rainfall event the samples were filtered using a syringe filter the filter cartridge with 0 45 μm pores and 100 ml portions were placed in a polyethylene bottle then 0 3 ml of hgcl2 solution 20 g l 1 was added to prevent microbial respiration the bottles were carefully sealed to prevent subsequent contamination of samples by air before analysis the samples were stored in a low temperature environment of 4 c carbon fluxes were measured by the eddy covariance technique at 39 m three times the canopy height on a tower installed at qianyanzhou ecological station in late 2002 using a three dimensional sonic anemometer model csat3 campbell scientific inc logan ut usa and an open path co2 h2o analyzer model li 7500 licor inc lincoln ne usa flux variables were sampled at 10 hz by a cr5000 datalogger campbell scientific inc and 30 min mean fluxes were calculated wen et al 2010 yilong et al 2013 the dissolved total carbon dtc dissolved organic carbon doc and dissolved inorganic carbon dic contents were obtained by total organic carbon analyzer directly or indirectly hao et al 2017a in addition 13c to 12c ratios were determined using a stable isotope mass spectrometer following atekwana and krishnamurthy 1998 the evolved co2 was extracted in the laboratory where yields were measured and isotope ratios were determined huang et al 2017 isotope ratios are reported as δ13c values derived from 1 δ 13 c r sample r v pdb r v pdb 1000 where rsample and rv pdb are respectively 13c 12c ratios of the sample and vienna pee dee belemnite the latter obtained using the gbw04499 4500 standard 2 3 calculation methods 2 3 1 wet deposition flux and

malfunction of sensors due to obstruction by hoarfrost birds or dew and data collected on rainy or extremely cloudy days were removed three dimensional rotation of the coordinate system was applied to the wind components to remove interference from apparatus irregularity or tilt of the airflow sun et al 2006 in addition some breaks in data collection occurred due to system maintenance and power outages fu et al 2006 lastly to avoid possible underestimation of the fluxes under stable conditions during the night effects of friction velocity u in each year were examined statistically following wen et al 2010 all computations were done using matlab software 2 3 4 contributions of each water source isosource a multi source mixing model freely available at http www epa gov wed pages models htm was used to calculate the contribution of each considered water source to the recorded carbon pools phillips 2003 phillips et al 2005 the model incrementally increases contributions of each potential source to identify feasible combinations for observed isotopic compositions in river water within specified tolerances the number of feasible solutions identified depends on isotopic values of the sources number of water sources isotopic composition of mixed river water and uncertainty level the model generates distributions of proportions of feasible sources with summary statistics such as means maxima and minima in the modeling reported here the source increment was set at 1 and mass balance tolerance at 0 1 3 results 3 1 precipitation and c wet deposition patterns in 2014 2015 and 2016 total precipitation amounted to nearly 1330 1870 and 1280 mm respectively fig 2 a rainfall was clearly higher in spring and summer than in autumn and winter and there was a distinct rainy season with most rain falling from march to august 84 60 and 66 of the annual totals in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively maximum monthly rainfalls in the three years were 400 mm in june 330 mm in may and 220

mm respectively and rainstorms 50 mm fig 2b and c as shown in fig 2c light rain events were most frequent 73 65 events with 50 mm rain were rare and the highest single rainfall event in which 105 mm of rain fell was on june 11 of 2015 from june to august carbon concentrations in rainwater increased dtc and doc concentrations rising to 16 54 and 12 62 mg l 1 respectively fig 3 a as shown in fig 3b concentrations of the monitored forms of c in rainwater fluctuated in autumn from sept to nov 2015 but mean concentrations of dtc and doc were higher 12 00 and 7 98 mg l 1 respectively than in other seasons in winter from dec 2015 to feb 2016 the concentration of each carbon form in rainwater decreased and varied more ranges of dtc doc and dic during this period were 1 85 14 79 0 39 13 54 and 0 49 5 54 mg l 1 respectively and the average concentrations were 8 14 6 73 and 1 41 mg l 1 respectively fig 3c concentrations of all monitored carbon forms in rainwater then declined in spring from mar to may 2016 and average concentrations of dtc doc and dic were lowest 3 89 3 35 and 0 54 mg l 1 respectively fig 3d as shown in fig 4 there were also clear monthly variations in carbon deposition flux and deposition between august 2015 and june 2016 the maximum and minimum carbon deposition fluxes in xiangxi river watershed were in november 2015 2860 kg km 2 and june 2016 234 kg km 2 respectively carbon deposition in these months significantly differed 2800 and 230 kg respectively in xiangxi river watershed the average monthly level of carbon deposition was 1070 kg and the mean load of carbon wet deposition was about 12880 kg year 1 the mean monthly carbon deposition fluxes in the rainy and dry seasons were 840 kg km 2 range 230 1950 kg km 2 and 1310 kg km 2 range 420 2860 kg km 2 respectively 3 2 c export in the watershed from august 2015 to june 2016 the concentration of each carbon form in baseflow conditions declined fig 5 a c during this period average concentrations of dtc dic and doc in the downstream reach were 17 98 mg l 1 range 6 20 33 11 mg l 1 9 07 mg l 1 range 3 10 21 60 mg l 1 and 8 91 mg l 1 range 3 10 14 42 mg l 1 respectively average concentrations at the upstream and middle stations were lower average doc concentrations at the upstream middle and downstream stations were maximal in july 2016 5 81 6 64 and 8 45 mg l 1 respectively average concentrations of dtc and dic in the river water sharply rose in july and were maximal at the middle stations 68 96 and 62 32 mg l 1 respectively in addition the dic concentration was generally higher than the doc concentration and average concentrations of both dic and doc were highest in the downstream reach 7 67 and 2 93 mg l 1 respectively in the rainy season average dtc concentrations in the upstream middle and downstream reaches were 7 64 mg l 1 range 3 44 19 09 mg l 1 9 36 mg l 1 range 3 15 23 10 mg l 1 and 11 18 mg l 1 range 5 66 28 93 mg l 1 respectively in the dry season average concentrations of dtc in these reaches were 14 63 mg l 1 range 6 49 23 89 mg l 1 16 55 mg l 1 range 7 04 29 15 mg l 1 and 17 90 mg l 1 range 6 63 33 11 mg l 1 respectively 3 3 relationship between c export dynamics and rainfall intensity as shown in fig 2b rainfall events rarely exceeded 50 mm during the study period six typical rainfall events occurred in september 2015 march 2016 two light rains on october 8 2015 6 mm and january 13 2016 4 mm two moderate rains on november 1 2015 10 mm and march 19 2016 11 mm and two heavy rains on september 22 2015 40 mm and june 12 2016 25 mm changes of dtc dic and doc concentrations in the river water were similar during light and moderate rainfall events after removing outliers but they were less similar during heavy rain events during light and moderate rain events concentrations of all recorded forms of carbon first decreased then lightly fluctuated and finally increased slightly as shown in fig 6 a there were major differences in concentrations of the three forms of carbon in the river water during light rainfall events concentrations of dtc during two of these events on october 8 2015 and january 13 2016 were 24 95 and 10 89 mg l 1 respectively concentrations of all forms of carbon in baseflow conditions strongly fluctuated during two moderate rainfall events on november 1st 2015 and march 19th 2016 with dtc concentrations rising to 62 47 and 22 87 mg l 1 respectively fig 6b during heavy rainfall events there were significant differences in average concentrations and trends of dtc dic and doc average concentrations of dtc during two of these events were 27 22 and 19 54 mg l 1 respectively while the average dic concentrations were 7 99 and 4 73 mg l 1 respectively fig 6c as shown in fig 7 concentrations of dtc dic and doc in the river water were higher during all rainfall events in 2015 than in those of 2016 and there were significant interannual differences changes in dtc and dic concentrations were similar fig 7a b in the heavy rainfall event on september 22 2015 both dtc and dic rapidly decreased after the first fluctuation and the concentration ranges were 20 17 33 65 and 8 80 26 59 mg l 1 respectively the average concentrations were 27 22 and 19 54 mg l 1 respectively and higher than average dtc and dic concentrations recorded during other rainfall events as shown in fig 7c there were no clear patterns of changes in doc concentration during rainfall events but they were lower during heavy rain than during light and moderate rain for example the average doc concentration during the heavy rainfall event of september 22 2015 was 7 67 mg l 1 while average concentrations during the light and moderate rainfall events of october 8 2015 and november 1 2015 were 12 61 and 13 25 mg l 1 respectively 3 4 characteristics of nee in the watershed nee strongly fluctuated diurnally during 2016 fig 8 a initially decreasing and subsequently increasing during the year most calculated daily nee values were negative reflecting the predominance of carbon sinks in the xiangxi river watershed and were lowest 6 47 g c m 2 on july 12 when the vegetation was rapidly growing and carbon absorption rates were presumably close to maximal monthly nee was lowest in july 89 28 g c m 2 fig 8b during 2016 re showed a unimodal pattern with maximum and minimum monthly values in august and january of 242 97 and 74 17 g c m 2 respectively gee peaked in july at 329 97 g c m 2 the total calculated annual nee of the forest ecosystem in the watershed was 5 11 105 kg c km 2 3 5 seasonal changes in c isotope composition in spring the δ13cdic values initially increased and then decreased the highest value was 12 2 at the downstream station g lowest 14 0 at the upstream station a and values essentially successively risen at stations between a and g possibly due to effects of settlements in downstream parts of the watershed in winter δ13cdic strongly fluctuated especially in the upstream reach possible reflecting effects of land use types δ13cdic values were generally higher in winter than in spring and they were maximal and minimal at stations a 9 7 and e 12 respectively fig 9 during the dry season in 2016 δ13cdic ranged between 12 00 and 9 70 with an average of 10 96 mean values for upstream middle and downstream reaches of the watershed were 10 63 221211 63 and 10 45 respectively in the spring of 2017 during the wet season δ13cdic ranged between 12 20 and about 14 00 with an average of 12 90 average values for the upstream middle and downstream reaches were 13 30 12 87 and 12 35 respectively overall δ13cdic values of the river water in the watershed tended to be higher in the dry season than during the wet season and higher in downstream reaches than in upstream and middle reaches 4 discussion 4 1 carbon cycle characteristics assessment the subtropical forest ecosystem in china is recognized as a carbon sink with very high carbon sequestration potential like european and north american temperate forests yu et al 2014 fig 10 shows the basic diagram of the carbon cycle in xiangxi watershed results presented here show that the nee in the focal watershed gradually increased from january to july in 2016 peaking at 8 90 104 kg c km 2 in july significantly higher than the monthly nee values in autumn and winter fig 8 many factors may contribute to such seasonal variations in forest ecosystems carbon budgets inter alia climate change atmospheric variables notably co2 concentration and nitrogen deposition rates the intensity and frequency of forest disturbance and forest age structure richardson and hollinger 2005 major contributors to the seasonal variation of nee in 2016 recorded in this study were presumably the non synchronous increases in precipitation and warmth associated with the monsoonal climate drought stress was unlikely to occur during the period of strong vegetative growth and increasing temperatures march august instead there was likely to be sufficient precipitation for strong transpiration and water consumption thereby enabling increases in nee ju et al 2010 nitrogen deposition and increases in co2 concentration within certain limits both reportedly enhance carbon sequestration lue and tian 2007 lebauer and treseder 2008 xia and wan 2008 as shown in table 1 the calculated nee for the whole of 2016 was 5 11 105 kg c km 2 liu et al 2004 found that nee at 23 and 39 m two and three times the canopy height respectively was 6 45 105 and 5 53 105 kg c km 2 respectively thus the nee we recorded at the qianyanzhou station is similar to the nee the cited authors recorded at the same height and values obtained at tianmu mountain and anji in zhejiang province table 1 in summary the mixed forest of qianyanzhou is in a regional community succession process and is a strong carbon sink nee is influenced by many interacting factors including growth season length temperature photosynthetically active radiation par and humidity shen 2006 ren et al 2012 found that amounts of rainfall in qianyanzhou strongly influence respiration and especially photosynthesis rates indirectly indicating that nee is affected by carbon deposition liu et al 2004 proposed that the carbon uptake capacity of the plantation ecosystem in qianyanzhou is significantly affected by drought stress which will directly reduce the carbon sequestration capacity of a forest ecosystem the distribution of precipitation recorded in this study with a rainy season from march to august fig 2 is largely consistent with the recorded changes in nee corroborating the potential importance of drought stress the input volume of carbon wet deposition in the xiangxi river watershed amounted to 1 32 104 kg km 2 year 1 fig 4 and the output volume of rainfall runoff amounted to 7443 kg km 2 year 1 accounting for 56 57 of the carbon wet deposition the total carbon input volume was about 5 17 105 kg km 2 year 1 ignoring possible anthropogenic inputs thus the forest ecosystem plays a key role in the watershed s carbon sequestration indicating that its nee is a major determinant of the dynamic balance of the watershed s carbon cycle subtropical forest ecosystems strongly influence the global carbon budget balance yu et al 2014 and rates of photosynthesis and respiration are determinants of the carbon sequestration capacities of subtropical forest ecosystems in china min et al 2012 wagle and kakani 2014 rainfall has clear seasonal and interannual variations due to the monsoonal climate of tropical and subtropical regions of china although annual rainfall is abundant seasonal drought often occurs and significantly affects forest carbon sequestration combinations of high temperature and drought affect photosynthesis rates more than either factor alone synergistically reducing the leaves stomatal conductance water potential and activities of photosynthetic enzymes yu and wang 2010 the cited authors found that on sunny days reductions in photosynthesis capacity are mainly due to soil water deficits before noon and combinations of high temperature and soil moisture deficits after noon under cloudy or rainy conditions the temperature is no longer the main factor limiting photosynthesis and radiation and deep soil moisture are reportedly the main factors restricting photosynthesis temperature and soil moisture are also major determinants of ecosystems respiratory rates richardson and hollinger 2005 luo and zhou 2006 temperature is the main factor controlling the release of carbon in chinese subtropical forest ecosystems but water deficits limit respiratory rates through their effects on microbial activities growth of plant roots and nutrient migration yu et al 2013 subtropical forest ecosystems are mostly distributed in southern parts of china with red soils that have poor permeability and aeration when soil water is abundant which is not conducive to the aerobic respiration of soil organisms however if the soil water content is too low the soil is hard and again not conducive to microbial activities thus regardless of the temperature the soil permeability and aeration must be within an appropriate range for high rates of ecosystem respiration 4 2 contributions of c pathways to river water dic is mainly derived from soil water carbonate dissolution and direct inputs of atmospheric precipitation the mean soil water δ13cdic in the karst region of the united states is reportedly 21 to 22 mcclanahan et al 2016 while the average value in soil water in china is 24 according to zhao et al 2015 and kegan et al 2016 thus in this study 24 was set as the δ13cdic value in soil water and the δ13cdic value of carbonate mineral sources was set to 0 for the quantification of fractional contributions of sources using the isosource mixing model as shown in fig 11 there were clear seasonal differences in contributions of the three main sources to the carbon in the xiangxi river water in contrast the contributions of soil water and atmospheric precipitation at each monitoring point were significantly higher in spring than in winter the contribution of carbonate mineral dissolution was generally higher in winter than in spring ranges of contributions of carbonate mineral dissolution in spring and winter at each monitoring point were 20 90 26 20 and 27 90 41 70 while average contributions were 23 94 and 33 94 respectively the contribution of soil water to river water carbon was slightly lower than that of carbonate mineral dissolution 28 10 and 22 88 on average in spring and winter respectively in spring and winter the contribution of atmospheric precipitation to the carbon in the river water was significantly higher than that of other carbon sources however the contributions of atmospheric precipitation in spring and winter differed 48 56 and 43 23 respectively due to seasonal differences in rainfall volumes in summary the carbon in the watershed s river water mainly came from atmospheric precipitation and the contributions of soil water and carbonate mineral dissolution varied seasonally 5 conclusion presented results show that the forested ecosystem in the watershed is clearly a carbon sink and plays a major role in the watershed s dynamic carbon cycle its carbon sequestration capacity was strongest in march to august a period largely coinciding with the rainy season than in other months atmospheric deposition precipitation appears to be the main source of carbon in the river water especially during the rainy season the results also show that monitoring water quality parameters can provide valuable feedback for local environmental governance to summarize forests comprise an important carbon pool in the terrestrial ecosystem and subtropical forests make major ecological contributions as carbon sinks which are crucial for mitigating increases in atmospheric co2

6396,forests are important components of the terrestrial ecosystem that play major roles in carbon cycling and associated environmental changes but more knowledge of the processes involved is required therefore carbon wet deposition and rainfall runoff processes were examined as well as carbon fluxes and sources in water in the xiangxi river watershed a typical subtropical forested watershed in china wet deposition of carbon amounted to 1 31 104 kg km 2 between june 2015 and may 2016 inclusive the concentration of measured forms of carbon in rainwater of single rainfall event peaked in summer when the concentration of dissolved total carbon dtc was 16 5 mg l 1 in 2016 rainfall runoff amounted to 7440 kg km 2 accounting for about 57 of the carbon wet deposition in the watershed the forest ecosystem in the watershed was found to be a carbon sink every month of the year with net ecosystem co2 exchange nee in 2016 of 5 11 105 kg c km 2 and monthly nee was lowest in july 8 93 104 kg c km 2 the 13c 12c ratio in dissolved inorganic carbon in the river water relative to pee dee belemnite δ13cdic was higher in the dry season range 12 00 to 9 70 mean 11 0 than in the rainy season range 14 00 to 12 20 mean 12 90 and higher in downstream reaches mean values in winter and spring 10 45 and 12 35 respectively than in upstream and middle reaches 10 63 and 13 30 11 63 and 12 87 in addition atmospheric precipitation made the highest contributions to the c concentration in the river water in spring and winter 48 6 and 43 2 respectively keywords subtropical watershed wet deposition of carbon rainfall runoff carbon flux isotope analysis 1 introduction forest ecosystems play major roles in global carbon cycling and balances moreover forests collectively comprise the largest carbon sink in terrestrial ecosystems fixing co2 photosynthetically in primary production and storing about two thirds of the total carbon sequestered in the entire terrestrial ecosystem watson et al 2000 canadell et al 2007 beer et al 2010 pan et al 2011 varying amounts of the carbon is subsequently released as co2 to the atmosphere on various time scales through complex respiratory processes thereby closing the atmosphere vegetation soil atmosphere carbon cycle valentini et al 2000 yan 2016 rates of carbon emission and absorption known as net ecosystem co2 exchange nee rates respectively indicating the strength of ecosystems or their components as carbon sources and sinks are key variables baldocchi 2008 other important variables of c fluxes in an ecosystem are the gross ecosystem exchange gee and ecosystem respiration re rates flanagan and johnson 2005 detailed knowledge of the processes involved is crucial for predicting changes in the global or local carbon cycle and associated ecological and climatic changes complex biogeochemical processes and human activities interactively release carbon of various forms from diverse sources in watersheds into river systems in southern china the main form of carbon in the rivers is dissolved inorganic carbon dic and its stable isotope composition reflects the local watershed s geochemical characteristics qian 2017 thus analysis of the stable isotopes in the dic in watersheds especially the 13c to 12c ratio relative to a standard δ13c is valuable for tracing the sources geochemical behavior and circulation of carbon barth et al 2003 lee et al 2007 huang et al 2017 xiangxi river is located near qianyanzhou ecological station chinese academy of sciences it belongs to the typical subtropical monsoon climateand has a wide range of plantations the biogeochemical characteristics of carbon cycle in subtropical regions have gradually become a research hotspot due to its high vegetation coverage and obvious carbon sink effect of forest ecosystems and in the context of the increasing area of plantation ecosystems china s plantation forest area ranks first in the world and plantation ecosystem has become an important part of china s forest ecosystem liu et al 2005 so exploring the biogeochemical cycling process and characteristics of carbon in these areas at the forest watershed scale is conducive to formulating targeted measures and forming favorable guidance for the carbon cycling process such analysis is generally more straightforward in small watersheds because they facilitate representative sampling and generally have more homogeneous geological and geomorphic environments than large watersheds further study of the carbon budget of plantation ecosystems in subtropical regions is of great significance for evaluating the carbon sequestration rate and potential of forest ecosystems in china δ13cdic patterns in the lower reaches of the xiangxi river recorded by sun et al 2015 indicate that the dic concentration in the river is affected not only by weathering of the rock but also by photosynthesis in the river however despite this and numerous other relevant studies the mechanisms involved in the transport and export of c between river water and soil are complex as numerous factors influence geological and pedological environmental compartments anderson and robert 2010 it is highly important to increase knowledge of the sources and dynamic processes affecting carbon in these compartments inter alia via stable isotopic analyses of key carbon pools in watersheds thus aims of the study reported here were to examine carbon distributions and fluxes in a typical forested watershed in the subtropical region of china where plantations account for more than 65 of total terrestrial carbon sequestration in china specific objectives were to characterize c concentrations and distributions during baseflow and rainfall runoff conditions summarize characteristics of the c fluxes quantitatively evaluate the carbon budget of the ecosystem and identify sources of carbon in the baseflow by stable isotopic analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study focused on the xiangxi river watershed in the jitai basin taihe county jiangxi province 115 04 13 e 26 44 48 n china fig 1 a where the qianyanzhou ecological station of the chinese academy of sciences has been gathering data since 1983 water from the xiangxi river flows into the second branch of the ganjiang river fig 1b c the average altitude is 110 8 m and the watershed has a typical subtropical monsoon climate with an annual relative humidity of 84 gao et al 2017 the mean annual precipitation and mean annual temperature are 1540 mm and 16 5 respectively annual rainfall is strongly seasonally distributed more than 80 falls from march to september but severe dry period frequently occur in july and august mainly due to high temperature and lack of rainfall the total area of the watershed is 0 98 km2 it is located in hilly terrain and the soil type is red loam classified as oxisol usda soil taxonomy and clay the main types of land use are forestland farmland grassland dry land and orange orchards with forest accounting for about 63 of the watershed s total area in the past 20 years there has been no significant change in land use and land cover types 2 2 sampling and analysis eight river water sampling points were selected to cover inputs from diverse land use types covering most of the watershed sampling points a b and c were located in upstream reaches d e and f in middle reaches while g and h were located in downstream reaches a hydrological monitoring station was established at sampling point g fig 1d baseflow water samples 100 ml from the upper 30 cm water layer at each sampling point were collected on the 9th and 19th day of each month in addition auto samplers model 6712 isco inc lincoln ne usa were installed at sampling point g to collect river water samples automatically during periods of rainfall runoff indicating the runoff during rainfall process triggered by 5 mm rainfall events the instrument collected 200 ml samples of surface runoff every 30 min until 24 samples were collected following each trigger rainwater was collected for further analysis by rain gauges installed in upstream middle and downstream locations during every rainfall event the water samples were collected quarterly for determination of the isotopic composition of samples associated with each rainfall event the samples were filtered using a syringe filter the filter cartridge with 0 45 μm pores and 100 ml portions were placed in a polyethylene bottle then 0 3 ml of hgcl2 solution 20 g l 1 was added to prevent microbial respiration the bottles were carefully sealed to prevent subsequent contamination of samples by air before analysis the samples were stored in a low temperature environment of 4 c carbon fluxes were measured by the eddy covariance technique at 39 m three times the canopy height on a tower installed at qianyanzhou ecological station in late 2002 using a three dimensional sonic anemometer model csat3 campbell scientific inc logan ut usa and an open path co2 h2o analyzer model li 7500 licor inc lincoln ne usa flux variables were sampled at 10 hz by a cr5000 datalogger campbell scientific inc and 30 min mean fluxes were calculated wen et al 2010 yilong et al 2013 the dissolved total carbon dtc dissolved organic carbon doc and dissolved inorganic carbon dic contents were obtained by total organic carbon analyzer directly or indirectly hao et al 2017a in addition 13c to 12c ratios were determined using a stable isotope mass spectrometer following atekwana and krishnamurthy 1998 the evolved co2 was extracted in the laboratory where yields were measured and isotope ratios were determined huang et al 2017 isotope ratios are reported as δ13c values derived from 1 δ 13 c r sample r v pdb r v pdb 1000 where rsample and rv pdb are respectively 13c 12c ratios of the sample and vienna pee dee belemnite the latter obtained using the gbw04499 4500 standard 2 3 calculation methods 2 3 1 wet deposition flux and

malfunction of sensors due to obstruction by hoarfrost birds or dew and data collected on rainy or extremely cloudy days were removed three dimensional rotation of the coordinate system was applied to the wind components to remove interference from apparatus irregularity or tilt of the airflow sun et al 2006 in addition some breaks in data collection occurred due to system maintenance and power outages fu et al 2006 lastly to avoid possible underestimation of the fluxes under stable conditions during the night effects of friction velocity u in each year were examined statistically following wen et al 2010 all computations were done using matlab software 2 3 4 contributions of each water source isosource a multi source mixing model freely available at http www epa gov wed pages models htm was used to calculate the contribution of each considered water source to the recorded carbon pools phillips 2003 phillips et al 2005 the model incrementally increases contributions of each potential source to identify feasible combinations for observed isotopic compositions in river water within specified tolerances the number of feasible solutions identified depends on isotopic values of the sources number of water sources isotopic composition of mixed river water and uncertainty level the model generates distributions of proportions of feasible sources with summary statistics such as means maxima and minima in the modeling reported here the source increment was set at 1 and mass balance tolerance at 0 1 3 results 3 1 precipitation and c wet deposition patterns in 2014 2015 and 2016 total precipitation amounted to nearly 1330 1870 and 1280 mm respectively fig 2 a rainfall was clearly higher in spring and summer than in autumn and winter and there was a distinct rainy season with most rain falling from march to august 84 60 and 66 of the annual totals in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively maximum monthly rainfalls in the three years were 400 mm in june 330 mm in may and 220

concentrations of the monitored forms of c in rainwater fluctuated in autumn from sept to nov 2015 but mean concentrations of dtc and doc were higher 12 00 and 7 98 mg l 1 respectively than in other seasons in winter from dec 2015 to feb 2016 the concentration of each carbon form in rainwater decreased and varied more ranges of dtc doc and dic during this period were 1 85 14 79 0 39 13 54 and 0 49 5 54 mg l 1 respectively and the average concentrations were 8 14 6 73 and 1 41 mg l 1 respectively fig 3c concentrations of all monitored carbon forms in rainwater then declined in spring from mar to may 2016 and average concentrations of dtc doc and dic were lowest 3 89 3 35 and 0 54 mg l 1 respectively fig 3d as shown in fig 4 there were also clear monthly variations in carbon deposition flux and deposition between august 2015 and june 2016 the maximum and minimum carbon deposition fluxes in xiangxi river watershed were in november 2015 2860 kg km 2 and june 2016 234 kg km 2 respectively carbon deposition in these months significantly differed 2800 and 230 kg respectively in xiangxi river watershed the average monthly level of carbon deposition was 1070 kg and the mean load of carbon wet deposition was about 12880 kg year 1 the mean monthly carbon deposition fluxes in the rainy and dry seasons were 840 kg km 2 range 230 1950 kg km 2 and 1310 kg km 2 range 420 2860 kg km 2 respectively 3 2 c export in the watershed from august 2015 to june 2016 the concentration of each carbon form in baseflow conditions declined fig 5 a c during this period average concentrations of dtc dic and doc in the downstream reach were 17 98 mg l 1 range 6 20 33 11 mg l 1 9 07 mg l 1 range 3 10 21 60 mg l 1 and 8 91 mg l 1 range 3 10 14 42 mg l 1 respectively average concentrations at the upstream and middle stations were lower average doc concentrations at the upstream middle and downstream stations were maximal in july 2016 5 81 6 64 and 8 45 mg l 1 respectively average concentrations of dtc and dic in the river water sharply rose in july and were maximal at the middle stations 68 96 and 62 32 mg l 1 respectively in addition the dic concentration was generally higher than the doc concentration and average concentrations of both dic and doc were highest in the downstream reach 7 67 and 2 93 mg l 1 respectively in the rainy season average dtc concentrations in the upstream middle and downstream reaches were 7 64 mg l 1 range 3 44 19 09 mg l 1 9 36 mg l 1 range 3 15 23 10 mg l 1 and 11 18 mg l 1 range 5 66 28 93 mg l 1 respectively in the dry season average

export dynamics and rainfall intensity as shown in fig 2b rainfall events rarely exceeded 50 mm during the study period six typical rainfall events occurred in september 2015 march 2016 two light rains on october 8 2015 6 mm and january 13 2016 4 mm two moderate rains on november 1 2015 10 mm and march 19 2016 11 mm and two heavy rains on september 22 2015 40 mm and june 12 2016 25 mm changes of dtc dic and doc concentrations in the river water were similar during light and moderate rainfall events after removing outliers but they were less similar during heavy rain events during light and moderate rain events concentrations of all recorded forms of carbon first decreased then lightly fluctuated and finally increased slightly as shown in fig 6 a there were major differences in concentrations of the three forms of carbon in the river water during light rainfall events concentrations of dtc during two of these events on october 8 2015 and january 13 2016 were 24 95 and 10 89 mg l 1 respectively concentrations of all forms of carbon in baseflow conditions strongly fluctuated during two moderate rainfall events on november 1st 2015 and march 19th 2016 with dtc concentrations rising to 62 47 and 22 87 mg l 1 respectively fig 6b during heavy rainfall events there were significant differences in average concentrations and trends of dtc dic and doc average concentrations of dtc during two of these events were 27 22 and 19 54 mg l 1 respectively while the average dic concentrations were 7 99 and 4 73 mg l 1 respectively fig 6c as shown in fig 7 concentrations of dtc dic and doc in the river water were higher during all rainfall events in 2015 than in those of 2016 and there were significant interannual differences changes in dtc and dic concentrations were similar fig 7a b in the heavy rainfall event on september 22 2015 both dtc and dic rapidly decreased after the first fluctuation and the concentration ranges were 20 17 33 65 and 8 80 26 59 mg l 1 respectively the average concentrations were 27 22 and 19 54 mg l 1 respectively and higher than average dtc and dic concentrations recorded during other rainfall events as shown in fig 7c there were no clear patterns of changes in doc concentration during rainfall events but they were lower during heavy rain than during light and moderate rain for example the average doc concentration during the heavy rainfall event of september 22 2015 was 7 67 mg l 1 while average concentrations during the light and moderate rainfall events of october 8 2015 and november 1 2015 were 12 61 and 13 25 mg l 1 respectively 3 4 characteristics of nee in the watershed nee strongly fluctuated diurnally during 2016 fig 8 a initially decreasing and subsequently increasing during the year most calculated daily nee values were negative reflecting the predominance of carbon sinks in the xiangxi river watershed and were lowest 6 47 g c m 2 on july 12 when the vegetation was rapidly growing and carbon absorption rates were presumably close to maximal monthly nee was lowest in july 89 28 g c m 2 fig 8b during 2016 re showed a unimodal pattern with maximum and minimum monthly values in august and january of 242 97 and 74 17 g c m 2 respectively gee peaked in july at 329 97 g c m 2 the total calculated annual nee of the forest ecosystem in the watershed was 5 11 105 kg c km 2 3 5 seasonal changes in c isotope composition in spring the δ13cdic values initially increased and then decreased the highest value was 12 2 at the downstream station g lowest 14 0 at the upstream station a and values essentially successively risen at stations between a and g possibly due to effects of settlements in downstream parts of the watershed in winter δ13cdic strongly fluctuated especially in the upstream reach possible reflecting effects of land use types δ13cdic values were generally higher in winter than in spring and they were maximal and minimal at stations a 9 7 and e 12 respectively fig 9 during the dry season in 2016 δ13cdic ranged between 12 00 and 9 70 with an average of 10 96 mean values for upstream middle and downstream reaches of the watershed were 10 63 221211 63 and 10 45 respectively in the spring of 2017 during the wet season δ13cdic ranged between 12 20 and about 14 00 with an average of 12 90 average values for the upstream middle and downstream reaches were 13 30 12 87 and 12 35 respectively overall δ13cdic values of the river water in the watershed tended to be higher in the dry season than during the wet season and higher in downstream reaches than in upstream and middle reaches 4 discussion 4 1 carbon cycle characteristics assessment the subtropical forest ecosystem in china is recognized as a carbon sink with very high carbon sequestration potential like european and north american temperate forests yu et al 2014 fig 10 shows the basic diagram of the carbon cycle in xiangxi watershed results presented here show that the nee in the focal watershed gradually increased from january to july in 2016 peaking at 8 90 104 kg c km 2 in july significantly higher than the monthly nee values in autumn and winter fig 8 many factors may contribute to such seasonal variations in forest ecosystems carbon budgets inter alia climate change atmospheric variables notably co2 concentration and nitrogen deposition rates the intensity and frequency of forest disturbance and forest age structure richardson and hollinger 2005 major contributors to the seasonal variation of nee in 2016 recorded in this study were presumably the non synchronous increases in precipitation and warmth associated with the monsoonal climate drought stress was unlikely to occur during the period of strong vegetative growth and increasing temperatures march august instead there was likely to be sufficient precipitation for strong transpiration and water consumption thereby enabling increases in nee ju et al 2010 nitrogen deposition and increases in co2 concentration within certain limits both reportedly enhance carbon sequestration lue and tian 2007 lebauer and treseder 2008 xia and wan 2008 as shown in table 1 the calculated nee for the whole of 2016 was 5 11 105 kg c km 2 liu et al 2004 found that nee at 23 and 39 m two and three times the canopy height respectively was 6 45 105 and 5 53 105 kg c km 2 respectively thus the nee we recorded at the qianyanzhou station is similar to the nee the cited authors recorded at the same height and values obtained at tianmu mountain and anji in zhejiang province table 1 in summary the mixed forest of qianyanzhou is in a regional community succession process and is a strong carbon sink nee is influenced by many interacting factors including growth season length temperature photosynthetically active radiation par and humidity shen 2006 ren et al 2012 found that amounts of rainfall in qianyanzhou strongly influence respiration and especially photosynthesis rates indirectly indicating that nee is affected by carbon deposition liu et al 2004 proposed that the carbon uptake capacity of the plantation ecosystem in qianyanzhou is significantly affected by drought stress which will directly reduce the carbon sequestration capacity of a forest ecosystem the distribution of precipitation recorded in this study with a rainy season from march to august fig 2 is largely consistent with the recorded changes in nee corroborating the potential importance of drought stress the input volume of carbon wet deposition in the xiangxi river watershed amounted to 1 32 104 kg km 2 year 1 fig 4 and the output volume of rainfall runoff amounted to 7443 kg km 2 year 1 accounting for 56 57 of the carbon wet deposition the total carbon input volume was about 5 17 105 kg km 2 year 1 ignoring possible anthropogenic inputs thus the forest ecosystem plays a key role in the watershed s carbon sequestration indicating that its nee is a major determinant of the dynamic balance of the watershed s carbon cycle subtropical forest ecosystems strongly influence the global carbon budget balance yu et al 2014 and rates of photosynthesis and respiration are determinants of the carbon sequestration capacities of subtropical forest ecosystems in china min et al 2012 wagle and kakani 2014 rainfall has clear seasonal and interannual variations due to the monsoonal climate of tropical and subtropical regions of china although annual rainfall is abundant seasonal drought often occurs and significantly affects forest carbon sequestration combinations of high temperature and drought affect photosynthesis rates more than either factor alone synergistically reducing the leaves stomatal conductance water potential and activities of photosynthetic enzymes yu and wang 2010 the cited authors found that on sunny days reductions in photosynthesis capacity are mainly due to soil water deficits before noon and combinations of high temperature and soil moisture deficits after noon under cloudy or rainy conditions the temperature is no longer the main factor limiting photosynthesis and radiation and deep soil moisture are reportedly the main factors restricting photosynthesis temperature and soil moisture are also major determinants of ecosystems respiratory rates richardson and hollinger 2005 luo and zhou 2006 temperature is the main factor controlling the release of carbon in chinese subtropical forest ecosystems but water deficits limit respiratory rates through their effects on microbial activities growth of plant roots and nutrient migration yu et al 2013 subtropical forest ecosystems are mostly distributed in southern parts of china with red soils that have poor permeability and aeration when soil water is abundant which is not conducive to the aerobic respiration of soil organisms however if the soil water content is too low the soil is hard and again not conducive to microbial activities thus regardless of the temperature the soil permeability and aeration must be within an appropriate range for high rates of ecosystem respiration 4 2 contributions of c pathways to river water dic is mainly derived from soil water carbonate dissolution and direct inputs of atmospheric precipitation the mean soil water δ13cdic in the karst region of the united states is reportedly 21 to 22 mcclanahan et al 2016 while the average value in soil water in china is 24 according to zhao et al 2015 and kegan et al 2016 thus in this study 24 was set as the δ13cdic value in soil water and the δ13cdic value of carbonate mineral sources was set to 0 for the quantification of fractional contributions of sources using the isosource mixing model as shown in fig 11 there were clear seasonal differences in contributions of the three main sources to the carbon in the xiangxi river water in contrast the contributions of soil water and atmospheric precipitation at each monitoring point were significantly higher in spring than in winter the contribution of carbonate mineral dissolution was generally higher in winter than in spring ranges of contributions of carbonate mineral dissolution in spring and winter at each monitoring point were 20 90 26 20 and 27 90 41 70 while average contributions were 23 94 and 33 94 respectively the contribution of soil water to river water carbon was slightly lower than that of carbonate mineral dissolution 28 10 and 22 88 on average in spring and winter respectively in spring and winter the contribution of atmospheric precipitation to the carbon in the river water was significantly higher than that of other carbon sources however the contributions of atmospheric precipitation in spring and winter differed 48 56 and 43 23 respectively due to seasonal differences in rainfall volumes in summary the carbon in the watershed s river water mainly came from atmospheric precipitation and the contributions of soil water and carbonate mineral dissolution varied seasonally 5 conclusion presented results show that the forested ecosystem in the watershed is clearly a carbon sink and plays a major role in the watershed s dynamic carbon cycle its carbon sequestration capacity was strongest in march to august a period largely coinciding with the rainy season than in other months atmospheric deposition precipitation appears to be the main source of carbon in the river water especially during the rainy season the results also show that monitoring water quality parameters can provide valuable feedback for local environmental governance to summarize forests comprise an important carbon pool in the terrestrial ecosystem and subtropical forests make major ecological contributions as carbon sinks which are crucial for mitigating increases in atmospheric co2 concentrations and greenhouse effects therefore it is crucial to preserve their carbon sequestration capacities by formulating and implementing appropriate afforestation and management regimes

6397,as the only unnatural phenomenon among the four drought types socioeconomic drought exerts direct negative impacts on socioeconomic system socioeconomic drought is closely related to regional sustainable development which however is received the least attention therefore this study aims to construct a practical framework to fully assess socioeconomic drought dynamic risk based on an improved multivariate standardized reliability and resilience index imsrri and copulas function the joint return periods of different grades drought were calculated to assess the drought risk from a macro perspective while three drought risk indicators resilience vulnerability and exposure were adopted for drought risk assessment from a micro perspective in addition a 30 year sliding window was applied on the imsrri series to explore the dynamic drought risk in a changing environment furthermore the linkages between drought risk indicators and teleconnection factors arctic oscillation ao el niño southern oscillation enso and pacific decadal oscillation pdo were explored the upper yellow river basin uyrb was selected as a case study and the study period is from 1959 to 2010 results indicate that 1 the joint return periods of the moderate severe and extreme drought in the uyrb were 5 03 11 7 and 40 78 years respectively and the resilience vulnerability and exposure values of socioeconomic drought were 0 11 14 38 and 0 37 respectively 2 the year of 1995 was the turning point of socioeconomic drought risk before 1995 socioeconomic drought risk was decreasing after 1995 socioeconomic drought risk was increasing which corresponds well to that of the imsrri series and 3 socioeconomic drought risk is significantly associated with teleconnection factors with the descending correlation order of pdo enso ao this study sheds new insights into socioeconomic drought dynamic risk assessment in a changing environment keywords socioeconomic drought risk copulas joint

four types meteorological agricultural hydrological or socioeconomic droughts wilhite and glantz 1985 american meteorological society 1997 world meteorological organization 2006 being different from meteorological hydrologic and agricultural drought socioeconomic drought is an only non physical phenomenon among these four types of drought tu et al 2018 which refers to that available water cannot

multivariate standardized reliability and resilience index msrri framework to quantify the socioeconomic drought which provided complementary information on socioeconomic drought development and recovery based on reservoir storage and demand huang et al 2016a applied the framework of msrri to evaluate the socioeconomic drought in the heihe basin in china and explored the influence of teleconnection factors on socioeconomic drought shi et al 2017 took the water shortage and drought duration as boundary conditions constructed the socioeconomic drought index sedi to characterized the socioeconomic drought events indicated that extreme socioeconomic drought may occur in future and the reasonable reservoir operation can ease the intensity of socioeconomic drought tu et al 2018 defined socioeconomic drought events through runoff condition and water supply and found that the reservoir regulation has significant influence on the decrease of socioeconomic drought properties guo et al 2019 combined the msrri framework and reservoir operation rules to improve the original msrri framework imsrri which could accurately quantify the socioeconomic drought under the effect of reservoir operation and the imsrri was used to characterize socioeconomic drought in this study in general current researches on socioeconomic drought mainly focus on how to define and characterize socioeconomic drought and related studies on socioeconomic drought risk have not yet been carried out socioeconomic drought is caused by the influence of meteorological agricultural and hydrological drought on the socioeconomic system heim 2002 and these three types of droughts are closely related to the water cycle in the context of global warming many remarkable changes have been observed in global climate including intensified water cycle and more frequent and severe extreme droughts kunkel 2003 beniston and stephenson 2004 dai 2011a b keshavarz et al 2014 leng et al 2015 huang et al 2017 fang et al 2019a liu et al 2019 which could result in higher drought risk in addition drought events have multiattribute features therefore many researches applied the copula functions to establish multivariate joint distribution of drought with multiple features which are based on the univariate distributions and the dependence structure among random variables sklar 1959 xu et al 2015 salvadori and de michele 2015 hao and singh 2015 then the joint return periods of drought events are calculated to characterize the drought risk nelsen 2006 salvadori and michele 2010 salvadori et al 2013 for example shiau 2006 adopted copula function to calculate the joint return period of specific drought duration and severity which was used to characterize drought risk liu et al 2015 identified drought events based on the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and through calculating joint return period to assess the drought risk with drought duration severity and peak in china chang et al 2016 applied joint return period with drought duration and severity to characterize drought risk in the weihe basin china which based on an integrated drought index yang et al 2018 established the joint probability distributions of drought duration and severity and applied joint return period to characterize drought risk in the arid region of northwest china based on the global palmer drought severity index pdsi gridded data however on the one hand joint return period characterized by the probability of drought events only provides a macro perspective on drought risk assessment and neglects the importance of drought risk characteristics in drought risk analysis such as resilience vulnerability and exposure these three risk indicators are three important indicators to reflect drought risk and its evolution process cook et al 2004 maity et al 2012 sadeghi and hazbavi 2017 liu et al 2013 which could provide a micro perspective in assessing socioeconomic drought risk on the other hand drought risk analysis in these previous studies was limited to a static way in which only one indicator could be gained to characterize the drought risk conditions of the whole series ignoring the dynamic variation of drought risk over time under the condition of climate change which is referred to as a dynamic way in addition it should be noted that as an unnatural phenomenon once the socioeconomic drought occurs it will directly affect the stability of human production and living therefore exploring the risk of socioeconomic drought and its evolution characteristics is very important to water resources management in general for socioeconomic drought risk there are three issues unresolved 1 comprehensive socioeconomic drought risk assessment does not conduct 2 drought risk indicators remain unconsidered in drought risk assessment 3 the dynamic evolution of socioeconomic drought risk remains unrevealed therefore this study aims to establish a framework which could comprehensively assess socioeconomic drought risk thus refilling current research gaps on socioeconomic drought risks in the proposed framework joint return periods and three risk indicators resilience vulnerability and exposure are used to assess socioeconomic drought risk in macro and micro perspectives respectively in addition except for static way a 30 year sliding window is utilized in the proposed framework to explore the dynamic evolution of socioeconomic drought risk in a dynamic way each window is treated as a subseries and joint return periods and three drought risk indicators of each subseries are calculated based on this the dynamic evolution of socioeconomic drought risk could be explored in general the framework proposed achieves a combination of macro and micro perspectives and dynamic and static ways to assess socioeconomic drought risks droughts are becoming more frequent under the context of global climate change hanson and weltzin 2000 hirabayashi et al 2008 mishra and singh 2010 trinh et al 2017 ahn et al 2016 and drought conditions are associated with large scale climate signals asong et al 2018 meng et al 2019 han et al 2019 for example huang et al 2016b found the arctic oscillation ao and the el niño southern oscillation enso had significant influence on hydrological drought in the columbia river basin asong et al 2018 found droughts in a typically cold region to be associated with large scale climate signals ao enso and pacific decadal oscillation pdo however these studies mainly focus on the connections between teleconnection factors and meteorological and hydrological droughts the uptake of insights from the large scale climate signals and socioeconomic drought especially the socioeconomic drought risk indicators remains limited huang et al 2016a guo et al 2019 exploring the connections between the socioeconomic drought risk indicators and these teleconnection factors is helpful for precisely understanding the influences of large scale climate signals on socioeconomic drought conditions and predicting the future socioeconomic drought dynamics therefore this present study investigates the connections between the socioeconomic drought risk indicators resilience vulnerability and exposure and teleconnection factors ao enso and pdo the upper yellow river basin uyrb located in the arid and semi arid area in northwest china in recent years the contradiction between water supply and demand of this area is becoming more and more serious chen et al 2016 longyang gorge lyx reservoir is a multi year reservoir which play an important role in water resources allocation in the uyrb bai et al 2015 thus the uyrb and lyx reservoir are selected as the research object in this present study the major purposes of this study are 1 to construct a practical framework to achieve a combination of macro and micro perspectives and dynamic and static ways to assess socioeconomic drought risks 2 to explore the linkages between the drought risk indicators and teleconnection factors 2 study area and data as the fifth largest river in the world the yellow river is located in northern china which is known as the mother river of china huang et al 2014b fang et al 2019b the uyrb is located in the interior of the eurasian continent and belongs to arid and semi arid regions the drainage area of the uyrb is 386000 km2 accounting for 51 3 of the total area of the yellow river basin and it yields 54 of the total runoff of the yellow river however the spatial and temporal distribution of water resources is uneven in this area and the contradiction between water supply and water demand is prominent bai et al 2015 longyang gorge lyx reservoir is located in qinghai province gonghe county which is the first large water control project in the uyrb and has 24 7 billion m3 of total storage and 19 4 billion m3 of regulating storage fig 1 as the first multi year reservoir on the yellow river lyx reservoir plays a leading role in the cascade scheduling system and water resources management of the uyrb and undertakes irrigation hydroelectric power generation ice prevention and ecological tasks meanwhile lyx reservoir has the ability to resist natural droughts to ensure the water demand of the downstream fang et al 2017 in this study the monthly inflow data of lyx reservoir and interval inflow between lyx reservoir and lanzhou section during may 1959 to april 2010 were collected from the northwest china grid company limited before the socioeconomic drought analysis homogeneity randomness and stationary of the runoff sequence were tested via chi square goodness of fit test run test and unit root test phillips perron test significant level α 0 05 respectively and the return values h are 1 0 and 0 respectively these results indicated the runoff sequence passed the randomness and stationary test and highlighted the inhomogeneity in the runoff sequence which meant the runoff sequence conforms to the characteristics of the hydrological sequence the monthly outflow of the lyx reservoir was calculated through simulation scheduling model the demand of the downstream of lyx reservoir was calculated by the runoff demand process of lanzhou section interval inflow between lyx reservoir and lanzhou section and water demand of each water consumption section between lyx reservoir and lanzhou city and these date were supplied by yellow river conservancy commission additionally to accurately delineate the uyrb aster dem dataset with 30 m spatial resolution was used fig 1 additionally the monthly ao nino 3 4 pdo time series spanning may 1959 to april 2010 was collected from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration earth system research laboratory http www esrl noaa gov 3 methodology 3 1 improved multivariate standardized reliability and resilience index for characterizing socioeconomic drought in order to quantitatively describe the socioeconomic drought mehran et al 2015 proposed the multivariate standardized reliability and resilience index which integrated top down and bottom up methodology however in our previous study we found the frame of msrri was overly sensitive to inflow and the msrri could not accurately depict the reservoir operation process and the capacity to resist the future drought especially in flood season guo et al 2019 thus we structured a new improved frame to assess the socioeconomic drought which combined the msrri and reservoir operation rules and more elaborate time scales were applied in the improved frame the imsrri could capture the onset termination persistence peak and retreat period of socioeconomic drought more accurately and reasonably than msrri as the same as the msrri imsrri is also based on top down and bottom up methodology and the two corresponding indicators are outflow demand reliability odr indicator and reservoir system resilience rsr indicator respectively the odr can describe the relationship between water supply and demand of the downstream thus the odr is tightly related to the industrial water agricultural irrigation and river channel ecological as the most important human water storage project reservoirs have the ability to resist the drought van loon and van lanen 2013 mehran et al 2015 meanwhile the reservoir operation and water storage of reservoir have obvious influences on hydroelectric power and shipping thus the rsr is applied for estimating the operation of reservoir system the odr and rsr are shown as follows 1 α t i t m 1 t q ou t t q es t t q es t t q es t t i t 6 t 7 m q dem i i f m 3 i t m 1 t q dem i i f m 6 2 β t s t t v i n t v ou t t v min v es t t v es t t where α t and β t are the unstandardized odr and rsr indicator respectively q ou t t denotes the monthly outflow from the reservoir i is the sample size which ranges from month 1 to n q es t t represents the total estimated water demand in projected timeframe time step t ranges from month 12 to n t 12 n m stands for the selected timeframe in months 3 months for within year reservoir systems and 6 for multi year reservoir systems s t t is the reservoir storage at month t v ou t t denotes the monthly outflow volume from the reservoir v i n t represents the monthly inflow volume from the reservoir v min stands for reservoir storage corresponding to the limited outflow process line and v es t t is the total estimated demand volume in the projected timeframe q de m t represents the monthly water demand of the reservoir s downstream and the demand is calculated as follows 3 q de m t q la n t i 1 n q r d ĩ t q r c t δ q l where q la n t denotes the demand of lanzhou section q r d ĩ t represents the demand of the i region q r c t stands for the interval watershed concentration δ q is the unit of river course loss and l denotes the length of the river between the lyx reservoir and the lanzhou section in the framework of imsrri the odr and rsr indicators characterize the reliability and resilience of reservoir system mehran et al 2015 guo et al 2019 and there is a tradeoff between the reliability and resilience hashimoto et al 1982 moy et al 1986 vogel and bolognese 1995 mcmahon et al 2006 especially during the drought period however for the socioeconomic drought the reliability and resilience indicators have influences on diffident water use departments respectively therefore the copula function is applied in the imsrri framework to construct the joint probability distribution of the odr and rsr indicators to accurately capture the socioeconomic drought guo et al 2019 α t and β t can be combined by copula function kao and govindaraju 2010 rajsekhar et al 2015 assuming the outflow demand reliability index and reservoir system resilience index as random variables x and y respectively the distribution with the cumulative joint probability p can be expressed with a copula as 4 p x x y y c f x g y p where c denotes the copula and f x and g y are the marginal cumulative distribution functions of random variables x and y in the calculation of the imsrri the frank copula was selected to structure the joint distribution of the odr and rsr guo et al 2019 the frank copula is expressed as 5 c u v 1 θ ln 1 e θ u 1 e θ v 1 e θ u 1 where u and v are the marginal cumulative probabilities of the odr and rsr respectively and θ is the parameter which can be estimated from kendall s rank correlation τ 6 τ 1 4 d θ 1 θ where d θ is expressed as 7 d θ 1 θ 0 θ t exp t 1 d t where t represents the integration variable from the cumulative joint probability p shown in eq 4 the improve multivariate standardized reliability and resilience index imsrri can be defined as 8 imsrri ϕ 1 p where ϕ represents the standard normal distribution function because imsrri assesses the supply and storage relative to the demand it can be regarded as a measure of socioeconomic drought the imsrri of the uyrb is shown as fig 2 3 2 socioeconomic drought event as similar as other standardized drought indices a positive imsrri value indicate that the reservoir system can satisfy the water demand while an imsrri negative value means the water supply cannot meet the demand or the normal operation of the reservoir system was destroyed guo et al 2019 in multivariate drought analyses 0 8 is often chosen as a threshold to characterize drought events yuan et al 2016 wu et al 2018 guo et al 2019 which means the cumulative probability of joint distribution of the two series is 0 2 hao and aghakouchak 2013 thus 0 8 is selected as threshold to capture the socioeconomic drought event in this study in this study socioeconomic drought events were captured based on the threshold and run theory yevjevich 1967 duration severity and intensity are three important features of drought events any two of them are enough to characterize a single drought event sadeghipour and dracup 1985 huang et al 2015 and there are many researches selected the drought duration and severity to define a single drought event chang et al 2016 yang et al 2018 montaseri et al 2018 however for socioeconomic drought compared with drought severity drought intensity could directly represent the average deficit of operation of the reservoir system during the drought period guo et al 2019 therefore drought duration and intensity were used to characterize the socioeconomic drought event in this study 3 3 copulas the copula can construct the joint probability distribution of the multivariate through integrating their corresponding marginal distributions its equation is expressed as follows 9 c u v φ 1 φ u φ v where φ denote the convex function and u and v represent the two variables generally there are three main types of copulas elliptical copula archimedean copula and the quadratic copula the elliptical copula could construct a non normal extreme relationship which could better describe extreme events the archimedean copula is easily constructed and has a strong representation both of the elliptical and archimedean copulas have been widely applied in hydrological frequency analysis genest et al 2007 song and singh 2010 chen et al 2015 reddy and ganguli 2012 therefore three archimedean copulas and two elliptical copulas were chosen to model the joint probability of the marginal distributions of drought duration and intensity in this study table 1 and the maximum likelihood estimate method is used to estimate the copula parameters joe 1997 in addition quantitative square euclidean distance sed and graphical goodness probability probability plot of fit tests were applied to evaluate the performance of different copulas and sed is calculated as follows 10 d e t 2 i 1 n c e u i v i c t u i v i 2 where d e t 2 is square euclidean distance between empirical copula and theoretical copula n denotes the sample size c e u i v i represents the cumulative probability of sample values calculated via empirical copula c t u i v i stands for the cumulative probability of sample values obtained via fitting theoretical copula and c e u v is calculated as 11 c e u v 1 n i 1 n i f e x i u i f e y i v u v 0 1 assuming that x i y i is the sample from two dimensional population x y where i is indicative function when f e x i u i f e x i u 1 or else i f e x i u 0 f e x and f e y are the empirical distribution function of x and y 3 4 joint return period and the sliding window joint return period is the reciprocal of the joint probability of two variables which can be used to represent the risk of drought events salvadori and michele 2004 proposed two cases joint return period or joint return period and and joint return period assuming that two random variables are x and y respectively and the thresholds of x and y are set to x and y respectively joint return period is the time interval with which at least one variable x or y is higher than the threshold t x x y y and joint return period refers to time interval of co occurrence of x and y exceeding their own thresholds t x x y y selecting the best fit distributions of drought duration d and intensity i among gamma distribution exponential distribution exp generalized pareto gp distribution and generalized extreme value distribution gev as the marginal distributions michele et al 2013 then the copula function is applied in coupling marginal distributions of drought duration and intensity and calculating their joint distribution then joint return periods are computed as follows 12 t d d i i e δ t 1 c f d d f i i 13 t d d i i e δ t 1 f d d f i i c f d d f i i where t d d i i and t d d i i are and joint return period respectively c represents the copula function c f d d f i i stands for the joint distributions of drought duration and intensity which is combined by copula function f d d and f i i are the marginal distribution of drought duration and intensity respectively e δ t denotes the expectation of drought events interval time and is the sum of the average of drought duration and non drought duration here drought interval is actually drought inter arrival time in order to explore the evolution of socioeconomic drought risk as shown as fig 3 we use a 30 year sliding window on the monthly imsrri series during may 1959 to may 2010 and the sliding step is one year 12 months for example the first window also the first subseries is from may 1959 to april 1989 the second window which is also the second subseries is from may 1960 to april 1990 and so on then there are 22 sub series obtained and each subseries is regarded as an individual series finally joint return periods of socioeconomic drought events with different grades for each subseries are calculated the obtained sequences of joint return period could be used to analyze the dynamic evolution of drought risk the flow chart of this process is shown in fig 4 3 5 drought resilience vulnerability and exposure resilience vulnerability and exposure are three important indicators to reflect drought risk and characterize drought evolution process hashimoto et al 1982 cook et al 2004 maity et al 2012 sadeghi and hazbavi 2017 liu et al 2013 as is known the concepts of resilience vulnerability and exposure have been widely used in the water resources systems loucks and van beek 2017 brown and williams 2015 ayyub 2014 and these three indicators are influenced by the spatial variation in hydro climate variables and water resources availability cook et al 2004 veettil et al 2018 in this study we utilized these concepts to explore the variation characteristics of socioeconomic drought risk in the uyrb the ability of a region recover from water shortage to water availability state is defined as drought resilience re hoque et al 2016 loucks and van beek 2017 according to the research of veettil et al 2018 the re can be expressed as the inverse of average drought duration 14 re m i 1 m d d i where m is the number of drought events in a time period and d d i denotes the duration of the i th drought event longer is the average drought duration lesser will be resilient of a region to droughts and lower is the re indices veettil et al 2018 for the socioeconomic drought drought vulnerability vu can be defined as the average depletion of reservoir and socioeconomic systems due to drought therefore based on the socioeconomic drought events which captured by the imsrri the drought vulnerability is estimated as sadeghi and hazbavi 2017 veettil et al 2018 15 vu imsrri 0 8 imsrri m a higher vu value means that the region is more vulnerable to droughts drought exposure ex refers to the relative amount of time the region is exposed to droughts liu et al 2013 ex can be calculated as the ratio between the total drought duration and the total time period veettil et al 2018 16 ex i 1 m d d i td where td is the total number of months in the timeframe as obvious from the formulation higher value of ex indicates that higher degree of drought exposure 4 results 4 1 socioeconomic drought events and their features in order to explore the evolution of socioeconomic drought in the uyrb the imsrri which contains the information of odr and rsr indices was applied to the lyx reservoir run theory was utilized to capture socioeconomic drought events and the statistical results of drought events during 1959 to 2010 in the uyrb were shown in fig 5 in general drought events were classified into four levels slight moderate severe and extreme shi et al 2017 for the socioeconomic drought the probability range of the duration and intensity of slight moderate severe and extreme drought was 0 0 5 0 5 0 75 0 75 0 90 and 0 90 1 respectively guo et al 2019 in order to accurately find out the critical value of different levels of drought events gamma distribution exponential distribution exp generalized pareto gp distribution and generalized extreme value distribution gev were applying to fit the drought duration and intensity and test the goodness of fit via the k s test and root mean square error rmse all distributions passed the 95 significance level test and the results were shown in fig 6 the empirical and theoretical distributions were plotted in fig 7 it can be seen from fig 6 that the best fit distribution of drought duration and intensity were gamma and gev distribution respectively and fig 7 further proved the reliability of the selection of marginal distribution in addition the critical values of different levels of socioeconomic drought events corresponding to the cumulative probability could be gained from the fig 7 and the results were shown in table 2 4 2 selection of the optimal copula function based on the optimal distribution of drought duration and intensity in section 4 1 gamma and gev distribution was chosen to fit the marginal distribution of duration and intensity respectively the fig 5 showed a significant positive correlation between drought duration and intensity and the kendall and spearman rank correlation coefficient between drought duration and intensity are 0 77 and 0 91 respectively therefore the joint probability distribution of drought duration and intensity could be structured using copula function the copula parameters θ was estimated through the maximum likelihood estimate method both quantitative and graphical are very important to the selection of copula functions montaseri et al 2018 therefore in this study quantitative square euclidean distance sed and graphical p p diagram goodness of fit tests were utilized to select the best fit copula the results were shown in fig 8 it was obvious from fig 8 that t copula is the best fit copula and the sed value of t copula is the minimum these results indicated that t copula has the optimal fitting effect on drought duration and intensity therefore t copula was chosen in this study to construct the drought risk model the joint distribution and contours of drought duration and intensity are plotted in figs 9 and 10 4 3 joint return periods of different grades socioeconomic drought and their dynamic evolution based on the best fit copula function of drought duration and intensity joint return period in two cases and were calculated to explore the risk in the uyrb and the results were plotted in fig 11 and the joint return periods of different grades socioeconomic drought were shown in table 3 obviously the drought risk in case was higher than that in case with the duration and intensity increased both the and joint return period increased and the and joint return period of moderate drought were 3 69 and 5 03 years respectively the and joint return period of severe drought were 7 23 and 11 7 years respectively and the and joint return period of extreme drought were 18 94 and 40 78 years respectively to clearly reflect the variation of drought risk under the climate variation a 30 year sliding window was used on the imsrri series during may 1959 to april 2010 to gained 22 subseries then joint return periods of these subseries were calculated according to the process in fig 4 and the results were shown in fig 12 as fig 12 showed joint return periods of each grade socioeconomic drought had a significant downward trend which meant that the probability of occurrence of moderate severe and extreme drought events were increasing in other words the risk of socioeconomic drought in the uyrb was increasing especially for the extreme drought both and joint return period decreased sharply which indicated that the risk of extreme drought in the uyrb had increased significantly in the past few decades in addition it could be gained from fig 10 that all the first eight subseries of each grade socioeconomic drought and each case showed a rising trend or the variation is relatively stable while it went down from the eighth subseries i e when the sliding window went to 1995 joint return period started to fall until the end of the subseries moreover the year of 1995 was the change point of the imsrri series in the uyrb which was detected by guo et al 2019 using the heuristic segmentation method pedro et al 2001 therefore under the influence of climate variation not only the socioeconomic drought index had changed but also the risk of extreme socioeconomic drought event was increasing meanwhile the change point of the imsrri 1995 was also a turning point where socioeconomic drought risk start to increase 4 4 drought risk indicators and their dynamic evolution in order to evaluate the socioeconomic drought more comprehensively resilience vulnerability and exposure indicators were calculated according to the eqs 14 15 and 16 the results were shown in table 4 meanwhile the risk indicators calculation was carried out for the subseries obtained from each sliding window and the dynamic variations of these three indicators were plotted in fig 13 it was evident from fig 13 that the re showed a reducing trend which meant the drought resilience of the uyrb was weakening both vu and ex had significant rising trend which indicated that socioeconomic system of the uyrb was increasingly vulnerable to drought and the exposure of socioeconomic drought in the uyrb was getting higher and higher respectively compared with the subseries re value of the whole series was low and was lower than the previous 73 percent subseries value vu and ex value of the whole series were high and were higher than the previous 91 and 68 percent subseries value respectively therefore the risk indicators of the whole series were very sensitive to the changes in drought conditions veettil et al 2018 in general during 1959 to 2010 the drought condition in the early stage was much better than that in the later stage in the uyrb through analyzing the evolution process of drought risk indicators we found that all the three risk indicators had a good trend before the eighth subseries but the re values started reducing from the eighth subseries and the vu and ex values also started rising from the eighth subseries as similar as the results in section 4 3 the turning points of drought risk indicators were also the eighth value when the sliding window went to the 1995 these results indicated that the variation of imsrri series also caused significant changes in socioeconomic drought conditions and resulted in the higher drought risk 5 discussion 5 1 the relationship between the joint return period and drought risk indicators in general both the joint return period and drought risk indicators indicated that the risk of socioeconomic drought was increasing in the uyrb joint return period was assessed the drought risk from a macro perspective and the drought risk indicators were evaluated the drought risk from a micro perspective which included the resilience vulnerability and exposure moreover the re value decreased and the resilience of drought decreased which could lead to the increase in the duration of single drought events and the increase of the ex value meant the reservoir system was exposed to drought condition for longer periods of time which also indicated that the drought duration was increasing meanwhile the increase of the vu value denoted the reservoir system was becoming more and more vulnerable to drought and for the drought events drought intensity was also increasing in general the reduced resilience and the increased exposure proved the increase of drought duration and the higher the vulnerability value was the more intense the drought intensity was therefore the joint return period and drought risk indicators could mutual verify and analyze in the comprehensive assessment of drought risk 5 2 the linkages between the drought risk indicators and teleconnection factors in order to be consistent with drought risk indicators the 30 year sliding window was also applied on the ao enso pdo series and the results were shown in fig 14 it can be gained from fig 14 that the ao and enso showed a gradually rising trend and the pdo showed a trend of falling first and then rising then the pearson correlation coefficient between climate factors and drought risk indicators were calculated and the results were shown in table 5 results indicated that drought risk indicators and teleconnection factors had significant correlations among the climate factors pdo had the strongest connection with the drought risk indicators whereas ao showed the weakest connection furthermore all the climate factors showed negative correlations with re and positive correlations with vu and ex therefore the evolution of socioeconomic drought risk was closely related to the changes in teleconnection factors these findings are helpful for improving our understanding on the evolution of socioeconomic drought risk and drought conditions in a changing environment 6 conclusions in order to explore the variation of socioeconomic drought risk under a changing environment the imsrri was used to characterize socioeconomic drought in the uyrb in this study socioeconomic drought events were captured by the run theory and threshold method and drought duration and intensity were chosen to characterize a single drought event then two cases joint return periods were calculated to assess socioeconomic drought risk from a macro perspective and resilience vulnerability and exposure indicators were utilized to characterize socioeconomic drought risk from a micro perspectives moreover a 30 year sliding window was used on the imsrri series to explore the dynamic evolution of socioeconomic drought risk in the uyrb the primary conclusions are as follows 1 the and joint return period of the moderate severe and extreme socioeconomic drought events were 3 69a and 5 03a 7 23a and 11 7a and 18 94a and 40 78a respectively in the uyrb 2 under a changing environment socioeconomic drought risk of the uyrb was increasing and the resilience vulnerability and exposure of socioeconomic drought also showed that socioeconomic drought risk has a rising trend in a changing environment the resilience was reducing and the vulnerability and exposure were increasing 3 when the sliding window went to the change point of the imsrri series 1995 i e from the eighth subseries both the two cases joint return period and three drought risk indicators turned to the direction with the higher drought risk therefore the change point of the imsrri series was also the turning point of socioeconomic drought risk 4 the decrease of the re and the increase of the ex denoted the drought duration was increasing and the increase of the vu indicated the drought intensity was enhancing thus in the framework of the drought risk assessment the results of the two cases joint return period and the resilience vulnerability and exposure could mutual verify 5 the evolution of socioeconomic drought risk is closely related to teleconnection factors especially for the pdo in detail teleconnection factors showed negative correlations with re and positive correlations with vu and ex these findings are helpful for improving our understanding on the evolution of socioeconomic drought risk and drought conditions in a changing environment in general in the perspective of a 30 year sliding window and based on the joint return period and drought risk indicators it was found that socioeconomic drought risk of the uyrb was increasing and fully revealed the evolution of drought resilience vulnerability and exposure during the past few decades this present study sheds new insights into socioeconomic drought dynamic risk assessment in a changing environment relevant findings are helpful for the local water resources management and provide a more micro perspective for drought risk assessment declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments this research was jointly funded by the national

6397,as the only unnatural phenomenon among the four drought types socioeconomic drought exerts direct negative impacts on socioeconomic system socioeconomic drought is closely related to regional sustainable development which however is received the least attention therefore this study aims to construct a practical framework to fully assess socioeconomic drought dynamic risk based on an improved multivariate standardized reliability and resilience index imsrri and copulas function the joint return periods of different grades drought were calculated to assess the drought risk from a macro perspective while three drought risk indicators resilience vulnerability and exposure were adopted for drought risk assessment from a micro perspective in addition a 30 year sliding window was applied on the imsrri series to explore the dynamic drought risk in a changing environment furthermore the linkages between drought risk indicators and teleconnection factors arctic oscillation ao el niño southern oscillation enso and pacific decadal oscillation pdo were explored the upper yellow river basin uyrb was selected as a case study and the study period is from 1959 to 2010 results indicate that 1 the joint return periods of the moderate severe and extreme drought in the uyrb were 5 03 11 7 and 40 78 years respectively and the resilience vulnerability and exposure values of socioeconomic drought were 0 11 14 38 and 0 37 respectively 2 the year of 1995 was the turning point of socioeconomic drought risk before 1995 socioeconomic drought risk was decreasing after 1995 socioeconomic drought risk was increasing which corresponds well to that of the imsrri series and 3 socioeconomic drought risk is significantly associated with teleconnection factors with the descending correlation order of pdo enso ao this study sheds new insights into socioeconomic drought dynamic risk assessment in a changing environment keywords socioeconomic drought risk copulas joint return period drought risk indicators dynamic evolution of the drought risk 1 introduction drought is recognized as a serious natural disaster which results in losses to agriculture and livestock ecological environmental imbalance and even endangerment of human life wilhite 2000 mishra and singh 2010 huang et al 2014a 2019 tu et al 2018 liu et al 2019a b in general droughts were divided into four types meteorological agricultural hydrological or socioeconomic droughts wilhite and glantz 1985 american meteorological society 1997 world meteorological organization 2006 being different from meteorological hydrologic and agricultural drought socioeconomic drought is an only non physical phenomenon among these four types of drought tu et al 2018 which refers to that available water cannot satisfy the demand and directly results in negative effects on industrial irrigation hydroelectric power and environment vandenberghe et al 2011 zseleczky and yosef 2014 huang et al 2016a ren et al 2019 reservoirs as the man made water control project play an important role in water resources management and provide resilience for human water use mehran et al 2015 reservoirs have the ability to change the spatial and temporal distribution of water resources at the end of the last century 70 of global freshwater usage amount came from the reservoirs shiklomanov et al 2000 vörösmarty and sahagian 2000 therefore the operation of the reservoir systems is closely related to socioeconomic drought however socioeconomic drought is difficult to quantify mehran et al 2015 and previous studies focusing on the assessment of socioeconomic drought are rare mehran et al 2015 integrated the local reservoir resilience and the relationship between water supply and demand and proposed the multivariate standardized reliability and resilience index msrri framework to quantify the socioeconomic drought which provided complementary information on socioeconomic drought development and recovery based on reservoir storage and demand huang et al 2016a applied the framework of msrri to evaluate the socioeconomic drought in the heihe basin in china and explored the influence of teleconnection factors on socioeconomic drought shi et al 2017 took the water shortage and drought duration as boundary conditions constructed the socioeconomic drought index sedi to characterized the socioeconomic drought events indicated that extreme socioeconomic drought may occur in future and the reasonable reservoir operation can ease the intensity of socioeconomic drought tu et al 2018 defined socioeconomic drought events through runoff condition and water supply and found that the reservoir regulation has significant influence on the decrease of socioeconomic drought properties guo et al 2019 combined the msrri framework and reservoir operation rules to improve the original msrri framework imsrri which could accurately quantify the socioeconomic drought under the effect of reservoir operation and the imsrri was used to characterize socioeconomic drought in this study in general current researches on socioeconomic drought mainly focus on how to define and characterize socioeconomic drought and related studies on socioeconomic drought risk have not yet been carried out socioeconomic drought is caused by the influence of meteorological agricultural and hydrological drought on the socioeconomic system heim 2002 and these three types of droughts are closely related to the water cycle in the context of global warming many remarkable changes have been observed in global climate including intensified water cycle and more frequent and severe extreme droughts kunkel 2003 beniston and stephenson 2004 dai 2011a b keshavarz et al 2014 leng et al 2015 huang et al 2017 fang et al 2019a liu et al 2019 which could result in higher drought risk in addition drought events have multiattribute features therefore many researches applied the copula functions to establish multivariate joint distribution of drought with multiple features which are based on the univariate distributions and the dependence structure among random variables sklar 1959 xu et al 2015 salvadori and de michele 2015 hao and singh 2015 then the joint return periods of drought events are calculated to characterize the drought risk nelsen 2006 salvadori and michele 2010 salvadori et al 2013 for example shiau 2006 adopted copula function to calculate the joint return period of specific drought duration and severity which was used to characterize drought risk liu et al 2015 identified drought events based on the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and through calculating joint return period to assess the drought risk with drought duration severity and peak in china chang et al 2016 applied joint return period with drought duration and severity to characterize drought risk in the weihe basin china which based on an integrated drought index yang et al 2018 established the joint probability distributions of drought duration and severity and applied joint return period to characterize drought risk in the arid region of northwest china based on the global palmer drought severity index pdsi gridded data however on the one hand joint return period characterized by the probability of drought events only provides a macro perspective on drought risk assessment and neglects the importance of drought risk characteristics in drought risk analysis such as resilience vulnerability and exposure these three risk indicators are three important indicators to reflect drought risk and its evolution process cook et al 2004 maity et al 2012 sadeghi and hazbavi 2017 liu et al 2013 which could provide a micro perspective in assessing socioeconomic drought risk on the other hand drought risk analysis in these previous studies was limited to a static way in which only one indicator could be gained to characterize the drought risk conditions of the whole series ignoring the dynamic variation of drought risk over time under the condition of climate change which is referred to as a dynamic way in addition it should be noted that as an unnatural phenomenon once the socioeconomic drought occurs it will directly affect the stability of human production and living therefore exploring the risk of socioeconomic drought and its evolution characteristics is very important to water resources management in general for socioeconomic drought risk there are three issues unresolved 1 comprehensive socioeconomic drought risk assessment does not conduct 2 drought risk indicators remain unconsidered in drought risk assessment 3 the dynamic evolution of socioeconomic drought risk remains unrevealed therefore this study aims to establish a framework which could comprehensively assess socioeconomic drought risk thus refilling current research gaps on socioeconomic drought risks in the proposed framework joint return periods and three risk indicators resilience vulnerability and exposure are used to assess socioeconomic drought risk in macro and micro perspectives respectively in addition except for static way a 30 year sliding window is utilized in the proposed framework to explore the dynamic evolution of socioeconomic drought risk in a dynamic way each window is treated as a subseries and joint return periods and three drought risk indicators of each subseries are calculated based on this the dynamic evolution of socioeconomic drought risk could be explored in general the framework proposed achieves a combination of macro and micro perspectives and dynamic and static ways to assess socioeconomic drought risks droughts are becoming more frequent under the context of global climate change hanson and weltzin 2000 hirabayashi et al 2008 mishra and singh 2010 trinh et al 2017 ahn et al 2016 and drought conditions are associated with large scale climate signals asong et al 2018 meng et al 2019 han et al 2019 for example huang et al 2016b found the arctic oscillation ao and the el niño southern oscillation enso had significant influence on hydrological drought in the columbia river basin asong et al 2018 found droughts in a typically cold region to be associated with large scale climate signals ao enso and pacific decadal oscillation pdo however these studies mainly focus on the connections between teleconnection factors and meteorological and hydrological droughts the uptake of insights from the large scale climate signals and socioeconomic drought especially the socioeconomic drought risk indicators remains limited huang et al 2016a guo et al 2019 exploring the connections between the socioeconomic drought risk indicators and these teleconnection factors is helpful for precisely understanding the influences of large scale climate signals on socioeconomic drought conditions and predicting the future socioeconomic drought dynamics therefore this present study investigates the connections between the socioeconomic drought risk indicators resilience vulnerability and exposure and teleconnection factors ao enso and pdo the upper yellow river basin uyrb located in the arid and semi arid area in northwest china in recent years the contradiction between water supply and demand of this area is becoming more and more serious chen et al 2016 longyang gorge lyx reservoir is a multi year reservoir which play an important role in water resources allocation in the uyrb bai et al 2015 thus the uyrb and lyx reservoir are selected as the research object in this present study the major purposes of this study are 1 to construct a practical framework to achieve a combination of macro and micro perspectives and dynamic and static ways to assess socioeconomic drought risks 2 to explore the linkages between the drought risk indicators and teleconnection factors 2 study area and data as the fifth largest river in the world the yellow river is located in northern china which is known as the mother river of china huang et al 2014b fang et al 2019b the uyrb is located in the interior of the eurasian continent and belongs to arid and semi arid regions the drainage area of the uyrb is 386000 km2 accounting for 51 3 of the total area of the yellow river basin and it yields 54 of the total runoff of the yellow river however the spatial and temporal distribution of water resources is uneven in this area and the contradiction between water supply and water demand is prominent bai et al 2015 longyang gorge lyx reservoir is located in qinghai province gonghe county which is the first large water control project in the uyrb and has 24 7 billion m3 of total storage and 19 4 billion m3 of regulating storage fig 1 as the first multi year reservoir on the yellow river lyx reservoir plays a leading role in the cascade scheduling system and water resources management of the uyrb and undertakes irrigation hydroelectric power generation ice prevention and ecological tasks meanwhile lyx reservoir has the ability to resist natural droughts to ensure the water demand of the downstream fang et al 2017 in this study the monthly inflow data of lyx reservoir and interval inflow between lyx reservoir and lanzhou section during may 1959 to april 2010 were collected from the northwest china grid company limited before the socioeconomic drought analysis homogeneity randomness and stationary of the runoff sequence were tested via chi square goodness of fit test run test and unit root test phillips perron test significant level α 0 05 respectively and the return values h are 1 0 and 0 respectively these results indicated the runoff sequence passed the randomness and stationary test and highlighted the inhomogeneity in the runoff sequence which meant the runoff sequence conforms to the characteristics of the hydrological sequence the monthly outflow of the lyx reservoir was calculated through simulation scheduling model the demand of the downstream of lyx reservoir was calculated by the runoff demand process of lanzhou section interval inflow between lyx reservoir and lanzhou section and water demand of each water consumption section between lyx reservoir and lanzhou city and these date were supplied by yellow river conservancy commission additionally to accurately delineate the uyrb aster dem dataset with 30 m spatial resolution was used fig 1 additionally the monthly ao nino 3 4 pdo time series spanning may 1959 to april 2010 was collected from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration earth system research laboratory http www esrl noaa gov 3 methodology 3 1 improved multivariate standardized reliability and resilience index for characterizing socioeconomic drought in order to quantitatively describe the socioeconomic drought mehran et al 2015 proposed the multivariate standardized reliability and resilience index which integrated top down and bottom up methodology however in our previous study we found the frame of msrri was overly sensitive to inflow and the msrri could not accurately depict the reservoir operation process and the capacity to resist the future drought especially in flood season guo et al 2019 thus we structured a new improved frame to assess the socioeconomic drought which combined the msrri and reservoir operation rules and more elaborate time scales were applied in the improved frame the imsrri could capture the onset termination persistence peak and retreat period of socioeconomic drought more accurately and reasonably than msrri as the same as the msrri imsrri is also based on top down and bottom up methodology and the two corresponding indicators are outflow demand reliability odr indicator and reservoir system resilience rsr indicator respectively the odr can describe the relationship between water supply and demand of the downstream thus the odr is tightly related to the industrial water agricultural irrigation and river channel ecological as the most important human water storage project reservoirs have the ability to resist the drought van loon and van lanen 2013 mehran et al 2015 meanwhile the reservoir operation and water storage of reservoir have obvious influences on hydroelectric power and shipping thus the rsr is applied for estimating the operation of reservoir system the odr and rsr are shown as follows 1 α t i t m 1 t q ou t t q es t t q es t t q es t t i t 6 t 7 m q dem i i f m 3 i t m 1 t q dem i i f m 6 2 β t s t t v i n t v ou t t v min v es t t v es t t where α t and β t are the unstandardized odr and rsr indicator respectively q ou t t denotes the monthly outflow from the reservoir i is the sample size which ranges from month 1 to n q es t t represents the total estimated water demand in projected timeframe time step t ranges from month 12 to n t 12 n m stands for the selected timeframe in months 3 months for within year reservoir systems and 6 for multi year reservoir systems s t t is the reservoir storage at month t v ou t t denotes the monthly outflow volume from the reservoir v i n t represents the monthly inflow volume from the reservoir v min stands for reservoir storage corresponding to the limited outflow process line and v es t t is the total estimated demand volume in the projected timeframe q de m t represents the monthly water demand of the reservoir s downstream and the demand is calculated as follows 3 q de m t q la n t i 1 n q r d ĩ t q r c t δ q l where q la n t denotes the demand of lanzhou section q r d ĩ t represents the demand of the i region q r c t stands for the interval watershed concentration δ q is the unit of river course loss and l denotes the length of the river between the lyx reservoir and the lanzhou section in the framework of imsrri the odr and rsr indicators characterize the reliability and resilience of reservoir system mehran et al 2015 guo et al 2019 and there is a tradeoff between the reliability and resilience hashimoto et al 1982 moy et al 1986 vogel and bolognese 1995 mcmahon et al 2006 especially during the drought period however for the socioeconomic drought the reliability and resilience indicators have influences on diffident water use departments respectively therefore the copula function is applied in the imsrri framework to construct the joint probability distribution of the odr and rsr indicators to accurately capture the socioeconomic drought guo et al 2019 α t and β t can be combined by copula function kao and govindaraju 2010 rajsekhar et al 2015 assuming the outflow demand reliability index and reservoir system resilience index as random variables x and y respectively the distribution with the cumulative joint probability p can be expressed with a copula as 4 p x x y y c f x g y p where c denotes the copula and f x and g y are the marginal cumulative distribution functions of random variables x and y in the calculation of the imsrri the frank copula was selected to structure the joint distribution of the odr and rsr guo et al 2019 the frank copula is expressed as 5 c u v 1 θ ln 1 e θ u 1 e θ v 1 e θ u 1 where u and v are the marginal cumulative probabilities of the odr and rsr respectively and θ is the parameter which can be estimated from kendall s rank correlation τ 6 τ 1 4 d θ 1 θ where d θ is expressed as 7 d θ 1 θ 0 θ t exp t 1 d t where t represents the integration variable from the cumulative joint probability p shown in eq 4 the improve multivariate standardized reliability and resilience index imsrri can be defined as 8 imsrri ϕ 1 p where ϕ represents the standard normal distribution function because imsrri assesses the supply and storage relative to the demand it can be regarded as a measure of socioeconomic drought the imsrri of the uyrb is shown as fig 2 3 2 socioeconomic drought event as similar as other standardized drought indices a positive imsrri value indicate that the reservoir system can satisfy the water demand while an imsrri negative value means the water supply cannot meet the demand or the normal operation of the reservoir system was destroyed guo et al 2019 in multivariate drought analyses 0 8 is often chosen as a threshold to characterize drought events yuan et al 2016 wu et al 2018 guo et al 2019 which means the cumulative probability of joint distribution of the two series is 0 2 hao and aghakouchak 2013 thus 0 8 is selected as threshold to capture the socioeconomic drought event in this study in this study socioeconomic drought events were captured based on the threshold and run theory yevjevich 1967 duration severity and intensity are three important features of drought events any two of them are enough to characterize a single drought event sadeghipour and dracup 1985 huang et al 2015 and there are many researches selected the drought duration and severity to define a single drought event chang et al 2016 yang et al 2018 montaseri et al 2018 however for socioeconomic drought compared with drought severity drought intensity could directly represent the average deficit of operation of the reservoir system during the drought period guo et al 2019 therefore drought duration and intensity were used to characterize the socioeconomic drought event in this study 3 3 copulas the copula can construct the joint probability distribution of the multivariate through integrating their corresponding marginal distributions its equation is expressed as follows 9 c u v φ 1 φ u φ v where φ denote the convex function and u and v represent the two variables generally there are three main types of copulas elliptical copula archimedean copula and the quadratic copula the elliptical copula could construct a non normal extreme relationship which could better describe extreme events the archimedean copula is easily constructed and has a strong representation both of the elliptical and archimedean copulas have been widely applied in hydrological frequency analysis genest et al 2007 song and singh 2010 chen et al 2015 reddy and ganguli 2012 therefore three archimedean copulas and two elliptical copulas were chosen to model the joint probability of the marginal distributions of drought duration and intensity in this study table 1 and the maximum likelihood estimate method is used to estimate the copula parameters joe 1997 in addition quantitative square euclidean distance sed and graphical goodness probability probability plot of fit tests were applied to evaluate the performance of different copulas and sed is calculated as follows 10 d e t 2 i 1 n c e u i v i c t u i v i 2 where d e t 2 is square euclidean distance between empirical copula and theoretical copula n denotes the sample size c e u i v i represents the cumulative probability of sample values calculated via empirical copula c t u i v i stands for the cumulative probability of sample values obtained via fitting theoretical copula and c e u v is calculated as 11 c e u v 1 n i 1 n i f e x i u i f e y i v u v 0 1 assuming that x i y i is the sample from two dimensional population x y where i is indicative function when f e x i u i f e x i u 1 or else i f e x i u 0 f e x and f e y are the empirical distribution function of x and y 3 4 joint return period and the sliding window joint return period is the reciprocal of the joint probability of two variables which can be used to represent the risk of drought events salvadori and michele 2004 proposed two cases joint return period or joint return period and and joint return period assuming that two random variables are x and y respectively and the thresholds of x and y are set to x and y respectively joint return period is the time interval with which at least one variable x or y is higher than the threshold t x x y y and joint return period refers to time interval of co occurrence of x and y exceeding their own thresholds t x x y y selecting the best fit distributions of drought duration d and intensity i among gamma distribution exponential distribution exp generalized pareto gp distribution and generalized extreme value distribution gev as the marginal distributions michele et al 2013 then the copula function is applied in coupling marginal distributions of drought duration and intensity and calculating their joint distribution then joint return periods are computed as follows 12 t d d i i e δ t 1 c f d d f i i 13 t d d i i e δ t 1 f d d f i i c f d d f i i where t d d i i and t d d i i are and joint return period respectively c represents the copula function c f d d f i i stands for the joint distributions of drought duration and intensity which is combined by copula function f d d and f i i are the marginal distribution of drought duration and intensity respectively e δ t denotes the expectation of drought events interval time and is the sum of the average of drought duration and non drought duration here drought interval is actually drought inter arrival time in order to explore the evolution of socioeconomic drought risk as shown as fig 3 we use a 30 year sliding window on the monthly imsrri series during may 1959 to may 2010 and the sliding step is one year 12 months for example the first window also the first subseries is from may 1959 to april 1989 the second window which is also the second subseries is from may 1960 to april 1990 and so on then there are 22 sub series obtained and each subseries is regarded as an individual series finally joint return periods of socioeconomic drought events with different grades for each subseries are calculated the obtained sequences of joint return period could be used to analyze the dynamic evolution of drought risk the flow chart of this process is shown in fig 4 3 5 drought resilience vulnerability and exposure resilience vulnerability and exposure are three important indicators to reflect drought risk and characterize drought evolution process hashimoto et al 1982 cook et al 2004 maity et al 2012 sadeghi and hazbavi 2017 liu et al 2013 as is known the concepts of resilience vulnerability and exposure have been widely used in the water resources systems loucks and van beek 2017 brown and williams 2015 ayyub 2014 and these three indicators are influenced by the spatial variation in hydro climate variables and water resources availability cook et al 2004 veettil et al 2018 in this study we utilized these concepts to explore the variation characteristics of socioeconomic drought risk in the uyrb the ability of a region recover from water shortage to water availability state is defined as drought resilience re hoque et al 2016 loucks and van beek 2017 according to the research of veettil et al 2018 the re can be expressed as the inverse of average drought duration 14 re m i 1 m d d i where m is the number of drought events in a time period and d d i denotes the duration of the i th drought event longer is the average drought duration lesser will be resilient of a region to droughts and lower is the re indices veettil et al 2018 for the socioeconomic drought drought vulnerability vu can be defined as the average depletion of reservoir and socioeconomic systems due to drought therefore based on the socioeconomic drought events which captured by the imsrri the drought vulnerability is estimated as sadeghi and hazbavi 2017 veettil et al 2018 15 vu imsrri 0 8 imsrri m a higher vu value means that the region is more vulnerable to droughts drought exposure ex refers to the relative amount of time the region is exposed to droughts liu et al 2013 ex can be calculated as the ratio between the total drought duration and the total time period veettil et al 2018 16 ex i 1 m d d i td where td is the total number of months in the timeframe as obvious from the formulation higher value of ex indicates that higher degree of drought exposure 4 results 4 1 socioeconomic drought events and their features in order to explore the evolution of socioeconomic drought in the uyrb the imsrri which contains the information of odr and rsr indices was applied to the lyx reservoir run theory was utilized to capture socioeconomic drought events and the statistical results of drought events during 1959 to 2010 in the uyrb were shown in fig 5 in general drought events were classified into four levels slight moderate severe and extreme shi et al 2017 for the socioeconomic drought the probability range of the duration and intensity of slight moderate severe and extreme drought was 0 0 5 0 5 0 75 0 75 0 90 and 0 90 1 respectively guo et al 2019 in order to accurately find out the critical value of different levels of drought events gamma distribution exponential distribution exp generalized pareto gp distribution and generalized extreme value distribution gev were applying to fit the drought duration and intensity and test the goodness of fit via the k s test and root mean square error rmse all distributions passed the 95 significance level test and the results were shown in fig 6 the empirical and theoretical distributions were plotted in fig 7 it can be seen from fig 6 that the best fit distribution of drought duration and intensity were gamma and gev distribution respectively and fig 7 further proved the reliability of the selection of marginal distribution in addition the critical values of different levels of socioeconomic drought events corresponding to the cumulative probability could be gained from the fig 7 and the results were shown in table 2 4 2 selection of the optimal copula function based on the optimal distribution of drought duration and intensity in section 4 1 gamma and gev distribution was chosen to fit the marginal distribution of duration and intensity respectively the fig 5 showed a significant positive correlation between drought duration and intensity and the kendall and spearman rank correlation coefficient between drought duration and intensity are 0 77 and 0 91 respectively therefore the joint probability distribution of drought duration and intensity could be structured using copula function the copula parameters θ was estimated through the maximum likelihood estimate method both quantitative and graphical are very important to the selection of copula functions montaseri et al 2018 therefore in this study quantitative square euclidean distance sed and graphical p p diagram goodness of fit tests were utilized to select the best fit copula the results were shown in fig 8 it was obvious from fig 8 that t copula is the best fit copula and the sed value of t copula is the minimum these results indicated that t copula has the optimal fitting effect on drought duration and intensity therefore t copula was chosen in this study to construct the drought risk model the joint distribution and contours of drought duration and intensity are plotted in figs 9 and 10 4 3 joint return periods of different grades socioeconomic drought and their dynamic evolution based on the best fit copula function of drought duration and intensity joint return period in two cases and were calculated to explore the risk in the uyrb and the results were plotted in fig 11 and the joint return periods of different grades socioeconomic drought were shown in table 3 obviously the drought risk in case was higher than that in case with the duration and intensity increased both the and joint return period increased and the and joint return period of moderate drought were 3 69 and 5 03 years respectively the and joint return period of severe drought were 7 23 and 11 7 years respectively and the and joint return period of extreme drought were 18 94 and 40 78 years respectively to clearly reflect the variation of drought risk under the climate variation a 30 year sliding window was used on the imsrri series during may 1959 to april 2010 to gained 22 subseries then joint return periods of these subseries were calculated according to the process in fig 4 and the results were shown in fig 12 as fig 12 showed joint return periods of each grade socioeconomic drought had a significant downward trend which meant that the probability of occurrence of moderate severe and extreme drought events were increasing in other words the risk of socioeconomic drought in the uyrb was increasing especially for the extreme drought both and joint return period decreased sharply which indicated that the risk of extreme drought in the uyrb had increased significantly in the past few decades in addition it could be gained from fig 10 that all the first eight subseries of each grade socioeconomic drought and each case showed a rising trend or the variation is relatively stable while it went down from the eighth subseries i e when the sliding window went to 1995 joint return period started to fall until the end of the subseries moreover the year of 1995 was the change point of the imsrri series in the uyrb which was detected by guo et al 2019 using the heuristic segmentation method pedro et al 2001 therefore under the influence of climate variation not only the socioeconomic drought index had changed but also the risk of extreme socioeconomic drought event was increasing meanwhile the change point of the imsrri 1995 was also a turning point where socioeconomic drought risk start to increase 4 4 drought risk indicators and their dynamic evolution in order to evaluate the socioeconomic drought more comprehensively resilience vulnerability and exposure indicators were calculated according to the eqs 14 15 and 16 the results were shown in table 4 meanwhile the risk indicators calculation was carried out for the subseries obtained from each sliding window and the dynamic variations of these three indicators were plotted in fig 13 it was evident from fig 13 that the re showed a reducing trend which meant the drought resilience of the uyrb was weakening both vu and ex had significant rising trend which indicated that socioeconomic system of the uyrb was increasingly vulnerable to drought and the exposure of socioeconomic drought in the uyrb was getting higher and higher respectively compared with the subseries re value of the whole series was low and was lower than the previous 73 percent subseries value vu and ex value of the whole series were high and were higher than the previous 91 and 68 percent subseries value respectively therefore the risk indicators of the whole series were very sensitive to the changes in drought conditions veettil et al 2018 in general during 1959 to 2010 the drought condition in the early stage was much better than that in the later stage in the uyrb through analyzing the evolution process of drought risk indicators we found that all the three risk indicators had a good trend before the eighth subseries but the re values started reducing from the eighth subseries and the vu and ex values also started rising from the eighth subseries as similar as the results in section 4 3 the turning points of drought risk indicators were also the eighth value when the sliding window went to the 1995 these results indicated that the variation of imsrri series also caused significant changes in socioeconomic drought conditions and resulted in the higher drought risk 5 discussion 5 1 the relationship between the joint return period and drought risk indicators in general both the joint return period and drought risk indicators indicated that the risk of socioeconomic drought was increasing in the uyrb joint return period was assessed the drought risk from a macro perspective and the drought risk indicators were evaluated the drought risk from a micro perspective which included the resilience vulnerability and exposure moreover the re value decreased and the resilience of drought decreased which could lead to the increase in the duration of single drought events and the increase of the ex value meant the reservoir system was exposed to drought condition for longer periods of time which also indicated that the drought duration was increasing meanwhile the increase of the vu value denoted the reservoir system was becoming more and more vulnerable to drought and for the drought events drought intensity was also increasing in general the reduced resilience and the increased exposure proved the increase of drought duration and the higher the vulnerability value was the more intense the drought intensity was therefore the joint return period and drought risk indicators could mutual verify and analyze in the comprehensive assessment of drought risk 5 2 the linkages between the drought risk indicators and teleconnection factors in order to be consistent with drought risk indicators the 30 year sliding window was also applied on the ao enso pdo series and the results were shown in fig 14 it can be gained from fig 14 that the ao and enso showed a gradually rising trend and the pdo showed a trend of falling first and then rising then the pearson correlation coefficient between climate factors and drought risk indicators were calculated and the results were shown in table 5 results indicated that drought risk indicators and teleconnection factors had significant correlations among the climate factors pdo had the strongest connection with the drought risk indicators whereas ao showed the weakest connection furthermore all the climate factors showed negative correlations with re and positive correlations with vu and ex therefore the evolution of socioeconomic drought risk was closely related to the changes in teleconnection factors these findings are helpful for improving our understanding on the evolution of socioeconomic drought risk and drought conditions in a changing environment 6 conclusions in order to explore the variation of socioeconomic drought risk under a changing environment the imsrri was used to characterize socioeconomic drought in the uyrb in this study socioeconomic drought events were captured by the run theory and threshold method and drought duration and intensity were chosen to characterize a single drought event then two cases joint return periods were calculated to assess socioeconomic drought risk from a macro perspective and resilience vulnerability and exposure indicators were utilized to characterize socioeconomic drought risk from a micro perspectives moreover a 30 year sliding window was used on the imsrri series to explore the dynamic evolution of socioeconomic drought risk in the uyrb the primary conclusions are as follows 1 the and joint return period of the moderate severe and extreme socioeconomic drought events were 3 69a and 5 03a 7 23a and 11 7a and 18 94a and 40 78a respectively in the uyrb 2 under a changing environment socioeconomic drought risk of the uyrb was increasing and the resilience vulnerability and exposure of socioeconomic drought also showed that socioeconomic drought risk has a rising trend in a changing environment the resilience was reducing and the vulnerability and exposure were increasing 3 when the sliding window went to the change point of the imsrri series 1995 i e from the eighth subseries both the two cases joint return period and three drought risk indicators turned to the direction with the higher drought risk therefore the change point of the imsrri series was also the turning point of socioeconomic drought risk 4 the decrease of the re and the increase of the ex denoted the drought duration was increasing and the increase of the vu indicated the drought intensity was enhancing thus in the framework of the drought risk assessment the results of the two cases joint return period and the resilience vulnerability and exposure could mutual verify 5 the evolution of socioeconomic drought risk is closely related to teleconnection factors especially for the pdo in detail teleconnection factors showed negative correlations with re and positive correlations with vu and ex these findings are helpful for improving our understanding on the evolution of socioeconomic drought risk and drought conditions in a changing environment in general in the perspective of a 30 year sliding window and based on the joint return period and drought risk indicators it was found that socioeconomic drought risk of the uyrb was increasing and fully revealed the evolution of drought resilience vulnerability and exposure during the past few decades this present study sheds new insights into socioeconomic drought dynamic risk assessment in a changing environment relevant findings are helpful for the local

6398,as one of the most important agricultural bases in china the north china plain ncp has experienced serious groundwater depletion however estimates of groundwater depletion rates in ncp differ considerably from one another due to different datasets and methods used in the estimation to get a better estimate of the groundwater depletion and to reveal the recent groundwater changes in ncp we first merge gravity recovery and climate experiment grace mass concentration mascon solutions from different organizations and soil moisture from different land surface models to yield unified mascon solutions and soil moisture estimates we then estimate the groundwater changes by subtracting the unified soil moisture and surface water storages in the major reservoirs in ncp from the unified mascon solutions results show that the groundwater storage in ncp depleted at a rate of 1 7 0 1 cm yr from 2004 to mid 2016 but this depletion accelerated to 3 8 0 1 cm yr from mid 2013 to mid 2016 ground based water table data show a consistent groundwater depletion rate 3 9 0 3 cm yr from mid 2013 to mid 2016 with the grace results we also analyze the land subsidence in ncp by using 116 global positioning system gps sites and depict the accelerated land subsidence and expanded subsidence funnels since 2013 which is consistent with the groundwater depletion all these point to a strong acceleration in groundwater depletion in ncp since mid 2013 land surface model outputs suggest a precipitation decline from 2013 to 2016 which caused a decline in soil moisture content and surface water storage this drought forced people to exploit more groundwater to compensate the surface water shortage and thereby led to the accelerated groundwater depletion keywords north china plain groundwater depletion grace gps land subsidence 1 introduction as a vital source of fresh water groundwater has supplied 50 of drinking water 40 of industrial consumption and 20 of agricultural consumption in the globe zektser and lorne 2004 overexploitation of groundwater has resulted in serious issues including groundwater depletion land subsidence soil salinization etc in the past five decades groundwater depletion has progressively become a global issue the north china plain ncp is the most important political and cultural center as well as an agricultural base in china in ncp groundwater accounts for 60 of fresh water consumption groundwater overexploitation in the past half century has led to a tremendous decline in groundwater level and several subsidence funnels zhang et al 2009 the ncp is a hot spot for groundwater depletion as it has become one of the most extensively altered areas by human activities in the world tang et al 2013 monitoring networks for groundwater are more limited than those for surface water even when monitoring networks are available data accessibility is often restricted alternatively the groundwater storage gws change and its associated land surface deformation can be remotely monitored by using geodetic methods such as gravity recovery and climate experiment grace global positioning system gps interferometric synthetic aperture radar insar etc grace measures the gravity changes that result from mass transport on the earth offering us the possibility to monitor large scale variations of groundwater tapley et al 2004 demonstrated the potential of detecting and monitoring terrestrial water storage change using grace rodell et al 2009 estimated the groundwater depletion rates in india using grace derived terrestrial water storage and simulated soil water scanlon et al 2012 applied a new approach to grace observations and estimated the gws changes in the california central valley usa which were validated by well data using grace and well data feng et al 2013 estimated the groundwater depletion rates for the period 2003 2010 in ncp tang et al 2013 analyzed the anthropogenic impacts on mass changes in ncp and their influences on estimating gws changes when using grace observations huang et al 2015 explored the capability of grace in detecting subregional scale groundwater depletion in ncp gong et al 2018

reviewed the gws changes in china derived from satellite gravity gps can be used to infer gws changes by monitoring the land surface displacements after removing the contributions from surface loading changes and geophysical effects gps measured land surface displacements correlate with gws changes by using gps abidin et al 2008 revealed the characteristics of the land subsidence in jakarta between 1997 and 2005 and their correlation with groundwater extraction chen et al 2010 examined the correlation between groundwater level and gps measured vertical surface displacements in the choshuichi alluvial fan taiwan and found that groundwater overdraft was the major mechanism for the land subsidence ji herring 2012 studied the horizontal surface displacements in the san gabriel valley california by using 11 gps sites and found a strong correlation between the surface displacements and water table variations silverii et al 2016 found that transient patterns in gps horizontal time series near large karst aquifers were controlled by seasonal and interannual groundwater recharge and discharge of karst aquifers similar to gps insar provides an alternative to monitor high resolution land subsidence due to gws changes with a millimeter level accuracy bell et al 2008 zhang et al 2013 castellazzi et al 2016 2017 rahmani ahmadi 2018 jiang et al 2018 many scientists have investigated the groundwater depletion rate in ncp by using hydrological data geodetic data and their combinations moiwo et al 2013 estimated the groundwater depletion rate to be 16 8 mm yr from 2002 to 2009 by using grace release 04 spherical harmonic coefficients shc feng et al 2013 estimated a groundwater depletion rate of 2 2 0 3 cm yr from 2003 to 2010 using grace release 05 shcs tang et al 2013 calculated the groundwater depletion rate to be 0 8 1 4 cm yr from 2003 to 2011 considering the influence from reservoir regulation water diversion and coal transport huang et al 2015 used the grace release 05 shc to detect the groundwater depletion in two sub regions of the ncp and estimated the depletion rates to be 4 65 0 68 cm yr and 1 69 0 19 cm yr during 2003 2013 gong et al 2018 stated that the gws in ncp declined at a rate of 1 78 0 01 cm yr during 1971 2015 by using in situ groundwater measurements and the grace mass concentrations mascon data wang et al 2017 deduced that the groundwater depletion rate in ncp was 2 49 0 71 cm yr from 2003 to 2009 and 2 72 0 25 cm yr from 2003 to 2012 by using grace shcs data however the above studies have some deficiencies firstly the estimates of groundwater depletion rate in ncp are not consistent when using different grace solutions and data processing strategies secondly the most recent gws changes are not studied especially after 2013 when the project of south to north water diversion has been operated thirdly the land surface deformation associated with groundwater depletion in ncp is not well depicted the objectives of this study are 1 to merge different mascon solutions to generate a unified solution 2 to use the unified solution to reveal gws changes in ncp 3 to depict the land surface deformation in ncp by using 116 gps sites 2 research area and data 2 1 research area the ncp is surrounded by the bo sea to the east yanshan mountains to the north taihang mountains to the west and yellow river to the south having an area of 140 000 km2 fig 1 this area is a large mesozoic and cenozoic sedimentary basin and the quaternary formations are 400 600 m in depth zhang et al 2009 the ncp is one of the world s largest aquifer systems which can be divided into one unconfined aquifer depths of 40 60 m and three confined aquifers depths of 120 170 m 250 350 m and 400 600 m sakura et al 2003 all the aquifers consist of sand gravel clay silt and abundant groundwater sakura et al 2003 observation data from 27 wells and 116 gps sites that are located in ncp are accessed the locations of the sites are shown in fig 1 2 2 data 2 2 1 grace mascon different from the grace traditional processing approach that is based on spherical harmonics sh basis functions an alternative processing approach based on regional mass concentration mascon functions has become operational in the recent years luthcke et al 2013 watkins et al 2015 wiese 2015 wiese et al 2016 save et al 2016 mascon solutions parameterize the gravity field in terms of finite equal area mascon blocks the mass within each mascon block is evenly distributed over the larger area encompassed by the bounding quadrilateral in a mass conserving manner mascon solutions offer several key advantages over the standard spherical harmonic solutions with mascons geophysical constraints are easily implemented to filter out noise from grace observations at the level 2 processing step and mascon solutions better handle the mass leakage problem than the sh solutions which will be beneficial for studies of the regional mass change due to these reasons grace mascon solutions from jet propulsion laboratory jpl of the national aeronautics and space administration nasa center for space research csr university of texas austin and goddard space flight center gsfc of nasa are used hereafter the three mascon solutions are simply called jpl mascon csr mascon and gsfc mascon respectively the jpl mascon is the release 5 version 2 with the coastal resolution improvement filter wiese 2015 the csr mascon is the release 5 version 1 0 save et al 2016 the gsfc mascon is the release 5 version 2 3b luthcke et al 2013 watkins et al 2015 wiese et al 2016 2 2 2 well data water table wt measurements from more than 50 deep confined wells depths are 60 160 m located in north china are collected from the china earthquake networks center most of them are hourly measurements and a few of them are daily measurements the starting observation time ranged from 2003 to 2011 most of them started around 2010 some of these data have serious quality problems including data gaps offsets abnormal jumps outliers etc before we use them these problems must be addressed as the well log files are not available we are not able to fix the offsets but just remove the data before offsets we also manually remove the observations with obvious jumps data with consecutive gaps spanning more than 2 years during 2012 to 2016 are not used after these we fit and remove the linear and seasonal terms from the wt time series we estimate the standard deviation σ of the residual wt time series and use 3σ as the threshold to remove outliers after all the above steps we finally obtain 27 qualified wt time series all of which have observations from 2012 to 2016 2 2 3 hydrological data terrestrial water storage changes simulated by four land surface models clm mosaic noah and vic in global land data assimilation system gldas version 1 rodell et al 2004 is used in the four models the terrestrial water storage is the sum of soil moisture in all layers accumulated snow and plant canopy surface water these data are sampled or resample at the spatial resolution of 1 1 the depths of the soil moisture for clm2 mosaic noah and vic models are 3 4 m 3 5 m 2 0 m and 1 9 m these simulated terrestrial water storage changes do not include the water in the reservoirs or rivers for clarity and simplicity the simulated terrestrial water storage is called soil moisture storage sms hereafter the precipitation runoff and evapotranspiration data from the gldas noah model koster and suarez 1992 liang et al 1994 ek et al 2003 for period 2004 2016 will be used to analyze water balance the runoff includes the surface runoff and the sub surface runoff the forcing data for the noah model for this period is a combination of noaa gdas atmospheric analysis fields spatially and temporally disaggregated noaa climate prediction center merged analysis of precipitation fields and observation based downward shortwave and longwave radiation fields derived using the method of the air force weather agency s agricultural meteorological modeling system agrmet rodell et al 2004 for the surface water storage sws we collect data of water storage in the major reservoirs in or near ncp from haihe river water conservancy commission ministry of water resource of the people s republic of china hwcc and mwr 2016 these data were published monthly from january 2004 to september 2015 but after september 2015 they were published annually we interpolate absent monthly sws data from october 2015 to june 2016 using the available data in 2015 and 2016 2 2 4 gps vertical displacements gps started to monitor the surface displacement in ncp since 1999 when the crustal movement observation network of china cmonoc was initiated its successor commenced in 2010 and built the backbone of the cmonoc network in total 260 continuously operating sites and 2000 campaign sites are distributed across mainland china to monitor the earth surface displacement according to the types of the bases of the observational pillars gps sites are grouped into two categories bedrock site and sediment site as the vertical displacements of the sediment can be used to infer the depletion of groundwater we employ 4 continuous and 112 campaign sediment sites to study the gws change in ncp fig 1 most of the collected measurements of continuous gps sites were initiated around 2010 while campaign gps sites have been launched once or twice a year since 2000 3 methods and data processing 3 1 three cornered hat method in this study the three cornered hat tch method premoli and tavella 1993 tavella and premoli 1994 is used to estimate the relative uncertainties of different datasets this method has been used in quantifying uncertainties in terrestrial water storage changes from grace observations land surface models and global hydrological models long et al 2017 this method does not require any a priori knowledge of the actual mass change when at least three different datasets are available the theory of the tch method is described below with the assumption that all the observation errors are normally distributed a given set of observations l i is expressed as 1 l i x e i where x is the true value e i is the observation error given a set of three pairs of observations i j k the difference between any two sets can be written as 2 l i l j x e i x e j e i e j l i l k x e i x e k e i e k l j l k x e j x e k e j e k the corresponding variance relationship can be written as 3 σ ij σ ei 2 σ ej 2 2 cov e i e j σ ik σ ei 2 σ ek 2 2 cov e i e k σ jk σ ej 2 σ ek 2 2 cov e j e k where σ ij σ ik σ jk are the variance of the differences of the observations σ ei 2 σ ej 2 σ ek 2 are the variance between the observations cov e i e j cov e i e k cov e j e k are the covariances of the observations the latter 6 are the unknowns to be determined if the observations from different sets are not correlated the covariances are zero and the σ ei 2 σ ej 2 σ ek 2 can be easily determined by eq 3 since all the mascon solutions are derived from the grace s inter satellite ranging observations the three mascon solutions could be correlated therefore we consider the covariances between different datasets in this situation eq 3 has 3 knowns and 6 unknowns and thus is underdetermined travella and premoli 1992 proposed to add mathematical constraints i e the determined variances should be all positive to solve the problem this method was further developed by premoli and tavella 1993 and tavella and premoli 1994 the detailed methods and equations can be found in premoli and tavella 1993 and will not be further illustrated here 3 2 singular spectral analysis singular spectral analysis ssa is an advanced data adaptive method that can decompose time series into trends seasonal oscillations irregular signals and noise ghil et al 2002 it does not require a priori information on mathematical function or stochastic model making it suitable for analyzing various kinds of data base on these advantages we use this method to extract the trends from the gws changes this method has been proven effective in extracting periodic and non periodic signals from noisy gps and grace time series walwer et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 2018 details about this method has been well illustrated in walwer et al 2016 and zhang et al 2017 and will not be further illustrated here 3 3 deriving groundwater storage changes from mascon solutions the total water storage tws in ncp can be regarded as the sum of sms sws and gws i e 4 tws s m s s w s g w s the tws changes can be estimated by grace mascon data the sms changes can be simulated by the land surface models and the sws changes can be obtained from haihe river water conservancy commission the gws changes can be obtained by two ways either directly estimated from the ground based water table observations or indirectly estimated by eq 4 using grace data and hydrological data we will estimate the gws changes in the two ways and compare the results here we first introduce how we estimate the gws changes from grace mascon data sakumura et al 2014 suggested that the ensemble mean simple arithmetic mean of jpl csr gfz fields was most effective in reducing the noise in the gravity field solutions within the available scatter of the solutions we follow sakumura et al 2014 but use different methods to merge the csr jpl and gsfc mascon solutions since the reference time have influences on the trend estimates we need to align these data to the same time reference since the csr mascon and the jpl mascon are relative to 2004 000 2009 999 while the gsfc mascon is relative to 2004 000 2016 000 we remove the 2004 000 2009 999 mean from the gsfc mascon to make it have the same reference with the csr and jpl mascons we first compute the tws changes in ncp from the csr jpl and gsfc mascon solutions then we apply the tch method to the three tws time series to determine their variances and covariances the results show that the variances for csr gsfc and jpl tws time series are 6 7 cm2 2 9 cm2 and 7 0 cm2 and their covariances are very close to zero based on these estimated co variances we use a weighted least square method to merge the three mascon solutions and finally generate a unified mascon solution we use the maximum differences between the unified solution and the other three solutions as the final uncertainties so that it gives a natural confidence interval of 100 we also interpolate the results into equally spaced monthly data to be consistent with the sms data we do not apply the tch method to the sms time series from the four land surface models clm mosaic noah and vic since the errors in these model data are not normally distributed and there are systematic biases among different time series due to different depths of simulated soil moisture in the four models we just take an average of the sms from the four models as the unified sms and treat the maximum differences between the unified sms and the other four smss as the uncertainties we remove the 2004 000 2009 999 mean from the unified sms time series to make it consistent with mascon data we also collect data from major reservoirs in or near ncp to account for sws changes we also remove the 2004 000 2009 999 mean from the sws data to ensure the sws data have the same reference with the tws data and the sms data fig 2 shows the retrieved tws changes from the unified mascon solution the sms changes from the unified soil moisture data and the sws changes from the haihe river water conservancy commission we derive the gws changes by subtracting the sms and sws from the tws then we apply ssa with a window with of 35 months to the gws time series to separate trends and seasonal oscillations 3 4 deriving gps vertical displacements bernese 5 2 software is employed to resolve daily position solutions from the double differenced carrier phase observations dach et al 2015 the data processing includes all sites from the cmonoc network and 127 globally distributed international global navigation satellite system service igs sites the ionosphere free combination of double differenced phase observations is used to eliminate the first order ionosphere delay effects and the second order ionosphere delays are estimated by models petrie et al 2010 the vmf1 model boehm et al 2006 and the gpt2 model lagler et al 2013 are used to model the tropospheric delay the igs14 absolute phase center model is used to correct the variation of the antenna phase center for both satellites and receivers the fes2004 model is employed to account for ocean tide corrections satellite positions are determined by using igs final orbit products on the final adjustment of coordinates minimal constraints are applied to align daily coordinates to the international terrestrial reference frame 2014 itrf2014 the vertical displacements of these sites are mainly due to surface loading changes while the horizontal displacements are mainly related to plate motions therefore we only use the vertical displacements we use the national centers for environmental prediction department of energy reanalysis 2 products to remove the atmospheric loading displacements and the gldas data to remove the hydrological loading displacements van dam et al 1994 the residual vertical displacements are mainly due to the gws changes all the loading displacements are calculated by convolving the loading mass changes with the green s functions farrell 1972 based on the preliminary reference earth model prem with continuous crust dziewonski and anderson 1981 4 results 4 1 groundwater storage changes fig 3 a shows the gws changes derived by subtracting the sms and sws from the tws changes the changes of gws is characterized by a primary long term decreasing trend accompanied by seasonal oscillations and interannual variations fig 3b 3c show the trends and seasonal oscillations derived by applying ssa to the gws time series we find peaks from the trend curve fig 3b with minimum peak distance of 2 years and finally detect 3 peaks which naturally divide the trend curve into 3 sub periods excluding the period before 2004 63 2004 63 2007 29 2007 29 2013 54 and 2013 54 2016 50 the gws change rates for the three sub periods and the whole period are estimated to be 2 2 0 4 cm yr 1 7 0 1 cm yr 3 8 0 1 cm yr and 1 7 0 1 cm yr based on the trend time series the gws change rate stayed relatively stable before mid 2013 but has more than doubled that from mid 2013 to mid 2016 which indicates the gws depletion has greatly accelerated since mid 2013 since this finding has never been reported before we will find more evidences from the well and gps measurements to support this 4 2 water table changes we first calculate the mean water table wt changes using the wt data from the 27 wells and then follow section 4 1 to divide the mean wt time series into two sub periods i e before and after 2013 54 fig 4 shows the mean wt time series and the linear fits to it we estimate the wt change rates to be 1 1 0 1 m yr and 2 3 0 0 m yr for before and after 2013 54 overall the wt showed a decreasing trend from 2012 to mid 2016 with a rate of 1 8 0 0 m yr accompanied with seasonal variations it is also evident that the wt accelerated to decline after 2013 54 by declining 0 5 m yr more than the average level using the same specific yields 0 05 0 07 in feng et al 2013 we convert the wt change rates to gws change rates the gws change rate is inferred to be 3 9 0 3 cm yr for 2013 54 2016 50 which is close to the rate estimated from grace data this further reinforces the finding that the gws has an accelerated decline from 2013 54 feng et al 2013 estimated the groundwater depletion rate to be 2 0 2 8 cm yr from 2003 to 2010 using well data gong et al 2018 estimated the groundwater declining rate to be 1 82 cm yr during 2005 2013 from in situ observations our estimate of gws decline rate is 1 7 cm yr before 2013 54 which is close to the results in feng et al 2013 and gong et al 2018 from mid 2013 to mid 2016 our estimate of gws depletion became 3 9 cm yr which suggests a strong acceleration in groundwater depletion during that period 4 3 land displacements due to groundwater changes we analyze the vertical displacements at 116 sediment gps sites to infer the temporal variation of groundwater depletion from vertical displacements we perform a linear regression to the time series before and after 2013 to calculate the corresponding displacement rates results show that all the 116 sediment gps sites show similar subsiding trends with average subsidence rates of 15 32 mm yr and 28 30 mm yr before and after 2013 these results suggest a strong acceleration in land subsidence after 2013 which agrees well with the accelerated groundwater depletion fig 5 shows the exemplary vertical displacement time series at 6 out of the 116 sites which visually demonstrates the acceleration of the subsidence we also present the spatial distribution of the subsidence field pre and post 2013 in fig 6 which clear shows that the subsidence funnels were greatly expanded after 2013 zhang et al 2009 depicted the distribution of subsidence funnels in ncp and pointed out that shallow groundwater funnels spread in the piedmont plain area while deep groundwater funnels were mainly located in the middle and east ncp the distribution of the subsidence funnels shown in fig 6 agrees well with that depicted by zhang et al 2009 but the extent has been greatly expanded 5 discussions the acceleration in groundwater depletion after 2013 has been revealed by the unified mascon solution and validated by accelerated wt decline and land subsidence in this study to find out what caused this acceleration we analyze water storage change from the perspective of water balance the natural water storage change δ s is expressed as the result of subtracting runoff r and evapotranspiration e from precipitation p 5 δ s p r e the precipitation runoff and evapotranspiration from the gldas noah model for period 2004 2016 is used for this analysis fig 7 a d show the accumulated precipitation accumulated evapotranspiration accumulated runoff and the tws changes derived by eq 2 using the noah model fig 7e h show the detrended ones fig 7d shows that the tws started to decline in 2013 and this decline lasted to 2016 which coincided with our detected gws changes fig 7e g show that all the detrended precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff started to decline since 2013 but only the decline in precipitation can cause the tws decline decline in runoff and evapotranspiration will increase the tws it is therefore inferred that precipitation decline is the cause for the tws decline however the tws decline does not necessarily cause groundwater decline as it also associates with sws and sms to investigate how the tws decline influences the groundwater change we remove the sws and sms changes from the tws changes to derive gws changes for clarity this gws change is called the noah based gws change to be differentiated from the grace based gws change fig 8 shows the surface water soil moisture and the noah based gws changes the surface water fig 8a showed an increase from 2010 to 2013 followed by a decrease from 2013 to late 2015 the soil moisture fig 8b also showed a slight increase before late 2013 followed by a sharp decrease from late 2013 to 2016 which is similar to the variations of the noah based tws as shown in fig 7d both the sws change and the sms change suggest a drought occurred in late 2013 and lasted to early 2016 however the noah based gws change fig 8c showed a slight decrease from 2011 to late 2013 followed by a slight increase from 2013 to late 2015 which is opposite to the tws changes it is not likely that the groundwater increases in ncp when both the sws and sms decrease therefore we attribute this inconsistence to data uncertainties overall the modeled groundwater changes in fig 8c do not show any decline during the drought which is very contradictory with the observations from grace water table and gps it is inferred that human factors which are not included in the model is responsible for this decline in the gws under the condition of less precipitation drier soil and deficient surface water during 2013 and 2016 people in ncp had to exploit more groundwater than usual to meet the need of water therefore the drought induced overexploitation of groundwater is inferred as the cause for the groundwater storage decline from 2013 to 2016 6 conclusion we use the three cornered hat method and the weighted least square method to merge the different grace mascon solutions and generate a unified solution based on the unified mascon solution we estimate the groundwater changes in north china plain and found an acceleration in groundwater depletion this acceleration started in mid 2013 and lasted to mid 2016 with an average groundwater depletion rate of 3 8 0 1 cm yr which doubled the rate before mid 2013 the groundwater depletion rate estimated from the water table data also shows an acceleration during the same period with a rate of 3 9 0 3 cm yr which is consistent with grace results 116 sediment gps sites depicted the land subsidence in ncp and revealed the accelerated land subsidence during 2013 and 2016 also in consistence with the groundwater depletion all these together suggest an acceleration in groundwater depletion from 2013 to 2016 by analyzing the land surface model we found that the precipitation decrease from 2013 to 2016 was the reason for the water storage decline under the condition of less precipitation drier soil and less surface water storage people had to exploit more groundwater than usual to meet the water need this led to the accelerated depletion in groundwater storage from 2013 to 2016 declaration of

6398,as one of the most important agricultural bases in china the north china plain ncp has experienced serious groundwater depletion however estimates of groundwater depletion rates in ncp differ considerably from one another due to different datasets and methods used in the estimation to get a better estimate of the groundwater depletion and to reveal the recent groundwater changes in ncp we first merge gravity recovery and climate experiment grace mass concentration mascon solutions from different organizations and soil moisture from different land surface models to yield unified mascon solutions and soil moisture estimates we then estimate the groundwater changes by subtracting the unified soil moisture and surface water storages in the major reservoirs in ncp from the unified mascon solutions results show that the groundwater storage in ncp depleted at a rate of 1 7 0 1 cm yr from 2004 to mid 2016 but this depletion accelerated to 3 8 0 1 cm yr from mid 2013 to mid 2016 ground based water table data show a consistent groundwater depletion rate 3 9 0 3 cm yr from mid 2013 to mid 2016 with the grace results we also analyze the land subsidence in ncp by using 116 global positioning system gps sites and depict the accelerated land subsidence and expanded subsidence funnels since 2013 which is consistent with the groundwater depletion all these point to a strong acceleration in groundwater depletion in ncp since mid 2013 land surface model outputs suggest a precipitation decline from 2013 to 2016 which caused a decline in soil moisture content and surface water storage this drought forced people to exploit more groundwater to compensate the surface water shortage and thereby led to the accelerated groundwater depletion keywords north china plain

decades groundwater depletion has progressively become a global issue the north china plain ncp is the most important political and cultural center as well as an agricultural base in china in ncp groundwater accounts for 60 of fresh water consumption groundwater overexploitation in the past half century has led to a tremendous decline in groundwater level and several subsidence funnels zhang et al 2009 the ncp is a hot spot for groundwater depletion as it has become one of the most extensively altered areas by human activities in the world tang et al 2013 monitoring networks for groundwater are more limited than those for surface water even when monitoring networks are available data accessibility is often restricted alternatively the groundwater storage gws change and its associated land surface deformation can be remotely monitored by using geodetic methods such as gravity recovery and climate experiment grace global positioning system gps interferometric synthetic aperture radar insar etc grace measures the gravity changes that result from mass transport on the earth offering us the possibility to monitor large scale variations of groundwater tapley et al 2004 demonstrated the potential of detecting and monitoring terrestrial water storage change using grace rodell et al 2009 estimated the groundwater depletion rates in india using grace derived terrestrial water storage and simulated soil water scanlon et al 2012 applied a new approach to grace observations and estimated the gws changes in the california central valley usa which were validated by well data using grace and well data feng et al 2013 estimated the groundwater depletion rates for the period 2003 2010 in ncp tang et al 2013 analyzed the anthropogenic impacts on mass changes in ncp and their influences on estimating gws changes when using grace observations huang et al 2015 explored the capability of grace in detecting subregional scale groundwater depletion in ncp gong et al 2018 studied the long term gws changes and land subsidence in ncp frappart and ramillien 2018 reviewed the grace satellite mission and its application in monitoring gws changes feng et al 2018 also reviewed the gws changes in china derived from satellite gravity gps can be used to infer gws changes by monitoring the land surface displacements after removing the contributions from surface loading changes and geophysical effects gps measured land surface displacements correlate with gws changes by using gps abidin et al 2008 revealed the characteristics of the land subsidence in jakarta between 1997 and 2005 and their correlation with groundwater extraction chen et al 2010 examined the correlation between groundwater level and gps measured vertical surface displacements in the choshuichi alluvial fan taiwan and found that groundwater overdraft was the major mechanism for the land subsidence ji herring 2012 studied the horizontal surface displacements in the san gabriel valley california by using 11 gps sites and found a strong correlation between the surface displacements and water table variations silverii et al 2016 found that transient patterns in gps horizontal time series near large karst aquifers were controlled by seasonal and interannual groundwater recharge and discharge of karst aquifers similar to gps insar provides an alternative to monitor high resolution land subsidence due to gws changes with a millimeter level accuracy bell et al 2008 zhang et al 2013 castellazzi et al 2016 2017 rahmani ahmadi 2018 jiang et al 2018 many scientists have investigated the groundwater depletion rate in ncp by using hydrological data geodetic data and their combinations moiwo et al 2013 estimated the groundwater depletion rate to be 16 8 mm yr from 2002 to 2009 by using grace release 04 spherical harmonic coefficients shc feng et al 2013 estimated a groundwater depletion rate of 2 2 0 3 cm yr from 2003 to 2010 using grace release 05 shcs tang et al 2013 calculated the groundwater depletion rate to be 0 8 1 4 cm yr from 2003 to 2011 considering the influence from reservoir regulation water diversion and coal transport huang et al 2015 used the grace release 05 shc to detect the groundwater depletion in two sub regions of the ncp and estimated the depletion rates to be 4 65 0 68 cm yr and 1 69 0 19 cm yr during 2003 2013 gong et al 2018 stated that the gws in ncp declined at a rate of 1 78 0 01 cm yr during 1971 2015 by using in situ groundwater measurements and the grace mass concentrations mascon data wang et al 2017 deduced that the groundwater depletion rate in ncp was 2 49 0 71 cm yr from 2003 to 2009 and 2 72 0 25 cm yr from 2003 to 2012 by using grace shcs data however the above studies have some deficiencies firstly the estimates of groundwater depletion rate in ncp are not consistent when using different grace solutions and data processing strategies secondly the most recent gws changes are not studied especially after 2013 when the project of south to north water diversion has been operated thirdly the land surface deformation associated with groundwater depletion in ncp is not well depicted the objectives of this study are 1 to merge different mascon solutions to generate a unified solution 2 to use the unified solution to reveal gws changes in ncp 3 to depict the land surface deformation in ncp by using 116 gps sites 2 research area and data 2 1 research area the ncp is surrounded by the bo sea to the east yanshan mountains to the north taihang mountains to the west and yellow river to the south having an area of 140 000 km2 fig 1 this area is a large mesozoic and cenozoic sedimentary basin and the quaternary formations are 400 600 m in depth zhang et al 2009 the ncp is one of the world s largest aquifer systems which can be divided into one unconfined aquifer depths of 40 60 m and three confined aquifers depths of 120 170 m 250 350 m and 400 600 m sakura et al 2003 all the aquifers consist of sand gravel clay silt and abundant groundwater sakura et al 2003 observation data from 27 wells and 116 gps sites that are located in ncp are accessed the locations of the sites are shown in fig 1 2 2 data 2 2 1 grace mascon different from the grace traditional processing approach that is based on spherical harmonics sh basis functions an alternative processing approach based on regional mass concentration mascon functions has become operational in the recent years luthcke et al 2013 watkins et al 2015 wiese 2015 wiese et al 2016 save et al 2016 mascon solutions parameterize the gravity field in terms of finite equal area mascon blocks the mass within each mascon block is evenly distributed over the larger area encompassed by the bounding quadrilateral in a mass conserving manner mascon solutions offer several key advantages over the standard spherical harmonic solutions with mascons geophysical constraints are easily implemented to filter out noise from grace observations at the level 2 processing step and mascon solutions better handle the mass leakage problem than the sh solutions which will be beneficial for studies of the regional mass change due to these reasons grace mascon solutions from jet propulsion laboratory jpl of the national aeronautics and space administration nasa center for space research csr university of texas austin and goddard space flight center gsfc of nasa are used hereafter the three mascon solutions are simply called jpl mascon csr mascon and gsfc mascon respectively the jpl mascon is the release 5 version 2 with the coastal resolution improvement filter wiese 2015 the csr mascon is the release 5 version 1 0 save et al 2016 the gsfc mascon is the release 5 version 2 3b luthcke et al 2013 watkins et al 2015 wiese et al 2016 2 2 2 well data water table wt measurements from more than 50 deep confined wells depths are 60 160 m located in north china are collected from the china earthquake networks center most of them are hourly measurements and a few of them are daily measurements the starting observation time ranged from 2003 to 2011 most of them started around 2010 some of these data have serious quality problems including data gaps offsets abnormal jumps outliers etc before we use them these problems must be addressed as the well log files are not available we are not able to fix the offsets but just remove the data before offsets we also manually remove the observations with obvious jumps data with consecutive gaps spanning more than 2 years during 2012 to 2016 are not used after these we fit and remove the linear and seasonal terms from the wt time series we estimate the standard deviation σ of the residual wt time series and use 3σ as the threshold to remove outliers after all the above steps we finally obtain 27 qualified wt time series all of which have observations from 2012 to 2016 2 2 3 hydrological data terrestrial water storage changes simulated by four land surface models clm mosaic noah and vic in global land data assimilation system gldas version 1 rodell et al 2004 is used in the four models the terrestrial water storage is the sum of soil moisture in all layers accumulated snow and plant canopy surface water these data are sampled or resample at the spatial resolution of 1 1 the depths of the soil moisture for clm2 mosaic noah and vic models are 3 4 m 3 5 m 2 0 m and 1 9 m these simulated terrestrial water storage changes do not include the water in the reservoirs or rivers for clarity and simplicity the simulated terrestrial water storage is called soil moisture storage sms hereafter the precipitation runoff and evapotranspiration data from the gldas noah model koster and suarez 1992 liang et al 1994 ek et al 2003 for period 2004 2016 will be used to analyze water balance the runoff includes the surface runoff and the sub surface runoff the forcing data for the noah model for this period is a combination of noaa gdas atmospheric analysis fields spatially and temporally disaggregated noaa climate prediction center merged analysis of precipitation fields and observation based downward shortwave and longwave radiation fields derived using the method of the air force weather agency s agricultural meteorological modeling system agrmet rodell et al 2004 for the surface water storage sws we collect data of water storage in the major reservoirs in or near ncp from haihe river water conservancy commission ministry of water resource of the people s republic of china hwcc and mwr 2016 these data were published monthly from january 2004 to september 2015 but after september 2015 they were published annually we interpolate absent monthly sws data from october 2015 to june 2016 using the available data in 2015 and 2016 2 2 4 gps vertical displacements gps started to monitor the surface displacement in ncp since 1999 when the crustal movement observation network of china cmonoc was initiated its successor commenced in 2010 and built the backbone of the cmonoc network in total 260 continuously operating sites and 2000 campaign sites are distributed across mainland china to monitor the earth surface displacement according to the types of the bases of the observational pillars gps sites are grouped into two categories bedrock site and sediment site as the vertical displacements of the sediment can be used to infer the depletion of groundwater we employ 4 continuous and 112 campaign sediment sites to study the gws change in ncp fig 1 most of the collected measurements of continuous gps sites were initiated around 2010 while campaign gps sites have been launched once or twice a year since 2000 3 methods and data processing 3 1 three cornered hat method in this study the three cornered hat tch method premoli and tavella 1993 tavella and premoli 1994 is used to estimate the relative uncertainties of different datasets this method has been used in quantifying uncertainties in terrestrial water storage changes from grace observations land surface models and global hydrological models long et al 2017 this method does not require any a priori knowledge of the actual mass change when at least three different datasets are available the theory of the tch method is described below with the assumption that all the observation errors are normally distributed a given set of observations l i is expressed as 1 l i x e i where x is the true value e i is the observation error given a set of three pairs of observations i j k the difference between any two sets can be written as 2 l i l j x e i x e j e i e j l i l k x e i x e k e i e k l j l k x e j x e k e j e k the corresponding variance relationship can be written as 3 σ ij σ ei 2 σ ej 2 2 cov e i e j σ ik σ ei 2 σ ek 2 2 cov e i e k σ jk σ ej 2 σ ek 2 2 cov e j e k where σ ij σ ik σ jk are the variance of the differences of the observations σ ei 2 σ ej 2 σ ek 2 are the variance between the observations cov e i e j cov e i e k cov e j e k are the covariances of the observations the latter 6 are the unknowns to be determined if the observations from different sets are not correlated the covariances are zero and the σ ei 2 σ ej 2 σ ek 2 can be easily determined by eq 3 since all the mascon solutions are derived from the grace s inter satellite ranging observations the three mascon solutions could be correlated therefore we consider the covariances between different datasets in this situation eq 3 has 3 knowns and 6 unknowns and thus is underdetermined travella and premoli 1992 proposed to add mathematical constraints i e the determined variances should be all positive to solve the problem this method was further developed by premoli and tavella 1993 and tavella and premoli 1994 the detailed methods and equations can be found in premoli and tavella 1993 and will not be further illustrated here 3 2 singular spectral analysis singular spectral analysis ssa is an advanced data adaptive method that can decompose time series into trends seasonal oscillations irregular signals and noise ghil et al 2002 it does not require a priori information on mathematical function or stochastic model making it suitable for analyzing various kinds of data base on these advantages we use this method to extract the trends from the gws changes this method has been proven effective in extracting periodic and non periodic signals from noisy gps and grace time series walwer et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 2018 details about this method has been well illustrated in walwer et al 2016 and zhang et al 2017 and will not be further illustrated here 3 3 deriving groundwater storage changes from mascon solutions the total water storage tws in ncp can be regarded as the sum of sms sws and gws i e 4 tws s m s s w s g w s the tws changes can be estimated by grace mascon data the sms changes can be simulated by the land surface models and the sws changes can be obtained from haihe river water conservancy commission the gws changes can be obtained by two ways either directly estimated from the ground based water table observations or indirectly estimated by eq 4 using grace data and hydrological data we will estimate the gws changes in the two ways and compare the results here we first introduce how we estimate the gws changes from grace mascon data sakumura et al 2014 suggested that the ensemble mean simple arithmetic mean of jpl csr gfz fields was most effective in reducing the noise in the gravity field solutions within the available scatter of the solutions we follow sakumura et al 2014 but use different methods to merge the csr jpl and gsfc mascon solutions since the reference time have influences on the trend estimates we need to align these data to the same time reference since the csr mascon and the jpl mascon are relative to 2004 000 2009 999 while the gsfc mascon is relative to 2004 000 2016 000 we remove the 2004 000 2009 999 mean from the gsfc mascon to make it have the same reference with the csr and jpl mascons we first compute the tws changes in ncp from the csr jpl and gsfc mascon solutions then we apply the tch method to the three tws time series to determine their variances and covariances the results show that the variances for csr gsfc and jpl tws time series are 6 7 cm2 2 9 cm2 and 7 0 cm2 and their covariances are very close to zero based on these estimated co variances we use a weighted least square method to merge the three mascon solutions and finally generate a unified mascon solution we use the maximum differences between the unified solution and the other three solutions as the final uncertainties so that it gives a natural confidence interval of 100 we also interpolate the results into equally spaced monthly data to be consistent with the sms data we do not apply the tch method to the sms time series from the four land surface models clm mosaic noah and vic since the errors in these model data are not normally distributed and there are systematic biases among different time series due to different depths of simulated soil moisture in the four models we just take an average of the sms from the four models as the unified sms and treat the maximum differences between the unified sms and the other four smss as the uncertainties we remove the 2004 000 2009 999 mean from the unified sms time series to make it consistent with mascon data we also collect data from major reservoirs in or near ncp to account for sws changes we also remove the 2004 000 2009 999 mean from the sws data to ensure the sws data have the same reference with the tws data and the sms data fig 2 shows the retrieved tws changes from the unified mascon solution the sms changes from the unified soil moisture data and the sws changes from the haihe river water conservancy commission we derive the gws changes by subtracting the sms and sws from the tws then we apply ssa with a window with of 35 months to the gws time series to separate trends and seasonal oscillations 3 4 deriving gps vertical displacements bernese 5 2 software is employed to resolve daily position solutions from the double differenced carrier phase observations dach et al 2015 the data processing includes all sites from the cmonoc network and 127 globally distributed international global navigation satellite system service igs sites the ionosphere free combination of double differenced phase observations is used to eliminate the first order ionosphere delay effects and the second order ionosphere delays are estimated by models petrie et al 2010 the vmf1 model boehm et al 2006 and the gpt2 model lagler et al 2013 are used to model the tropospheric delay the igs14 absolute phase center model is used to correct the variation of the antenna phase center for both satellites and receivers the fes2004 model is employed to account for ocean tide corrections satellite positions are determined by using igs final orbit products on the final adjustment of coordinates minimal constraints are applied to align daily coordinates to the international terrestrial reference frame 2014 itrf2014 the vertical displacements of these sites are mainly due to surface loading changes while the horizontal displacements are mainly related to plate motions therefore we only use the vertical displacements we use the national centers for environmental prediction department of energy reanalysis 2 products to remove the atmospheric loading displacements and the gldas data to remove the hydrological loading displacements van dam et al 1994 the residual vertical displacements are mainly due to the gws changes all the loading displacements are calculated by convolving the loading mass changes with the green s functions farrell 1972 based on the preliminary reference earth model prem with continuous crust dziewonski and anderson 1981 4 results 4 1 groundwater storage changes fig 3 a shows the gws changes derived by subtracting the sms and sws from the tws changes the changes of gws is characterized by a primary long term decreasing trend accompanied by seasonal oscillations and interannual variations fig 3b 3c show the trends and seasonal oscillations derived by applying ssa to the gws time series we find peaks from the trend curve fig 3b with minimum peak distance of 2 years and finally detect 3 peaks which naturally divide the trend curve into 3 sub periods excluding the period before 2004 63 2004 63 2007 29 2007 29 2013 54 and 2013 54 2016 50 the gws change rates for the three sub periods and the whole period are estimated to be 2 2 0 4 cm yr 1 7 0 1 cm yr 3 8 0 1 cm yr and 1 7 0 1 cm yr based on the trend time series the gws change rate stayed relatively stable before mid 2013 but has more than doubled that from mid 2013 to mid 2016 which indicates the gws depletion has greatly accelerated since mid 2013 since this finding has never been reported before we will find more evidences from the well and gps measurements to support this 4 2 water table changes we first calculate the mean water table wt changes using the wt data from the 27 wells and then follow section 4 1 to divide the mean wt time series into two sub periods i e before and after 2013 54 fig 4 shows the mean wt time series and the linear fits to it we estimate the wt change rates to be 1 1 0 1 m yr and 2 3 0 0 m yr for before and after 2013 54 overall the wt showed a decreasing trend from 2012 to mid 2016 with a rate of 1 8 0 0 m yr accompanied with seasonal variations it is also evident that the wt accelerated to decline after 2013 54 by declining 0 5 m yr more than the average level using the same specific yields 0 05 0 07 in feng et al 2013 we convert the wt change rates to gws change rates the gws change rate is inferred to be 3 9 0 3 cm yr for 2013 54 2016 50 which is close to the rate estimated from grace data this further reinforces the finding that the gws has an accelerated decline from 2013 54 feng et al 2013 estimated the groundwater depletion rate to be 2 0 2 8 cm yr from 2003 to 2010 using well data gong et al 2018 estimated the groundwater declining rate to be 1 82 cm yr during 2005 2013 from in situ observations our estimate of gws decline rate is 1 7 cm yr before 2013 54 which is close to the results in feng et al 2013 and gong et al 2018 from mid 2013 to mid 2016 our estimate of gws depletion became 3 9 cm yr which suggests a strong acceleration in groundwater depletion during that period 4 3 land displacements due to groundwater changes we analyze the vertical displacements at 116 sediment gps sites to infer the temporal variation of groundwater depletion from vertical displacements we perform a linear regression to the time series before and after 2013 to calculate the corresponding displacement rates results show that all the 116 sediment gps sites show similar subsiding trends with average subsidence rates of 15 32 mm yr and 28 30 mm yr before and after 2013 these results suggest a strong acceleration in land subsidence after 2013 which agrees well with the accelerated groundwater depletion fig 5 shows the exemplary vertical displacement time series at 6 out of the 116 sites which visually demonstrates the acceleration of the subsidence we also present the spatial distribution of the subsidence field pre and post 2013 in fig 6 which clear shows that the subsidence funnels were greatly expanded after 2013 zhang et al 2009 depicted the distribution of subsidence funnels in ncp and pointed out that shallow groundwater funnels spread in the piedmont plain area while deep groundwater funnels were mainly located in the middle and east ncp the distribution of the subsidence funnels shown in fig 6 agrees well with that depicted by zhang et al 2009 but the extent has been greatly expanded 5 discussions the acceleration in groundwater depletion after 2013 has been revealed by the unified mascon solution and validated by accelerated wt decline and land subsidence in this study to find out what caused this acceleration we analyze water storage change from the perspective of water balance the natural water storage change δ s is expressed as the result of subtracting runoff r and evapotranspiration e from precipitation p 5 δ s p r e the precipitation runoff and evapotranspiration from the gldas noah model for period 2004 2016 is used for this analysis fig 7 a d show the accumulated precipitation accumulated evapotranspiration accumulated runoff and the tws changes derived by eq 2 using the noah model fig 7e h show the detrended ones fig 7d shows that the tws started to decline in 2013 and this decline lasted to 2016 which coincided with our detected gws changes fig 7e g show that all the detrended precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff started to decline since 2013 but only the decline in precipitation can cause the tws decline decline in runoff and evapotranspiration will increase the tws it is therefore inferred that precipitation decline is the cause for the tws decline however the tws decline does not necessarily cause groundwater decline as it also associates with sws and sms to investigate how the tws decline influences the groundwater change we remove the sws and sms changes from the tws changes to derive gws changes for clarity this gws change is called the noah based gws change to be differentiated from the grace based gws change fig 8 shows the surface water soil moisture and the noah based gws changes the surface water fig 8a showed an increase from 2010 to 2013 followed by a decrease from 2013 to late 2015 the soil moisture fig 8b also showed a slight increase before late 2013 followed by a sharp decrease from late 2013 to 2016 which is similar to the variations of the noah based tws as shown in fig 7d both the sws change and the sms change suggest a drought occurred in late 2013 and lasted to early 2016 however the noah based gws change fig 8c showed a slight decrease from 2011 to late 2013 followed by a slight increase from 2013 to late 2015 which is opposite to the tws changes it is not likely that the groundwater increases in ncp when both the sws and sms decrease therefore we attribute this inconsistence to data uncertainties overall the modeled groundwater changes in fig 8c do not show any decline during the drought which is very contradictory with the observations from grace water table and gps it is inferred that human factors which are not included in the model is responsible for this decline in the gws under the condition of less precipitation drier soil and deficient surface water during 2013 and 2016 people in ncp had to exploit more groundwater than usual to meet the need of water therefore the drought induced overexploitation of groundwater is inferred as the cause for the groundwater storage decline from 2013 to 2016 6 conclusion we use the three cornered hat method and the weighted least square method to merge the different grace mascon solutions and generate a unified solution based on the unified mascon solution we estimate the groundwater changes in north china plain and found an acceleration in groundwater depletion this acceleration started in mid 2013 and lasted to mid 2016 with an average groundwater depletion rate of 3 8 0 1 cm yr which doubled the rate before mid 2013 the groundwater depletion rate estimated from the water table data also shows an acceleration during the same period with a rate of 3 9 0 3 cm yr which is consistent with grace results 116 sediment gps sites depicted the land subsidence in ncp and revealed the accelerated land subsidence during 2013 and 2016 also in consistence with the groundwater depletion all these together suggest an acceleration in groundwater depletion from 2013 to 2016 by analyzing the land surface model we found that the precipitation decrease from 2013 to 2016 was the reason for the water storage decline under the condition of less precipitation drier soil and less surface water storage people had to exploit more groundwater than usual to meet the water need this led to the accelerated depletion in groundwater storage from 2013 to 2016 declaration of

6399,the use of hydrologic models to assess long term watershed condition through repeated simulations of runoff and erosion is one common approach for rangeland health evaluation however obtaining vegetative data of appropriate spatiotemporal resolution for model parameterization can be difficult the goal of this research was to assess the utility of using time varying landsat derived vegetative values to parameterize an event based watershed scale hydrologic model this study was conducted on a small instrumented grassland watershed in the usda agricultural research service operated walnut gulch experimental watershed in southeastern arizona cloud free landsat scenes were acquired over the watershed for the years 1996 2014 the soil adjusted total vegetation index satvi was calculated for each image and calibrated using ground measured data to produce a time series of satellite based foliar cover rasters these values were used to parameterize the rangeland hydrology and erosion model rhem for 26 rainfall runoff events with corresponding observed data three parameterization scenarios using these data aggregated to different temporal resolutions static long term mean annual mean and intra annual values were compared to a static literature based scenario for evaluation the linear relationship between field measured foliar cover and satvi showed statistically significant agreement with r2 0 85 and p 0 05 simulated runoff volume and peak flow rate using the three remotely sensed parameterization scenarios improved upon that of the literature based scenario with the annual mean scenario performing the best of the three temporal aggregations the methodological framework outlined here provides a means for improved parameterization for watershed scale modelling where vegetative data may be scarce or unobtainable for long term analysis keywords rangeland hydrology and erosion model kineros landsat remote sensing surface runoff ecohydrology 1 introduction the acceleration of rangeland degradation has emerged as a major environmental concern in recent decades mea 2005 reynolds et al 2007 schlesinger et al 1990 it is estimated that 10 20 of global rangelands have been severely degraded reducing the capacity to provide many valuable ecosystem services including agricultural and livestock production carbon sequestration and biodiversity asner et al 2004 havstad et al 2007 rangelands are generally limited by water and soil nutrients and exhibit great spatial and temporal variability in productivity havstad et al 2007 vegetative condition in these regions can vary greatly with time as vegetation is easily diminished and the recovery time can take decades pilgrim et al 1988 strong relationships between ecological and hydrological processes exist in these semiarid environments ludwig et al 2005 shifts in vegetative composition and productivity from natural and anthropogenic pressures include woody species encroachment on native grasslands asner et al 2003 scholes and archer 1997 increases in invasive grasses ditomaso 2000 polyakov et al 2010 drought induced vegetative die off breshears et al 2005 moran et al 2014 and mortality from land mismanagement greene et al 1994 mcivor et al 1995 these changes in vegetation can ultimately lead to increased surface runoff and soil erosion through reduced infiltration rates dadkhah and gifford 1980 dunne et al 1991 decreased surface roughness cerdà 1997 ludwig et al 2005 weltz et al 1992 decreased canopy interception burgy and pomeroy 1958 thurow et al 1987 and degraded aggregate stability of the soil barthès and roose 2002 cantón et al 2009 holifield collins et al 2015 plot scale studies have played an important role in gaining understanding of hydrologic processes within these environments it has been widely reported that as vegetative cover decreases surface runoff and erosion rates increase within a rangeland environment nearing et al 2005 puigdefábregas 2005 rogers and schumm 1991 zuazo et al 2008 there is general agreement that a threshold of 30 50 grass cover is needed to significantly deter runoff and soil erosion in semiarid environments gutierrez and hernandez 1996 holifield collins et al 2015 pan and shangguan 2006 while plot scale experiments offer a great deal of control they lack representation of the complexities of the natural system in which they exist there is a growing need for information on the large scale ecohydrological effects of climate induced alterations of vegetation and precipitation regimes newman et al 2006 seyfried and wilcox 1995 scaling up in size from plot studies to catchment size studies introduces a more realistic representation of the ecological system with the heterogeneities in vegetation topography soil and climate represented however the large spatial extent and spatiotemporal heterogeneity of these regions have made monitoring and quantitatively assessing the large scale effects of these ecohydrological landscape changes a challenge hydrologic models are one practical tool for quantifying runoff and erosion rates in rangelands hernandez et al 2013 nearing et al 2011 modelling allows for relationships and processes observed at small scales to be extrapolated spatially and temporally to a larger scale enabling studies that may not be physically or economically feasible by traditional field methods nearing et al 1989 wainwright et al 2000 the ability to predict runoff and erosion using measurable biophysical model inputs provides land managers with scientifically based information for land management decisions the rangeland hydrology and erosion model rhem was developed specifically for hillslope scale use in rangeland environments adapting the central algorithms from the water erosion prediction project wepp model to the unique hydrologic characteristics of these semiarid regions hernandez et al 2017 nearing et al 2011 parameter estimation equations in rhem utilize physically quantifiable inputs including soil texture slope characteristics vegetation cover and ground cover al hamdan et al 2013 al hamdan et al 2017 hernandez et al 2017 these commonly measured inputs allow for intuitive simulation of vegetation or ground cover changes due to management or disturbance hernandez et al 2013 nouwakpo et al 2016a williams et al 2016a watershed scale modelling with rhem can be achieved by routing hillslope simulations through a network of channels using the kineros2 k2 model within the automated geospatial watershed assessment tool agwa geospatial environment ross 2013 the use of models in long term watershed scale hydrological monitoring is limited by the availability of corresponding vegetative data of sufficient spatiotemporal resolution for input while localized transect based vegetation measurements are appropriate for modelling at the hillslope scale these measurements are often prohibitive at the watershed scale due to time and cost constraints furthermore the existence of such data with historic or replicated measurements for long term monitoring or comparison purposes is sparse these data limitations are a key obstacle for large scale hydrologic modelling in arid and semiarid regions goodrich et al 2012 pilgrim et al 1988 seyfried and wilcox 1995 a common approach for watershed scale model parameterization is to associate literature based parameter values with land cover classes based on national land cover geospatial data sets e g the national land cover database nlcd and the north american lands change monitoring system nalcms goodrich et al 2012 hernandez et al 2000 miller et al 2002 niraula et al 2012 norman et al 2010 deriving detailed vegetative parameters from these sources can be problematic as land cover classes are often generalized across many plant communities and can cover large areas the use of satellite based remote sensing on rangelands has been shown effective for quantifying vegetative parameters including biomass leaf area index and foliar cover booth and tueller 2003 hunt et al 2003 qi et al 2002 wallace et al 2006 the landsat earth observing satellites are particularly appropriate for ecological monitoring and vegetation change detection at the regional or watershed scale vogelmann et al 2012 these data offer the necessary spatiotemporal and spectral resolution for characterizing vegetation typical of rangelands and capturing both long term trends and intra annual variability across large regions huete 1988 marsett et al 2006 purevdorj et al 1998 xie et al 2008 the release of a free landsat archive 1984 present to the public provides a cost effective easily obtainable resource for long term vegetation monitoring markham and helder 2012 masek et al 2006 wulder et al 2012 recent studies using landsat data have shown advancements in identifying degraded grasslands fassnacht et al 2015 improved change detection of grasslands tarantino et al 2016 detection of grazing effects and management practices in grasslands guo et al 2015 xu et al 2018 sibanda et al 2016 and identifying plant communities in rangelands villarreal et al 2016 the incorporation of remotely sensed data into spatially distributed hydrological models provides a means for model parameterization at large spatial scales and with improved temporal frequency spatially distributed watershed scale vegetative model inputs allow for a more realistic representation of the distribution and structure of vegetation that govern rangeland hydrology cadaret et al 2016 nouwakpo et al 2016b puigdefábregas 2005 williams et al 2016a additionally long term dynamic vegetative data records facilitate analyses of hydrologic response to landscape change and disturbance such as fire grazing and plant community alterations ebel and martin 2017 flerchinger et al 2016 park et al 2017 spaeth et al 2016 williams et al 2016b however uncertainty remains in how large scale spatial and temporal variability may affect model results seyfried and wilcox 1995 reynolds et al 2017 urban 2005 the goal of this research was to evaluate whether the inclusion of time varying landsat based foliar cover estimates improves runoff prediction within a rhem k2 modelling framework thus the specific objectives of the study were to 1 quantify watershed scale vegetation and ground cover for model parameterization and calibration of a remotely sensed foliar cover dataset 2 develop a 20 year time series of field calibrated landsat based foliar cover for the study area and 3 evaluate model performance for a default literature based parameterization approach versus three parameterization scenarios incorporating the remotely sensed vegetative estimates of varying temporal aggregation 2 methods 2 1 site description this research was conducted on the kendall grassland located within the usda agricultural research service ars walnut gulch experimental watershed wgew in southeastern arizona fig 1 the climate of the region is semiarid with a mean annual temperature of 18 c and mean annual precipitation of 315 mm 1961 2015 across the wgew approximately 65 of the annual precipitation occurs between july and september during the north american monsoon monsoon precipitation is dominated by high intensity spatially localized convective thunderstorms from which large amounts of runoff and flash flooding can occur winter precipitation is dominated by large scale low intensity frontal storms that generally do not produce surface runoff in the wgew the kendall subwatershed is located in the upper portion of the wgew 31 74 n 109 94 w the watershed has a drainage area of 0 02 km2 and average slope gradient of 12 3 the soils are an elgin 50 stronghold 40 complex with a fine gravelly sandy loam upper horizon and clay components below 2 5 cm breckenfeld et al 1995 the watershed drains into a densely vegetated swale near the outlet of the watershed through concentrated flow paths the swale serves as a deposition zone at which increased infiltration and sediment storage occur nearing et al 2005 kendall is instrumented with a weighing type rain gauge v notch weir pump sediment sampler and meteorological station with delta t thetaprobe soil moisture sensors at 5 and 15 cm depth goodrich et al 2008 keefer et al 2008 nichols et al 2008 stone et al 2008a the vegetation of the watershed has historically been dominated by native bunchgrasses scott et al 2010 following an extended period of drought many of the native grasses and shrubs died in 2006 and were replaced with forbs since then the watershed has been dominated by the invasive bunchgrass eragrostis lehmanniana lehmann lovegrass the main period of vegetative productivity occurs from july october in response to warm temperatures and monsoon precipitation a short growth period for annual grasses and forbs may occur in early spring if winter precipitation is sufficient 2 2 methods workflow overview the following sections describe the process in which a field calibrated remotely sensed foliar cover dataset was generated and integrated into the hydrologic model for precipitation runoff simulations fig 2 2 3 landsat image acquisition multispectral imagery from landsat 5 thematic mapper tm 1984 2012 landsat 7 enhanced thematic mapper plus etm 1999 2015 and landsat 8 operational land imager oli 2013 present were used in this study this series of satellites was designed to provide a continuous series of multispectral earth observations for global land surface monitoring at a spatial resolution of 30 m ground measured distance markham and helder 2012 the satellites have a repeat cycle of sixteen days with each satellite in orbit offset by 8 days e g tm and etm or etm and oli the definition of spectral bands varies slightly between satellites but the data series can largely be considered continuous if atmospheric corrections are applied bryant et al 2003 roy et al 2014 surface reflectance data were used to minimize some of these differences and allow for time series analysis flood 2014 no adjustments or calibration between satellites were performed and data obtained from the three satellites were considered to be a continuous data series in this study cloud free landsat surface reflectance scenes 1996 2015 were acquired between april and december for world reference system wrs 2 path 36 row 38 through the united states geological survey usgs earthexplorer http earthexplorer usgs gov and google earth engine http earthengine google com tm and etm surface reflectance products were processed using the landsat ecosystem disturbance adaptive processing system ledaps method masek et al 2006 the oli surface reflectance product was calculated using the provisional landsat surface reflectance code lasrc vermote et al 2016 all etm scenes were visually screened for the presence of scan line correction data gaps in the region immediately surrounding kendall the images were subsequently archived into a time series of surface reflectance scenes over the study domain 2 4 field data collection ten transects were established across kendall to monitor vegetative and ground cover over the course of the 2015 growing season transects were arranged within 3 60 m 60 m sampling blocks designed to register with four landsat pixels fig 3 each sampling block contained three 80 m transects the transects spanned the length of two landsat pixels 60 m with 10 m of extra length at each end to account for gps error transect locations were logged using a handheld gps device with 5 m accuracy two by two pixel sized blocks were chosen as the sampling area to compensate for uncertainty in registration during ground validation congalton 1991 stehman and czaplewski 1998 foliar cover and ground cover were measured at 0 5 m intervals along each transect using the line point intercept method herrick et al 2005 canopy hits were classified by plant life form as grass shrub or forb as well as senescent or green ground cover hits were classified as bare soil rock litter or basal area by life form senescent or green eight iterations of transect measurements were conducted between april 22 2015 and october 28 2015 on kendall four additional transect locations wg1 4 within wgew were measured in grassland areas with sparse cover surrounding kendall for use in landsat calibration fig 1 one transect block at each of these sites was measured between december 2 2015 and december 7 2015 the collection dates at all sites were designed to fall between landsat 7 and landsat 8 satellite overpasses to maximize the potential for acquiring a cloud free satellite image with close proximity to ground measurements for calibration table 1 2 5 development of landsat based foliar cover three vegetation indices were calculated and evaluated for foliar cover estimation from the acquired landsat surface reflectance scenes the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi the soil adjusted vegetation index savi and the soil adjusted total vegetation index satvi ndvi is a commonly used vegetation index used for measuring green or photosynthetically active vegetation calculated as 1 ndvi ρ nir ρ red ρ nir ρ red where ρ nir is surface reflectance in the near infrared band and ρ red is surface reflectance in the red band this vegetation index functions under the premise that live green vegetation absorbs energy in the red wavelengths and reflects in the near infrared nir lengths tucker 1979 however when used in areas with sparse vegetative cover soil reflectance from the underlying soil can inflate the index values erroneously huete 1988 savi incorporates a soil adjustment factor l to account for this phenomenon and is calculated as 2 savi ρ nir ρ red ρ nir ρ red l 1 l where ρ nir is surface reflectance in the near infrared band ρ red is surface reflectance in the red band and l is the soil adjustment factor by varying the l factor between 0 high vegetation density and 1 low vegetation density the vegetation index can be calibrated to minimize the effect of background soil reflectance huete 1988 an l factor of 0 5 was used here representing moderate vegetative cover while ndvi and savi are measures of green vegetation satvi is a measure of both green and senescent vegetation marsett et al 2006 satvi is calculated as 3 satvi ρ s w i r 1 ρ red ρ s w i r 1 ρ red l 1 l ρ s w i r 2 2 where ρ s w i r 1 is surface reflectance in the first shortwave infrared band ρ s w i r 2 is surface reflectance in the second shortwave infrared band ρ red is surface reflectance in the red band and l is the soil adjustment factor linear regression analyses were performed between the total foliar cover green and senescent measured in the kendall and wgew blocks and the vegetation index images corresponding with the ground measurement dates table 1 to establish if any significant relationships existed hagen et al 2012 marsett et al 2006 a spatial average of vegetation index values was calculated for the four landsat pixels intersecting each study block for use in the regression analysis the strength of correlation for each regression was evaluated using the coefficient of determination r2 mean absolute error mae and root mean squared error rmse a time series of total foliar cover values fcrs including green and senescent vegetation was then produced by applying the best performing vegetation index versus foliar cover relationship to the landsat vegetation index data set in addition to foliar cover basal and litter cover are required inputs for parameterizing the model however in this environment it is difficult to discern these values using downward looking remotely sensed data therefore allometric relationships were developed from the transect data to estimate litter and basal cover from foliar cover values a data set was compiled of foliar litter and basal cover values from each transect block kendall and wgew on all collection dates n 28 regression analysis was conducted between foliar cover and basal cover and foliar cover and litter cover the resulting eqs 4 and 5 were used to estimate basal bcrs and litter lcrs cover from fcrs 4 bc rs 0 37 f c rs 0 18 5 lc rs 0 25 f c rs 14 04 2 6 hydrologic modelling environment a suite of models and tools were used to conduct the precipitation runoff simulations in this study the following section briefly describes the tools used and how they were incorporated into the simulation process in depth documentation can be located at the urls provided in the sections below 2 6 1 kineros2 k2 k2 http www tucson ars ag gov kineros is an event oriented physically based model for simulating interception infiltration surface runoff and erosion for small agricultural rangeland and urban watersheds goodrich et al 2012 miller et al 2007 smith et al 1995 watersheds in k2 are represented as a network of geometrically simplified one dimensional flow elements hortonian overland flow elements are represented as rectangular planes or curvilinear surfaces over which runoff is routed into trapezoidal channel elements that cascade to the outlet of the watershed infiltration is modeled using the smith and parlange 1978 approximation and kinematic wave equations are used for overland and channel flow rainfall can be distributed across elements from multiple gauges and unique parameter sets can be applied to each of the elements allowing for representation of spatial heterogeneity in the watershed miller et al 2007 k2 was used in this study to route surface runoff from multiple hillslope simulations through a channel network to the outlet of the kendall watershed at weir 112 2 6 2 automated geospatial watershed assessment tool agwa determination of watershed geometry and initial model parameterization were conducted using agwa version 3 6 1 www tucson ars ag gov agwa within the esri arcgis version 10 4 environment goodrich et al 2012 miller et al 2007 agwa allows for rapid model parameterization and data propagation from nationally available data sources e g soils elevation land cover and precipitation within the arcgis geospatial environment tools within agwa allow for the delineation of watershed boundaries discretization of model elements model parameterization model execution and visualization of results the gis environment provided the ability to distribute geospatial and remotely sensed data across discrete model elements representing the structure of the watershed 2 6 3 rangeland hydrology and erosion model rhem rhem is a process based hillslope scale model for estimating runoff and soil loss within rangeland environments hernandez et al 2017 nearing et al 2011 rhem v2 3 is available for use as a web based decision support tool http apps tucson ars ag gov rhem and is incorporated into agwa to work in conjunction with k2 used for channel routing to perform watershed scale simulation the hydrology component of rhem is similar to k2 but incorporates unique parameterization equations that utilize quantifiable measures of vegetative and ground cover across multiple vegetative communities e g foliar cover litter cover basal cover rock cover and cryptogam cover rhem was developed for use at the hillslope scale as a soil loss estimation tool for use specifically on rangelands 2 7 model parameterization a unique set of model parameters was created for each rainfall runoff event additionally four parameterization scenarios were evaluated in which a default parameterization in agwa was compared to three fcrs based scenarios at varying temporal resolutions the parameterization procedure within agwa used to create the default scenario is outlined in sections 2 7 1 2 7 3 modifications to this procedure using the remotely sensed data to produce the fcrs based scenarios are discussed in section 2 8 2 7 1 hydrologic inputs and storm selection twenty six runoff producing rainfall events occurring in july august and september were used for simulation and validation precipitation breakpoint data measured at wgew raingage 82 were input into rhem k2 for each event since the model does not have an inter storm component an estimate of the pre storm initial relative soil saturation si is required to quantify the antecedent soil moisture goodrich et al 1994 si was calculated using volumetric water content vwc measurements from the soil moisture sensors located at 5 cm depth near the meteorological station at the beginning of each event soil moisture data were not available prior to 1996 which limited the study to the years 1996 2015 gauged runoff volume and peak flow rate data measured by a v notch weir at the outlet of the watershed wgew weir 112 were associated with each precipitation event and used as model validation criteria only storms in which the ratio of runoff to precipitation was greater than 5 were used for simulation table 2 these data are available from the usda ars southwest watershed research center via a web interface at http www tucson ars ag gov dap 2 7 2 watershed delineation and discretization the delineation of the kendall watershed boundary was performed with the agwa watershed delineation tool using a lidar based 0 5 m dem and the point location of the outlet of the sub watershed at weir 112 the watershed was then broken into discreet hillslope and channel reach elements using the agwa discretization tool default channel element width and depth are estimated in agwa using empirical hydraulic geometry relationships as a function of contributing area for the top and bottom of each channel reach miller et al 2007 the initial agwa calculated channel widths at the top and bottom of each reach were refined with field measured data the user defined pour points option was used in agwa to describe the channel network and create the watershed elements this method allows the user to manually set the initiation points of channels and subdivide channel reaches with different characteristics using gis point features channel initiation points where placed at the beginning of two main channels that drain into the vegetated swale at the base of the watershed internal pour points were placed at the initiation of the swale to separate the two main upland channels from the channel in the swale the channel within the swale was further subdivided to represent changes in soil type and channel width based on the definition of these pour points the watershed was broken up into hillslope elements that contributed to each channel reach fig 4 2 7 3 initial model parameterization once the watershed was split into discrete elements the initial model parameterization for each element was conducted using the agwa parameterization tool this tool requires the input of geospatial layers representing soils data land cover classification elevation and vegetation life form and cover rhem only the resulting parameter file generated from these data sets provided the necessary watershed parameters to execute the rhem k2 model soils data were obtained from the nrcs soil survey geographic database ssurgo the ssurgo spatial map was intersected with the watershed to obtain the spatial distribution of soil types agwa determines a soil texture for each hillslope element from the ssurgo tabular data using a weighting scheme based on spatial distribution of soils within an element proportion of soil components within a complex and soil horizons to 22 9 cm depth miller et al 2007 the textural classification usda of the soil across kendall was described as a sandy clay loam composed of 46 7 sand 23 0 silt and 30 3 clay this texture was applied to all hillslope elements soil parameters including saturated hydraulic conductivity kb percent rock suction head and porosity were estimated based upon the soil texture classification using pedo transfer functions lookup tables and algorithms within agwa hernandez et al 2017 rawls et al 1982 rawls et al 1998 channel elements are given default soil characteristic and hydraulic roughness parameters values based upon the assumption of a sandy bed this assumption produces high transmission losses within the channel miller et al 2007 the two upland channels were not incised and no noticeable change in soil texture or vegetation composition from the adjacent hillslopes was seen therefore the same soil texture used for adjacent hillslope elements was applied to these channel elements the channel reaches in the swale region contained large amounts of coarse sediment deposition creating a sandy upper horizon the soil texture for these reaches was left defined as a sand soil texture class land cover classification was defined using the 2011 national land cover database nlcd the nlcd is a landsat derived land cover classification map covering the conterminous united states each 30 m pixel is classified as one of sixteen land cover classes consistent with previous nlcd releases homer et al 2015 a lookup table in agwa associates a literature based foliar cover value in this case 25 and an associated interception depth parameter value with each land cover class canopy interception in in rhem k2 is reflected as the average depth of rainfall captured by the vegetation on a hillslope the in parameter is calculated by reducing the rainfall rate by the cover fraction based on percent foliar cover fcrs in this study until the amount retained reaches the user defined maximum interception depth smith et al 1995 this value was applied to all hillslope elements plant community foliar basal litter rock and cryptogamic cover values are needed to calculate the effective saturated hydraulic conductivity ke and the darcy friction factor f t parameters in rhem the ke parameter modifies the initial estimate of saturated hydraulic conductivity kb based on soil texture as outlined above to account for the effects of increased infiltration with an increase of vegetative cover or change in composition hernandez et al 2017 nearing et al 2011 the ke parameter is calculated as 6 k e i k b i e p i l i t t e r b a s a l where kbi is the 25 percentile saturated hydraulic conductivity for each soil textural class i p is the natural log of the ratio of the 75 to the 25 percentile values of saturated hydraulic conductivity litter is percent litter cover and basal is percent basal cover hernandez et al 2017 this parameter is further adjusted by applying a multiplier based on the dominant plant life form e g bunch grass 1 0 sod grass 0 8 forbs 1 0 shrub 1 2 the f t parameter represents hydraulic roughness in rhem it incorporates ground cover and slope measurements and has been shown to be negatively correlated with bare ground with basal cover being the most influential ground cover factor al hamdan et al 2015 the f t parameter is calculated as 7 log f t 0 109 1 425 l i t t e r 0 442 r o c k 1 764 b a s a l c r y p t o 2 068 s where litter is the fraction of area covered by litter to total area m2 m 2 rock is the fraction of area covered by rock cover to total area m2 m 2 basal crypto is the fraction of area covered by basal plus cryptogam cover to total area m2 m 2 and s is slope m m 1 al hamdan et al 2015 the plant life form group for kendall was defined as bunch grass dominated determined from field observations transect measured rock cover was applied to individual elements based on the element s proximity to a given transect and remained static for all simulations cryptogam cover did not exist in the watershed and was assigned a null value basal and litter cover were calculated by applying eqs 4 and 5 to the foliar cover value obtained from the nlcd lookup table this set of parameters defined using agwa and the literature based foliar cover value served as the a prioi parameterization scenario scenario 1 for all precipitation runoff simulations additional model calibrations were performed using the remotely sensed data wherein the foliar cover value used in scenario 1 was replaced with landsat based fcrs values the intrinsic characteristics of the watershed e g topography watershed geometry porosity were left as static values for all event simulations however the in ke and f t parameters in rhem k2 were altered using fcrs and the derived bcrs and lcrs data 2 8 model parameterization integrating remotely sensed foliar cover three additional parameterization scenarios were developed using the fcrs time series the three fcrs based scenarios scenarios 2 4 were designed to evaluate the effects of temporal variability of foliar cover on model performance as well as to assess the value of spatially localized data in comparison to scenario 1 foliar cover values were calculated for each hillslope element by using a weighted average of all intersecting 30 m landsat pixels within the boundary of the element basal and litter cover were calculated using eqs 4 and 5 using the mean foliar cover value from each hillslope element these values were then input into the rhem parameterization eqs 6 and 7 to calculate ke and f t and the foliar cover value was applied to in the remaining static parameters for each hillslope and channel element were calculated as outlined in the previous section scenario 2 was based on a long term mean foliar cover value from 1996 to 2015 representing the assumption that foliar cover during the growing season remained constant over time the mean of fcrs values between july and september of each year were calculated the mean of these values was then calculated resulting in a static long term estimate of foliar cover for the study period the long term mean was calculated in this fashion in order to minimize the influence of the varying number of images available during the monsoon period each year this calculation was performed for each landsat pixel intersecting kendall resulting in a spatially distributed grid of foliar cover values scenario 3 was based on an annually varying mean foliar cover value representing the assumption that foliar cover remained constant during any given monsoon season but varied between years this value was determined by taking the mean of all fcrs values between july and september of each year this resulted in a dynamic series of 15 annual foliar cover grids that were then associated with all precipitation events that occurred in that year scenario 4 was the most temporally localized of the three fcrs based scenarios fcrs values acquired within the closest temporal proximity to a selected precipitation event were associated with that event no fcrs images were acquired more than 10 days before or after a given precipitation event 2 9 model execution and performance evaluation rhem k2 precipitation runoff simulations were executed for all selected events table 2 using the four parameterization scenarios runoff volume and peak flow rate for all storms were evaluated as a lumped data set including the values from all 26 simulated events the rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr and percent bias pbias were the performance metrics used in this study as outlined by moriasi et al 2007 rsr standardizes the rmse with the standard deviation of the observed data with an optimum value of 0 rsr is calculated as 8 rsr rmse stdev obs i 1 n y i obs y i sim 2 i 1 n y i obs y mean obs 2 where y i obs is the ith observation of the measured data y i sim is the ith observation of the simulated data and y mean obs is the mean of the observed data moriasi et al 2007 pbias is a measure of the tendency of a model to over or under estimate values compared to the observed data gupta et al 1999 pbias is calculated as 9 pbias i 1 n y i obs y i sim 100 i 1 n y i obs where y i obs is the ith observation of the measured data and y i sim is the ith observation of the simulated data the optimal value of pbias is 0 with values of lower magnitude representing more accurate simulation positive values indicate a model underestimation bias and negative values indicate a model overestimation bias 3 results and discussion 3 1 field based characterization of the watershed the invasive eragrostis lehmanniana lehmann lovegrass was the dominant species measured within all kendall transect blocks 68 of watershed vegetation other species with notable presence were hilaria belangeri steud nash curly mesquite grass 14 calliandra eriophylla benth fairyduster 3 bouteloua curtipendula michx torr sideoats grama 3 acacia constricta benth whitethorn acacia 2 and pleuraphis mutica buckley tobosagrass 2 all other species present represented less than one percent of the total vegetative composition and were comprised of annual forbs perennial grasses shrubs and cactus composition for the three study blocks were similar with lehmann lovegrass dominating the composition followed by native grasses shrubs and forbs the vegetative composition within the swale differed slightly from the uplands in the watershed with a greater amount of annual forbs 17 and less native grass 4 compared to 2 and 22 respectively in the uplands foliar cover on kendall mean value of block 1 block 2 and block 3 ranged from 63 on 6 22 2015 to 82 on 9 28 2015 fig 5 the annual mean foliar cover on kendall spanning the growing season was 73 s 6 lehmann lovegrass inflorescences were first observed on 8 14 2015 and were widespread by the 8 28 2015 collection date the large panicle inflorescences mainly accounted for the increased measure of foliar cover seen in august and early september the three kendall blocks and the swale transect maintained similar foliar cover values throughout the collection period while total foliar cover remained relatively stable over the course of the growing season the green and senescent components showed greater variability the vegetation was predominantly senescent until the 7 24 2014 collection date fig 5 green vegetation during this period was composed of annual forbs and lehmann lovegrass vegetation greenness responded to the onset of monsoon precipitation occurring in late june greenness stabilized with intermittent rainfall and peaked after a large pulse of precipitation in early september consistently elevated green foliar cover values were observed in the swale transect due to the increased presence of forbs and improved plant available water from upland drainage basal cover was similar between all blocks and remained relatively constant over the collection period x 27 s 6 with only a slight increasing trend visible after the 6 22 2015 monitoring fig 6 the swale contained slightly lower basal cover values due to a high presence of forbs litter cover also remained relatively constant for the three kendall blocks with a slight decrease over the growing season x 33 s 4 fig 6 the swale contained significantly higher litter cover t test p 0 05 on all collection dates x 59 s 6 mean rock cover x 24 s 4 was significantly higher t test p 0 05 in the three study blocks than in the swale x 5 s 3 fig 6 foliar cover was the most dynamic variable with a slight increase in foliar cover near peak productivity caused by inflorescence growth however from a hydrological perspective this small change in foliar cover would only affect rainfall interception and have a minimum effect on surface runoff produced from high intensity monsoon rainfall the results also show the importance of sufficient spatial coverage of transect measurements for representing changes in soils and vegetation composition although little spatial variability was seen in the vegetative composition or ground cover measurements in the uplands of the watershed significant differences were seen in the swale increased litter and decreased rock cover as well as altered vegetative composition in the swale indicated that different hydrologic properties exist in this portion of the watershed and need to be accounted for in runoff simulation as ke and f t eqs 6 and 7 are functions of these rhem inputs field measured basal and litter cover remained relatively static over the course of the 2015 growing season while foliar cover was more dynamic application of eqs 4 and 5 at a sub annual frequency could introduce unrealistic fluctuations in the amount of basal and litter cover to best represent the static nature of these vegetative components a mean annual value or singular value taken near peak productivity is recommended 3 2 landsat based foliar cover calibration results from the regression analysis between the vegetation indices and field measured foliar cover indicated that satvi fig 7 was the best predictor of total foliar cover r2 0 85 rmse 5 37 and mae 4 60 compared to ndvi r2 0 66 rmse 8 10 and mae 6 61 and savi r2 0 57 rmse 9 07 and mae 7 38 this result is consistent with hagen et al 2012 which showed satvi to be the best performing vegetation index of those evaluated across western rangeland sites however the resulting eq 10 from the regression analysis differed from the broad scale rangeland equation developed in hagen et al 2012 which underestimated foliar cover in this localized grassland environment 10 fc rs 330 86 s a t v i 22 04 the regression analysis reinforces the observations from the intra annual vegetation measurements in that herbaceous vegetation within semiarid grasslands may only be green for a portion of the year therefore spectral remote sensing techniques must account for both green and senescent vegetation to accurately quantify total foliar cover greater uncertainty exists in fcrs values below 60 and above 80 as the dataset is largely composed of calibration data from the kendall blocks which fell within this dynamic range this relationship was developed using foliar cover values within a localized grassland community and therefore cannot be applied with a high degree of certainty to landscapes containing different plant communities 3 3 allometric relationships for basal and litter cover estimation the linear relationship between foliar and basal cover showed significant r2 0 57 p 0 05 correlation fig 8 the relationship makes physical sense within this bunchgrass dominated vegetation community in that an increase of basal area would result in an increase in foliar cover with zero basal cover resulting in approximately zero foliar cover b 0 18 the correlation between foliar and litter cover was weak but significant r2 0 29 p 0 05 fig 8 this relationship is generalized and is based on the assumption that with greater amounts of foliar cover a greater potential for litter cover exists the relationship ignores many complex physical and temporal factors that affect litter presence over time furthermore while the swale contained a significantly higher amount of litter than the uplands the equation shown in fig 8 was applied to all model elements for simplicity additional long term data collection is required to develop more robust models for these relationships however these simple relationships provide a conceptual foundation for research in this context moving forward 3 4 landsat based foliar cover time series the fcrs time series produced by the application of eq 10 is shown in fig 9 the lower image frequency occurring from 1996 to 1999 and in 2012 was the result of only one landsat satellite in orbit during that period better representation of phenology and periods of peak productivity were seen in the periods where two satellites were in orbit however high frequency variability between consecutive fcrs values was apparent in periods where foliar cover was below 60 this may be a result of differences between satellite measurements e g landsat 5 and landsat 7 or landsat 7 and landsat 8 or physical changes in vegetation or moisture content further research needs to be conducted to determine the source of this variability a cross platform calibration of bands would need to be done if the variability is sourced to differences in satellite measurements evidence of the drought induced vegetation change in which the watershed was occupied by forbs in 2006 and transitioned to a lehmann lovegrass dominated grassland can be seen in the fcrs time series fig 9 beginning in 2000 a succession of dry years with below average winter 2000 2003 and monsoon precipitation 2000 2005 and high temperatures occurred following a late flush of vegetation productivity in 1999 a decreasing trend in foliar cover was present reaching a low point of 40 in the spring of 2006 fig 9 this trend is consistent with observed reduced net ecosystem carbon uptake an indicator of lower productivity during these years emmerich 2003 scott et al 2010 despite above average monsoon precipitation from 2006 to 2008 native species did not fully recover were replaced with a flush of annual grasses and forbs in 2006 which was succeeded by lehmann lovegrass thereafter scott et al 2010 nine of the twenty six runoff events used in this study occurred during the 2006 monsoon precipitation intensities were not abnormally high for these events but runoff ratios were generally elevated during this period table 2 soil erosion resulting from these events accounted for 42 of the 19 year sediment loss record polyakov et al 2010 the coincidence of change in vegetation and the spike in runoff and sediment loss suggest a drastic change in watershed response minimum plant litter was measured in 2007 scott et al 2010 and the presence of annual vegetation allude to decreased basal cover during this period increased flow velocities and decreased infiltration rates can be expected from these conditions resulting in higher runoff and erosion while not as well documented as the vegetation die off in 2006 a similar response from extremely low to high fcrs values within a growing is shown in 1999 fig 9 historic composition data shows a spike in forb presence in 1999 similar to that of 2006 high annual forb cover and a decrease in fcrs leading up to 1999 suggest a similar period of grass die off further data collection needs to be conducted to validate fcrs during these periods of altered vegetation composition after 2006 a general increasing trend in foliar cover is present fig 9 lehmann lovegrass has largely dominated the watershed s vegetation since 2008 while the grass species present on the watershed have changed foliar cover appears to have returned to historic levels in the period from 2008 to 2015 only 8 significant runoff events occurred runoff ratio greater than 5 including 3 events in 2008 when the grass vegetation was dominated by seedlings table 2 the infrequency of runoff events in recent years and high foliar litter and basal cover measurements suggest that the watershed is hydrologically stable under this vegetative state 3 5 foliar cover input scenarios the remotely sensed foliar cover values based on fcrs scenarios 2 4 were higher than the nlcd based value scenario 1 of 25 in all cases fig 10 regardless of the temporal resolution the remotely sensed data more closely resembled that of the field measured data reinforcing the importance of spatially localized data the cover values shown in this section are based on a spatial average of all pixels within the domain of the watershed for discussion purposes scenario 2 long term mean of fcrs from 1996 to 2015 represented a static fcrs value of 65 and derived bcrs and lcrs values of 24 and 30 respectively compared to the corresponding values of 25 9 and 20 in scenario 1 these static values were applied to all 26 simulation events scenario 3 annual fcrs means showed improved representation of inter annual fluctuation compared to scenarios 1 and 2 and general trends in fcrs response to climatic variability were visible fcrs bcrs and lcrs values for scenario 3 ranged from 58 21 and 29 in 2006 to 73 27 and 32 in 2008 respectively phenological timing and image availability had a large impact on the annual fcrs means the timing of vegetation green up where fcrs values were largest was highly variable between years the annual mean fcrs value can be inflated if this green up occurs early due the inclusion of more high values in the calculation of the mean between july and september similarly the number of available cloud free images and the dates they are acquired can affect the annual mean fcrs value scenario 4 values fcrs value closest to the event date allow for representation of intra annual variability and may be higher or lower than scenarios 2 and 3 values within a given year the greatest variability of values associated with a runoff event occurred in 1999 fcrs bcrs and lcrs values ranged from 52 20 and 27 respectively on 7 16 1999 to 81 30 and 34 on 9 9 1999 the determination of bcrs and lcrs from fcrs for model parameterization using intra annual values may be problematic as unrealistic increases in these values could occur within a year contradicting the static nature of basal and litter cover the 2015 transect data suggested fig 5 3 6 runoff simulation and model evaluation the mean simulated runoff volume for the 26 event lumped data set was greater than that of the observed dataset but more accurate for the remotely sensed scenarios table 3 negative pbias in all cases indicated model over estimation of total runoff volume however smaller pbias values were shown in scenarios 2 3 than for scenario 1 113 27 with scenario 3 having the smallest pbias 50 33 rsr values were also improved using the remotely sensed data value with scenario 3 performing best 0 77 and scenario 1 performing the worst 0 95 moriasi et al 2007 suggest streamflow model evaluation criteria for satisfactory performance of 25 for pbias and 0 70 for rsr these values may be inappropriate for event based data but serve as a generalized benchmark here overall model accuracy measures were improved with the incorporation of fcrs with the best pbias and rsr values shown for scenario 3 table 3 agreement between the observed and simulated peak flow rates data sets were better than those for total runoff volume scenario 1 showed model overestimation with a simulated mean peak runoff rate of 25 72 mm hr compared to an observed mean of 16 43 mm hr and pbias of 56 56 table 3 the remotely sensed scenarios showed little bias with pbias values less than a magnitude of 5 with scenario 3 performing best 0 37 smaller rsr values for scenarios 1 3 indicated better model performance for scenarios 1 3 compared to scenario 1 0 83 with scenario 3 performing best 0 70 based on the performance metrics scenario 3 produced the best simulated peak runoff rate results slopes and intercepts for runoff volume and peak flow regressions were not shown to be significantly different ancova α 0 05 between the four scenarios fig 11 however relative improvement in rsr and pbias for both simulated runoff volume and peak flow were shown using the remotely sensed foliar cover inputs table 3 negligible differences in performance were seen between scenarios 2 4 based on the model performance metrics table 3 and the analysis of the field measured cover data it was concluded that annual implementation of fcrs scenario 3 was most appropriate for model parameterization the comparatively better results for peak flow rate infer that estimates of f t were better than those of saturated hydraulic conductivity ke in this watershed one factor that likely affected the overestimated runoff volume was the characterization of the swale the slope soil and ground cover in this area are different from the surrounding hillslopes years of sediment deposit in this shallow sloped region have produced a coarse sandy soil texture to depths of at least 1 m these conditions have allowed for altered vegetation and significantly higher litter content the soil texture in the swale channel elements were modified to represent a sandy texture within the model however improved localized soil data is needed to represent the heightened infiltration in this region of the watershed as soil textural data obtained from ssurgo soils maps may not represent the actual near surface soil texture on the kendall watershed these texture classes are the basis for deriving kb that is then modified by vegetation to calculate ke eq 6 furthermore the increased litter content seen in the swale transect was not reflected in the fcrs parameterization data which accounts for an underestimation of ke and overestimation of runoff volume hernandez et al 2017 further insight was gained when the simulation results were subset into vegetative life form groups i e forb dominated 1999 2007 and 2007 and grass dominated all other years for visualization purposes fig 11 increased model overestimation for runoff volume was seen in all scenarios for events that occurred when the watershed was grass dominated overestimation for grass dominated events was reduced with remotely sensed foliar cover input the overestimation of runoff occurring in grass dominated events suggests that ke is too low under grass dominated conditions and current soil texture distinct differences in the simulated peak flow rate were also seen between vegetation groups model overestimation of peak flow rates occurred for grass dominated events while underestimation was seen in forb dominated events peak flow rate is largely affected by f t which suggests that this parameter is too low under grass dominant conditions and too high under forb dominated conditions these results indicate that the satvi to foliar cover relationship and allometric relationships used to calculate basal and litter cover here should be modified to represent specific plant communities furthermore the allometric relationships between foliar cover and litter used here are rudimentary and need to be improved upon through additional data collection and research the ke and f t parameters are sensitive to these inputs and largely affect the model results improved understanding of these complex relationships would extend the value of the approach outlined in this research and could further improve model simulation results the ability to group the simulated runoff events by dominant vegetation was a luxury due to historic species monitoring on the watershed operationally this type of data may not be available the use of remotely sensed foliar cover estimates for the parameterization of rhem k2 improved simulation results compared to scenario 1 however results suggest that in addition to detecting the abundance of vegetation it is also necessary to detect the type of vegetation villarreal et al 2016 showed success in discerning annual forbs lehmann lovegrass and native grasses using ndvi and satvi implementation of a similar approach could further improve model parameterization by associating a plant community classification with fcrs values 4 conclusion the vegetative composition of the kendall grassland watershed in 2015 was dominated by the invasive lehmann lovegrass total foliar cover basal cover and litter cover values remained relatively stable throughout the course of the growing season high variability in green and senescent foliar cover was observed over the measurement period due to this fact the use of satvi was determined most appropriate for calibrating field measured foliar cover with landsat imagery due to its ability to detect green and senescent vegetation the resulting time series of remotely sensed foliar cover showed the ability to detect climate based alterations in vegetative cover based on a qualitative comparison the integrated rhem k2 model was parameterized using foliar cover values from four input scenarios the first scenario used a literature based value while the other three were based on the remotely sensed foliar cover values of different temporal representation improvement in model performance was seen when the model was parameterized using the remotely sensed data for runoff volume and peak flow rate temporal resolution long term annual and sub annual had negligible effect on the simulated values however based on the static nature of field observations of foliar basal and litter cover over a growing season and slightly better model performance the annual mean value of fcrs scenario 3 was selected as the optimum parameterization scheme these results highlighted the importance of spatially localized vegetation data for model parameterization a well documented change in vegetation on kendall occurred during the period of simulated events the vegetation transitioned from native grass dominated to forb dominated to its current state of invasive grass dominated runoff volume for grass dominated events were over predicted by the model to a greater extent than the forb dominated events similarly simulated peak flow rate was overestimated for grass dominated events and underestimated for forb dominated events these results emphasize the importance of not only quantifying the abundance of vegetation but also the type of vegetation future research should focus on expanding on the methodologies outlined here to address different vegetation communities the development of community specific vegetation relationships between the vegetation index and foliar cover as well as improved basal and litter cover estimates could provide better parameter estimates however classification of vegetation communities using remotely sensed data will be required for operational implementation of these improvements the research presented in this study provides a framework for the parameterization of the rhem k2 model using landsat based estimates for required vegetative inputs while model performance metrics were lower than desired this methodology shows improvement over the default method of associating literature based values with geospatial land cover classes furthermore no parameter optimization or use of calibrated multipliers were used to refine parameter estimates this allows for improved operational use when data is scarce this methodology shows the potential for long term change analysis at the watershed scale and may be especially useful for detecting

6399,the use of hydrologic models to assess long term watershed condition through repeated simulations of runoff and erosion is one common approach for rangeland health evaluation however obtaining vegetative data of appropriate spatiotemporal resolution for model parameterization can be difficult the goal of this research was to assess the utility of using time varying landsat derived vegetative values to parameterize an event based watershed scale hydrologic model this study was conducted on a small instrumented grassland watershed in the usda agricultural research service operated walnut gulch experimental watershed in southeastern arizona cloud free landsat scenes were acquired over the watershed for the years 1996 2014 the soil adjusted total vegetation index satvi was calculated for each image and calibrated using ground measured data to produce a time series of satellite based foliar cover rasters these values were used to parameterize the rangeland hydrology and erosion model rhem for 26 rainfall runoff events with corresponding observed data three parameterization scenarios using these data aggregated to different temporal resolutions static long term mean annual mean and intra annual values were compared to a static literature based scenario for evaluation the linear relationship between field measured foliar cover and satvi showed statistically significant agreement with r2 0 85 and p 0 05 simulated runoff volume and peak flow rate using the three remotely sensed parameterization scenarios improved upon that of the literature based scenario with the annual mean scenario performing the best of the three temporal aggregations the methodological framework outlined here provides a means for improved parameterization for watershed scale modelling where vegetative data may be scarce or unobtainable for long term analysis keywords rangeland hydrology and erosion model kineros landsat remote sensing surface runoff ecohydrology 1 introduction the acceleration of rangeland degradation has emerged as a major environmental concern in recent decades mea 2005 reynolds et al 2007 schlesinger et al 1990 it is estimated that 10 20 of global rangelands have been severely degraded reducing the capacity to provide many valuable ecosystem services including agricultural and livestock production carbon sequestration and biodiversity asner et al 2004 havstad et al 2007 rangelands are generally limited by water and soil nutrients and exhibit great spatial and temporal variability in productivity havstad et al 2007 vegetative condition in these regions can vary greatly with time as vegetation is easily diminished and the recovery time can take decades pilgrim et al 1988 strong relationships between ecological and hydrological processes exist in these semiarid environments ludwig et al 2005 shifts in vegetative composition and productivity from natural and anthropogenic pressures include woody species encroachment on native grasslands asner et al 2003 scholes and archer 1997 increases in invasive grasses ditomaso 2000 polyakov et al 2010 drought induced vegetative die off breshears et al 2005 moran et al 2014 and mortality from land mismanagement greene et al 1994 mcivor et al 1995 these changes in vegetation can ultimately lead to increased surface runoff and soil erosion through reduced infiltration rates dadkhah and gifford 1980 dunne et al 1991 decreased surface roughness cerdà 1997 ludwig et al 2005 weltz et al 1992 decreased canopy interception burgy and pomeroy 1958 thurow et al 1987 and degraded aggregate stability of the soil barthès and roose 2002 cantón et al 2009 holifield collins et al 2015 plot scale studies have played an important role in gaining understanding of hydrologic processes within these environments it has been widely reported that as vegetative cover decreases surface runoff and erosion rates increase within a rangeland environment nearing et al 2005 puigdefábregas 2005 rogers and schumm 1991 zuazo et al 2008 there is general agreement that a threshold of 30 50 grass cover is needed to significantly deter runoff and soil erosion in semiarid environments gutierrez and hernandez 1996 holifield collins et al 2015 pan and shangguan 2006 while plot scale experiments offer a great deal of control they lack representation of the complexities of the natural system in which they exist there is a growing need for information on the large scale ecohydrological effects of climate induced alterations of vegetation and precipitation regimes newman et al 2006 seyfried and wilcox 1995 scaling up in size from plot studies to catchment size studies introduces a more realistic representation of the ecological system with the heterogeneities in vegetation topography soil and climate represented however the large spatial extent and spatiotemporal heterogeneity of these regions have made monitoring and quantitatively assessing the large scale effects of these ecohydrological landscape changes a challenge hydrologic models are one practical tool for quantifying runoff and erosion rates in rangelands hernandez et al 2013 nearing et al 2011 modelling allows for relationships and processes observed at small scales to be extrapolated spatially and temporally to a larger scale enabling studies that may not be physically or economically feasible by traditional field methods nearing et al 1989 wainwright et al 2000 the ability to predict runoff and erosion using measurable biophysical model inputs provides land managers with scientifically based information for land management decisions the rangeland hydrology and erosion model rhem was developed specifically for hillslope scale use in rangeland environments adapting the central algorithms from the water erosion prediction project wepp model to the unique hydrologic characteristics of these semiarid regions hernandez et al 2017 nearing et al 2011 parameter estimation equations in rhem utilize physically quantifiable inputs including soil texture slope characteristics vegetation cover and ground cover al hamdan et al 2013 al hamdan et al 2017 hernandez et al 2017 these commonly measured inputs allow for intuitive simulation of vegetation or ground cover changes due to management or disturbance hernandez et al 2013 nouwakpo et al 2016a williams et al 2016a watershed scale modelling with rhem can be achieved by routing hillslope simulations through a network of channels using the kineros2 k2 model within the automated geospatial watershed assessment tool agwa geospatial environment ross 2013 the use of models in long term watershed scale hydrological monitoring is limited by the availability of corresponding vegetative data of sufficient spatiotemporal resolution for input while localized transect based vegetation measurements are appropriate for modelling at the hillslope scale these measurements are often prohibitive at the watershed scale due to time and cost constraints furthermore the existence of such data with historic or replicated measurements for long term monitoring or comparison purposes is sparse these data limitations are a key obstacle for large scale hydrologic modelling in arid and semiarid regions goodrich et al 2012 pilgrim et al 1988 seyfried and wilcox 1995 a common approach for watershed scale model parameterization is to associate literature based parameter values with land cover classes based on national land cover geospatial data sets e g the national land cover database nlcd and the north american lands change monitoring system nalcms goodrich et al 2012 hernandez et al 2000 miller et al 2002 niraula et al 2012 norman et al 2010 deriving detailed vegetative parameters from these sources can be problematic as land cover classes are often generalized across many plant communities and can cover large areas the use of satellite based remote sensing on rangelands has been shown effective for quantifying vegetative parameters including biomass leaf area index and foliar cover booth and tueller 2003 hunt et al 2003 qi et al 2002 wallace et al 2006 the landsat earth observing satellites are particularly appropriate for ecological monitoring and vegetation change detection at the regional or watershed scale vogelmann et al 2012 these data offer the necessary spatiotemporal and spectral resolution for characterizing vegetation typical of rangelands and capturing both long term trends and intra annual variability across large regions huete 1988 marsett et al 2006 purevdorj et al 1998 xie et al 2008 the release of a free landsat archive 1984 present to the public provides a cost effective easily obtainable resource for long term vegetation monitoring markham

grasslands tarantino et al 2016 detection of grazing effects and management practices in grasslands guo et al 2015 xu et al 2018 sibanda et al 2016 and identifying plant communities in rangelands villarreal et al 2016 the incorporation of remotely sensed data into spatially distributed hydrological models provides a means for model parameterization at large spatial scales and with improved temporal frequency spatially distributed watershed scale vegetative model inputs allow for a more realistic representation of the distribution and structure of vegetation that govern rangeland hydrology cadaret et al 2016 nouwakpo et al 2016b puigdefábregas 2005 williams et al 2016a additionally long term dynamic vegetative data records facilitate analyses of hydrologic response to landscape change and disturbance such as fire grazing and plant community alterations ebel and martin 2017 flerchinger et al 2016 park et al 2017 spaeth et al 2016 williams et al 2016b however uncertainty remains in how large scale spatial and temporal variability may affect model results seyfried and wilcox 1995 reynolds et al 2017 urban 2005 the goal of this research was to evaluate whether the inclusion of time varying landsat based foliar cover estimates improves runoff prediction within a rhem k2 modelling framework thus the specific objectives of the study were to 1 quantify watershed scale vegetation and ground cover for model parameterization and calibration of a remotely sensed foliar cover dataset 2 develop a 20 year time series of field calibrated landsat based foliar cover for the study area and 3 evaluate model performance for a default literature based parameterization approach versus three parameterization scenarios incorporating the remotely sensed vegetative estimates of varying temporal aggregation 2 methods 2 1 site description this research was conducted on the kendall grassland located within the usda agricultural research service ars walnut gulch experimental watershed wgew in southeastern arizona fig 1 the climate of the region is semiarid with a mean annual temperature of 18 c and mean annual precipitation of 315 mm 1961 2015 across the wgew approximately 65 of the annual precipitation occurs between july and september during the north american monsoon monsoon precipitation is dominated by high intensity spatially localized convective thunderstorms from which large amounts of runoff and flash flooding can occur winter precipitation is dominated by large scale low intensity frontal storms that generally do not produce surface runoff in the wgew the kendall subwatershed is located in the upper portion of the wgew 31 74 n 109 94 w the watershed has a drainage area of 0 02 km2 and average slope gradient of 12 3 the soils are an elgin 50 stronghold 40 complex with a fine gravelly sandy loam upper horizon and clay components below 2 5 cm breckenfeld et al 1995 the watershed drains into a densely vegetated swale near the outlet of the watershed through concentrated flow paths the swale serves as a deposition zone at which increased infiltration and sediment storage occur nearing et al 2005 kendall is instrumented with a weighing type rain gauge v notch weir pump sediment sampler and meteorological station with delta t thetaprobe soil moisture sensors at 5 and 15 cm depth goodrich et al 2008 keefer et al 2008 nichols et al 2008 stone et al 2008a the vegetation of the watershed has historically been dominated by native bunchgrasses scott et al 2010 following an extended period of drought many of the native grasses and shrubs died in 2006 and were replaced with forbs since then the watershed has been dominated by the invasive bunchgrass eragrostis lehmanniana lehmann lovegrass the main period of vegetative productivity occurs from july october in response to warm temperatures and monsoon precipitation a short growth period for annual grasses and forbs may occur in early spring if winter precipitation is sufficient 2 2 methods workflow overview the following sections describe the process in which a field calibrated remotely sensed foliar cover dataset was generated and integrated into the hydrologic model for precipitation runoff simulations fig 2 2 3 landsat image acquisition multispectral imagery from landsat 5 thematic mapper tm 1984 2012 landsat 7 enhanced thematic mapper plus etm 1999 2015 and landsat 8 operational land imager oli 2013 present were used in this study this series of satellites was designed to provide a continuous series of multispectral earth observations for global land surface monitoring at a spatial resolution of 30 m ground measured distance markham and helder 2012 the satellites have a repeat cycle of sixteen days with each satellite in orbit offset by 8 days e g tm and etm or etm and oli the definition of spectral bands varies slightly between satellites but the data series can largely be considered continuous if atmospheric corrections are applied bryant et al 2003 roy et al 2014 surface reflectance data were used to minimize some of these differences and allow for time series analysis flood 2014 no adjustments or calibration between satellites were performed and data obtained from the three satellites were considered to be a continuous data series in this study cloud free landsat surface reflectance scenes 1996 2015 were acquired between april and december for world reference system wrs 2 path 36 row 38 through the united states geological survey usgs earthexplorer http earthexplorer usgs gov and google earth engine http earthengine google com tm and etm surface reflectance products were processed using the landsat ecosystem disturbance adaptive processing system ledaps method masek et al 2006 the oli surface reflectance product was calculated using the provisional landsat surface reflectance code lasrc vermote et al 2016 all etm scenes were visually screened for the presence of scan line correction data gaps in the region immediately surrounding kendall the images were subsequently archived into a time series of surface reflectance scenes over the study domain 2 4 field data collection ten transects were established across kendall to monitor vegetative and ground cover over the course of the 2015 growing season transects were arranged within 3 60 m 60 m sampling blocks designed to register with four landsat pixels fig 3 each sampling block contained three 80 m transects the transects spanned the length of two landsat pixels 60 m with 10 m of extra length at each end to account for gps error transect locations were logged using a handheld gps device with 5 m accuracy two by two pixel sized blocks were chosen as the sampling area to compensate for uncertainty in registration during ground validation congalton 1991 stehman and czaplewski 1998 foliar cover and ground cover were measured at 0 5 m intervals along each transect using the line point intercept method herrick et al 2005 canopy hits were classified by plant life form as grass shrub or forb as well as senescent or green ground cover hits were classified as bare soil rock litter or basal area by life form senescent or green eight iterations of transect measurements were conducted between april 22 2015 and october 28 2015 on kendall four additional transect locations wg1 4 within wgew were measured in grassland areas with sparse cover surrounding kendall for use in landsat calibration fig 1 one transect block at each of these sites was measured between december 2 2015 and december 7 2015 the collection dates at all sites were designed to fall between landsat 7 and landsat 8 satellite overpasses to maximize the potential for acquiring a cloud free satellite image with close proximity to ground measurements for calibration table 1 2 5 development of landsat based foliar cover three vegetation indices were calculated and evaluated for foliar cover estimation from the acquired landsat surface reflectance scenes the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi the soil adjusted vegetation index savi and the soil adjusted total vegetation index satvi ndvi is a commonly used vegetation index used for measuring green or photosynthetically active vegetation calculated as 1 ndvi ρ nir ρ red ρ nir ρ red where ρ nir is surface reflectance in the near infrared band and ρ red is surface reflectance in the red band this vegetation index functions under the premise that live green vegetation absorbs energy in the red wavelengths and reflects in the near infrared nir lengths tucker 1979 however when used in areas with sparse vegetative cover soil reflectance from the underlying soil can inflate the index values erroneously huete 1988 savi incorporates a soil adjustment factor l to account for this phenomenon and is calculated as 2 savi ρ nir ρ red ρ nir ρ red l 1 l where ρ nir is surface reflectance in the near infrared band ρ red is surface reflectance in the red band and l is the soil adjustment factor by varying the l factor between 0 high vegetation density and 1 low vegetation density the vegetation index can be calibrated to minimize the effect of background soil reflectance huete 1988 an l factor of 0 5 was used here representing moderate vegetative cover while ndvi and savi are measures of green vegetation satvi is a measure of both green and senescent vegetation marsett et al 2006 satvi is calculated as 3 satvi ρ s w i r 1 ρ red ρ s w i r 1 ρ red l 1 l ρ s w i r 2 2 where ρ s w i r 1 is surface reflectance in the first shortwave infrared band ρ s w i r 2 is surface reflectance in the second shortwave infrared band ρ red is surface reflectance in the red band and l is the soil adjustment factor linear regression analyses were performed between the total foliar cover green and senescent measured in the kendall and wgew blocks and the vegetation index images corresponding with the ground measurement dates table 1 to establish if any significant relationships existed hagen et al 2012 marsett et al 2006 a spatial average of vegetation index values was calculated for the four landsat pixels intersecting each study block for use in the regression analysis the strength of correlation for each regression was evaluated using the coefficient of determination r2 mean absolute error mae and root mean squared error rmse a time series of total foliar cover values fcrs including green and senescent vegetation was then produced by applying the best performing vegetation index versus foliar cover relationship to the landsat vegetation index data set in addition to foliar cover basal and litter cover are required inputs for parameterizing the model however in this environment it is difficult to discern these values using downward looking remotely sensed data therefore allometric relationships were developed from the transect data to estimate litter and basal cover from foliar cover values a data set was compiled of foliar litter and basal cover values from each transect block kendall and wgew on all collection dates n 28 regression analysis was conducted between foliar cover and basal cover and foliar cover and litter cover the resulting eqs 4 and 5 were used to estimate basal bcrs and litter lcrs cover from fcrs 4 bc rs 0 37 f c rs 0 18 5 lc rs 0 25 f c rs 14 04 2 6 hydrologic modelling environment a suite of models and tools were used to conduct the precipitation runoff simulations in this study the following section briefly describes the tools used and how they were incorporated into the simulation

simulating interception infiltration surface runoff and erosion for small agricultural rangeland and urban watersheds goodrich et al 2012 miller et al 2007 smith et al 1995 watersheds in k2 are represented as a network of geometrically simplified one dimensional flow elements hortonian overland flow elements are represented as rectangular planes or curvilinear surfaces over which runoff is routed into trapezoidal channel elements that cascade to the outlet of the watershed infiltration is modeled using the smith and parlange 1978 approximation and kinematic wave equations are used for overland and channel flow rainfall can be distributed across elements from multiple gauges and unique parameter sets can be applied to each of the elements allowing for representation of spatial heterogeneity in the watershed miller et al 2007 k2 was used in this study to route surface runoff from multiple hillslope simulations through a channel network to the outlet of the kendall watershed

parameterization model execution and visualization of results the gis environment provided the ability to distribute geospatial and remotely sensed data across discrete model elements representing the

al 2017 nearing et al 2011 rhem v2 3 is available for use as a web based decision support tool http apps tucson ars ag gov rhem and is incorporated into agwa to work in conjunction with k2 used for channel routing to perform watershed scale simulation the hydrology component of rhem is similar to k2 but incorporates unique parameterization equations that utilize quantifiable measures of vegetative and ground cover across multiple vegetative communities e g foliar cover litter cover basal cover rock cover and cryptogam cover rhem was developed for use at the hillslope scale as a soil loss estimation tool for use specifically on rangelands 2 7 model parameterization a unique set of model parameters was created for each rainfall runoff event additionally four parameterization scenarios were evaluated in which a default parameterization in agwa was compared to three fcrs based scenarios at varying temporal resolutions the parameterization procedure within agwa used to create the default scenario is outlined in sections 2 7 1 2 7 3 modifications to this procedure using the remotely sensed data to produce the fcrs based scenarios are discussed in section 2 8 2 7 1 hydrologic inputs and storm selection twenty six runoff producing rainfall events occurring in july august and september were used for simulation and validation precipitation breakpoint data measured at wgew raingage 82 were input into rhem k2 for each event since the model does not have an inter storm component an estimate of the pre storm initial relative soil saturation si is required to quantify the antecedent soil moisture goodrich et al 1994 si was calculated using volumetric water content vwc measurements from the soil moisture sensors located at 5 cm depth near the meteorological station at the beginning of each event soil moisture data were not available prior to 1996 which limited the study to the years 1996 2015 gauged runoff volume and peak flow rate data measured by a v notch weir at the outlet of the watershed wgew weir 112 were associated with each precipitation event and used as model validation criteria only storms in which the ratio of runoff to precipitation was greater than 5 were used for simulation table 2 these data are available from the usda ars southwest watershed research center via a web interface at http www tucson ars ag gov dap 2 7 2 watershed delineation and discretization the delineation of the kendall watershed boundary was performed with the agwa watershed delineation tool using a lidar based 0 5 m dem and the point location of the outlet of the sub watershed at weir 112 the watershed was then broken into discreet hillslope and channel reach elements using the agwa discretization tool default channel element width and depth are estimated in agwa using empirical hydraulic geometry relationships as a function of contributing area for the top and bottom of each channel reach miller et al 2007 the initial agwa calculated channel widths at the top and bottom of each reach were refined with field measured data the user defined pour points option was used in agwa to describe the channel network and create the watershed elements this method allows the user to manually set the initiation points of channels and subdivide channel reaches with different characteristics using gis point features channel initiation points where placed at the beginning of two main channels that drain into the vegetated swale at the base of the watershed internal pour points were placed at the initiation of the swale to separate the two main upland channels from the channel in the swale the channel within the swale was further subdivided to represent changes in soil type and channel width based on the definition of these pour points the watershed was broken up into hillslope elements that contributed to each channel reach fig 4 2 7 3 initial model parameterization once the watershed was split into discrete elements the initial model parameterization for each element was conducted using the agwa parameterization tool this tool requires the input of geospatial layers representing soils data land cover classification elevation and vegetation life form and cover rhem only the resulting parameter file generated from these data sets provided the necessary watershed parameters to execute the rhem k2 model soils data were obtained from the nrcs soil survey geographic database ssurgo the ssurgo spatial map was intersected with the watershed to obtain the spatial distribution of soil types agwa determines a soil texture for each hillslope element from the ssurgo tabular data using a weighting scheme based on spatial distribution of soils within an element proportion of soil components within a complex and soil horizons to 22 9 cm depth miller et al 2007 the textural classification usda of the soil across kendall was described as a sandy clay loam composed of 46 7 sand 23 0 silt and 30 3 clay this texture was applied to all hillslope elements soil parameters including saturated hydraulic conductivity kb percent rock suction head and porosity were estimated based upon the soil texture classification using pedo transfer functions lookup tables and algorithms within agwa hernandez et al 2017 rawls et al 1982 rawls et al 1998 channel elements are given default soil characteristic and hydraulic roughness parameters values based upon the assumption of a sandy bed this assumption produces high transmission losses within the channel miller et al 2007 the two upland channels were not incised and no noticeable change in soil texture or vegetation composition from the adjacent hillslopes was seen therefore the same soil texture used for adjacent hillslope elements was applied to these channel elements the channel reaches in the swale region contained large amounts of coarse sediment deposition creating a sandy upper horizon the soil texture for these reaches was left defined as a sand soil texture class land cover classification was defined using the 2011 national land cover database nlcd the nlcd is a landsat derived land cover classification map covering the conterminous united states each 30 m pixel is classified as one of sixteen land cover classes consistent with previous nlcd releases homer et al 2015 a lookup table in agwa associates a literature based foliar cover value in this case 25 and an associated interception depth parameter value with each land cover class canopy interception in in rhem k2 is reflected as the average depth of rainfall captured by the vegetation on a hillslope the in parameter is calculated by reducing the rainfall rate by the cover fraction based on percent foliar cover fcrs in this study until the amount retained reaches the user defined maximum interception depth smith et al 1995 this value was applied to all hillslope elements plant community foliar basal litter rock and cryptogamic cover values are needed to calculate the effective saturated hydraulic conductivity ke and the darcy friction factor f t parameters in rhem the ke parameter modifies the initial estimate of saturated hydraulic conductivity kb based on soil texture as outlined above to account for the effects of increased infiltration with an increase of vegetative cover or change in composition hernandez et al 2017 nearing et al 2011 the ke parameter is calculated as 6 k e i k b i e p i l i t t e r b a s a l where kbi is the 25 percentile saturated hydraulic conductivity for each soil textural class i p is the natural log of the ratio of the 75 to the 25 percentile values of saturated hydraulic conductivity litter is percent litter cover and basal is percent basal cover hernandez et al 2017 this parameter is further adjusted by applying a multiplier based on the dominant plant life form e g bunch grass 1 0 sod grass 0 8 forbs 1 0 shrub 1 2 the f t parameter represents hydraulic roughness in rhem it incorporates ground cover and slope measurements and has been shown to be negatively correlated with bare ground with basal cover being the most influential ground cover factor al hamdan et al 2015 the f t parameter is calculated as 7 log f t 0 109 1 425 l i t t e r 0 442 r o c k 1 764 b a s a l c r y p t o 2 068 s where litter is the fraction of area covered by litter to total area m2 m 2 rock is the fraction of area covered by rock cover to total area m2 m 2 basal crypto is the fraction of area covered by basal plus cryptogam cover to total area m2 m 2 and s is slope m m 1 al hamdan et al 2015 the plant life form group for kendall was defined as bunch grass dominated determined from field observations transect measured rock cover was applied to individual elements based on the element s proximity to a given transect and remained static for all simulations cryptogam cover did not exist in the watershed and was assigned a null value basal and litter cover were calculated by applying eqs 4 and 5 to the foliar cover value obtained from the nlcd lookup table this set of parameters defined using agwa and the literature based foliar cover value served as the a prioi parameterization scenario scenario 1 for all precipitation runoff simulations additional model calibrations were performed using the remotely sensed data wherein the foliar cover value used in scenario 1 was replaced with landsat based fcrs values the intrinsic characteristics of the watershed e g topography watershed geometry porosity were left as static values for all event simulations however the in ke and f t parameters in rhem k2 were altered using fcrs and the derived bcrs and lcrs data 2 8 model parameterization integrating remotely sensed foliar cover three additional parameterization scenarios were developed using the fcrs time series the three fcrs based scenarios scenarios 2 4 were designed to evaluate the effects of temporal variability of foliar cover on model performance as well as to assess the value of spatially localized data in comparison to scenario 1 foliar cover values were calculated for each hillslope element by using a weighted average of all intersecting 30 m landsat pixels within the boundary of the element basal and litter cover were calculated using eqs 4 and 5 using the mean foliar cover value from each hillslope element these values were then input into the rhem parameterization eqs 6 and 7 to calculate ke and f t and the foliar cover value was applied to in the remaining static parameters for each hillslope and channel element were calculated as outlined in the previous section scenario 2 was based on a long term mean foliar cover value from 1996 to 2015 representing the assumption that foliar cover during the growing season remained constant over time the mean of fcrs values between july and september of each year were calculated the mean of these values was then calculated resulting in a static long term estimate of foliar cover for the study period the long term mean was calculated in this fashion in order to minimize the influence of the varying number of images available during the monsoon period each year this calculation was performed for each landsat pixel intersecting kendall resulting in a spatially distributed grid of foliar cover values scenario 3 was based on an annually varying mean foliar cover value representing the assumption that foliar cover remained constant during any given monsoon season but varied between years this value was determined by taking the mean of all fcrs values between july and september of each year this resulted in a dynamic series of 15 annual foliar cover grids that were then associated with all precipitation events that occurred in that year scenario 4 was the most temporally localized of the three fcrs based scenarios fcrs values acquired within the closest temporal proximity to a selected precipitation event were associated with that event no fcrs images were acquired more than 10 days before or after a given precipitation event 2 9 model execution and performance evaluation rhem k2 precipitation runoff simulations were executed for all selected events table 2 using the four parameterization scenarios runoff volume and peak flow rate for all storms were evaluated as a lumped data set including the values from all 26 simulated events the rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr and percent bias pbias were the performance metrics used in this study as outlined by moriasi et al 2007 rsr standardizes the rmse with the standard deviation of the observed data with an optimum value of 0 rsr is calculated as 8 rsr rmse stdev obs i 1 n y i obs y i sim 2 i 1 n y i obs y mean obs 2 where y i obs is the ith observation of the measured data y i sim is the ith observation of the simulated data and y mean obs is the mean of the observed data moriasi et al 2007 pbias is a measure of the tendency of a model to over or under estimate values compared to the observed data gupta et al 1999 pbias is calculated as 9 pbias i 1 n y i obs y i sim 100 i 1 n y i obs where y i obs is the ith observation of the measured data and y i sim is the ith observation of the simulated data the optimal value of pbias is 0 with values of lower magnitude representing more accurate simulation positive values indicate a model underestimation bias and negative values indicate a model overestimation bias 3 results and discussion 3 1 field based characterization of the watershed the invasive eragrostis lehmanniana lehmann lovegrass was the dominant species measured within all kendall transect blocks 68 of watershed vegetation other species with notable presence were hilaria belangeri steud nash curly mesquite grass 14 calliandra eriophylla benth fairyduster 3 bouteloua curtipendula michx torr sideoats grama 3 acacia constricta benth whitethorn acacia 2 and pleuraphis mutica buckley tobosagrass 2 all other species present represented less than one percent of the total vegetative composition and were comprised of annual forbs perennial grasses shrubs and cactus composition for the three study blocks were similar with lehmann lovegrass dominating the composition followed by native grasses shrubs and forbs the vegetative composition within the swale differed slightly from the uplands in the watershed with a greater amount of annual forbs 17 and less native grass 4 compared to 2 and 22 respectively in the uplands foliar cover on kendall mean value of block 1 block 2 and block 3 ranged from 63 on 6 22 2015 to 82 on 9 28 2015 fig 5 the annual mean foliar cover on kendall spanning the growing season was 73 s 6 lehmann lovegrass inflorescences were first observed on 8 14 2015 and were widespread by the 8 28 2015 collection date the large panicle inflorescences mainly accounted for the increased measure of foliar cover seen in august and early september the three kendall blocks and the swale transect maintained similar foliar cover values throughout the collection period while total foliar cover remained relatively stable over the course of the growing season the green and senescent components showed greater variability the vegetation was predominantly senescent until the 7 24 2014 collection date fig 5 green vegetation during this period was composed of annual forbs and lehmann lovegrass vegetation greenness responded to the onset of monsoon precipitation occurring in late june greenness stabilized with intermittent rainfall and peaked after a large pulse of precipitation in early september consistently elevated green foliar cover values were observed in the swale transect due to the increased presence of forbs and improved plant available water from upland drainage basal cover was similar between all blocks and remained relatively constant over the collection period x 27 s 6 with only a slight increasing trend visible after the 6 22 2015 monitoring fig 6 the swale contained slightly lower basal cover values due to a high presence of forbs litter cover also remained relatively constant for the three kendall blocks with a slight decrease over the growing season x 33 s 4 fig 6 the swale contained significantly higher litter cover t test p 0 05 on all collection dates x 59 s 6 mean rock cover x 24 s 4 was significantly higher t test p 0 05 in the three study blocks than in the swale x 5 s 3 fig 6 foliar cover was the most dynamic variable with a slight increase in foliar cover near peak productivity caused by inflorescence growth however from a hydrological perspective this small change in foliar cover would only affect rainfall interception and have a minimum effect on surface runoff produced from high intensity monsoon rainfall the results also show the importance of sufficient spatial coverage of transect measurements for representing changes in soils and vegetation composition although little spatial variability was seen in the vegetative composition or ground cover measurements in the uplands of the watershed significant differences were seen in the swale increased litter and decreased rock cover as well as altered vegetative composition in the swale indicated that different hydrologic properties exist in this portion of the watershed and need to be accounted for in runoff simulation as ke and f t eqs 6 and 7 are functions of these rhem inputs field measured basal and litter cover remained relatively static over the course of the 2015 growing season while foliar cover was more dynamic application of eqs 4 and 5 at a sub annual frequency could introduce unrealistic fluctuations in the amount of basal and litter cover to best represent the static nature of these vegetative components a mean annual value or singular value taken near peak productivity is recommended 3 2 landsat based foliar cover calibration results from the regression analysis between the vegetation indices and field measured foliar cover indicated that satvi fig 7 was the best predictor of total foliar cover r2 0 85 rmse 5 37 and mae 4 60 compared to ndvi r2 0 66 rmse 8 10 and mae 6 61 and savi r2 0 57 rmse 9 07 and mae 7 38 this result is consistent with hagen et al 2012 which showed satvi to be the best performing vegetation index of those evaluated across western rangeland sites however the resulting eq 10 from the regression analysis differed from the broad scale rangeland equation developed in hagen et al 2012 which underestimated foliar cover in this localized grassland environment 10 fc rs 330 86 s a t v i 22 04 the regression analysis reinforces the observations from the intra annual vegetation measurements in that herbaceous vegetation within semiarid grasslands may only be green for a portion of the year therefore spectral remote sensing techniques must account for both green and senescent vegetation to accurately quantify total foliar cover greater uncertainty exists in fcrs values below 60 and above 80 as the dataset is largely composed of calibration data from the kendall blocks which fell within this dynamic range this relationship was developed using foliar cover values within a localized grassland community and therefore cannot be applied with a high degree of certainty to landscapes containing different plant communities 3 3 allometric relationships for basal and litter cover estimation the linear relationship between foliar and basal cover showed significant r2 0 57 p 0 05 correlation fig 8 the relationship makes physical sense within this bunchgrass dominated vegetation community in that an increase of basal area would result in an increase in foliar cover with zero basal cover resulting in approximately zero foliar cover b 0 18 the correlation between foliar and litter cover was weak but significant r2 0 29 p 0 05 fig 8 this relationship is generalized and is based on the assumption that with greater amounts of foliar cover a greater potential for litter cover exists the relationship ignores many complex physical and temporal factors that affect litter presence over time furthermore while the swale contained a significantly higher amount of litter than the uplands the equation shown in fig 8 was applied to all model elements for simplicity additional long term data collection is required to develop more robust models for these relationships however these simple relationships provide a conceptual foundation for research in this context moving forward 3 4 landsat based foliar cover time series the fcrs time series produced by the application of eq 10 is shown in fig 9 the lower image frequency occurring from 1996 to 1999 and in 2012 was the result of only one landsat satellite in orbit during that period better representation of phenology and periods of peak productivity were seen in the periods where two satellites were in orbit however high frequency variability between consecutive fcrs values was apparent in periods where foliar cover was below 60 this may be a result of differences between satellite measurements e g landsat 5 and landsat 7 or landsat 7 and landsat 8 or physical changes in vegetation or moisture content further research needs to be conducted to determine the source of this variability a cross platform calibration of bands would need to be done if the variability is sourced to differences in satellite measurements evidence of the drought induced vegetation change in which the watershed was occupied by forbs in 2006 and transitioned to a lehmann lovegrass dominated grassland can be seen in the fcrs time series fig 9 beginning in 2000 a succession of dry years with below average winter 2000 2003 and monsoon precipitation 2000 2005 and high temperatures occurred following a late flush of vegetation productivity in 1999 a decreasing trend in foliar cover was present reaching a low point of 40 in the spring of 2006 fig 9 this trend is consistent with observed reduced net ecosystem carbon uptake an indicator of lower productivity during these years emmerich 2003 scott et al 2010 despite above average monsoon precipitation from 2006 to 2008 native species did not fully recover were replaced with a flush of annual grasses and forbs in 2006 which was succeeded by lehmann lovegrass thereafter scott et al 2010 nine of the twenty six runoff events used in this study occurred during the 2006 monsoon precipitation intensities were not abnormally high for these events but runoff ratios were generally elevated during this period table 2 soil erosion resulting from these events accounted for 42 of the 19 year sediment loss record polyakov et al 2010 the coincidence of change in vegetation and the spike in runoff and sediment loss suggest a drastic change in watershed response minimum plant litter was measured in 2007 scott et al 2010 and the presence of annual vegetation allude to decreased basal cover during this period increased flow velocities and decreased infiltration rates can be expected from these conditions resulting in higher runoff and erosion while not as well documented as the vegetation die off in 2006 a similar response from extremely low to high fcrs values within a growing is shown in 1999 fig 9 historic composition data shows a spike in forb presence in 1999 similar to that of 2006 high annual forb cover and a decrease in fcrs leading up to 1999 suggest a similar period of grass die off further data collection needs to be conducted to validate fcrs during these periods of altered vegetation composition after 2006 a general increasing trend in foliar cover is present fig 9 lehmann lovegrass has largely dominated the watershed s vegetation since 2008 while the grass species present on the watershed have changed foliar cover appears to have returned to historic levels in the period from 2008 to 2015 only 8 significant runoff events occurred runoff ratio greater than 5 including 3 events in 2008 when the grass vegetation was dominated by seedlings table 2 the infrequency of runoff events in recent years and high foliar litter and basal cover measurements suggest that the watershed is hydrologically stable under this vegetative state 3 5 foliar cover input scenarios the remotely sensed foliar cover values based on fcrs scenarios 2 4 were higher than the nlcd based value scenario 1 of 25 in all cases fig 10 regardless of the temporal resolution the remotely sensed data more closely resembled that of the field measured data reinforcing the importance of spatially localized data the cover values shown in this section are based on a spatial average of all pixels within the domain of the watershed for discussion purposes scenario 2 long term mean of fcrs from 1996 to 2015 represented a static fcrs value of 65 and derived bcrs and lcrs values of 24 and 30 respectively compared to the corresponding values of 25 9 and 20 in scenario 1 these static values were applied to all 26 simulation events scenario 3 annual fcrs means showed improved representation of inter annual fluctuation compared to scenarios 1 and 2 and general trends in fcrs response to climatic variability were visible fcrs bcrs and lcrs values for scenario 3 ranged from 58 21 and 29 in 2006 to 73 27 and 32 in 2008 respectively phenological timing and image availability had a large impact on the annual fcrs means the timing of vegetation green up where fcrs values were largest was highly variable between years the annual mean fcrs value can be inflated if this green up occurs early due the inclusion of more high values in the calculation of the mean between july and september similarly the number of available cloud free images and the dates they are acquired can affect the annual mean fcrs value scenario 4 values fcrs value closest to the event date allow for representation of intra annual variability and may be higher or lower than scenarios 2 and 3 values within a given year the greatest variability of values associated with a runoff event occurred in 1999 fcrs bcrs and lcrs values ranged from 52 20 and 27 respectively on 7 16 1999 to 81 30 and 34 on 9 9 1999 the determination of bcrs and lcrs from fcrs for model parameterization using intra annual values may be problematic as unrealistic increases in these values could occur within a year contradicting the static nature of basal and litter cover the 2015 transect data suggested fig 5 3 6 runoff simulation and model evaluation the mean simulated runoff volume for the 26 event lumped data set was greater than that of the observed dataset but more accurate for the remotely sensed scenarios table 3 negative pbias in all cases indicated model over estimation of total runoff volume however smaller pbias values were shown in scenarios 2 3 than for scenario 1 113 27 with scenario 3 having the smallest pbias 50 33 rsr values were also improved using the remotely sensed data value with scenario 3 performing best 0 77 and scenario 1 performing the worst 0 95 moriasi et al 2007 suggest streamflow model evaluation criteria for satisfactory performance of 25 for pbias and 0 70 for rsr these values may be inappropriate for event based data but serve as a generalized benchmark here overall model accuracy measures were improved with the incorporation of fcrs with the best pbias and rsr values shown for scenario 3 table 3 agreement between the observed and simulated peak flow rates data sets were better than those for total runoff volume scenario 1 showed model overestimation with a simulated mean peak runoff rate of 25 72 mm hr compared to an observed mean of 16 43 mm hr and pbias of 56 56 table 3 the remotely sensed scenarios showed little bias with pbias values less than a magnitude of 5 with scenario 3 performing best 0 37 smaller rsr values for scenarios 1 3 indicated better model performance for scenarios 1 3 compared to scenario 1 0 83 with scenario 3 performing best 0 70 based on the performance metrics scenario 3 produced the best simulated peak runoff rate results slopes and intercepts for runoff volume and peak flow regressions were not shown to be significantly different ancova α 0 05 between the four scenarios fig 11 however relative improvement in rsr and pbias for both simulated runoff volume and peak flow were shown using the remotely sensed foliar cover inputs table 3 negligible differences in performance were seen between scenarios 2 4 based on the model performance metrics table 3 and the analysis of the field measured cover data it was concluded that annual implementation of fcrs scenario 3 was most appropriate for model parameterization the comparatively better results for peak flow rate infer that estimates of f t were better than those of saturated hydraulic conductivity ke in this watershed one factor that likely affected the overestimated runoff volume was the characterization of the swale the slope soil and ground cover in this area are different from the surrounding hillslopes years of sediment deposit in this shallow sloped region have produced a coarse sandy soil texture to depths of at least 1 m these conditions have allowed for altered vegetation and significantly higher litter content the soil texture in the swale channel elements were modified to represent a sandy texture within the model however improved localized soil data is needed to represent the heightened infiltration in this region of the watershed as soil textural data obtained from ssurgo soils maps may not represent the actual near surface soil texture on the kendall watershed these texture classes are the basis for deriving kb that is then modified by vegetation to calculate ke eq 6 furthermore the increased litter content seen in the swale transect was not reflected in the fcrs parameterization data which accounts for an underestimation of ke and overestimation of runoff volume hernandez et al 2017 further insight was gained when the simulation results were subset into vegetative life form groups i e forb dominated 1999 2007 and 2007 and grass dominated all other years for visualization purposes fig 11 increased model overestimation for runoff volume was seen in all scenarios for events that occurred when the watershed was grass dominated overestimation for grass dominated events was reduced with remotely sensed foliar cover input the overestimation of runoff occurring in grass dominated events suggests that ke is too low under grass dominated conditions and current soil texture distinct differences in the simulated peak flow rate were also seen between vegetation groups model overestimation of peak flow rates occurred for grass dominated events while underestimation was seen in forb dominated events peak flow rate is largely affected by f t which suggests that this parameter is too low under grass dominant conditions and too high under forb dominated conditions these results indicate that the satvi to foliar cover relationship and allometric relationships used to calculate basal and litter cover here should be modified to represent specific plant communities furthermore the allometric relationships between foliar cover and litter used here are rudimentary and need to be improved upon through additional data collection and research the ke and f t parameters are sensitive to these inputs and largely affect the model results improved understanding of these complex relationships would extend the value of the approach outlined in this research and could further improve model simulation results the ability to group the simulated runoff events by dominant vegetation was a luxury due to historic species monitoring on the watershed operationally this type of data may not be available the use of remotely sensed foliar cover estimates for the parameterization of rhem k2 improved simulation results compared to scenario 1 however results suggest that in addition to detecting the abundance of vegetation it is also necessary to detect the type of vegetation villarreal et al 2016 showed success in discerning annual forbs lehmann lovegrass and native grasses using ndvi and satvi implementation of a similar approach could further improve model parameterization by associating a plant community classification with fcrs values 4 conclusion the vegetative composition of the kendall grassland watershed in 2015 was dominated by the invasive lehmann lovegrass total foliar cover basal cover and litter cover values remained relatively stable throughout the course of the growing season high variability in green and senescent foliar cover was observed over the measurement period due to this fact the use of satvi was determined most appropriate for calibrating field measured foliar cover with landsat imagery due to its ability to detect green and senescent vegetation the resulting time series of remotely sensed foliar cover showed the ability to detect climate based alterations in vegetative cover based on a qualitative comparison the integrated rhem k2 model was parameterized using foliar cover values from four input scenarios the first scenario used a literature based value while the other three were based on the remotely sensed foliar cover values of different temporal representation improvement in model performance was seen when the model was parameterized using the remotely sensed data for runoff volume and peak flow rate temporal resolution long term annual and sub annual had negligible effect on the simulated values however based on the static nature of field observations of foliar basal and litter cover over a growing season and slightly better model performance the annual mean value of fcrs scenario 3 was selected as the optimum parameterization scheme these results highlighted the importance of spatially localized vegetation data for model parameterization a well documented change in vegetation on kendall occurred during the period of simulated events the vegetation transitioned from native grass dominated to forb dominated to its current state of invasive grass dominated runoff volume for grass dominated events were over predicted by the model to a greater extent than the forb dominated events similarly simulated peak flow rate was overestimated for grass dominated events and underestimated for forb dominated events these results emphasize the importance of not only quantifying the abundance of vegetation but also the type of vegetation future research should focus on expanding on the methodologies outlined here to address different vegetation communities the development of community specific vegetation relationships between the vegetation index and foliar cover as well as improved basal and litter cover estimates could provide better parameter estimates however classification of vegetation communities using remotely sensed data will be required for operational implementation of these improvements the research presented in this study provides a framework for the parameterization of the rhem k2 model using landsat based estimates for required vegetative inputs while model performance metrics were lower than desired this methodology shows improvement over the default method of associating literature based values with geospatial land cover classes furthermore no parameter optimization or use of calibrated multipliers were used to refine parameter estimates this allows for improved operational use when data is scarce this methodology shows the potential for long term change analysis at the watershed scale and may be especially useful for detecting
