21305,this paper integrates the effects of pile installation reconsolidation pile loading and soil ageing into an analytical framework to predict the long term setup of a displacement pile in clay the increase of mean effective stress and the decrease of void ratio of surrounding clay during reconsolidation and soil ageing are determined to quantify the changes in undrained shear strength and shear modulus which are the two key soil parameters controlling load carrying behaviours of piles the bearing capacity factors and load transfer curves are developed by incorporating the developed soil parameters the analytical framework is then proposed and validated by predicting a well documented pile field test good agreements between the analytical results and the measured data demonstrate that the pile setup can be reasonably predicted by the proposed framework comprehensive parametric studies are conducted to investigate the influences of overconsolidation ratio secondary compression index and pile loading on the pile setup the results indicate that a displacement pile in clay with a smaller overconsolidation ratio or a larger secondary compression index or subjected to a larger load exhibits a larger long term bearing capacity keywords setup reconsolidation soil ageing displacement pile overconsolidation ratio secondary compression index 1 introduction an interesting phenomenon that the axial bearing capacity of a displacement pile in clay increases with the elapse of time after its installation has been recognized by many geotechnical researchers and practitioners which is well denoted as pile setup pile setup is mainly caused by recovery of strength and stiffness of surrounding clay due to the reconsolidation e g randolph et al 1979 ng et al 2012 and soil ageing e g tavenas and audy 1972 schmertmann 1991 incorporating setup into the design of displacement piles can undoubtedly help save construction costs through reducing the number or dimension of required piles in addition accurate prediction of pile setup is of great significance to estimate the load carrying behaviour of existing displacement piles and to further utilize them to construct pile foundation via being mixed with new piles for rehabilitating or constructing buildings up to now field tests have been widely conducted by researchers to explore the setup of a displacement pile in clay e g konrad and roy 1987 bullock et al 2005a b ng et al 2012 chen et al 2014 haque et al 2014 from the well documented results of field tests many empirical equations were developed to predict the post installation increase in the axial bearing capacity of displacement piles the semilogarithmic empirical relationship proposed by skov and denver 1988 is one of the milestones of these empirical equations however these empirical equations had limitations because they were derived based on the field tests in the specific geological conditions on the other hand field tests are expensive and time consuming especially when the pile setup is taken into consideration because such investigations require the field tests lasting for several years or even decades which make the tests quite difficult to realize the finite element simulation apart from field tests has been served as another approach to explore the setup of a displacement pile in clay e g titi and wathugala 1999 whittle and sutabutr 1999 abu farsakh et al 2015 since a variety of complicated factors such as pile installation reconsolidation as well as soil ageing can be incorporated into the modeling process however some of the finite element simulations utilized the soil properties obtained from laboratory tests on undisturbed soil samples while significant changes in mechanical properties of surrounding clay have been induced due to the great disturbance in the soil structure caused by pile installation therefore these simulations are unable to predict the actual time dependent axial bearing capacity of displacement piles in addition the finite element simulations are limited in their wide applicability since one finite element model can just serve for one geotechnical engineering project if different projects need to be simulated the finite element model may need to be rebuilt from scratch as a result it is difficult to build a general framework through finite element simulations to investigate the setup of displacement piles with different dimensions under different geological conditions the objective of this paper is to present a general analytical framework to predict the long term setup of a displacement pile in clay the changes occurring in the two key soil parameters undrained shear strength and shear modulus of surrounding clay at different phases including installation reconsolidation pile loading as well as soil ageing are quantified and incorporated into the proposed analytical framework the installation effect is modeled by an anisotropic cavity expansion and the generated excess pore water pressure immediately after pile installation is determined based on the solution of cavity expansion the radial consolidation theory with a variable coefficient of consolidation is employed to model the reconsolidation of surrounding clay the soil ageing is represented by means of defining the quasi overconsolidation ratio these effects are then integrated and incorporated into the undrained shear strength and shear modulus based on which the bearing capacity factors and load transfer curves are developed to predict the pile setup the proposed framework is validated by predicting a well documented pile field test which was carried out for exploring the long term loading carrying behaviour of a displacement pile parametric studies are conducted to investigate the effects of overconsolidation ratio ocr secondary compression index and magnitude of pile loading on the long term pile setup 2 changes in mechanical properties of surrounding clay 2 1 definitions of significant soil parameters the undrained shear strength of in situ clay s u 0 under a conventional triaxial compression test can be defined as wood 1990 1 s u 0 1 2 m p 0 ocr 2 λ where ocr is the overconsolidation ratio p 0 is the initial mean effective stress m is the slope of critical state line equal to 6 sin ϕ 3 sin ϕ ϕ is the effective internal friction angle and λ represents the plastic volumetric strain ratio defined as λ 1 κ λ and κ and λ represent the slopes of swelling and compression lines in the e ln p plane respectively the shear modulus of in situ clay can be defined as sun et al 2004 2 g 3 1 2 v υ p 2 1 v κ where v is the effective poisson s ratio and υ 1 e is the specific volume the pile setup mainly results from the recovery in strength and stiffness of surrounding clay which is caused by the effects of reconsolidation and soil ageing although both effects simultaneously contribute to the pile setup it is unnecessary to consider both the effects together in the same phase because during reconsolidation the dissipation of excess pore water pressure dominates the recovery of strength and stiffness of surrounding clay while the effect of soil ageing is negligible augustesen 2006 bullock et al 2005 during soil ageing the situation is reversed therefore it can be assumed that the soil ageing occurs primarily after reconsolidation see fig 1 to simplify the analytical analysis in this study the similar assumption has also been suggested by other researchers e g ladd et al 1977 mesri and choi 1985 augustesen 2006 2 2 pile installation and dissipation of excess pore water pressure the surrounding soil is displaced predominantly outward during pile installation the strain field generated by pile installation in the surrounding clay resembles the strain field determined from the cavity expansion theory the rationality of which has been verified by randolph et al 1979 and randolph 2003 besides the cavity expansion theory can provide a closed form solution for predicting the radial stress and the excess pore water pressure in the surrounding clay therefore an anisotropic cavity expansion solution li et al 2016 which employs the k 0 based anisotropic modified cam clay model is adopted to model the process of pile installation the notation k 0 denotes the coefficient of earth pressure at rest the reason for adopting the anisotropic solution of cavity expansion is that natural clays generally consolidate in the k 0 condition and show the initial stress anisotropy and the initial stress induced anisotropy and the adopted anisotropic solution can well capture these two anisotropies following the solution of cavity expansion in k 0 consolidated clay proposed by li et al 2016 the excess pore water pressure induced by pile installation can be given as 3 u 0 r p 0 k 0 2 k 0 1 ocr 2 λ 1 3 p 0 η y 1 2 χ ln 3 g 0 p 0 η y r p r 2 1 4 q f 2 3 χ 2 6 where η y is the relative stress ratio at the boundary of plastic zone developed around the pile equal to ocr 1 m 2 3 1 k 0 2 k 0 1 2 the parameter χ is defined as p f 4 m 2 9 2 1 k 0 2 k 0 1 2 3 r p is the pile radius and p f and q f are the mean effective stress and the deviator stress at the critical state respectively which can be given as 4 p f p 0 ocr 2 λ 5 q f m p 0 ocr 2 λ after pile installation the induced excess pore water pressure mainly dissipates in the radial direction which is depicted in fig 2 this dissipation process can be properly modeled by the classical terzaghi s theory of consolidation the governing equation can be written as 6 1 1 e 0 e t k γ w 1 r r r u t where e 0 is the initial void ratio k is the permeability coefficient and γ w is the unit weight of water the general solution of eq 6 can be obtained based on the variable separation method as follows gong et al 2017 7 u 1 j r t n 1 a n j 0 λ n r j 1 λ n r p y 1 λ n r p y 0 λ n r e λ n 2 c h 1 j t where j 0 and j 1 are the first kind bessel functions of first order and second order respectively y 0 and y 1 are the second kind bessel functions of first order and second order respectively j represents the j th small interval of total dissipation time λ n are the eigenvalues of bessel function and c h is a variable coefficient of consolidation which can be expressed as 8 c h c h 0 p 0 α p t α where c h 0 is the initial coefficient of consolidation for radial horizontal drainage and α is a dimensionless factor the coefficient a n in eq 7 can be obtained based on the orthogonality of bessel function as 9 a n r p r y u 0 r v 0 λ n r r d r r p r v 0 2 λ n r r d r where r y is the radius of plastic zone developed around the displacement pile and the expression of v 0 λ n r is 10 v 0 λ n r j 0 λ n r j 1 λ n r p y 1 λ n r p y 0 λ n r during pile installation a critical state zone is developed around the displacement pile where the mean effective stress of surrounding clay remains constant and always equals the mean effective stress at the critical state p f after pile installation the mean effective stress of surrounding clay p t increases from the mean effective stress at the critical state p f with the dissipation of excess pore water pressure which leads to the increase in undrained shear strength of surrounding clay because the relaxation effect exists in the process of reconsolidation randolph and wroth 1979a the excess pore water pressure is unable to fully transform into the increase of mean effective stress hence an effective stress transfer parameter ξ proposed by randolph and wroth 1979a is adopted here to consider the relaxation effect after taking the relaxation effect into consideration the mean effective stress of surrounding clay during reconsolidation can be calculated based on the principle of effective stress as 11 p t p f ξ u 0 u t where 12 ξ p 0 u 0 3 ocr 5 1 2 k 0 ln 1 5 1 2 k 0 3 ocr u 0 p 0 due to the rearrangement of remolded soil particles the surrounding clay also regains its strength with time after pile installation this phenomenon is referred to as thixotropy abu farsakh et al 2015 and occurs no matter whether the surrounding clay is subjected to reconsolidation to consider the thixotropic effect a time dependent parameter β t is introduced and defined as abu farsakh et al 2015 13 β t β β β 0 e t τ where β represents that the surrounding clay regains its strength from the disturbed state for a quite long time after pile installation and its value can be taken as 1 β 0 is a reduction parameter denoting the stress state of surrounding clay immediately after pile installation equal to 0 75 abu farsakh et al 2015 and τ is a time constant assumed as the time for 90 dissipation of excess pore water pressure the surrounding clay suffers from the strong remolding effects during pile installation including the collapse of soil structure and the erasing of stress history the remolding effects lead to the surrounding clay exhibiting the mechanical properties similar to the normally consolidated clay after pile installation randolph and wroth 1981 yao et al 2009 thus the overconsolidation ratio of surrounding clay can be taken as unity correspondingly the undrained shear strength of surrounding clay after pile installation can be expressed as 14 s u 1 2 m p 1 2 λ through substituting eqs 11 and 13 into eq 14 the time dependent undrained shear strength of surrounding clay after pile installation which appropriately incorporates the effects of pile installation reconsolidation and thixotropy can be determined as follows 15 s u t m 1 2 λ 1 p 0 ocr 2 λ ξ δ u t β t in the e log p plane the relationship between the void ratio and the mean effective stress can be written as 16 e e 0 c c log p p 0 where c c is the compression index and represents the slope of compression curve in the e log p plane substituting eq 11 into eq 2 along with the substitution of eqs 4 7 and 16 the time dependent shear modulus of surrounding clay after pile installation can be expressed as 17 g t 3 1 2 v 1 e 0 c c log ocr 2 λ ξ δ u t p 0 p 0 ocr 2 λ ξ δ u t 2 1 v κ 2 3 soil ageing as shown in fig 3 the loading of the displacement pile gives rise to the decrease in the void ratio of surrounding clay from point a to point b in addition the void ratio of surrounding clay decreases with the elapse of time due to the effects of soil ageing from point b to point c although the mean effective stress of surrounding clay remains constant both the decreases in void ratio lead to the surrounding clay showing more stable structure and exhibiting the quasi overconsolidated behaviour to account for this quasi overconsolidated behaviour the secondary relations built based on the bjerrum s theory of time dependent compression bjerrum 1967 and developed by garlanger 1972 is adopted to describe the decrease of void ratio resulting from the pile loading and the soil ageing the expression can be specifically written as 18 e t e 0 c c log lr c α log t t r e t t r e where c α is the secondary compression index t r e is the reference time which here should be denoted as the end time of the dissipation of excess pore water pressure and lr 1 is defined as the loading parameter and equal to σ z p σ z t r e where σ z p is the vertical effective stress of surrounding clay when an axial load is applied to the pile head the loading parameter can well reflect the magnitude of pile loading as a larger loading parameter corresponds to a larger load applied to the pile head to better describe the quasi overconsolidated behaviour of clay a parameter called quasi overconsolidation ratio r is defined as the ratio of quasi preconsolidation pressure to the initial mean effective stress p c q p 0 according to the relationship in the e ln p plane the decrease of void ratio can be also determined as 19 δ e e e 0 λ ln p c q p t r e substituting eq 19 into eq 18 the quasi overconsolidation ratio can be obtained as 20 r t exp c c λ log lr c α λ log t t r e t t r e combining eqs 15 and 20 as well as combining 17 and eq 20 the time dependent undrained shear strength and shear modulus of surrounding clay which incorporates the effects of soil ageing can be given as follows 21 s u t 1 2 λ 1 m r t p 0 ocr 2 λ ξ δ u t r e β t t t r e 22 g t 3 1 2 v r t p 0 ocr 2 λ ξ δ u t r e 1 e 0 c c log lr c α e log t t r 2 1 v κ t t r e 3 time dependent axial bearing capacity fig 4 shows the stress state of a soil element adjacent to the pile shaft when the pile is subjected to an axial load randolph and wroth 1981 indicates that the shearing state of a soil element adjacent to the pile shaft can be equivalent to that in a simple shear test hence the unit shaft resistance of a displacement pile f s can be developed in terms of the undrained shear strength under the plane strain condition s u p as li et al 2017a 23 f s τ y x s u p cos ϕ note that the undrained shear strength defined by eq 1 is obtained under conventional triaxial compression tests and is different from the undrained shear strength under the plain strain condition because of its intrinsic three dimensional mechanical properties therefore the stress transformed method combined with the smp criterion presented by matsuoka et al 1999 is adopted to develop the relationship between the undrained shear strength under the plane strain condition and the undrained shear strength obtained from the three dimensional compression test the corresponding relationship between them can be derived as li et al 2017a 24 s u p 3 sin ψ f m 2 sin 2 ψ f s u where ψ f is the stress transformed parameter written as 25 sin ψ f 2 m 9 3 m substituting eqs 1 15 and 24 into eq 23 yields the unit time dependent shaft resistance as 26 f s t 3 sin ψ f cos ϕ m 2 sin 2 ψ f p t p 0 s u 0 ocr λ β t the unit shaft resistance of a displacement pile f s t which incorporates the time dependent effects can also be easily evaluated based on the total stress method as follows 27 f s t α t s u 0 where α t is the time dependent pile shaft bearing capacity factor it is worth mentioning that in the total stress method the pile interface is deemed to be completely rough and without slippage comparing eq 26 with eq 27 the time dependent pile shaft bearing capacity factor which considers the effects of reconsolidation and thixotropy can be given as 28 α t 3 sin ψ f m 2 sin 2 ψ f p t p 0 β t ocr λ substituting eqs 1 21 and 24 into eq 23 and comparing with eq 27 the time dependent pile shaft bearing capacity factors incorporating the effects of soil ageing and thixotropy can be expressed as 29 α t 3 sin ψ f m 2 sin 2 ψ f r t p t r e p 0 β t ocr λ t t r e conducting the integral along the pile shaft the shaft bearing capacity of a displacement pile in clay which properly incorporates the time dependent effects can be determined as 30 q s t 0 h 2 π r p f s t d z the end bearing capacity of a displacement pile in clay only accounts for a small part of the total bearing capacity bullock et al 2005a b in the framework of the total stress method the unit pile end resistance can be easily estimated as 31 q b n c s u 0 where n c is the pile end bearing capacity factor and can be empirically taken as 9 wardle et al 1992 due to the effects of dissipation of excess pore water pressure and soil ageing the unit pile end resistance of the displacement pile also exhibits the time dependent effects therefore it can be expressed as 32 q b t n c t s u 0 substituting eqs 1 and 15 into eq 32 the time dependent pile end bearing capacity factor which considers the effects of reconsolidation and thixotropy can be written as 33 n c t p t p 0 n c ocr λ β t the time dependent pile end bearing capacity factor considering the effects of soil ageing and thixotropy can be obtained by substituting eq 21 into eq 32 as follows 34 n c t p t r e p 0 r t n c ocr λ β t t t r e for a displacement pile in clay the total axial bearing capacity consists of the shaft bearing capacity and the end bearing capacity thus the total axial bearing capacity of a displacement pile in clay which considers the effects of both reconsolidation and soil ageing can be estimated by the following equation 35 q t q s t q b t 0 h 2 π r p f s t d z π r p 2 q b t 4 time dependent load displacement response the surrounding clay exhibits the time dependent undrained shear strength and shear modulus after pile installation because of the effects of reconsolidation and soil ageing the load displacement response of an axially loaded displacement significantly relies on these two soil parameters li et al 2017 a b thus a displacement pile in clay exhibiting evidently time dependent load displacement response this time dependent response can be explored by incorporating the time dependent soil mechanical properties and the correspondingly developed time dependent pile bearing capacity factors into the model parameters of load transfer curves up to now geotechnical researchers have extensively investigated the relationship between the shaft shear stress τ s z and the pile soil relative displacement d s z the results of both field and laboratory tests indicate that there is a nonlinear relationship between the shaft shear stress and the pile soil relative displacement and this nonlinear relationship can be properly described by an exponential function or a hyperbolic function zhang and zhang 2012 wang et al 2012 therefore a hyperbolic function see fig 5 is adopted to simulate the nonlinear behaviour of the pile soil interface the expression of which can be written as 36 τ s z d s z a s b s d s z where a s and b s represent the initial stiffness and the reciprocal of the asymptote of the pile shaft load transfer curve respectively since the time dependent load displacement response is one of the focuses of this study eq 36 can be rewritten as 37 τ s z t d s z a s t b s t d s z the value of a s t in the above equation can be determined as randolph and wroth 1979b 38 a s t r p g t l n r m r p where r m is the limiting influence radius and equal to 2 5 l 1 v beyond which the shaft shear stress induced by pile installation becomes negligible the asymptote of the pile shaft load transfer curve is equal to τ s u t and b s t is the reciprocal of the asymptote thus the coefficient b s t can be determined as 39 b s t 1 τ s u t 1 f s t the nonlinear load displacement relationship developed at the pile base is also assumed to conform to a hyperbolic function therefore the relationship between the unit pile end resistance q b and the pile end settlement d b can be expressed as 40 q b t d b a b t b b t d b where a b t is the initial stiffness of the pile end load transfer curve which can be derived as randolph and wroth 1979b 41 a b t π 1 v r p 4 g t and b b t is the ultimate pile end resistance given by 42 b b t 1 q b u t 1 n c t s u 0 5 computational scheme the stress states of soil elements adjacent to the displacement pile are different along the pile shaft which requires the displacement pile being divided into very small segments to guarantee that the stress along the pile segment can be assumed to be equal hence as shown in fig 6 the displacement pile is divided into n small segments with length l a flow chart for predicting the time dependent bearing capacity of a displacement pile in clay is provided in fig 7 and described below 1 to determine the eigenvalues of bessel function λ n in eq 7 it first needs to determine the first zero point and period of the following equation 43 j 0 x r y y 1 x r p y 0 x r y j 1 x r p 0 2 utilizing eq 43 gives the first 50 values of zero points i e λ n note that although eq 43 owns infinite zero points because the bessel functions are oscillating functions the first 50 values can give sufficient accuracy in addition equal roots may be obtained when calculating eq 43 however only one of these equal roots should be remained while others should be deleted 3 the coefficient a n is determined by substituting the eigenvalues obtained from step 2 into eq 9 4 the excess pore water pressure at time t i e u t is determined from eq 7 5 with the elapse of time the excess pore water pressure dissipates when u t u 0 10 the time constant τ in eq 13 is determined when u t 10 2 it can be considered that the reconsolidation is completed and this corresponding moment is regard to the reference time t r e in eq 20 6 the mean effective stress of surrounding clay during reconsolidation is determined from eq 11 and the quasi overconsolidation ratio during soil ageing is determined from eq 20 7 the bearing capacity factors α t and n c t during reconsolidation and soil ageing are obtained based on eqs 28 29 33 and 34 respectively 8 the time dependent end bearing capacity and the time depend shaft bearing capacity are summed to obtain the total time dependent axial bearing capacity of the displacement pile in clay from 35 note that the first 6 steps of the procedure for exploring the time dependent load displacement response of a displacement pile in clay are the same as those of investigating the time dependent bearing capacity hence the flow chart and the specific procedures for predicting the time dependent load displacement response directly starts from step 7 the flow chart can be referred to fig 8 and the procedures are described in the following 7 the shear modulus of the surrounding clay at a given time t g t is obtained from eq 17 by substituting the corresponding mean effective stress into it when t t r e or from eq 22 by substituting the corresponding quasi overconsolidation ratio and the mean effective stress into it when t t r e the unit shaft resistance f s t and the unit pile end resistance q b t at a given time t are determined from eqs 27 and 32 with the substitution of corresponding pile bearing capacity factors respectively 8 a small pile end displacement d b n is assumed 9 the pile end resistance q b t is obtained by substituting d b n into eq 40 along with the substitution of g b t and n c t into eqs 41 and 42 the pile end load q b t is equal to π r p 2 q b t 10 in the first trial the displacement d c n at the midpoint of pile segment n is assumed to equal the pile end displacement d b n i e d c n d b n 11 the shear stress along the shaft of pile segment n τ s n t is obtained by substituting d c n and the corresponding a s t and b s t into eq 37 12 the load at the top of pile segment n q t n t is calculated as 44 q t n t q b t π l τ s n t 13 the updated displacement at the midpoint of pile segment n d c n u is calculated as 45 d c n u d b n q t n t 3 q b t 4 l 2 e p a p 14 a very small tolerance i e 10 6 m is specified between the updated midpoint displacement d c n u and the first assumed midpoint displacement d c n if d c n u d c n 10 6 the updated midpoint displacement d c n u needs to be set as the new value of d c n and steps 10 14 need to be repeated until d c n u d c n 10 6 15 the displacement and the load at the top of pile segment n are calculated as 46 d t n d b n d c n u 47 q t n t q b t π l τ s n u t 16 steps 10 15 are repeated from pile segment n to pile segment 1 to obtain the load displacement response developed at the pile head 17 steps 8 16 are repeated with an assumed pile end displacement from zero to a desired value to obtain the load displacement curve of a displacement pile in clay at a given time after pile installation 6 validation 6 1 field test the field test selected for validation was conducted by konrad and roy 1987 at the saint alban test site which is located about 80 km west of quebec city at the northern fringe of the saint laurent lowlands the reason for selecting this field test instead of other available field tests is that the authors not only well rerecorded the test results of the setup of displacement piles but also listed many soil parameters that are vital for the proposed analytical analysis the soil at the test site is the st alban clay which is slightly overconsolidated and with an ocr in the order of 2 1 the initial coefficient of radial consolidation and the secondary compression index were not measured on st alban clay samples during field test nonetheless the initial coefficient of radial consolidation can be taken about 0 0008 m2 h to represent the destructed clay in a slightly overconsolidated state leroueil et al 1979 in addition according to the literature yin 2007 the secondary compression index of clay with an ocr larger than 2 can be empirically taken as 0 001 the other soil parameters required in the analysis are tabulated in table 1 the test pile chosen for comparison is the pile a in the field test the pile is a circular steel pipe with 8 mm thick wall whose length and diameter are 7 6 m and 0 22 m respectively the elastic modulus of the pile is about 210 gpa its bearing capacity was measured carefully at time intervals of 4 days 8 days 20 days 33 days and 2 years after pile installation further details related to this field test can refer to konrad and roy 1987 6 2 bearing capacity to investigate the effect of reconsolidation on the setup of a displacement pile in clay the fifty day variation of excess pore water pressure shaft bearing capacity and total axial bearing capacity are predicted for comparison in fig 9 the dissipation of excess pore water pressure chosen here was measured at the depth of 3 05 m by the pore pressure transducer equipped in the tested pile from the figure it can be found that the predicted dissipation of excess pore water pressure and shaft bearing capacity show good agreements with the measured values the total axial bearing capacity is overestimated about 20 at 4 days after pile installation this may be because the actual thixotropy is stronger than the thixotropy predicted by eq 13 which makes the undrained shear strength at the early stage slightly overestimated however it still shows a satisfactory agreement between the predicted and field measured results of total axial bearing capacity as time goes on in addition it can be seen that the reconsolidation lasts for about 41 days since the completion of pile installation after that the effects of soil ageing mainly contribute to the increase of bearing capacity of the displacement pile fig 10 shows the complete predicted variation of total axial bearing capacity and shaft bearing capacity of the displacement pile at the saint alban test site for 2 years it can be found that both the predicted shaft bearing capacity and total axial bearing capacity at 2 years agree very well with the measured values it is worth noting that the increase of pile bearing capacity caused by the effect of soil ageing seems not very obvious compared with that resulting from the effect of reconsolidation this is because the rate of soil ageing is much slower than the rate of reconsolidation the increase of soil strength caused by soil aging is much smaller than that resulted from reconsolidation in a short time period correspondingly the increase of bearing capacity arising from soil ageing in 2 years is comparatively small nonetheless when time for soil ageing is long enough the pile setup caused by the effects of soil ageing will be much more obvious therefore it suggests that the increase in pile bearing capacity due to the reconsolidation is important in the economy for new structures while the effect of soil ageing is more significant for rehabilitating or building new structures utilizing existing piles from previous structures 6 3 load displacement response the validation of the proposed framework is examined again by predicting the time dependent load displacement response of pile a measured on the 4th day and 8th day after pile installation it can be seen from fig 11 that although a softer axial response is predicted for the displacement pile on the 4th day after pile installation both the load displacement curves still agree well with the measured results especially the curve predicted on 8th day therefore satisfactory agreements are demonstrated between the predicted and measured load displacement responses it is worth pointing out that the reason for the softer axial response may be the slight underestimation of the shear modulus of the surrounding clay it can also be interestingly found that the stiffness of the displacement pile in clay increases with the elapse of time this observed time dependent property should be taken into account when designing displacement piles in clay 7 results and discussions 7 1 effects of overconsolidation ratio the stress history significantly affects the clay behaviours like compression and consolidation which certainly exerts influences on the bearing capacity of a displacement pile in clay compared with the undrained shear strength that was adopted by some researchers e g weltman and healy 1978 kulhawy and jackson 1989 the ocr is independent of other significant soil parameters such as internal friction angle volumetric strain ratio unit weight etc and thus it is more rational to utilize the ocr to explore the effects of stress history on pile bearing capacity here three different ocrs i e 1 2 and 5 which represent the normally consolidated clay the slightly overconsolidated clay and the moderately overconsolidated clay are adopted to investigate the effects of stress history on pile bearing capacity the ratio of pile length to pile diameter is 35 and the soil parameters adopted for analysis is the same as those listed in table 1 the values of coefficients of earth pressure at rest of clays with different ocrs can be evaluated by the following equation mayne and kulhawy 1982 48 k 0 ocr sin ϕ 1 sin ϕ to better illustrate the effects of stress history on pile bearing capacity the results are separately illustrated into figs 12 and 13 according to the two different phases of pile setup i e reconsolidation and soil ageing from figs 12a and figs 13a it can be seen that during reconsolidation the bearing capacity factors of a displacement pile in clay with larger ocrs increase much faster than those of a displacement pile in clay with smaller ocrs correspondingly the bearing capacity of displacement piles in clay with larger ocrs increases much faster than piles in clay with smaller ones during reconsolidation the end time of pile setup caused by reconsolidation increases with the increase of ocr hence when designing new displacement piles in clays with different ocrs special attention should be paid to the time of applying loads to the pile head with the aim of incorporating the full pile setup caused by the reconsolidation into the design it should also be noted in figs 12b and 13b that the displacement piles in clay with smaller ocrs own larger bearing capacity factors in the period of soil ageing as the excess pore water pressure totally dissipates and the clay has a stronger soil aging effect the larger bearing capacity factors demonstrate that the displacement piles in clay with smaller ocrs have larger long term bearing capacities 7 2 effects of secondary compression indexes the rate of soil ageing is affected by the secondary compression index the larger compression indexes generally correspond to the larger rates of soil ageing besides it can be found from eq 20 that the magnitude of quasi overconsolidation ratio depends on the secondary compression index and the quasi overconsolidation ratio is a significant parameter determining the long term bearing capacity of a displacement pile in clay therefore it is quite meaningful to explore the effects of different secondary compression indexes on pile bearing capacity factors note that the secondary compression index only affects the pile bearing capacity during soil ageing thus only variations of pile bearing capacity factors during soil ageing are shown in figs 14 and 15 since the secondary compression index of the clay in the test site is equal to 0 001 another three values of secondary compression index with the same order of magnitudes which are 0 003 0 005 and 0 007 respectively are adopted here it can be found that the values of both the pile end bearing capacity factor and the pile shaft bearing capacity factor of a displacement pile in clay with larger secondary compression indexes are also larger than those of a displacement pile in clay with smaller secondary compression indexes in addition both the pile bearing capacity factors increase much faster when the surrounding clay processes the larger secondary compression index this is because the larger undrained shear strength is developed for the clay with a larger secondary compression index during soil ageing and the undrained shear strength is the key soil parameter controlling the pile bearing capacity the phenomena indicate that a displacement pile in clay with a larger secondary compression index will develop a larger long term bearing capacity 7 3 effects of loadings figs 16 and 17 illustrate the effects of different loads applied to the pile head reflected by loading parameter lr on pile bearing capacity factors the reason for this exploration is that the pile loading can lead to the decrease of void ratio of surrounding clay and then can change the mechanical properties of surrounding clay which further affects the bearing capacity of displacement piles in clay because it is assumed that the time for pile loading is just at the end of dissipation of excess pore water pressure only the variation of pile bearing capacity factors during soil ageing is shown in the figures it can be observed that both the pile end bearing capacity factor and the pile shaft bearing capacity factor increase as the magnitude of the load applied to pile head increases which indicates that a larger long term bearing capacity is developed for the pile subjected to a larger load this phenomenon can be attributed to that a larger pile loading results in the larger decrease of void ratio and then brings about stronger quasi overconsolidated effects of surrounding clay the stronger quasi overconsolidated effects lead to the surrounding clay developing larger quasi overconsolidation ratios as a result a larger undrained shear strength is developed for the surrounding clay which leads to the displacement pile processing larger bearing capacity note that the statement that the pile subjected to a larger load can result in a larger long term bearing capacity may only hold true under the similar soil conditions as the field tests 8 conclusions in this paper an analytical framework has been presented to predict the setup of a displacement pile in clay where the effects of pile installation reconsolidation pile loading and soil ageing were integrated the validity of the framework was examined by predicting the time dependent bearing capacity and the time dependent load displacement response of a displacement pile in a well documented pile field test the effects of overconsolidation ratio secondary compression index and loading on pile setup were discussed in detail based on the proposed framework the proposed procedure can be applied to estimate the setup of different types of piles but for some types of piles it will have some limitations for example for bored piles only the soil ageing effects should be taken into consideration when exploring the setup and thus the proposed procedure only considering the effects of soil ageing can be utilized for driven piles both the effects of reconsolidation and the effects of soil ageing should be taken into account when predicting the setup besides the influences caused by the pile striking play an important role in driven pile setup and should be considered as well therefore the procedure for predicting the load carrying behaviours of driven piles can be similar to the proposed one for displacement piles but the influences resulting from the pile striking should be integrated into the procedure for the sake of accuracy the conclusions that can be drawn from this study are summarized in the following 1 both the predicted pile setup and load displacement response show good agreements with the test results of a displacement pile in the field test it well proves that the proposed analytical framework can be effectively applied to evaluate the pile setup resulting from the effects of reconsolidation and soil ageing 2 for a displacement pile in clay with a larger ocr its bearing capacity after pile installation increases much faster than the displacement pile in clay with a smaller ocr due to the faster dissipation of installation induced excess pore water pressure however its long term bearing capacity is smaller than the displacement pile in clay with a smaller ocr 3 the magnitude of secondary compression index affects the long term bearing capacity of displacement piles in clay larger increase rate and magnitude of long term bearing capacity are developed for a displacement pile in clay with a larger secondary compression index besides a larger load applied to the pile head during pile loading also leads to the displacement pile processing a larger long term bearing capacity 4 the parametric study focusing on the investigations of bearing capacity factors provides a feasible way for exploring the pile size effect on setup just through incorporating the pile radius and the bearing capacity factors into eq 35 it can be easily found from the equation that a pile with a larger size will experience more

21305,this paper integrates the effects of pile installation reconsolidation pile loading and soil ageing into an analytical framework to predict the long term setup of a displacement pile in clay the increase of mean effective stress and the decrease of void ratio of surrounding clay during reconsolidation and soil ageing are determined to quantify the changes in undrained shear strength and shear modulus which are the two key soil parameters controlling load carrying behaviours of piles the bearing capacity factors and load transfer curves are developed by incorporating the developed soil parameters the analytical framework is then proposed and validated by predicting a well documented pile field test good agreements between the analytical results and the measured data demonstrate that the pile setup can be reasonably predicted by the proposed framework comprehensive parametric studies are conducted to investigate the influences of overconsolidation ratio secondary compression index and pile loading on the pile setup the results indicate that a displacement pile in clay with a smaller overconsolidation ratio or a larger secondary compression index or subjected to a larger load exhibits a larger long term bearing capacity keywords setup reconsolidation soil ageing displacement pile overconsolidation ratio secondary compression index 1 introduction an interesting phenomenon that the axial bearing capacity of a displacement pile in clay increases with the elapse of time after its installation has been recognized by many geotechnical researchers and practitioners which is well denoted as pile setup pile setup is mainly caused by recovery of strength and stiffness of surrounding clay due to the reconsolidation e g randolph et al 1979 ng et al 2012 and soil ageing e g tavenas and audy 1972 schmertmann 1991 incorporating setup into the design of displacement piles can undoubtedly help save construction costs through reducing the number or dimension of required piles in addition accurate prediction of pile setup is of great significance to estimate the load carrying behaviour of existing displacement piles and to further utilize them to construct pile foundation via being mixed with new piles for rehabilitating or constructing buildings up to now field tests have been widely conducted by researchers to explore the setup of a displacement pile in clay e g konrad and roy 1987 bullock et al 2005a b ng et al 2012 chen et al 2014 haque et al 2014 from the well documented results of field tests many empirical equations were developed to predict the post installation increase in the axial bearing capacity of displacement piles the semilogarithmic empirical relationship proposed by skov and denver 1988 is one of the milestones of these empirical equations however these empirical equations had limitations because they were derived based on the field tests in the specific geological conditions on the other hand field tests are expensive and time consuming especially when the pile setup is taken into consideration because such investigations require the field tests lasting for several years or even decades which make the tests quite difficult to realize the finite element simulation apart from field tests has been served as another approach to explore the setup of a displacement pile in clay e g titi and wathugala 1999 whittle and sutabutr 1999 abu farsakh et al 2015 since a variety of complicated factors such as pile installation reconsolidation as well as soil ageing can be incorporated into the modeling process however some of the finite element simulations utilized the soil properties obtained from laboratory tests on undisturbed soil samples while significant changes in mechanical properties of surrounding clay have been induced due to the great disturbance in the soil structure caused by pile installation therefore these simulations are unable to predict the actual time dependent axial bearing capacity of displacement piles in addition the finite element simulations are limited in their wide applicability since one finite element model can just serve for one geotechnical engineering project if different projects need to be simulated the finite element model may need to be rebuilt from scratch as a result it is difficult to build a general framework through finite element simulations to investigate the setup of displacement piles with different dimensions under different geological conditions the objective of this paper is to present a general analytical framework to predict the long term setup of a displacement pile in clay the changes occurring in the two key soil parameters undrained shear strength and shear modulus of surrounding clay at different phases including installation reconsolidation pile loading as well as soil ageing are quantified and incorporated into the proposed analytical framework the installation effect is modeled by an anisotropic cavity expansion and the generated excess pore water pressure immediately after pile installation is determined based on the solution of cavity expansion the radial consolidation theory with a variable coefficient of consolidation is employed to model the reconsolidation of surrounding clay the soil ageing is represented by means of defining the quasi overconsolidation ratio these effects are then integrated and incorporated into the undrained shear strength and shear modulus based on which the bearing capacity factors and load transfer curves are developed to predict the pile setup the proposed framework is validated by predicting a well documented pile field test which was carried out for exploring the long term loading carrying behaviour of a displacement pile parametric studies are conducted to investigate the effects of overconsolidation ratio ocr secondary compression index and magnitude of pile loading on the long term pile setup 2 changes in mechanical properties of surrounding clay 2 1 definitions of significant soil parameters the undrained shear strength of in situ clay s u 0 under a conventional triaxial compression test can be defined as wood 1990 1 s u 0 1 2 m p 0 ocr 2 λ where ocr is the overconsolidation ratio p 0 is the initial mean effective stress m is the slope of critical state line equal to 6 sin ϕ 3 sin ϕ ϕ is the effective internal friction angle and λ represents the plastic volumetric strain ratio defined as λ 1 κ λ and κ and λ represent the slopes of swelling and compression lines in the e ln p plane respectively the shear modulus of in situ clay can be defined as sun et al 2004 2 g 3 1 2 v υ p 2 1 v κ where v is the effective poisson s ratio and υ 1 e is the specific volume the pile setup mainly results from the recovery in strength and stiffness of surrounding clay which is caused by the effects of reconsolidation and soil ageing although both effects simultaneously contribute to the pile setup it is unnecessary to consider both the effects together in the same phase because during reconsolidation the dissipation of excess pore water pressure dominates the recovery of strength and stiffness of surrounding clay while the effect of soil ageing is negligible augustesen 2006 bullock et al 2005 during soil ageing the situation is reversed therefore it can be assumed that the soil ageing occurs primarily after reconsolidation see fig 1 to simplify the analytical analysis in this study the similar assumption has also been suggested by other researchers e g ladd et al 1977 mesri and choi 1985 augustesen 2006 2 2 pile installation and dissipation of excess pore water pressure the surrounding soil is displaced predominantly outward during pile installation the strain field generated by pile installation in the surrounding clay resembles the strain field determined from the cavity expansion theory the rationality of which has been verified by randolph et al 1979 and randolph 2003 besides the cavity expansion theory can provide a closed form solution for predicting the radial stress and the excess pore water pressure in the surrounding clay therefore an anisotropic cavity expansion solution li et al 2016 which employs the k 0 based anisotropic modified cam clay model is adopted to model the process of pile installation the notation k 0 denotes the coefficient of earth pressure at rest the reason for adopting the anisotropic solution of cavity expansion is that natural clays generally consolidate in the k 0 condition and show the initial stress anisotropy and the initial stress induced anisotropy and the adopted anisotropic solution can well capture these two anisotropies following the solution of cavity expansion in k 0 consolidated clay proposed by li et al 2016 the excess pore water pressure induced by pile installation can be given as 3 u 0 r p 0 k 0 2 k 0 1 ocr 2 λ 1 3 p 0 η y 1 2 χ ln 3 g 0 p 0 η y r p r 2 1 4 q f 2 3 χ 2 6 where η y is the relative stress ratio at the boundary of plastic zone developed around the pile equal to ocr 1 m 2 3 1 k 0 2 k 0 1 2 the parameter χ is defined as p f 4 m 2 9 2 1 k 0 2 k 0 1 2 3 r p is the pile radius and p f and q f are the mean effective stress and the deviator stress at the critical state respectively which can be given as 4 p f p 0 ocr 2 λ 5 q f m p 0 ocr 2 λ after pile installation the induced excess pore water pressure mainly dissipates in the radial direction which is depicted in fig 2 this dissipation process can be properly modeled by the classical terzaghi s theory of consolidation the governing equation can be written as 6 1 1 e 0 e t k γ w 1 r r r u t where e 0 is the initial void ratio k is the permeability coefficient and γ w is the unit weight of water the general solution of eq 6 can be obtained based on the variable separation method as follows gong et al 2017 7 u 1 j r t n 1 a n j 0 λ n r j 1 λ n r p y 1 λ n r p y 0 λ n r e λ n 2 c h 1 j t where j 0 and j 1 are the first kind bessel functions of first order and second order respectively y 0 and y 1 are the second kind bessel functions of first order and second order respectively j represents the j th small interval of total dissipation time λ n are the eigenvalues of bessel function and c h is a variable coefficient of consolidation which can be expressed as 8 c h c h 0 p 0 α p t α where c h 0 is the initial coefficient of consolidation for radial horizontal drainage and α is a dimensionless factor the coefficient a n in eq 7 can be obtained based on the orthogonality of bessel function as 9 a n r p r y u 0 r v 0 λ n r r d r r p r v 0 2 λ n r r d r where r y is the radius of plastic zone developed around the displacement pile and the expression of v 0 λ n r is 10 v 0 λ n r j 0 λ n r j 1 λ n r p y 1 λ n r p y 0 λ n r during pile installation a critical state zone is developed around the displacement pile where the mean effective stress of surrounding clay remains constant and always equals the mean effective stress at the critical state p f after pile installation the mean effective stress of surrounding clay p t increases from the mean effective stress at the critical state p f with the dissipation of excess pore water pressure which leads to the increase in undrained shear strength of surrounding clay because the relaxation effect exists in the process of reconsolidation randolph and wroth 1979a the excess pore water pressure is unable to fully transform into the increase of mean effective stress hence an effective stress transfer parameter ξ proposed by randolph and wroth 1979a is adopted here to consider the relaxation effect after taking the relaxation effect into consideration the mean effective stress of surrounding clay during reconsolidation can be calculated based on the principle of effective stress as 11 p t p f ξ u 0 u t where 12 ξ p 0 u 0 3 ocr 5 1 2 k 0 ln 1 5 1 2 k 0 3 ocr u 0 p 0 due to the rearrangement of remolded soil particles the surrounding clay also regains its strength with time after pile installation this phenomenon is referred to as thixotropy abu farsakh et al 2015 and occurs no matter whether the surrounding clay is subjected to reconsolidation to consider the thixotropic effect a time dependent parameter β t is introduced and defined as abu farsakh et al 2015 13 β t β β β 0 e t τ where β represents that the surrounding clay regains its strength from the disturbed state for a quite long time after pile installation and its value can be taken as 1 β 0 is a reduction parameter denoting the stress state of surrounding clay immediately after pile installation equal to 0 75 abu farsakh et al 2015 and τ is a time constant assumed as the time for 90 dissipation of excess pore water pressure the surrounding clay suffers from the strong remolding effects during pile installation including the collapse of soil structure and the erasing of stress history the remolding effects lead to the surrounding clay exhibiting the mechanical properties similar to the normally consolidated clay after pile installation randolph and wroth 1981 yao et al 2009 thus the overconsolidation ratio of surrounding clay can be taken as unity correspondingly the undrained shear strength of surrounding clay after pile installation can be expressed as 14 s u 1 2 m p 1 2 λ through substituting eqs 11 and 13 into eq 14 the time dependent undrained shear strength of surrounding clay after pile installation which appropriately incorporates the effects of pile installation reconsolidation and thixotropy can be determined as follows 15 s u t m 1 2 λ 1 p 0 ocr 2 λ ξ δ u t β t in the e log p plane the relationship between the void ratio and the mean effective stress can be written as 16 e e 0 c c log p p 0 where c c is the compression index and represents the slope of compression curve in the e log p plane substituting eq 11 into eq 2 along with the substitution of eqs 4 7 and 16 the time dependent shear modulus of surrounding clay after pile installation can be expressed as 17 g t 3 1 2 v 1 e 0 c c log ocr 2 λ ξ δ u t p 0 p 0 ocr 2 λ ξ δ u t 2 1 v κ 2 3 soil ageing as shown in fig 3 the loading of the displacement pile gives rise to the decrease in the void ratio of surrounding clay from point a to point b in addition the void ratio of surrounding clay decreases with the elapse of time due to the effects of soil ageing from point b to point c although the mean effective stress of surrounding clay remains constant both the decreases in void ratio lead to the surrounding clay showing more stable structure and exhibiting the quasi overconsolidated behaviour to account for this quasi overconsolidated behaviour the secondary relations built based on the bjerrum s theory of time dependent compression bjerrum 1967 and developed by garlanger 1972 is adopted to describe the decrease of void ratio resulting from the pile loading and the soil ageing the expression can be specifically written as 18 e t e 0 c c log lr c α log t t r e t t r e where c α is the secondary compression index t r e is the reference time which here should be denoted as the end time of the dissipation of excess pore water pressure and lr 1 is defined as the loading parameter and equal to σ z p σ z t r e where σ z p is the vertical effective stress of surrounding clay when an axial load is applied to the pile head the loading parameter can well reflect the magnitude of pile loading as a larger loading parameter corresponds to a larger load applied to the pile head to better describe the quasi overconsolidated behaviour of clay a parameter called quasi overconsolidation ratio r is defined as the ratio of quasi preconsolidation pressure to the initial mean effective stress p c q p 0 according to the relationship in the e ln p plane the decrease of void ratio can be also determined as 19 δ e e e 0 λ ln p c q p t r e substituting eq 19 into eq 18 the quasi overconsolidation ratio can be obtained as 20 r t exp c c λ log lr c α λ log t t r e t t r e combining eqs 15 and 20 as well as combining 17 and eq 20 the time dependent undrained shear strength and shear modulus of surrounding clay which incorporates the effects of soil ageing can be given as follows 21 s u t 1 2 λ 1 m r t p 0 ocr 2 λ ξ δ u t r e β t t t r e 22 g t 3 1 2 v r t p 0 ocr 2 λ ξ δ u t r e 1 e 0 c c log lr c α e log t t r 2 1 v κ t t r e 3 time dependent axial bearing capacity fig 4 shows the stress state of a soil element adjacent to the pile shaft when the pile is subjected to an axial load randolph and wroth 1981 indicates that the shearing state of a soil element adjacent to the pile shaft can be equivalent to that in a simple shear test hence the unit shaft resistance of a displacement pile f s can be developed in terms of the undrained shear strength under the plane strain condition s u p as li et al 2017a 23 f s τ y x s u p cos ϕ note that the undrained shear strength defined by eq 1 is obtained under conventional triaxial compression tests and is different from the undrained shear strength under the plain strain condition because of its intrinsic three dimensional mechanical properties therefore the stress transformed method combined with the smp criterion presented by matsuoka et al 1999 is adopted to develop the relationship between the undrained shear strength under the plane strain condition and the undrained shear strength obtained from the three dimensional compression test the corresponding relationship between them can be derived as li et al 2017a 24 s u p 3 sin ψ f m 2 sin 2 ψ f s u where ψ f is the stress transformed parameter written as 25 sin ψ f 2 m 9 3 m substituting eqs 1 15 and 24 into eq 23 yields the unit time dependent shaft resistance as 26 f s t 3 sin ψ f cos ϕ m 2 sin 2 ψ f p t p 0 s u 0 ocr λ β t the unit shaft resistance of a displacement pile f s t which incorporates the time dependent effects can also be easily evaluated based on the total stress method as follows 27 f s t α t s u 0 where α t is the time dependent pile shaft bearing capacity factor it is worth mentioning that in the total stress method the pile interface is deemed to be completely rough and without slippage comparing eq 26 with eq 27 the time dependent pile shaft bearing capacity factor which considers the effects of reconsolidation and thixotropy can be given as 28 α t 3 sin ψ f m 2 sin 2 ψ f p t p 0 β t ocr λ substituting eqs 1 21 and 24 into eq 23 and comparing with eq 27 the time dependent pile shaft bearing capacity factors incorporating the effects of soil ageing and thixotropy can be expressed as 29 α t 3 sin ψ f m 2 sin 2 ψ f r t p t r e p 0 β t ocr λ t t r e conducting the integral along the pile shaft the shaft bearing capacity of a displacement pile in clay which properly incorporates the time dependent effects can be determined as 30 q s t 0 h 2 π r p f s t d z the end bearing capacity of a displacement pile in clay only accounts for a small part of the total bearing capacity bullock et al 2005a b in the framework of the total stress method the unit pile end resistance can be easily estimated as 31 q b n c s u 0 where n c is the pile end bearing capacity factor and can be empirically taken as 9 wardle et al 1992 due to the effects of dissipation of excess pore water pressure and soil ageing the unit pile end resistance of the displacement pile also exhibits the time dependent effects therefore it can be expressed as 32 q b t n c t s u 0 substituting eqs 1 and 15 into eq 32 the time dependent pile end bearing capacity factor which considers the effects of reconsolidation and thixotropy can be written as 33 n c t p t p 0 n c ocr λ β t the time dependent pile end bearing capacity factor considering the effects of soil ageing and thixotropy can be obtained by substituting eq 21 into eq 32 as follows 34 n c t p t r e p 0 r t n c ocr λ β t t t r e for a displacement pile in clay the total axial bearing capacity consists of the shaft bearing capacity and the end bearing capacity thus the total axial bearing capacity of a displacement pile in clay which considers the effects of both reconsolidation and soil ageing can be estimated by the following equation 35 q t q s t q b t 0 h 2 π r p f s t d z π r p 2 q b t 4 time dependent load displacement response the surrounding clay exhibits the time dependent undrained shear strength and shear modulus after pile installation because of the effects of reconsolidation and soil ageing the load displacement response of an axially loaded displacement significantly relies on these two soil parameters li et al 2017 a b thus a displacement pile in clay exhibiting evidently time dependent load displacement response this time dependent response can be explored by incorporating the time dependent soil mechanical properties and the correspondingly developed time dependent pile bearing capacity factors into the model parameters of load transfer curves up to now geotechnical researchers have extensively investigated the relationship between the shaft shear stress τ s z and the pile soil relative displacement d s z the results of both field and laboratory tests indicate that there is a nonlinear relationship between the shaft shear stress and the pile soil relative displacement and this nonlinear relationship can be properly described by an exponential function or a hyperbolic function zhang and zhang 2012 wang et al 2012 therefore a hyperbolic function see fig 5 is adopted to simulate the nonlinear behaviour of the pile soil interface the expression of which can be written as 36 τ s z d s z a s b s d s z where a s and b s represent the initial stiffness and the reciprocal of the asymptote of the pile shaft load transfer curve respectively since the time dependent load displacement response is one of the focuses of this study eq 36 can be rewritten as 37 τ s z t d s z a s t b s t d s z the value of a s t in the above equation can be determined as randolph and wroth 1979b 38 a s t r p g t l n r m r p where r m is the limiting influence radius and equal to 2 5 l 1 v beyond which the shaft shear stress induced by pile installation becomes negligible the asymptote of the pile shaft load transfer curve is equal to τ s u t and b s t is the reciprocal of the asymptote thus the coefficient b s t can be determined as 39 b s t 1 τ s u t 1 f s t the nonlinear load displacement relationship developed at the pile base is also assumed to conform to a hyperbolic function therefore the relationship between the unit pile end resistance q b and the pile end settlement d b can be expressed as 40 q b t d b a b t b b t d b where a b t is the initial stiffness of the pile end load transfer curve which can be derived as randolph and wroth 1979b 41 a b t π 1 v r p 4 g t and b b t is the ultimate pile end resistance given by 42 b b t 1 q b u t 1 n c t s u 0 5 computational scheme the stress states of soil elements adjacent to the displacement pile are different along the pile shaft which requires the displacement pile being divided into very small segments to guarantee that the stress along the pile segment can be assumed to be equal hence as shown in fig 6 the displacement pile is divided into n small segments with length l a flow chart for predicting the time dependent bearing capacity of a displacement pile in clay is provided in fig 7 and described below 1 to determine the eigenvalues of bessel function λ n in eq 7 it first needs to determine the first zero point and period of the following equation 43 j 0 x r y y 1 x r p y 0 x r y j 1 x r p 0 2 utilizing eq 43 gives the first 50 values of zero points i e λ n note that although eq 43 owns infinite zero points because the bessel functions are oscillating functions the first 50 values can give sufficient accuracy in addition equal roots may be obtained when calculating eq 43 however only one of these equal roots should be remained while others should be deleted 3 the coefficient a n is determined by substituting the eigenvalues obtained from step 2 into eq 9 4 the excess pore water pressure at time t i e u t is determined from eq 7 5 with the elapse of time the excess pore water pressure dissipates when u t u 0 10 the time constant τ in eq 13 is determined when u t 10 2 it can be considered that the reconsolidation is completed and this corresponding moment is regard to the reference time t r e in eq 20 6 the mean effective stress of surrounding clay during reconsolidation is determined from eq 11 and the quasi overconsolidation ratio during soil ageing is determined from eq 20 7 the bearing capacity factors α t and n c t during reconsolidation and soil ageing are obtained based on eqs 28 29 33 and 34 respectively 8 the time dependent end bearing capacity and the time depend shaft bearing capacity are summed to obtain the total time dependent axial bearing capacity of the displacement pile in clay from 35 note that the first 6 steps of the procedure for exploring the time dependent load displacement response of a displacement pile in clay are the same as those of investigating the time dependent bearing capacity hence the flow chart and the specific procedures for predicting the time dependent load displacement response directly starts from step 7 the flow chart can be referred to fig 8 and the procedures are described in the following 7 the shear modulus of the surrounding clay at a given time t g t is obtained from eq 17 by substituting the corresponding mean effective stress into it when t t r e or from eq 22 by substituting the corresponding quasi overconsolidation ratio and the mean effective stress into it when t t r e the unit shaft resistance f s t and the unit pile end resistance q b t at a given time t are determined from eqs 27 and 32 with the substitution of corresponding pile bearing capacity factors respectively 8 a small pile end displacement d b n is assumed 9 the pile end resistance q b t is obtained by substituting d b n into eq 40 along with the substitution of g b t and n c t into eqs 41 and 42 the pile end load q b t is equal to π r p 2 q b t 10 in the first trial the displacement d c n at the midpoint of pile segment n is assumed to equal the pile end displacement d b n i e d c n d b n 11 the shear stress along the shaft of pile segment n τ s n t is obtained by substituting d c n and the corresponding a s t and b s t into eq 37 12 the load at the top of pile segment n q t n t is calculated as 44 q t n t q b t π l τ s n t 13 the updated displacement at the midpoint of pile segment n d c n u is calculated as 45 d c n u d b n q t n t 3 q b t 4 l 2 e p a p 14 a very small tolerance i e 10 6 m is specified between the updated midpoint displacement d c n u and the first assumed midpoint displacement d c n if d c n u d c n 10 6 the updated midpoint displacement d c n u needs to be set as the new value of d c n and steps 10 14 need to be repeated until d c n u d c n 10 6 15 the displacement and the load at the top of pile segment n are calculated as 46 d t n d b n d c n u 47 q t n t q b t π l τ s n u t 16 steps 10 15 are repeated from pile segment n to pile segment 1 to obtain the load displacement response developed at the pile head 17 steps 8 16 are repeated with an assumed pile end displacement from zero to a desired value to obtain the load displacement curve of a displacement pile in clay at a given time after pile installation 6 validation 6 1 field test the field test selected for validation was conducted by konrad and roy 1987 at the saint alban test site which is located about 80 km west of quebec city at the northern fringe of the saint laurent lowlands the reason for selecting this field test instead of other available field tests is that the authors not only well rerecorded the test results of the setup of displacement piles but also listed many soil parameters that are vital for the proposed analytical analysis the soil at the test site is the st alban clay which is slightly overconsolidated and with an ocr in the order of 2 1 the initial coefficient of radial consolidation and the secondary compression index were not measured on st alban clay samples during field test nonetheless the initial coefficient of radial consolidation can be taken about 0 0008 m2 h to represent the destructed clay in a slightly overconsolidated state leroueil et al 1979 in addition according to the literature yin 2007 the secondary compression index of clay with an ocr larger than 2 can be empirically taken as 0 001 the other soil parameters required in the analysis are tabulated in table 1 the test pile chosen for comparison is the pile a in the field test the pile is a circular steel pipe with 8 mm thick wall whose length and diameter are 7 6 m and 0 22 m respectively the elastic modulus of the pile is about 210 gpa its bearing capacity was measured carefully at time intervals of 4 days 8 days 20 days 33 days and 2 years after pile installation further details related to this field test can refer to konrad and roy 1987 6 2 bearing capacity to investigate the effect of reconsolidation on the setup of a displacement pile in clay the fifty day variation of excess pore water pressure shaft bearing capacity and total axial bearing capacity are predicted for comparison in fig 9 the dissipation of excess pore water pressure chosen here was measured at the depth of 3 05 m by the pore pressure transducer equipped in the tested pile from the figure it can be found that the predicted dissipation of excess pore water pressure and shaft bearing capacity show good agreements with the measured values the total axial bearing capacity is overestimated about 20 at 4 days after pile installation this may be because the actual thixotropy is stronger than the thixotropy predicted by eq 13 which makes the undrained shear strength at the early stage slightly overestimated however it still shows a satisfactory agreement between the predicted and field measured results of total axial bearing capacity as time goes on in addition it can be seen that the reconsolidation lasts for about 41 days since the completion of pile installation after that the effects of soil ageing mainly contribute to the increase of bearing capacity of the displacement pile fig 10 shows the complete predicted variation of total axial bearing capacity and shaft bearing capacity of the displacement pile at the saint alban test site for 2 years it can be found that both the predicted shaft bearing capacity and total axial bearing capacity at 2 years agree very well with the measured values it is worth noting that the increase of pile bearing capacity caused by the effect of soil ageing seems not very obvious compared with that resulting from the effect of reconsolidation this is because the rate of soil ageing is much slower than the rate of reconsolidation the increase of soil strength caused by soil aging is much smaller than that resulted from reconsolidation in a short time period correspondingly the increase of bearing capacity arising from soil ageing in 2 years is comparatively small nonetheless when time for soil ageing is long enough the pile setup caused by the effects of soil ageing will be much more obvious therefore it suggests that the increase in pile bearing capacity due to the reconsolidation is important in the economy for new structures while the effect of soil ageing is more significant for rehabilitating or building new structures utilizing existing piles from previous structures 6 3 load displacement response the validation of the proposed framework is examined again by predicting the time dependent load displacement response of pile a measured on the 4th day and 8th day after pile installation it can be seen from fig 11 that although a softer axial response is predicted for the displacement pile on the 4th day after pile installation both the load displacement curves still agree well with the measured results especially the curve predicted on 8th day therefore satisfactory agreements are demonstrated between the predicted and measured load displacement responses it is worth pointing out that the reason for the softer axial response may be the slight underestimation of the shear modulus of the surrounding clay it can also be interestingly found that the stiffness of the displacement pile in clay increases with the elapse of time this observed time dependent property should be taken into account when designing displacement piles in clay 7 results and discussions 7 1 effects of overconsolidation ratio the stress history significantly affects the clay behaviours like compression and consolidation which certainly exerts influences on the bearing capacity of a displacement pile in clay compared with the undrained shear strength that was adopted by some researchers e g weltman and healy 1978 kulhawy and jackson 1989 the ocr is independent of other significant soil parameters such as internal friction angle volumetric strain ratio unit weight etc and thus it is more rational to utilize the ocr to explore the effects of stress history on pile bearing capacity here three different ocrs i e 1 2 and 5 which represent the normally consolidated clay the slightly overconsolidated clay and the moderately overconsolidated clay are adopted to investigate the effects of stress history on pile bearing capacity the ratio of pile length to pile diameter is 35 and the soil parameters adopted for analysis is the same as those listed in table 1 the values of coefficients of earth pressure at rest of clays with different ocrs can be evaluated by the following equation mayne and kulhawy 1982 48 k 0 ocr sin ϕ 1 sin ϕ to better illustrate the effects of stress history on pile bearing capacity the results are separately illustrated into figs 12 and 13 according to the two different phases of pile setup i e reconsolidation and soil ageing from figs 12a and figs 13a it can be seen that during reconsolidation the bearing capacity factors of a displacement pile in clay with larger ocrs increase much faster than those of a displacement pile in clay with smaller ocrs correspondingly the bearing capacity of displacement piles in clay with larger ocrs increases much faster than piles in clay with smaller ones during reconsolidation the end time of pile setup caused by reconsolidation increases with the increase of ocr hence when designing new displacement piles in clays with different ocrs special attention should be paid to the time of applying loads to the pile head with the aim of incorporating the full pile setup caused by the reconsolidation into the design it should also be noted in figs 12b and 13b that the displacement piles in clay with smaller ocrs own larger bearing capacity factors in the period of soil ageing as the excess pore water pressure totally dissipates and the clay has a stronger soil aging effect the larger bearing capacity factors demonstrate that the displacement piles in clay with smaller ocrs have larger long term bearing capacities 7 2 effects of secondary compression indexes the rate of soil ageing is affected by the secondary compression index the larger compression indexes generally correspond to the larger rates of soil ageing besides it can be found from eq 20 that the magnitude of quasi overconsolidation ratio depends on the secondary compression index and the quasi overconsolidation ratio is a significant parameter determining the long term bearing capacity of a displacement pile in clay therefore it is quite meaningful to explore the effects of different secondary compression indexes on pile bearing capacity factors note that the secondary compression index only affects the pile bearing capacity during soil ageing thus only variations of pile bearing capacity factors during soil ageing are shown in figs 14 and 15 since the secondary compression index of the clay in the test site is equal to 0 001 another three values of secondary compression index with the same order of magnitudes which are 0 003 0 005 and 0 007 respectively are adopted here it can be found that the values of both the pile end bearing capacity factor and the pile shaft bearing capacity factor of a displacement pile in clay with larger secondary compression indexes are also larger than those of a displacement pile in clay with smaller secondary compression indexes in addition both the pile bearing capacity factors increase much faster when the surrounding clay processes the larger secondary compression index this is because the larger undrained shear strength is developed for the clay with a larger secondary compression index during soil ageing and the undrained shear strength is the key soil parameter controlling the pile bearing capacity the phenomena indicate that a displacement pile in clay with a larger secondary compression index will develop a larger long term bearing capacity 7 3 effects of loadings figs 16 and 17 illustrate the effects of different loads applied to the pile head reflected by loading parameter lr on pile bearing capacity factors the reason for this exploration is that the pile loading can lead to the decrease of void ratio of surrounding clay and then can change the mechanical properties of surrounding clay which further affects the bearing capacity of displacement piles in clay because it is assumed that the time for pile loading is just at the end of dissipation of excess pore water pressure only the variation of pile bearing capacity factors during soil ageing is shown in the figures it can be observed that both the pile end bearing capacity factor and the pile shaft bearing capacity factor increase as the magnitude of the load applied to pile head increases which indicates that a larger long term bearing capacity is developed for the pile subjected to a larger load this phenomenon can be attributed to that a larger pile loading results in the larger decrease of void ratio and then brings about stronger quasi overconsolidated effects of surrounding clay the stronger quasi overconsolidated effects lead to the surrounding clay developing larger quasi overconsolidation ratios as a result a larger undrained shear strength is developed for the surrounding clay which leads to the displacement pile processing larger bearing capacity note that the statement that the pile subjected to a larger load can result in a larger long term bearing capacity may only hold true under the similar soil conditions as the field tests 8 conclusions in this paper an analytical framework has been presented to predict the setup of a displacement pile in clay where the effects of pile installation reconsolidation pile loading and soil ageing were integrated the validity of the framework was examined by predicting the time dependent bearing capacity and the time dependent load displacement response of a displacement pile in a well documented pile field test the effects of overconsolidation ratio secondary compression index and loading on pile setup were discussed in detail based on the proposed framework the proposed procedure can be applied to estimate the setup of different types of piles but for some types of piles it will have some limitations for example for bored piles only the soil ageing effects should be taken into consideration when exploring the setup and thus the proposed procedure only considering the effects of soil ageing can be utilized for driven piles both the effects of reconsolidation and the effects of soil ageing should be taken into account when predicting the setup besides the influences caused by the pile striking play an important role in driven pile setup and should be considered as well therefore the procedure for predicting the load carrying behaviours of driven piles can be similar to the proposed one for displacement piles but the influences resulting from the pile striking should be integrated into the procedure for the sake of accuracy the conclusions that can be drawn from this study are summarized in the following 1 both the predicted pile setup and load displacement response show good agreements with the test results of a displacement pile in the field test it well proves that the proposed analytical framework can be effectively applied to evaluate the pile setup resulting from the effects of reconsolidation and soil ageing 2 for a displacement pile in clay with a larger ocr its bearing capacity after pile installation increases much faster than the displacement pile in clay with a smaller ocr due to the faster dissipation of installation induced excess pore water pressure however its long term bearing capacity is smaller than the displacement pile in clay with a smaller ocr 3 the magnitude of secondary compression index affects the long term bearing capacity of displacement piles in clay larger increase rate and magnitude of long term bearing capacity are developed for a displacement pile in clay with a larger secondary compression index besides a larger load applied to the pile head during pile loading also leads to the displacement pile processing a larger long term bearing capacity 4 the parametric study focusing on the investigations of bearing capacity factors provides a feasible way for exploring the pile size effect on setup just through incorporating the pile radius and the bearing capacity factors into eq 35 it can be easily found from the equation that a pile with a larger size will experience more setup which is similar to the conclusion suggested by haque et al 2014 credit authorship contribution statement weibing gong software methodology data curation writing original draft lin li

stream time averaged quantity 1 introduction the control of the flow around bluff bodies has been intensively researched to insure the safety of the structures by suppressing the vortex shedding and also harvest the energy by utilizing the vortex induced vibration among the flow control methods to attenuate the vortex induced vibration the shape modification is adopted as geometric disturbances zdravkovich 1981 naudascher and rockwell 2012 ekmekci and rockwell 2010 recently as one of the geometric disturbances a harbor seal vibrissa hsv has been considered as a subject of flow controls in several studies hanke et al 2010 witte et al 2012 hans et al 2013 morrison et al 2016 wang and liu 2016 kim and yoon 2017 2018a owing to its ability to significantly suppress lift fluctuation due to its unique geometry the utilization of the harbor seal vibrissa is classified as the biomimetics the summary for the research on hsv shaped cylinders can be found in kim and yoon 2018b the ability of the hsv geometry to reduce the forces has been confirmed by hanke et al 2010 hans et al 2013 morrison et al 2016 and kim yoon kim and yoon 2017 2018a 2018b the hsv shape reduces at least 90 lift forces and about 40 the mean drag force compared with those on a circular cylinder with an identical hydraulic diameter the flow structures in the wake of the hsv have been investigated by hanke et al 2010 witte et al 2012 wang and liu 2016 and kim yoon kim and yoon 2017 2018b these studies revealed the same flow characteristics that hsv geometry does not apparently form the kármán vortices as primary vortex structures in the wake region and the wake vortices elongate further downstream the effect of the angle of attack on the flow around the hsv has been investigated by murphy et al 2013 and kim and yoon 2017 especially the fine resolution of the angle of attack was handled by kim and yoon 2017 when the angle of attack augments the flow is governed by the characteristics of the bluff body thus the unique features of the hsv is limited in the certain range of the angle of attack augments kim and yoon 2017 the effects of geometrical features of the hsv on the reduction of the forces were investigated by hans et al 2013 the geometric features of the undulations in the major and minor axis and the offset angle between leading edge and trailing edge were individually investigated by applying on the elliptic cylinder they report that the effect of the offset angle on the lift and drag coefficients is weak and the undulations on both axes are necessary for lift force reduction the effect of the reynolds number on the flow characteristics around the hsv cylinder has been studied by kim and yoon 2018b the reynolds number ranges from 50 to 500 they confirmed that the performance of the unique hsv geometry on the reduction drag and the suppression of lift fluctuation is valid in the low reynolds number regime as above mentioned the geometrical features of harbor seal whiskers were considered by only hans et al 2013 to investigated their effect on the force reduction ability thus the present study aims at investigating the effect of the geometrical features on the flow structures and the force coefficients the vibrissa s unique shape features are an elliptical cross section with undulations on major and minor axes offset angle between leading edge and trailing edge and variation of the offset angle along the length of the whisker hans et al 2013 the present study aims at achieving the idea to design the geometric disturbance for the bluff flow control to realize the reduction of the forces by analyzing the geometric features of the hsv thus the present study considers more geometric features of the hsv than hans et al 2013 each geometric feature is extracted from the original hsv shape seven hsv like geometries are designed for the purpose of the comparison the elliptic cylinder is considered the large eddy simulation les is performed to simulate flow around the cylinders with the geometric features of the hsv at the reynolds number of 500 the three dimensional vortical structures of each feature are visualized and compared with those of the elliptic cylinder to find their effect on the modification of the flow structures the components of the vorticity are analyzed by considering the iso surfaces of the vorticity contours to find their effect on the three dimensional vortical structures 2 numerical details 2 1 governing equations and numerical methods the governing equations of the unsteady three dimensional incompressible flow are the continuity and the navier stokes equations the present study utilizes the large eddy simulation les method to resolve the turbulent flow in the wake therefore the filtered governing equations are defined as follows 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u i u j x j p x i 1 re 2 u i x j x j τ i j x j where u i are the corresponding velocity components p is the pressure re is the reynolds number the τ i j is the subgrid scale stress tensor as τ i j u i u j u i u j resulting in the effect of subgrid scales on the resolved scales an overbar denotes the large scale flow obtained from grid filtering the dynamic smagorinsky subgrid scale sgs model proposed by germano et al 1991 is used to reflect the effects of unresolved small scale fluid motions further details of sgs model can be found in yoon et al 2009 jung and yoon 2014 and yoon et al 2015 especially yoon et al kim and yoon 2018a and yoon et al kim and yoon 2018b successfully used this model for the flow around the hsv at the same reynolds number of 500 all the variables are non dimensionalized by the hydraulic diameter d h and the free stream velocity u the reynolds number of re 500 are considered for spatial discretization a second order central difference scheme based on the finite volume method fvm is applied on structured grids considered in the present study for temporal discretization for governing equations a second order implicit scheme is employed the second order adams bashforth scheme and the crank nicolson scheme are used to treat the convection and the diffusion terms respectively the present numerical methods are successfully utilized for the researches on the flow around the hsv at the same reynolds number of 500 by h s yoon et al kim and yoon 2017 2018a 2018b 2 2 definition of the geometry and boundary conditions the geometry of hsv employed in this study consists of the parameters of the idealized vibrissa surface model given by hanke et al 2010 fig 1 shows the schematics of the body geometry of the hsv and coordinate system as shown in fig 1 the surface structure consists of two different inclined elliptic cross sections with offset angles of α o f f s e t and β o f f s e t respectively to the flow direction the lengths of semi major and semi minor axes are of a k and b l respectively the period length of λ p 2 65 d h is considered for all geometric features for the elliptic cylinder the lengths of semi major a and semi minor axes b are 0 722 d h and 0 354 d h respectively which is usually used in the previous researches 28 30 32 seven hsv like geometries are designed by combining the minor axis undulation the major axis undulation the both axis undulation and the offset angle the hsv like geometries are organized as the minor axis undulation mi major axis undulation ma same offset angle with major axis undulation ma so different offset angle with major axis undulation ma do both axis undulation ba same offset angle with both axis undulation ba so real whisker with different offset angle with both axis ba do table 1 show all geometries with the hsv features and their design parameters in addition the elliptic cylinder is included for the purpose of the comparison for mi of the minor axis undulation the node and the saddle are the spanwise positions with the shortest and the longest lengths of the transverse direction respectively as shown in table 1 for ma of the major axis undulation the spanwise positions of the node and the saddle are the longest and the shortest lengths of the streamwise direction for the cross section as shown in table 1 for ba of the both axis undulation in table 1 the spanwise variation of the streamwise length is the same with ma the spanwise variation of the transverse length is the same with mi for the cases of so and do with the same and different offset angle with major axis undulation respectively the node is the spanwise central position of the nodes of the leading and trailing edges the saddle is the spanwise central position of the saddles of the leading and trailing edges fig 2 shows the present computational domain of o type and the boundary conditions an inflow and outflow boundaries are located at a distance of 15 d h from the geometry the boundaries of the streamwise direction hold the inflow and outflow conditions a uniform velocity profile was used at the inlet boundary and a convective boundary condition u i t c u i x 0 was imposed on the outflow region where c is the space averaged streamwise outlet velocity the no slip and no penetration conditions were imposed on walls a neumann condition was applied for the pressure boundary a periodic boundary condition was applied in the spanwise direction and the spanwise computational domain of 3 period lengths are considered 2 3 grid dependence test and validation the investigation of the grid dependence test and the validation of our results have been performed to validate the present numerical methods and the grid system the comparisons of the time averaged drag coefficient c d the root mean square rms of lift fluctuation c l r m s and the strouhal number st with previous data are performed for the elliptic cylinder and the hsv as arranged in table 2 the drag and lift coefficient and strouhal number is defined as follow 4 c d 2 f d ρ u 2 a 5 c l 2 f l ρ u 2 a 6 s t f s d h u where f d and f l are the total drag and lift forces respectively ρ is the fluid density u is the free stream velocity a is the projected area of the cylinder facing the flow direction f s is the frequency of the vortex shedding the grid dependence test of the solution is performed for the hsv ba do which is the most complicate shape among the present geometries the three different grid systems of coarse 2 5 million grids medium 3 5 million grids and fine 4 5 million grids are considered and their corresponding results are listed in table 2 the result of our computation is found to be in fairly good agreement with previous data since the values among the three different grid systems show small variations which are not crucial the medium grid system as shown in fig 3 is employed to discuss the results 3 results and discussion 3 1 force coefficients and the strouhal number the elliptic cylinder is exposed by the strong time dependence of the drag and lift coefficients c d and c l as shown in fig 4 a at this reynolds number of re 500 these time dependent behaviors of c d and c l are consistent with the findings of the previous studies 4 5 9 11 the modified geometries based on the hsv cylinder provide the reduction of c d and the suppression of the fluctuation of c l as shown in fig 4 b regarding to c d the time variation of its value shows the dependence of the geometric pattern in other words the geometries containing the major axis undulation without an offset angle which are the major axis undulation ma and both axis undulation ba achieves a large amount of the reduction of c d the next case in terms of the amount of the drag reduction is the geometries with offset angle and both axis undulation the minor axis undulation mi gives the smallest reduction of the drag coefficient this trend can be supported by the time averaged drag coefficient c d as shown in fig 5 and fig 6 a all modified geometries present that the reduction of c d ranges from about 5 68 to 9 44 comparing to c d of the elliptic cylinder the major axis undulation ma and both axis undulation ba reveal the similar reduction with the amounts of 9 31 and 9 44 respectively the geometries formed by the same and different offset angles with both axis undulation ma so ma do ba so ba do achieve 7 45 8 10 reduction of c d respectively leading to about the same reduction rate to c d of the elliptic cylinder finally the minor axis undulation mi provides the smallest drag reduction of 5 7 in comparison with c d of the elliptic cylinder with respect to c l the modified geometries based on the hsv give the considerable suppression of the fluctuation of c l as shown in fig 4 a and b these geometries achieve about the same c l r m s in figs 5 and 6 b which corresponds to more than 90 reduction of c l r m s of the elliptic cylinder to be specific the geometries of both axis undulation with and without the same offset angle provide more reduction of c l r m s than other ceases otherwise the minor axis undulation has a lager value of c l r m s than the cases with the major axis undulation even this geometry provides about the 70 reduction of c l r m s in comparison with the elliptic cylinder the strouhal number s t is used to evaluate the frequency of the vortex shedding in the wake thus the plots of the psd power spectrum density of the time dependent lift coefficient for different geometries are presented in fig 7 the elliptic cylinder reveals a single primary frequency governing the psd as shown in fig 7 a also the mi forms a single dominant frequency peak which is very similar to the psd for the elliptic cylinder as shown in fig 7 b the ma reveals a single dominant frequency like the elliptic cylinder and the mi but the ma forms relatively larger low frequency peaks than the elliptic cylinder and the mi as shown in fig 7 c the ba with the both axis undulation reveals more significant low frequency peaks and also high frequencies than the ma as shown in fig 7 d when the offset angle is adopted to the ma the ma so and ma do present many frequencies with the small psd comparing to the ma as shown in fig 7 e and f the ba so and ba do keep the pattern of the st of the ba resulting in the presence of low and high frequencies with the comparable psd to the primary frequency as shown in fig 7 g and h these low and high frequency peaks can be associated with the breaking of the vortex tubes and braids into smaller coherent structures in the wakes of the structure these flow structures will be presented in later which can contribute to explain the existence of the low and high frequency peaks the value of s t is dependent on the treatment of the undulation and the offset angle the values of s t for the modified geometries including the hsv ba do are smaller than s t of the elliptic cylinder as arranged in fig 5 among the features of the hsv the mi has the largest value of s t which associates to the appearance of the regular vortex shedding in wake the features with the both axis undulation provide smaller primary frequency 3 2 flow fields fig 8 show the side and top views of the typical 3d vortical structures for the elliptic cylinder and hsv like cylinders with the symmetric feature the method presented by zhou et al 1999 was used to identify these 3d vortical structures the vortical structures are identified by the negative of λ 2 which is the second largest eigenvalue of s i j 2 ω i j 2 where s i j 2 and ω i j 2 are the strain rate and rotation rate tensors respectively the elliptic cylinder clearly shows that the roll up of the separated shear layers and kármán vortices are formed in the near wake region as shown in fig 8 a the mi with the minor axis undulation also forms the kármán vortices in the wake region as shown in fig 8 b however the inter connecting hairpin like vortices periodically appears along the spanwise direction in the near wake these vortices sustain to downstream and the spanwise kármán vortices are early split as shown in fig 8 b in contrast to the elliptic and mi cylinders the ma and ba do not obviously form the kármán vortices of primary vortex structures in the wake region as shown in fig 8 c and d respectively these geometries contain the distorted vortex rollers in the near wake region these distorted vortex rollers are also observed in the helically twisted elliptic cylinder which achieved the considerable reduction of the drag and suppression of the lift fluctuation jung and yoon 2014 overall complex 3d structures are appeared with inter connecting hairpin like vortices visible in the x z plane however these inter connecting hairpin like vortices are much distorted larger and earlier merged than those of the mi fig 9 shows the side and top views of the typical 3d vortical structures for the hsv like cylinders with the offset angle feature generally the ma so ma do ba so and ba do form almost the same 3d vortical structures with the ma and the ba as shown in fig 9 a b 9 c and 9 d respectively consequently among the features of the hsv shape the major axis undulation is dominant to the modification of the vortical structures all hsv like cylinders with the major axis undulation form the similar vortical structures with the real hsv shape which corresponds to the ba do in the present study this modification of the vortical structures for the cases with the major axis undulation is consistent with the findings from other studies hanke et al 2010 morrison et al 2016 kim and yoon 2017 2018a 2018b the drag reduction and the suppression of the lift fluctuation are strongly associated to the common flow characteristics which are the retard of the vortex roll up the elongation of the vortex formation length the zero vorticity region and almost the disappearance of the vortex shedding near wake the existence of these common flow characteristics is supported by many previous studies considered the geometric disturbances of the wavy cylinder lam and lin 2008 lin et al 2016 lam et al 2004 zhang and lee 2005 xu et al 2010 the helically twisted elliptic cylinder jung and yoon 2014 kim et al 2016 wei et al 2016 stranded cable models nebres et al 1993 the asymmetric wavy cylinder yoon et al 2017 and the double wavy cylinder yoon et al 2020 in order to analyze the effect of the hsv geometric features on the components of the vorticity first the iso surfaces of the instantaneous streamwise vorticity for the cylinders of mi ma and ba with the symmetric feature are plotted in fig 10 the elliptic cylinder reveals the periodical formation of the negative and positive streamwise vorticities along the span these vorticities evolve along the downstream and the transverse direction which corresponds the vortex shedding and kármán vortices as shown in fig 10 a the mi forms the very similar iso surfaces of the streamwise vortices with the elliptic cylinder resulting in the periodical formation of the negative and positive streamwise vorticities as the presence of the vortex shedding and kármán vortices along the span as shown in fig 10 b in contrast to the elliptic and mi cylinders the ma forms the negative and positive streamwise vorticities on the upstream and the downstream surfaces as clearly shown in fig 10 c the elongation and the relatively irregular formation of the streamwise vorticities cover the wake unlike the evolution of the periodically lib like formation of the streamwise vorticities along the downstream for the elliptic and mi cylinders the ba shows the very similar iso surfaces of the streamwise vortices with the ma as shown in fig 10 d it seems that the effect of the minor axis undulation on the streamwise vortices is minute fig 11 shows the iso surfaces of the instantaneous streamwise vorticity for the cylinders with the offset angle for ma so and ma do it seems that the present offset angle does not give an obvious effect on the formation of the streamwise vorticities which can be clarified by comparing between fig 10 c for the ma without the offset angle and fig 11 a and b for the ma so and ma do with the offset angle otherwise the ba so and ba do present the effect of the offset angle on the formation of the streamwise vorticities leading to the inclined rectangular formation unlike the semicircle formation of the ba without the offset angle these different formations can be clarified by comparing between fig 10 d for the ba without the offset angle and fig 11 c and d for the ba so and ba do with the offset angle fig 12 shows the iso surfaces of the instantaneous transverse vorticity for cylinders without the offset angle the elliptic cylinder reveals the periodical formation of the negative and positive transverse vorticities along the span from the rear surface these vorticities evolve along the downstream and the transverse direction which corresponds the vortex shedding and kármán vortices as shown in fig 12 a for the mi the variation of the transverse length according to the span presents that the negative and positive vorticities periodically appear from the upstream surface and elongate to downstream as shown in fig 12 b additionally the spanwise width of each transverse vorticities becomes narrower as moving toward the rear surface the spanwise length of each vorticity is determined by the undulation size for the ma the variation of the spanwise slope by the undulation of the major axis along the span periodically forms the positive and negative vorticities on the upstream surface and the downstream surface as shown in fig 12 c the sign of the periodical array of the transverse vorticity for the ma is opposite to that of the mi also the spanwise width of each transverse vorticities of the ma near wake is wider than that of the mi the ba give a combined effect of the minor and major axis undulation on the formation of the transverse vorticities therefore as shown in fig 12 d the periodical transverse vorticities near the front stagnation are formed by the effect of ma and then the elongated periodical transverse vorticities with the opposite sign start to be appeared by the effect of mi fig 13 shows the iso surfaces of the instantaneous transverse vorticity for the hsv like cylinders with the offset angle for the ma so and ma do the effects of the same offset angle and different offset angles on the formation of the instantaneous transverse vorticity are not apparent as shown in fig 13 a and b respectively in cases of ba so and ba do the offset angle contributes the instantaneous streamwise vorticities on the surface to be the inclined rectangular formation as observed in fig 13 c and d however the effect of the offset angle on the formation of the instantaneous transverse vorticity is not considerable resulting in the similar formation with the ba as observed in fig 13 c and d for the ba so and ba do respectively fig 14 shows the iso surfaces of the instantaneous spanwise vorticities for the cylinders the elliptic cylinder clearly reveals the typical vortex shedding and kármán vortices as shown in fig 14 a also the mi shows the kármán vortices in wake in fig 14 b the ma and ba form much longer shear layers which do not appear the kármán vortices derived by the vortex shedding as shown in fig 14 c and d respectively the formations of the instantaneous spanwise vorticities for the geometries with the offset angles resemble those for the geometries without the offset angles as shown in fig 14 e h for ma so ma do ba so and ba do respectively it can be carefully concluded that the major axis undulation is more dominant to the formation of the spanwise vorticities than the minor axis undulation the typical instantaneous streamlines and the contours of the time averaged spanwise vorticity for each feature of the hsv shape in x y plane for different spanwise positions are plotted in fig 15 and fig 16 respectively the mi of the minor axis undulation the vortex roll up apparently appears although the size and the position of the vortices are dependent on the spanwise location as shown in fig 15 a the flow early separates and the separation point moves to the upstream as the span changes from s1 to s5 thus the contours of the time averaged spanwise vorticity clearly show that the upper and lower shear layers become longer and wider as the span changes from s1 to s5 as observed in fig 16 a in general the geometries with the major axis undulation form the similar streamlines according to the spanwise positions as shown in fig 15 b g when the spanwise position moves from s1 to s5 the length of the major axis becomes short leading to the change from the streamlined body to the bluff body thus the spanwise planes of s1 and s2 near the node based on the major axis does not show the reverse flow near the wake but the streamwise directional flow successively the contours of the time averaged spanwise vorticity show nearly the elongated formation of the upper and lower shear layers without rolling a tail as shown in fig 16 b g as the spanwise position moves to s3 the lower or upper vortex occurs by the flow separation further moving to s5 the vortices near wake become larger and elongated to the downstream as shown in fig 15 b g thus the appearance of the near wake vortices contributes the tails of the upper and lower shear layers to the roll up formation as shown in fig 16 b g especially the upper and lower vortices mainly elongated to the downstream and do not strongly interact each other since the vertical motion and roll up are weak thus the typical vortex roll up near wake and the vortex shedding are not observed as shown in fig 15 b g fig 17 shows the contours of the turbulent kinetic energy tke for different cylinders in the x z plane at y 0 all hsv like geometries form wider region with very small tke than the elliptic cylinder thus the significant reduction in tke in the near wake of the hsv like geometries contributes to a reduction in the drag and fluctuating lift the spanwise dependence of the maximum tke position is associated with the vortex formation length and the shear layer elongation due to the 3d geometric disturbance the longer vortex formation length and the elongated shear layer contribute to the delay of the vortex roll up and the late vortex shedding which weaken the tke and leads to the relatively stable flow these characteristics of the tke distribution by the hsv like geometries are similar to the findings of the previous researches for the geometric modification lin et al 2016 zhang and lee 2005 4 conclusions the present study numerically investigated the effect of the hsv s geometrical features on the flow structures and the force coefficients for re 500 by using the les seven geometric features were extracted from the original hsv shape and individually designed for the purpose of the comparison the elliptic cylinder was considered all cylinders based on the hsv s geometric features cylinder provided the reduction of c d and the suppression of the fluctuation of c l comparing to the elliptic cylinder the geometric feature gives an effect on c d the features of ma and ba containing the major axis undulation without an offset angle achieves a large amount of the reduction of c d the next case in terms of the amount of the drag reduction is the geometries with offset angle and both axis undulation the mi with only the minor axis gives the smallest reduction of the drag coefficient all hsv s geometric features gave the considerable suppression of the fluctuation of c l r m s the mi has a lager value of c l r m s than the features with the major axis undulation however this geometry provides about the 70 reduction of c l r m s in comparison with the elliptic cylinder the features with the major axis undulation achieved about the same c l r m s which is more than 90 reduction of c l r m s of the elliptic cylinder the mi forms a single dominant frequency peak which is very similar to the power spectrum density for the elliptic cylinder the mi formed the kármán vortices in the wake region like the elliptic cylinder regardless of the spanwise direction the ma revealed a single dominant frequency like the elliptic cylinder and the mi but the ma formed relatively larger low frequency peaks than the elliptic cylinder and the mi these low frequency peaks are more significant for the cases with which undulations were adopted to the both axis regardless of the offset angle these low frequency peaks were associated with the breaking of the vortex tubes and braids into smaller coherent structures in the wakes of the structure consequently among the features of the hsv shape the major axis undulation was dominant to the modification of the vortical structures all cylinders with the major axis undulation formed the similar vortical structures with the real hsv each component of the vorticity differently responded to the features of the hsv geometry the mi and ma formed additional streamwise vorticities over the surface however the formation of the additional streamwise vorticities was dependent on the mi and ma the offset angle modified the additional streamwise vorticities as the inclined wide formation for the transverse vorticity the mi and ma formed the additional periodical vorticities along the span with different signs on the surface the ba gave a combined effect of the mi and ma on the formation of the transverse vorticities however the effect of the offset angle on the formation of the transverse vorticity is not considerable from the spanwise vorticities it could be carefully concluded that the major axis undulation is more dominant to the formation of the spanwise vorticities than the minor axis undulation credit authorship contribution statement hyun sik yoon supervision writing original draft seok hyun nam validation investigation

stream time averaged quantity 1 introduction the control of the flow around bluff bodies has been intensively researched to insure the safety of the structures by suppressing the vortex shedding and also harvest the energy by utilizing the vortex induced vibration among the flow control methods to attenuate the vortex induced vibration the shape modification is adopted as geometric disturbances zdravkovich 1981 naudascher and rockwell 2012 ekmekci and rockwell 2010 recently as one of the geometric disturbances a harbor seal vibrissa hsv has been considered as a subject of flow controls in several studies hanke et al 2010 witte et al 2012 hans et al 2013 morrison et al 2016 wang and liu 2016 kim and yoon 2017 2018a owing to its ability to significantly suppress lift fluctuation due to its unique geometry the utilization of the harbor seal vibrissa is classified as the biomimetics the summary for the research on hsv shaped cylinders can be found in kim and yoon 2018b the ability of the hsv geometry to reduce the forces has been confirmed by hanke et al 2010 hans et al 2013 morrison et al 2016 and kim yoon kim and yoon 2017 2018a 2018b the hsv shape reduces at least 90 lift forces and about 40 the mean drag force compared with those on a circular cylinder with an identical hydraulic diameter the flow structures in the wake of the hsv have been investigated by hanke et al 2010 witte et al 2012 wang and liu 2016 and kim yoon kim and yoon 2017 2018b these studies revealed the same flow characteristics that hsv geometry does not apparently form the kármán vortices as primary vortex structures in the wake region and the wake vortices elongate further downstream the effect of the angle of attack on the flow around the hsv has been investigated by murphy et al 2013 and kim and yoon 2017 especially the fine resolution of the angle of attack was handled by kim and yoon 2017 when the angle of attack augments the flow is governed by the characteristics of the bluff body thus the unique features of the hsv is limited in the certain range of the angle of attack augments kim and yoon 2017 the effects of geometrical features of the hsv on the reduction of the forces were investigated by hans et al 2013 the geometric features of the undulations in the major and minor axis and the offset angle between leading edge and trailing edge were individually investigated by applying on the elliptic cylinder they report that the effect of the offset angle on the lift and drag coefficients is weak and the undulations on both axes are necessary for lift force reduction the effect of the reynolds number on the flow characteristics around the hsv cylinder has been studied by kim and yoon 2018b the reynolds number ranges from 50 to 500 they confirmed that the performance of the unique hsv geometry on the reduction drag and the suppression of lift fluctuation is valid in the low reynolds number regime as above mentioned the geometrical features of harbor seal whiskers were considered by only hans et al 2013 to investigated their effect on the force reduction ability thus the present study aims at investigating the effect of the geometrical features on the flow structures and the force coefficients the vibrissa s unique shape features are an elliptical cross section with undulations on major and minor axes offset angle between leading edge and trailing edge and variation of the offset angle along the length of the whisker hans et al 2013 the present study aims at achieving the idea to design the geometric disturbance for the bluff flow control to realize the reduction of the forces by analyzing the geometric features of the hsv thus the present study considers more geometric features of the hsv than hans et al 2013 each geometric feature is extracted from the original hsv shape seven hsv like geometries are designed for the purpose of the comparison the elliptic cylinder is considered the large eddy simulation les is performed to simulate flow around the cylinders with the geometric features of the hsv at the reynolds number of 500 the three dimensional vortical structures of each feature are visualized and compared with those of the elliptic cylinder to find their effect on the modification of the flow structures the components of the vorticity are analyzed by considering the iso surfaces of the vorticity contours to find their effect on the three dimensional vortical structures 2 numerical details 2 1 governing equations and numerical methods the governing equations of the unsteady three dimensional incompressible flow are the continuity and the navier stokes equations the present study utilizes the large eddy simulation les method to resolve the turbulent flow in the wake therefore the filtered governing equations are defined as follows 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u i u j x j p x i 1 re 2 u i x j x j τ i j x j where u i are the corresponding velocity components p is the pressure re is the reynolds number the τ i j is the subgrid scale stress tensor as τ i j u i u j u i u j resulting in the effect of subgrid scales on the resolved scales an overbar denotes the large scale flow obtained from grid filtering the dynamic smagorinsky subgrid scale sgs model proposed by germano et al 1991 is used to reflect the effects of unresolved small scale fluid motions further details of sgs model can be found in yoon et al 2009 jung and yoon 2014 and yoon et al 2015 especially yoon et al kim and yoon 2018a and yoon et al kim and yoon 2018b successfully used this model for the flow around the hsv at the same reynolds number of 500 all the variables are non dimensionalized by the hydraulic diameter d h and the free stream velocity u the reynolds number of re 500 are considered for spatial discretization a second order central difference scheme based on the finite volume method fvm is applied on structured grids considered in the present study for temporal discretization for governing equations a second order implicit scheme is employed the second order adams bashforth scheme and the crank nicolson scheme are used to treat the convection and the diffusion terms respectively the present numerical methods are successfully utilized for the researches on the flow around the hsv at the same reynolds number of 500 by h s yoon et al kim and yoon 2017 2018a 2018b 2 2 definition of the geometry and boundary conditions the geometry of hsv employed in this study consists of the parameters of the idealized vibrissa surface model given by hanke et al 2010 fig 1 shows the schematics of the body geometry of the hsv and coordinate system as shown in fig 1 the surface structure consists of two different inclined elliptic cross sections with offset angles of α o f f s e t and β o f f s e t respectively to the flow direction the lengths of semi major and semi minor axes are of a k and b l respectively the period length of λ p 2 65 d h is considered for all geometric features for the elliptic cylinder the lengths of semi major a and semi minor axes b are 0 722 d h and 0 354 d h respectively which is usually used in the previous researches 28 30 32 seven hsv like geometries are designed by combining the minor axis undulation the major axis undulation the both axis undulation and the offset angle the hsv like geometries are organized as the minor axis undulation mi major axis undulation ma same offset angle with major axis undulation ma so different offset angle with major axis undulation ma do both axis undulation ba same offset angle with both axis undulation ba so real whisker with different offset angle with both axis ba do table 1 show all geometries with the hsv features and their design parameters in addition the elliptic cylinder is included for the purpose of the comparison for mi of the minor axis undulation the node and the saddle are the spanwise positions with the shortest and the longest lengths of the transverse direction respectively as shown in table 1 for ma of the major axis undulation the spanwise positions of the node and the saddle are the longest and the shortest lengths of the streamwise direction for the cross section as shown in table 1 for ba of the both axis undulation in table 1 the spanwise variation of the streamwise length is the same with ma the spanwise variation of the transverse length is the same with mi for the cases of so and do with the same and different offset angle with major axis undulation respectively the node is the spanwise central position of the nodes of the leading and trailing edges the saddle is the spanwise central position of the saddles of the leading and trailing edges fig 2 shows the present computational domain of o type and the boundary conditions an inflow and outflow boundaries are located at a distance of 15 d h from the geometry the boundaries of the streamwise direction hold the inflow and outflow conditions a uniform velocity profile was used at the inlet boundary and a convective boundary condition u i t c u i x 0 was imposed on the outflow region where c is the space averaged streamwise outlet velocity the no slip and no penetration conditions were imposed on walls a neumann condition was applied for the pressure boundary a periodic boundary condition was applied in the spanwise direction and the spanwise computational domain of 3 period lengths are considered 2 3 grid dependence test and validation the investigation of the grid dependence test and the validation of our results have been performed to validate the present numerical methods and the grid system the comparisons of the time averaged drag coefficient c d the root mean square rms of lift fluctuation c l r m s and the strouhal number st with previous data are performed for the elliptic cylinder and the hsv as arranged in table 2 the drag and lift coefficient and strouhal number is defined as follow 4 c d 2 f d ρ u 2 a 5 c l 2 f l ρ u 2 a 6 s t f s d h u where f d and f l are the total drag and lift forces respectively ρ is the fluid density u is the free stream velocity a is the projected area of the cylinder facing the flow direction f s is the frequency of the vortex shedding the grid dependence test of the solution is performed for the hsv ba do which is the most complicate shape among the present geometries the three different grid systems of coarse 2 5 million grids medium 3 5 million grids and fine 4 5 million grids are considered and their corresponding results are listed in table 2 the result of our computation is found to be in fairly good agreement with previous data since the values among the three different grid systems show small variations which are not crucial the medium grid system as shown in fig 3 is employed to discuss the results 3 results and discussion 3 1 force coefficients and the strouhal number the elliptic cylinder is exposed by the strong time dependence of the drag and lift coefficients c d and c l as shown in fig 4 a at this reynolds number of re 500 these time dependent behaviors of c d and c l are consistent with the findings of the previous studies 4 5 9 11 the modified geometries based on the hsv cylinder provide the reduction of c d and the suppression of the fluctuation of c l as shown in fig 4 b regarding to c d the time variation of its value shows the dependence of the geometric pattern in other words the geometries containing the major axis undulation without an offset angle which are the major axis undulation ma and both axis undulation ba achieves a large amount of the reduction of c d the next case in terms of the amount of the drag reduction is the geometries with offset angle and both axis undulation the minor axis undulation mi gives the smallest reduction of the drag coefficient this trend can be supported by the time averaged drag coefficient c d as shown in fig 5 and fig 6 a all modified geometries present that the reduction of c d ranges from about 5 68 to 9 44 comparing to c d of the elliptic cylinder the major axis undulation ma and both axis undulation ba reveal the similar reduction with the amounts of 9 31 and 9 44 respectively the geometries formed by the same and different offset angles with both axis undulation ma so ma do ba so ba do achieve 7 45 8 10 reduction of c d respectively leading to about the same reduction rate to c d of the elliptic cylinder finally the minor axis undulation mi provides the smallest drag reduction of 5 7 in comparison with c d of the elliptic cylinder with respect to c l the modified geometries based on the hsv give the considerable suppression of the fluctuation of c l as shown in fig 4 a and b these geometries achieve about the same c l r m s in figs 5 and 6 b which corresponds to more than 90 reduction of c l r m s of the elliptic cylinder to be specific the geometries of both axis undulation with and without the same offset angle provide more reduction of c l r m s than other ceases otherwise the minor axis undulation has a lager value of c l r m s than the cases with the major axis undulation even this geometry provides about the 70 reduction of c l r m s in comparison with the elliptic cylinder the strouhal number s t is used to evaluate the frequency of the vortex shedding in the wake thus the plots of the psd power spectrum density of the time dependent lift coefficient for different geometries are presented in fig 7 the elliptic cylinder reveals a single primary frequency governing the psd as shown in fig 7 a also the mi forms a single dominant frequency peak which is very similar to the psd for the elliptic cylinder as shown in fig 7 b the ma reveals a single dominant frequency like the elliptic cylinder and the mi but the ma forms relatively larger low frequency peaks than the elliptic cylinder and the mi as shown in fig 7 c the ba with the both axis undulation reveals more significant low frequency peaks and also high frequencies than the ma as shown in fig 7 d when the offset angle is adopted to the ma the ma so and ma do present many frequencies with the small psd comparing to the ma as shown in fig 7 e and f the ba so and ba do keep the pattern of the st of the ba resulting in the presence of low and high frequencies with the comparable psd to the primary frequency as shown in fig 7 g and h these low and high frequency peaks can be associated with the breaking of the vortex tubes and braids into smaller coherent structures in the wakes of the structure these flow structures will be presented in later which can contribute to explain the existence of the low and high frequency peaks the value of s t is dependent on the treatment of the undulation and the offset angle the values of s t for the modified geometries including the hsv ba do are smaller than s t of the elliptic cylinder as arranged in fig 5 among the features of the hsv the mi has the largest value of s t which associates to the appearance of the regular vortex shedding in wake the features with the both axis undulation provide smaller primary frequency 3 2 flow fields fig 8 show the side and top views of the typical 3d vortical structures for the elliptic cylinder and hsv like cylinders with the symmetric feature the method presented by zhou et al 1999 was used to identify these 3d vortical structures the vortical structures are identified by the negative of λ 2 which is the second largest eigenvalue of s i j 2 ω i j 2 where s i j 2 and ω i j 2 are the strain rate and rotation rate tensors respectively the elliptic cylinder clearly shows that the roll up of the separated shear layers and kármán vortices are formed in the near wake region as shown in fig 8 a the mi with the minor axis undulation also forms the kármán vortices in the wake region as shown in fig 8 b however the inter connecting hairpin like vortices periodically appears along the spanwise direction in the near wake these vortices sustain to downstream and the spanwise kármán vortices are early split as shown in fig 8 b in contrast to the elliptic and mi cylinders the ma and ba do not obviously form the kármán vortices of primary vortex structures in the wake region as shown in fig 8 c and d respectively these geometries contain the distorted vortex rollers in the near wake region these distorted vortex rollers are also observed in the helically twisted elliptic cylinder which achieved the considerable reduction of the drag and suppression of the lift fluctuation jung and yoon 2014 overall complex 3d structures are appeared with inter connecting hairpin like vortices visible in the x z plane however these inter connecting hairpin like vortices are much distorted larger and earlier merged than those of the mi fig 9 shows the side and top views of the typical 3d vortical structures for the hsv like cylinders with the offset angle feature generally the ma so ma do ba so and ba do form almost the same 3d vortical structures with the ma and the ba as shown in fig 9 a b 9 c and 9 d respectively consequently among the features of the hsv shape the major axis undulation is dominant to the modification of the vortical structures all hsv like cylinders with the major axis undulation form the similar vortical structures with the real hsv shape which corresponds to the ba do in the present study this modification of the vortical structures for the cases with the major axis undulation is consistent with the findings from other studies hanke et al 2010 morrison et al 2016 kim and yoon 2017 2018a 2018b the drag reduction and the suppression of the lift fluctuation are strongly associated to the common flow characteristics which are the retard of the vortex roll up the elongation of the vortex formation length the zero vorticity region and almost the disappearance of the vortex shedding near wake the existence of these common flow characteristics is supported by many previous studies considered the geometric disturbances of the wavy cylinder lam and lin 2008 lin et al 2016 lam et al 2004 zhang and lee 2005 xu et al 2010 the helically twisted elliptic cylinder jung and yoon 2014 kim et al 2016 wei et al 2016 stranded cable models nebres et al 1993 the asymmetric wavy cylinder yoon et al 2017 and the double wavy cylinder yoon et al 2020 in order to analyze the effect of the hsv geometric features on the components of the vorticity first the iso surfaces of the instantaneous streamwise vorticity for the cylinders of mi ma and ba with the symmetric feature are plotted in fig 10 the elliptic cylinder reveals the periodical formation of the negative and positive streamwise vorticities along the span these vorticities evolve along the downstream and the transverse direction which corresponds the vortex shedding and kármán vortices as shown in fig 10 a the mi forms the very similar iso surfaces of the streamwise vortices with the elliptic cylinder resulting in the periodical formation of the negative and positive streamwise vorticities as the presence of the vortex shedding and kármán vortices along the span as shown in fig 10 b in contrast to the elliptic and mi cylinders the ma forms the negative and positive streamwise vorticities on the upstream and the downstream surfaces as clearly shown in fig 10 c the elongation and the relatively irregular formation of the streamwise vorticities cover the wake unlike the evolution of the periodically lib like formation of the streamwise vorticities along the downstream for the elliptic and mi cylinders the ba shows the very similar iso surfaces of the streamwise vortices with the ma as shown in fig 10 d it seems that the effect of the minor axis undulation on the streamwise vortices is minute fig 11 shows the iso surfaces of the instantaneous streamwise vorticity for the cylinders with the offset angle for ma so and ma do it seems that the present offset angle does not give an obvious effect on the formation of the streamwise vorticities which can be clarified by comparing between fig 10 c for the ma without the offset angle and fig 11 a and b for the ma so and ma do with the offset angle otherwise the ba so and ba do present the effect of the offset angle on the formation of the streamwise vorticities leading to the inclined rectangular formation unlike the semicircle formation of the ba without the offset angle these different formations can be clarified by comparing between fig 10 d for the ba without the offset angle and fig 11 c and d for the ba so and ba do with the offset angle fig 12 shows the iso surfaces of the instantaneous transverse vorticity for cylinders without the offset angle the elliptic cylinder reveals the periodical formation of the negative and positive transverse vorticities along the span from the rear surface these vorticities evolve along the downstream and the transverse direction which corresponds the vortex shedding and kármán vortices as shown in fig 12 a for the mi the variation of the transverse length according to the span presents that the negative and positive vorticities periodically appear from the upstream surface and elongate to downstream as shown in fig 12 b additionally the spanwise width of each transverse vorticities becomes narrower as moving toward the rear surface the spanwise length of each vorticity is determined by the undulation size for the ma the variation of the spanwise slope by the undulation of the major axis along the span periodically forms the positive and negative vorticities on the upstream surface and the downstream surface as shown in fig 12 c the sign of the periodical array of the transverse vorticity for the ma is opposite to that of the mi also the spanwise width of each transverse vorticities of the ma near wake is wider than that of the mi the ba give a combined effect of the minor and major axis undulation on the formation of the transverse vorticities therefore as shown in fig 12 d the periodical transverse vorticities near the front stagnation are formed by the effect of ma and then the elongated periodical transverse vorticities with the opposite sign start to be appeared by the effect of mi fig 13 shows the iso surfaces of the instantaneous transverse vorticity for the hsv like cylinders with the offset angle for the ma so and ma do the effects of the same offset angle and different offset angles on the formation of the instantaneous transverse vorticity are not apparent as shown in fig 13 a and b respectively in cases of ba so and ba do the offset angle contributes the instantaneous streamwise vorticities on the surface to be the inclined rectangular formation as observed in fig 13 c and d however the effect of the offset angle on the formation of the instantaneous transverse vorticity is not considerable resulting in the similar formation with the ba as observed in fig 13 c and d for the ba so and ba do respectively fig 14 shows the iso surfaces of the instantaneous spanwise vorticities for the cylinders the elliptic cylinder clearly reveals the typical vortex shedding and kármán vortices as shown in fig 14 a also the mi shows the kármán vortices in wake in fig 14 b the ma and ba form much longer shear layers which do not appear the kármán vortices derived by the vortex shedding as shown in fig 14 c and d respectively the formations of the instantaneous spanwise vorticities for the geometries with the offset angles resemble those for the geometries without the offset angles as shown in fig 14 e h for ma so ma do ba so and ba do respectively it can be carefully concluded that the major axis undulation is more dominant to the formation of the spanwise vorticities than the minor axis undulation the typical instantaneous streamlines and the contours of the time averaged spanwise vorticity for each feature of the hsv shape in x y plane for different spanwise positions are plotted in fig 15 and fig 16 respectively the mi of the minor axis undulation the vortex roll up apparently appears although the size and the position of the vortices are dependent on the spanwise location as shown in fig 15 a the flow early separates and the separation point moves to the upstream as the span changes from s1 to s5 thus the contours of the time averaged spanwise vorticity clearly show that the upper and lower shear layers become longer and wider as the span changes from s1 to s5 as observed in fig 16 a in general the geometries with the major axis undulation form the similar streamlines according to the spanwise positions as shown in fig 15 b g when the spanwise position moves from s1 to s5 the length of the major axis becomes short leading to the change from the streamlined body to the bluff body thus the spanwise planes of s1 and s2 near the node based on the major axis does not show the reverse flow near the wake but the streamwise directional flow successively the contours of the time averaged spanwise vorticity show nearly the elongated formation of the upper and lower shear layers without rolling a tail as shown in fig 16 b g as the spanwise position moves to s3 the lower or upper vortex occurs by the flow separation further moving to s5 the vortices near wake become larger and elongated to the downstream as shown in fig 15 b g thus the appearance of the near wake vortices contributes the tails of the upper and lower shear layers to the roll up formation as shown in fig 16 b g especially the upper and lower vortices mainly elongated to the downstream and do not strongly interact each other since the vertical motion and roll up are weak thus the typical vortex roll up near wake and the vortex shedding are not observed as shown in fig 15 b g fig 17 shows the contours of the turbulent kinetic energy tke for different cylinders in the x z plane at y 0 all hsv like geometries form wider region with very small tke than the elliptic cylinder thus the significant reduction in tke in the near wake of the hsv like geometries contributes to a reduction in the drag and fluctuating lift the spanwise dependence of the maximum tke position is associated with the vortex formation length and the shear layer elongation due to the 3d geometric disturbance the longer vortex formation length and the elongated shear layer contribute to the delay of the vortex roll up and the late vortex shedding which weaken the tke and leads to the relatively stable flow these characteristics of the tke distribution by the hsv like geometries are similar to the findings of the previous researches for the geometric modification lin et al 2016 zhang and lee 2005 4 conclusions the present study numerically investigated the effect of the hsv s geometrical features on the flow structures and the force coefficients for re 500 by using the les seven geometric features were extracted from the original hsv shape and individually designed for the purpose of the comparison the elliptic cylinder was considered all cylinders based on the hsv s geometric features cylinder provided the reduction of c d and the suppression of the fluctuation of c l comparing to the elliptic cylinder the geometric feature gives an effect on c d the features of ma and ba containing the major axis undulation without an offset angle achieves a large amount of the reduction of c d the next case in terms of the amount of the drag reduction is the geometries with offset angle and both axis undulation the mi with only the minor axis gives the smallest reduction of the drag coefficient all hsv s geometric features gave the considerable suppression of the fluctuation of c l r m s the mi has a lager value of c l r m s than the features with the major axis undulation however this geometry provides about the 70 reduction of c l r m s in comparison with the elliptic cylinder the features with the major axis undulation achieved about the same c l r m s which is more than 90 reduction of c l r m s of the elliptic cylinder the mi forms a single dominant frequency peak which is very similar to the power spectrum density for the elliptic cylinder the mi formed the kármán vortices in the wake region like the elliptic cylinder regardless of the spanwise direction the ma revealed a single dominant frequency like the elliptic cylinder and the mi but the ma formed relatively larger low frequency peaks than the elliptic cylinder and the mi these low frequency peaks are more significant for the cases with which undulations were adopted to the both axis regardless of the offset angle these low frequency peaks were associated with the breaking of the vortex tubes and braids into smaller coherent structures in the wakes of the structure consequently among the features of the hsv shape the major axis undulation was dominant to the modification of the vortical structures all cylinders with the major axis undulation formed the similar vortical structures with the real hsv each component of the vorticity differently responded to the features of the hsv geometry the mi and ma formed additional streamwise vorticities over the surface however the formation of the additional streamwise vorticities was dependent on the mi and ma the offset angle modified the additional streamwise vorticities as the inclined wide formation for the transverse vorticity the mi and ma formed the additional periodical vorticities along the span with different signs on the surface the ba gave a combined effect of the mi and ma on the formation of the transverse vorticities however the effect of the offset angle on the formation of the transverse vorticity is not considerable from the spanwise vorticities it could be carefully concluded that the major axis undulation is more dominant to the formation of the spanwise vorticities than the minor axis undulation credit authorship contribution statement hyun sik yoon supervision writing original draft seok hyun nam validation investigation

21307,tidal power has become the focus of research and development where a grid connected tidal turbine based permanent magnet synchronous generator pmsg via power converters are the more investigated due to their advantages like high power density favorable electricity and relatively low cost however because of the parametric uncertainties nonlinear dynamical and time varying parameters of the pmsg the controller design is a challenging work furthermore the dc link overvoltage and reactive power support are the important requirement in the tidal energy system when connected to the grid in this paper a new passivity based controller pbc that forces the pmsg to track velocity and torque trajectories is proposed and applied to generator side to address the problems faced by the conventional proportional integral pi controllers a fuzzy logic controller is adopted by the pbc to design a desired torque dynamic to guarantee a fast convergence stability and robustness against parameter variations of the closed loop a classical pi controller is applied to the grid side in order to regulate the dc link voltage and to feed the grid with only the active power the carried out

turbine passivity based current controller permanent magnet synchronous generator 1 introduction marine current renewable energy has gained a strong increasing interest where the tidal turbine based pmsg connected to the electrical grid via a buck to buck converters are the more developed during the last years an up to date of the developments and the newest achievements in large marine current turbine technologies from 500 kw to 2 mw have been reported by zhou et al 2017 the authors have provided an important background for researchers in tidal energy domain all types of the tidal turbines have been investigated evident advantages of these conversion systems are a huge potential characteristic high power density relatively low cost and the high predictability guo et al 2020 however the maximum power which can be harnessed by the marine current turbine is nonlinear due to the water flow speed also a tidal system based pmsg can extract more power than wind system with the same characteristic because of the water density which is thousand higher than the air density touimi et al 2018 moreover nonlinear dynamical of the pmsg and its parameters which can vary significantly from their nominal values make the controller design a challenging problem furthermore the efficiency of the power converter dc link overvoltage fault ride through and reactive power are considered as the important requirement for the tidal conversion system when connected to the distribution network mohanty et al 2019 nonlinear controls have been largely developed to design an appropriate controller to minimize the aforementioned issues a sliding mode control strategy was investigated for the maximum power extraction of a tidal conversion system in benelghali et al 2011 however the proposed approach extremely depends on the marine current and system model in zhou et al 2013 a 1 5 mw grid connected tidal turbine based pmsg is considered under swell effect using a classical pi controller which shows an adequate power extraction however a disturbance such as unpredictable parameter changes and sudden current flow velocity change are not evaluated the similar system was considered in zhou et al 2020 where a new active disturbance rejection controller adrc approach is developed to control a tidal turbine under disturbances and parameter uncertainties as an alternative control strategy to the conventional pi method the results show clearly that the pi strategy is very sensitive to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances the adrc treats the parameter variations or uncertainties as a single signal to be rejected i e as a generalized total disturbance which the controller can detect and cancel a previous study in gu et al 2015 proposed a terminal sliding mode current controller associated to a fuzzy logic controller for extracting maximum marine current energy the study shows that the proposed method can adaptively track the maximum marine current point and smooth the generator power fluctuations under swell effects however extensive investigation on the parameter uncertainties and the nonlinear properties of the pmsg have not been evaluated in pham et al 2018 predictive control model based fault tolerant control is developed for marine current applications based five phase pmsg a magnet failure resilient control of a tidal turbine based pmsg subjected to magnet failures is investigated by toumi et al 2019 typically demagnetization hence a magnetic equivalent circuit method is used for magnet failures modeling then a second order sliding mode control is adopted to address the robustness issues faced by the conventional pi methods however only the impact of magnets failure on the tidal turbine is considered the other kind of disturbances such as parameters variations and external disturbances are not considered in order to achieve the maximum power extraction under large parametric nonlinearities and uncertainties of a new hydrostatic tidal turbine in yin and zhao 2019 a nonlinear predictive controller that uses short term predictions of the approaching tidal speed field when is below the rated value is proposed an integral action is incorporated into the control loop and a nonlinear observer based smooth second order sliding mode control to improve the robustness against parameter variations and uncertainties the same system is also investigated in yin and zhao 2020 a nonlinear observer based extreme learning machine is proposed a comparison with the conventional pid control showed that the proposed control systems achieved much better performance however as mentioned in yang et al 2013 the aforementioned strategies are signal based and a large part of them usually neglect the physical properties of the pmsg during the controller computation in this paper a new passivity based controller pbc is proposed the approach has the advantage to be energy based design the controller forces the pmsg to operate at an optimal torque and track time varying speed of the tidal turbine the pbc was introduced to define a controller design methodology that achieves stabilization by reshaping the natural energy of the system and inject the required damping term the main objective is to bring the system to a desired dynamic without canceling the nonlinear dynamics and avoid introducing singularities in the closed loop achour et al 2009 the inherent advantages of this method are the guaranteed stability enhanced robustness properties and the compensation of the nonlinear terms in a damped way and not by cancellation the proposed technique introduces a fast internal loop that decouples the variables from the pmsg and allows the pbc to be faster and more efficient where a fuzzy logic controller is adopted to design a desired torque dynamic to guarantee a fast convergence stability and robustness against parameter variations of the closed loop the pbc was introduced by nicklasson et al 1994 to control general rotating electrical machine then it was instrumented as a solution for a synchronous generator pérez et al 1997 several publications including some variants of this approach applied to the pmsg have been appeared in the literature an adaptive version of the standard nonlinear passivity based control that ensures asymptotic convergence to the maximum power point of wind system connected to a battery is proposed in david and ortega 2012 the adaptation mainly is based on wind speed estimated the standard pbc is a variation of pbc that is principally used for systems described by euler lagrange equations ortega and spong 1989 a similar proposed in cisneros et al 2013 replaced the battery by the dc link with grid connection this modification has significantly complicated the control design so a pi pbc is proposed to control the grid side to compensate the coupling term from the pmsg based wind turbine in santos et al 2015 an interconnection and damping assignment passivity based control ida pbc approach is investigated the ida pbc doesn t propose the storage function of the closed loop as in the calssical pbc but derives as a result of the choice of the interconnection and damping structures of system a passivity based sliding mode control to achieve mppt of the pmsg based system is presented in yang et al 2018 the aim is to enhance the system robustness by incorporating a sliding mode control smc to the pbc the authors in yang et al 2018 presented on the same conversion model a passivity based linear feedback control for pmsg which is used to achieve mppt the sliding mode control is replaced by a linear feedback control in subramaniam and joo 2019 passivity based control is fuzzy logic control and the integral sliding mode control for the pmsg to gain the asymptotically stability using a suitable fuzzy lyapunov function recently a large part of the control methods that are inspired from the wind technologies are in the development or testing phase and the reference technology has not yet clearly established this work is motivated by the fact of controlling the pmsg without neglecting its mechanical part or removing it to make it work at an optimal point the key challenge is the maintaining of the dc link voltage and the reactive power to their references value whatever the disturbances related to nonlinear properties of the pmsg and its parameters which can vary significantly from their nominal values the system dynamics is taken as a feedback interconnection of a two passive subsystem the passivity control is applied only to the first the electrical subsystem where the second the mechanical subsystem is leaved as a passive perturbation the key issue is to identify the workless force terms which appear in the process model which have no effect on its dynamics hence there is no need for their cancellation this leads to simple control structure and enhances the system robustness compared to conventional approaches such as second order sliding mode control benelghali et al 2011 and pi control zhou et al 2013 the proposed fuzzy pbc has the following advantages it presents simple structure and mathematical calculation it shows a fast convergence and guarantees stability considering the nonlinear model of the system and it provides a higher robustness against parameter variations this proposed method is related to previous work achour et al 2009 concerning the current control of a permanent magnet synchronous motor pmsm the contributions of this paper are summarized as follow in achour et al 2009 where the objective is the control of the permanent magnet synchronous motor pmsm the mechanical torque tm in equation 7 is estimated but in this work the pbc is used to control the pmsg where the mechanical torque tm is generated by the tidal turbine which is a useful input for the pmsg also the speed imposed on the pmsg is that of the tidal turbine which requires an adaptation of the control law hence the proposed passivity based current controller is modified a linear feedback is applied to the pmsg model that allows the maintaining of the armature reaction flux in quadrature with the rotor flux which introduces a fast internal loop that decouples the variables from the pmsg this leads to simple control structure and simple mathematical calculation and allows the pbc to be faster and more efficient also a fuzzy logic controller is adopted to design the desired torque dynamic to guarantee a fast convergence stability and robustness against parameter variations of the controlled system in the proposed method the dynamics of the pmsg were represented as feedback interconnection of a passive electrical and mechanical subsystem the pbc is applied only to the electrical subsystem while the mechanical subsystem has been treated as a passive perturbation the use of the pmsg dq model in the computation of the pbc avoids the model structure destruction due to singularities since dq model does not depend explicitly on the rotor angular position the pbc is an energy based approach therefore the dependence of the controller on system parameters is extremely reduced and avoids the cancellation of non linearities of the system then the dynamic response is fast efficient the asymptotic stability and the robustness of the conversion system are improved the remained of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the model of the marine current turbine and the pmsg are developed section 3 provide the design procedure of pbc applied to the machine side converter msc section 4 deals with pi controller applied to grid side converter gsc section 5 deals with pi controller applied to gsc simulation results are presented in section 6 considering different cases of the system operation to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method at last section 7 presents the conclusion of the paper 1 1 tidal conversion system configuration the configuration of the closed loop system is depicted in fig 1 it consists of a tidal turbine a pmsg connected to the electrical grid via a pwm converters in this work we focus on the regulation of the dc voltage and the reactive power to their reference values as indicated in section 1 the dynamic of the tidal turbine based pmsg present a nonlinear differential equation also to improve the operation efficiency the conversion system needs an effective optimal energy extraction the msc controller has the purpose to transmit the power captured by the turbine with reduced losses which results in the maintaining of the dc link voltage to its reference value while the grid side control is responsible to deliver only the active power to the grid 1 2 tidal turbine model the mechanical power which can harness by tidal turbine is given by gu et al 2015 1 p m 1 2 ρ c p β λ π a v t 3 2 c p β λ 0 5 116 λ i 0 4 β 5 e 21

first step of our design procedure the decomposition of the pmsg model into the feedback interconnection of two passive subsystems its electrical and mechanical dynamics where the latter can be treated as a passive disturbance we design then a pbc for the electrical subsystem and a damping term is injected to make the electrical subsystem strictly passive which forces the pmsg to track velocity the design procedure of the passivity based current control with linear feedback applied to the msc is represented by fig 2 it consists in tow main parts the desired dynamics described as the reference current and the reference electromagnetic torque and then calculating the control voltage the following sub paragraph recalls the definition of the concept of passivity 1 5 passivity concept review passivity is applied to nonlinear systems which are modeled ordinary by a differential equation let us review some concepts related to a passivity the reader is referred to nicklasson et al 1994 for more details we consider a dynamical nonlinear system expressed such that 9 x f x u y h x u where x r n denotes the state u r p and y r p are the input and the output respectively with f 0 0 h 0 0 definition 1 system 9 is said to be passive if there exists a nonnegative function v x called the storage function such that 10 v x v x 0 0 t y t τ u τ d τ where x 0 x 0 r n if in addition there is a positive definite function s r n r such for all u r p and all x 0 r n 11 v x v x 0 0 t y t τ u τ d τ 0 t s x τ d τ then system 9 is said to be strictly passive 1 6 linear feedback current controlled dq model of the pmsg the interdependence between the flux linkage ψ d q and the current vector i d q can be expressed as follow 12 ψ d q ψ d ψ q l d q i d q ψ f substituting the i d q expression obtained from 9 in 6 yields 13 v d q r d q i d q d ψ d q d t p ω m i ψ d q before calculating the pbc we will apply to the pmsg a nonlinear feedback which allows maintaining the armature reaction flux in quadrature with the rotor flux this flux orientation control will enforce the d axis current i d to zero and the behavior of the pmsg will be similar to that of a dc generator so this control method has a linearizing feedback the equation that expresses this linearizing feedback is given as 14 v d p ω m l q i q the application of the relation 11 to the model 10 imposes a zero i d current and we get then the following simplified model 15 v q r s i q d ψ q d t p ω m i ψ q the proportional integral pi loop which forces the quadrature current i q to track the reference value i q is 16 v q k q p i q i q k q i 0 t i q i q d t then the pmsg model decoupled by the oriented flux control given below is controlled by the input i q 17 d ψ q d t p ω m ψ q r s i q 18 j d ω m d t t m t

interconnection of two passive subsystems property the input output relationship of the electrical subsystem modeled by 13 is given as 20 σ e v e v d q ω m y e i d q t m the mechanical subsystem given in relation 7 is represented by the following expression 21 σ m v m t e m t m y e ω m t e m t m j s f f v the previous decomposition allows us to formulate the following lemma lemma 1 under the above conditions the pmsg can be considered as the interconnection by a negative feedback of two passive subsystems σ e and σ m the proof of this lemma is given in appendix a 1 8 passivity property of the pmsg in dq frame considering the model 7 8 and 13 we can formulate the following lemma lemma 2 the relationship m d q i d q ψ d q describing the electrical part 13 is strictly passive if the vector of the currents i d q and the flux linkage vector ψ d q are taken as input and output vector respectively the proof of this lemma is given in appendix b 1 9 fuzzy passivity based linear feedback controller structure of a pmsg we consider the desired value of the flux linkage vector ψ d q ψ d ψ q t and the vector of the tracking error of these greatness is e f e f d e f q t ψ d q ψ d q by replacing e f in eq 13 we deduce the dynamic equation of e f by considering the function v e f 0 5 e f t e f and by using the lyapunov theory we deduce the control signals i d q i d i q t which ensure

error is given in appendix b 1 10 desired flux computation the computation of the control signal i d q requires the desired flux vector ψ d q if the direct current i d is maintained equal to zero then the pmsg operates under maximum torque under this condition and using 12 it results achour et al 2009 23 ψ q l q i q therefore the expression of the flux reference is deduced from 8 and 23 as 24 ψ q 2 3 l q p φ f t e m where t e m is the desired torque 1 11 desired torque computation using a fuzzy logic controller from the mechanical dynamic eq 18 and taking the rotor speed ω m equal to its set point we compute the desired torque which is given as follows 25 t e m j d ω m d t f f v ω m t m where ω m is the tidal turbine speed this expression of the desired torque t e m has two drawbacks it is in an open loop and its convergence is limited by the mechanical parameters j f f v of the pmsg in this work we introduced a fuzzy logic controller to design the desired torque dynamic to eliminate the static error stability and robustness against parameter variations of the closed loop and ensure the fast convergence of the speed tracking error ε m ω m ω m then the desired torque is computed as expressed in fig 3 the fuzzy controller design procedure has three steps which are fuzzification rule base and defuzzification two inputs signals are considered for the fuzzy block the speed error ε m and its derivative the membership function of the fuzzy controller inputs and outputs shown as two trapezoidal and three triangular groups type see fig 4 in table 1 we definite five fuzzy sets linguistic variables for the inputs and outputs of the fuzzy logic block to get the rule base which are expressed as negative big nb negative small ns zero z positive small ps positive big pb the defuzzification step is performed by using the center of gravity method 1 12 conventional pi controller of a pmsg the pi controller used in this work in order to compare the performances of the proposed pbc strategy has two interdependent loops the d axis current loop and the q axis current loop as illustrated in fig 5 the first loop aim is to fix at unity power factor by controlling the d axis stator current i d component and setting the desired d axis stator current i d to zero the q axis loop has the objective to control the generator speed and torque by computing the desired q axis component of the stator current with a tidal turbine which is the reference speed and pmsg speed tracking error khefifi et al 2019 the voltage controller components of the pmsg can be computed by the following expression 26 v d v d ω e l q i q 27 v q v d ω e l d i d φ f with 28 v d k d p p i i d i d k d i p i 0 t i d i d d τ 29 v q k q p p i i q i q k q i p i 0 t i q i q d τ where k d p p i 0 k d

using the pi controller the purpose of gsc is to regulate the dc voltage at its predefined desired value and inject only the active power into the grid which means regulate the reactive power to zero

frame voltage components v g d and v g q are the grid voltage components in the dq axis i d f and i q f are the dq frame current of grid l f is the filter inductance r f is the filter resistance ω is the network angular frequency the electrical grid control consists to inject only the active power into the grid by enforcing quadrature current i q f to zero and the d axis reference current i d f is determined by dc bus voltage controller the pi controller contains tow closed control loop the outer associated with the dc link capacitor voltage and the inner loop is adopted to track the line current control so the pi regulator is employed in order to generate the reference source d axis current i d f and specifies the dc link at a constant value regardless the continue change in tidal

i q f 2 simulation results and observation the proposed control structure of fig 2 were performed using the simulated tidal conversion system illustrated on fig 7 under matlab simulink environment based on pmsg with rated power of 1 5 mw and rated speed of 125 rpm the dc link reference is set to 1150v and the reference reactive power is fixed to zero in order to confirm the proposed method performances and reliability the parameters used for the simulation of the conversion system are defined in table 2 from the pole placement method the gains concerning the generator side and the grid side current pi controller are listed in table 3 the proposed fuzzy passivity based linear feedback current fpblfc controller will be compared to the conventional pi controller method the simulation tests are divides into two scenarios the first aspect shows the performance of the conversion system to the initial parameter values the second scenario concerns the robustness tests of the proposed control design against parameter changes and disturbances is carried out three cases are studied in this part in the first case a variation of 50 of the stator resistance value r s is performed for the second case a variation 100 of the total inertia j is simulated and the last test deal with the simultaneous variation of 50 r s and 100 j concerning the pbc simulation the parameter k f q 100 2 1 performance of the proposed method under initial parameter values fig 8 illustrate the used tidal speed characteristics with variation between 4 m s and 8 m s fig 9 show the dc link voltage response which indicates that the dc voltage under the fpblfc method is very well maintained at its reference value 1150v with an extremely fast convergence when compared to the pi response which present a slow convergence figs 10 and 11 show that only the active power is transmitted to the grid while the reactive power is very well kept at its zero reference value as indicates that the reactive power is extremely minimized for both conventional and proposed control however as can be seen the fpblfc strategy present a fast convergence to the zero reference then the conventional one in fig 12 it can be seen that the control operation achieves with a perfect sinusoidal grid voltage absorption without overshoot in this part the control objectives of the proposed method are very well achieved for the initial parameter conditions the proposed fpblfc method provides a best performance when compared to the conventional pi method as demonstrated the fpblfc controller show a higher tracking error with a fast convergence of the dc link voltage and the reactive power 2 2 performance of the proposed method under parameter changes case 1 a change of 50 of the stator resistance r s due to the pmsg dynamical the stator resistance is influenced by the temperature consequently the stator currents dynamic becomes more aggressive in figs 13 and 14 we can see that a change of 50 of the stator resistance does not influence the speed convergence of the fpblfc strategy for all the dc link voltage and the reactive power responses when compared to the pi control which its response present an increases of the convergence error due to the fixed gains that are very sensitive to parameter changes this means that the proposed fpblfc controller has remedied to the disturbance of the pmsg this is due to the imposed damping gain k f q appearing on the pbc design in eq 22 which compensated the variation because it is these gain that ensure robustness if it is chosen large compared to r s value case 2 a change of 100 of the total inertia j as can be seen in figs 15 and 16 a change of 100 of the inertia moment j has no influence on the system performance this is because the fpblfc controller design illustrated in section 4 which is not influenced by the total moment j due to the fuzzy controller of fig 4 that has compensated the effect of j on the mechanical part however the conventional is also influenced by the variation of total moment for the same reason as in the previous case case 3 a simultaneous variation of 50 of the stator resistance r s and 100 of the total inertia j as indicated in figs 17 and 18 a simultaneous variation of 50 of the stator resistance r s and 100 of the total inertia j give a similar response concerning the proposed fpblfc controller as in the case 2 this is due to the procedure design of the pbc in section 3 and 4 which compensate the parametric uncertainties as well as the convergence of the pursuit errors which is assured while the classical method which is impacted by simultaneous change 2 3 comparative analyse of the proposed method with the conventional pi controller all tests performed in this section under the simulated conversion system platform show clearly that the fpblfc control strategy exhibits an efficient tracking speed furthermore the fpblfc controller present an extremely robustness performance against parameter changes compared to the classical pi controller so as depicted the proposed control method has a higher effectiveness 3 conclusion in paper a new passivity based controller associated with a fuzzy logic controller for a tidal conversion system based pmsg has been developed the modeling and methodology for the proposed strategy applied to pmsg has been described analyzed and compared to the conventional pi controller the simulation results show the effectiveness of the conversion system with the inclusion of the dynamics of the pmsg the simulation studies under matlab simulink show the fast tracking of the maximum tidal power point the dc link is very well kept at its constant value and reactive power generated is extremely minimized with the proposed method the control strategy is reasonable simple structure and is highly promising in tidal energy applications the tidal conversion system based pmsg provides a good performance significant robustness against generator

controller to minimize the aforementioned issues a sliding mode control strategy was investigated for the maximum power extraction of a tidal conversion system in benelghali et al 2011 however the proposed approach extremely depends on the marine current and system model in zhou et al 2013 a 1 5 mw grid connected tidal turbine based pmsg is considered under swell effect using a classical pi controller which shows an adequate power extraction however a disturbance such as unpredictable parameter changes and sudden current flow velocity change are not evaluated the similar system was considered in zhou et al 2020 where a new active disturbance rejection controller adrc approach is developed to control a tidal turbine under disturbances and parameter uncertainties as an alternative control strategy to the conventional pi method the results show clearly that the pi strategy is very sensitive to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances the adrc treats the parameter variations or uncertainties as a single signal to be rejected i e as a generalized total disturbance which the controller can detect and cancel a previous study in gu et al 2015 proposed a terminal sliding mode current controller associated to a fuzzy logic controller for extracting maximum marine current energy the study shows that the proposed method can adaptively track the maximum marine current point and smooth the generator power fluctuations under swell effects however extensive investigation on the parameter uncertainties and the nonlinear properties of the pmsg have not been evaluated in pham et al 2018 predictive control model based fault tolerant control is developed for marine current applications based five phase pmsg a magnet failure resilient control of a tidal turbine based pmsg subjected to magnet failures is investigated by toumi et al 2019 typically demagnetization hence a magnetic equivalent circuit method is used for magnet failures modeling then a second order sliding mode control is adopted to address the robustness issues faced by the conventional pi methods however only the impact of magnets failure on the tidal turbine is considered the other kind of disturbances such as parameters variations and external disturbances are not considered in order to achieve the maximum power extraction under large parametric nonlinearities and uncertainties of a new hydrostatic tidal turbine in yin and zhao 2019 a nonlinear predictive controller that uses short term predictions of the approaching tidal speed field when is below the rated value is proposed an integral action is incorporated into the control loop and a nonlinear observer based smooth second order sliding mode control to improve the robustness against parameter variations and uncertainties the same system is also investigated in yin and zhao 2020 a nonlinear observer based extreme learning machine is proposed a comparison with the conventional pid control showed that the proposed control systems achieved much better performance however as mentioned in yang et al 2013 the aforementioned strategies are signal based and a large part of them usually neglect the physical properties of the pmsg during the controller computation in this paper a new passivity based controller pbc is proposed the approach has the advantage to be energy based design the controller forces the pmsg to operate at an optimal torque and track time varying speed of the tidal turbine the pbc was introduced to define a controller design methodology that achieves stabilization by reshaping the natural energy of the system and inject the required damping term the main objective is to bring the system to a desired dynamic without canceling the nonlinear dynamics and avoid introducing singularities in the closed loop achour et al 2009 the inherent advantages of this method are the guaranteed stability enhanced robustness properties and the compensation of the nonlinear terms in a damped way and not by cancellation the proposed technique introduces a fast internal loop that decouples the variables from the pmsg and allows the pbc to be faster and more efficient where a fuzzy logic controller is adopted to design a desired torque dynamic to guarantee a fast convergence stability and robustness against parameter variations of the closed loop the pbc was introduced by nicklasson et al 1994 to control general rotating electrical machine then it was instrumented as a solution for a synchronous generator pérez et al 1997 several publications including some variants of this approach applied to the pmsg have been appeared in the literature an adaptive version of the standard nonlinear passivity based control that ensures asymptotic convergence to the maximum power point of wind system connected to a battery is proposed in david and ortega 2012 the adaptation mainly is based on wind speed estimated the standard pbc is a variation of pbc that is principally used for systems described by euler lagrange equations ortega and spong 1989 a similar proposed in cisneros et al 2013 replaced the battery by the dc link with grid connection this modification has significantly complicated the control design so a pi pbc is proposed to control the grid side to compensate the coupling term from the pmsg based wind turbine in santos et al 2015 an interconnection and damping assignment passivity based control ida pbc approach is investigated the ida pbc doesn t propose the storage function of the closed loop as in the calssical pbc but derives as a result of the choice of the interconnection and damping structures of system a passivity based sliding mode control to achieve mppt of the pmsg based system is presented in yang et al 2018 the aim is to enhance the system robustness by incorporating a sliding mode control smc to the pbc the authors in yang et al 2018 presented on the same conversion model a passivity based linear feedback control for pmsg which is used to achieve mppt the sliding mode control is replaced by a linear feedback control in subramaniam and joo 2019 passivity based control is fuzzy logic control and the integral sliding mode control for the pmsg to gain the asymptotically stability using a suitable fuzzy lyapunov function recently a large part of the control methods that are inspired from the wind technologies are in the development or testing phase and the reference technology has not yet clearly established this work is motivated by the fact of controlling the pmsg without neglecting its mechanical part or removing it to make it work at an optimal point the key challenge is the maintaining of the dc link voltage and the reactive power to their references value whatever the disturbances related to nonlinear properties of the pmsg and its parameters which can vary significantly from their nominal values the system dynamics is taken as a feedback interconnection of a two passive subsystem the passivity control is applied only to the first the electrical subsystem where the second the mechanical subsystem is leaved as a passive perturbation the key issue is to identify the workless force terms which appear in the process model which have no effect on its dynamics hence there is no need for their cancellation this leads to simple control structure and enhances the system robustness compared to conventional approaches such as second order sliding mode control benelghali et al 2011 and pi control zhou et al 2013 the proposed fuzzy pbc has the following advantages it presents simple structure and mathematical calculation it shows a fast convergence and guarantees stability considering the nonlinear model of the system and it provides a higher robustness against parameter variations this proposed method is related to previous work achour et al 2009 concerning the current control of a permanent magnet synchronous motor pmsm the contributions of this paper are summarized as follow in achour et al 2009 where the objective is the control of the permanent magnet synchronous motor pmsm the mechanical torque tm in equation 7 is estimated but in this work the pbc is used to control the pmsg where the mechanical torque tm is generated by the tidal turbine which is a useful input for the pmsg also the speed imposed on the pmsg is that of the tidal turbine which requires an adaptation of the control law hence the proposed passivity based current controller is modified a linear feedback is applied to the pmsg model that allows the maintaining of the armature reaction flux in quadrature with the rotor flux which introduces a fast internal loop that decouples the variables from the pmsg this leads to simple control structure and simple mathematical calculation and allows the pbc to be faster and more efficient also a fuzzy logic controller is adopted to design the desired torque dynamic to guarantee a fast convergence stability and robustness against parameter variations of the controlled system in the proposed method the dynamics of the pmsg were represented as feedback interconnection of a passive electrical and mechanical subsystem the pbc is applied only to the electrical subsystem while the mechanical subsystem has been treated as a passive perturbation the use of the pmsg dq model in the computation of the pbc avoids the model structure destruction due to singularities since dq model does not depend explicitly on the rotor angular position the pbc is an energy based approach therefore the dependence of the controller on system parameters is extremely reduced and avoids the cancellation of non linearities of the system then the dynamic response is fast efficient the asymptotic stability and the robustness of the conversion system are improved the remained of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the model of the marine current turbine and the pmsg are developed section 3 provide the design procedure of pbc applied to the machine side converter msc section 4 deals with pi controller applied to grid side converter gsc section 5 deals with pi controller applied to gsc simulation results are presented in section 6 considering different cases of the system operation to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method at last section 7 presents the conclusion of the paper 1 1 tidal conversion system configuration the configuration of the closed loop system is depicted in fig 1 it consists of a tidal turbine a pmsg connected to the electrical grid via a pwm converters in this work we focus on the regulation of the dc voltage and the reactive power to their reference values as indicated in section 1 the dynamic of the tidal turbine based pmsg present a nonlinear differential equation also to improve the operation efficiency the conversion system needs an effective optimal energy extraction the msc controller has the purpose to transmit the power captured by the turbine with reduced losses which results in the maintaining of the dc link voltage to its reference value while the grid side control is responsible to deliver only the active power to the grid 1 2 tidal turbine model the mechanical power which can harness by tidal turbine is given by gu et al 2015 1 p m 1 2 ρ c p β λ π a v t 3 2 c p β λ 0 5 116 λ i 0 4 β 5 e 21

first step of our design procedure the decomposition of the pmsg model into the feedback interconnection of two passive subsystems its electrical and mechanical dynamics where the latter can be treated as a passive disturbance we design then a pbc for the electrical subsystem and a damping term is injected to make the electrical subsystem strictly passive which forces the pmsg to track velocity the design procedure of the passivity based current control with linear feedback applied to the msc is represented by fig 2 it consists in tow main parts the desired dynamics described as the reference current and the reference electromagnetic torque and then calculating the control voltage the following sub paragraph recalls the definition of the concept of passivity 1 5 passivity concept review passivity is applied to nonlinear systems which are modeled ordinary by a differential equation let us review some concepts related to a passivity the reader is referred to nicklasson et al 1994 for more details we consider a dynamical nonlinear system expressed such that 9 x f x u y h x u where x r n denotes the state u r p and y r p are the input and the output respectively with f 0 0 h 0 0 definition 1 system 9 is said to be passive if there exists a nonnegative function v x called the storage function such that 10 v x v x 0 0 t y t τ u τ d τ where x 0 x 0 r n if in addition there is a positive definite function s r n r such for all u r p and all x 0 r n 11 v x v x 0 0 t y t τ u τ d τ 0 t s x τ d τ then system 9 is said to be strictly passive 1 6 linear feedback current controlled dq model of the pmsg the interdependence between the flux linkage ψ d q and the current vector i d q can be expressed as follow 12 ψ d q ψ d ψ q l d q i d q ψ f substituting the i d q expression obtained from 9 in 6 yields 13 v d q r d q i d q d ψ d q d t p ω m i ψ d q before calculating the pbc we will apply to the pmsg a nonlinear feedback which allows maintaining the armature reaction flux in quadrature with the rotor flux this flux orientation control will enforce the d axis current i d to zero and the behavior of the pmsg will be similar to that of a dc generator so this control method has a linearizing feedback the equation that expresses this linearizing feedback is given as 14 v d p ω m l q i q the application of the relation 11 to the model 10 imposes a zero i d current and we get then the following simplified model 15 v q r s i q d ψ q d t p ω m i ψ q the proportional integral pi loop which forces the quadrature current i q to track the reference value i q is 16 v q k q p i q i q k q i 0 t i q i q d t then the pmsg model decoupled by the oriented flux control given below is controlled by the input i q 17 d ψ q d t p ω m ψ q r s i q 18 j d ω m d t t m t

interconnection of two passive subsystems property the input output relationship of the electrical subsystem modeled by 13 is given as 20 σ e v e v d q ω m y e i d q t m the mechanical subsystem given in relation 7 is represented by the following expression 21 σ m v m t e m t m y e ω m t e m t m j s f f v the previous decomposition allows us to formulate the following lemma lemma 1 under the above conditions the pmsg can be considered as the interconnection by a negative feedback of two passive subsystems σ e and σ m the proof of this lemma is given in appendix a 1 8 passivity property of the pmsg in dq frame considering the model 7 8 and 13 we can formulate the following lemma lemma 2 the relationship m d q i d q ψ d q describing the electrical part 13 is strictly passive if the vector of the currents i d q and the flux linkage vector ψ d q are taken as input and output vector respectively the proof of this lemma is given in appendix b 1 9 fuzzy passivity based linear feedback controller structure of a pmsg we consider the desired value of the flux linkage vector ψ d q ψ d ψ q t and the vector of the tracking error of these greatness is e f e f d e f q t ψ d q ψ d q by replacing e f in eq 13 we deduce the dynamic equation of e f by considering the function v e f 0 5 e f t e f and by using the lyapunov theory we deduce the control signals i d q i d i q t which ensure

error is given in appendix b 1 10 desired flux computation the computation of the control signal i d q requires the desired flux vector ψ d q if the direct current i d is maintained equal to zero then the pmsg operates under maximum torque under this condition and using 12 it results achour et al 2009 23 ψ q l q i q therefore the expression of the flux reference is deduced from 8 and 23 as 24 ψ q 2 3 l q p φ f t e m where t e m is the desired torque 1 11 desired torque computation using a fuzzy logic controller from the mechanical dynamic eq 18 and taking the rotor speed ω m equal to its set point we compute the desired torque which is given as follows 25 t e m j d ω m d t f f v ω m t m where ω m is the tidal turbine speed this expression of the desired torque t e m has two drawbacks it is in an open loop and its convergence is limited by the mechanical parameters j f f v of the pmsg in this work we introduced a fuzzy logic controller to design the desired torque dynamic to eliminate the static error stability and robustness against parameter variations of the closed loop and ensure the fast convergence of the speed tracking error ε m ω m ω m then the desired torque is computed as expressed in fig 3 the fuzzy controller design procedure has three steps which are fuzzification rule base and defuzzification two inputs signals are considered for the fuzzy block the speed error ε m and its derivative the membership function of the fuzzy controller inputs and outputs shown as two trapezoidal and three triangular groups type see fig 4 in table 1 we definite five fuzzy sets linguistic variables for the inputs and outputs of the fuzzy logic block to get the rule base which are expressed as negative big nb negative small ns zero z positive small ps positive big pb the defuzzification step is performed by using the center of gravity method 1 12 conventional pi controller of a pmsg the pi controller used in this work in order to compare the performances of the proposed pbc strategy has two interdependent loops the d axis current loop and the q axis current loop as illustrated in fig 5 the first loop aim is to fix at unity power factor by controlling the d axis stator current i d component and setting the desired d axis stator current i d to zero the q axis loop has the objective to control the generator speed and torque by computing the desired q axis component of the stator current with a tidal turbine which is the reference speed and pmsg speed tracking error khefifi et al 2019 the voltage controller components of the pmsg can be computed by the following expression 26 v d v d ω e l q i q 27 v q v d ω e l d i d φ f with 28 v d k d p p i i d i d k d i p i 0 t i d i d d τ 29 v q k q p p i i q i q k q i p i 0 t i q i q d τ where k d p p i 0 k d

using the pi controller the purpose of gsc is to regulate the dc voltage at its predefined desired value and inject only the active power into the grid which means regulate the reactive power to zero

frame voltage components v g d and v g q are the grid voltage components in the dq axis i d f and i q f are the dq frame current of grid l f is the filter inductance r f is the filter resistance ω is the network angular frequency the electrical grid control consists to inject only the active power into the grid by enforcing quadrature current i q f to zero and the d axis reference current i d f is determined by dc bus voltage controller the pi controller contains tow closed control loop the outer associated with the dc link capacitor voltage and the inner loop is adopted to track the line current control so the pi regulator is employed in order to generate the reference source d axis current i d f and specifies the dc link at a constant value regardless the continue change in tidal turbine while the q axis current i q f is produced by the reactive power q g see fig 6 the model of the dc voltage is 32 c d v d c d t 3 2 v g d v d c i d f i d c where v d c is the dc link voltage i d c is the grid side transmission line current and c is the dc link capacitor the pi current controller can be expressed as follow 33 v g d p i k g p d i d f r e f i d f k g i d 0 t i d f r e f i d f

i q f 2 simulation results and observation the proposed control structure of fig 2 were performed using the simulated tidal conversion system illustrated on fig 7 under matlab simulink environment based on pmsg with rated power of 1 5 mw and rated speed of 125 rpm the dc link reference is set to 1150v and the reference reactive power is fixed to zero in order to confirm the proposed method performances and reliability the parameters used for the simulation of the conversion system are defined in table 2 from the pole placement method the gains concerning the generator side and the grid side current pi controller are listed in table 3 the proposed fuzzy passivity based linear feedback current fpblfc controller will be compared to the conventional pi controller method the simulation tests are divides into two scenarios the first aspect shows the performance of the conversion system to the initial parameter values the second scenario concerns the robustness tests of the proposed control design against parameter changes and disturbances is carried out three cases are studied in this part in the first case a variation of 50 of the stator resistance value r s is performed for the second case a variation 100 of the total inertia j is simulated and the last test deal with the simultaneous variation of 50 r s and 100 j concerning the pbc simulation the parameter k f q 100 2 1 performance of the proposed method under initial parameter values fig 8 illustrate the used tidal speed characteristics with variation between 4 m s and 8 m s fig 9 show the dc link voltage response which indicates that the dc voltage under the fpblfc method is very well maintained at its reference value 1150v with an extremely fast convergence when compared to the pi response which present a slow convergence figs 10 and 11 show that only the active power is transmitted to the grid while the reactive power is very well kept at its zero reference value as indicates that the reactive power is extremely minimized for both conventional and proposed control however as can be seen the fpblfc strategy present a fast convergence to the zero reference then the conventional one in fig 12 it can be seen that the control operation achieves with a perfect sinusoidal grid voltage absorption without overshoot in this part the control objectives of the proposed method are very well achieved for the initial parameter conditions the proposed fpblfc method provides a best performance when compared to the conventional pi method as demonstrated the fpblfc controller show a higher tracking error with a fast convergence of the dc link voltage and the reactive power 2 2 performance of the proposed method under parameter changes case 1 a change of 50 of the stator resistance r s due to the pmsg dynamical the stator resistance is influenced by the temperature consequently the stator currents dynamic becomes more aggressive in figs 13 and 14 we can see that a change of 50 of the stator resistance does not influence the speed convergence of the fpblfc strategy for all the dc link voltage and the reactive power responses when compared to the pi control which its response present an increases of the convergence error due to the fixed gains that are very sensitive to parameter changes this means that the proposed fpblfc controller has remedied to the disturbance of the pmsg this is due to the imposed damping gain k f q appearing on the pbc design in eq 22 which compensated the variation because it is these gain that ensure robustness if it is chosen large compared to r s value case 2 a change of 100 of the total inertia j as can be seen in figs 15 and 16 a change of 100 of the inertia moment j has no influence on the system performance this is because the fpblfc controller design illustrated in section 4 which is not influenced by the total moment j due to the fuzzy controller of fig 4 that has compensated the effect of j on the mechanical part however the conventional is also influenced by the variation of total moment for the same reason as in the previous case case 3 a simultaneous variation of 50 of the stator resistance r s and 100 of the total inertia j as indicated in figs 17 and 18 a simultaneous variation of 50 of the stator resistance r s and 100 of the total inertia j give a similar response concerning the proposed fpblfc controller as in the case 2 this is due to the procedure design of the pbc in section 3 and 4 which compensate the parametric uncertainties as well as the convergence of the pursuit errors which is assured while the classical method which is impacted by simultaneous change 2 3 comparative analyse of the proposed method with the conventional pi controller all tests performed in this section under the simulated conversion system platform show clearly that the fpblfc control strategy exhibits an efficient tracking speed furthermore the fpblfc controller present an extremely robustness performance against parameter changes compared to the classical pi controller so as depicted the proposed control method has a higher effectiveness 3 conclusion in paper a new passivity based controller associated with a fuzzy logic controller for a tidal conversion system based pmsg has been developed the modeling and methodology for the proposed strategy applied to pmsg has been described analyzed and compared to the conventional pi controller the simulation results show the effectiveness of the conversion system with the inclusion of the dynamics of the pmsg the simulation studies under matlab simulink show the fast tracking of the maximum tidal power point the dc link is very well kept at its constant value and reactive power generated is extremely minimized with the proposed method the control strategy is reasonable simple structure and is highly promising in tidal energy applications the tidal conversion system based pmsg provides a good performance significant robustness against generator

f f v since f m s is a strictly positive quantity so we deduce that m is passive then the pmsg can be decomposed into two passive sub systems appendix b proof of lemma 2 passivity property of the pmsg

has no influence on the energy balance 45 
21308,the energy of surface water waves is a very important concept the most common method for calculating the wave energy is based on the linear or first order stokes wave theory this study investigated the energy density i e the potential kinetic and total energy of very nonlinear waves for a finite water depth and deep water over horizontal bottoms analytical expressions for the wave energy density were derived based on the nonlinear stokes wave theories using the perturbation expansion method and taylor expansion the energy density was accurate to the fourth order and sixth order for the second and third order stokes wave theories respectively as for the fifth order stokes wave theory higher order energy density expressions were proposed which were accurate to the tenth order compared with previous findings the present fifth order stokes wave energy density was more consistent with the numerical integration result then the homotopy analysis method ham was applied to obtain the energy density according to the expressions for the nonlinear wave energy density the energy density was no longer a single variable function of wave height and varied with wave parameters such as the wave height and wave number in addition the kinetic energy and potential energy were not equal and the former was larger than the latter keywords energy density nonlinear wave analytical solution homotopy analysis method ham 1 introduction the energy of surface water waves is a very important concept because the waves basically propagate a certain amount of mechanical energy by transferring between kinetic and potential energy the wave energy is extensively used to index the strength of waves calculate the radiation stress and evaluate the wave field to exploit wave power dean and dalrymple 1991 jacobsen 2016 stokes 1847 the most common method for calculating the wave energy density is based on the linear or first order stokes wave theory dean and dalrymple 1991 and sorensen 2006 calculated the average potential energy and kinetic energy per unit of water by integrating over a wavelength range mei et al 2005 and zou 2005 calculated the energy by integrating over a wave period the result was a univariate function of the wave height which was proportional to the square of the wave height and the kinetic energy was equal to the potential energy because of its simplicity this method is also used for nonlinear waves the nonlinear wave theories have been well developed and many researchers have proposed expressions of higher order wave theories fenton 1985 pihl et al 2001 skjelbreia 1959 song et al 2012 the influence of nonlinear waves on harbors and near shore buildings was receiving more attention gao et al 2016 2017 2020a 2020b however there have been few studies on the properties of nonlinear wave energy longuet higgins 1975 and klopman 1990 derived the exact relations between the integral properties of irrotational periodic gravity surface waves of finite amplitude some of these relationships are limited to the special case of a reference frame moving with a horizontal velocity which makes the mean eulerian velocity vanish at each point below the level of the wave troughs this corresponds to stokes s first definition of wave celerity jonsson and arneborg 1995 derived the energy properties of fifth order stokes waves based on the work of fenton 1985 for a finite water depth and the energy density was accurate to the fourth order jonsson and steenberg 1999 calculated the potential and kinetic energy in deep water which led to an

technique which was applied to solve the shallow water equations in one and two dimensional cases then abbaszadeh and dehghan 2020 combined the upwind local radial basis function differential quadrature lrbf dq method with the space splitting idea and proposed a numerical procedure based on the meshless method for solving some models arising in water sciences the homotopy analysis method ham was a rapid development analytic approximation method used to solve significantly nonlinear problems liao 2003 lin 2016 lin et al 2014 in contrast to the traditional perturbation method the ham did not depend on a small parameter moreover it was more flexible in relation to the selection of an appropriate set of base functions for the solution and a simple way to control the convergence rate and region of the solution series the ham had been successfully applied to many nonlinear ordinary and partial differential equations including some water wave problems liao 2012 liu et al 2016 2019 this study derives analytical expressions of the nonlinear wave energy density for a finite water depth and deep water including second third and fifth order stokes wave theories and the results are accurate to the fourth order sixth order and tenth order respectively then the homotopy analysis method ham is applied to solve the fully nonlinear partial differential equation for a steady propagating periodic gravity wave and obtain the energy density a comparison of the energy density with that obtained by the stokes wave showed that it was close to that of a fifth order stokes wave and there is a slight difference between the two methods near the wave of maximum steepness the results show that for a nonlinear wave the kinetic energy and potential energy of the wave are no longer equal and the total energy is no longer a univariate function of the wave height but varies with wave parameters such as the wave height and wave number in addition with an increase in nonlinearity the interaction between the various components of the wave would have a significant impact on the wave energy the energy distribution inside the wave would also become more uneven this may provide a way to explain the breaking of waves from an energy perspective therefore for a wave with nonlinearity using wave energy formulas based on the linear wave theory will cause some errors the results of this study have research significance for the calculation of nonlinear wave energy 2 energy density of nonlinear stokes waves 2 1 second order stokes wave energy density the wave induced potential energy per unit of horizontal area under the free surface is considered as shown in fig 1 the potential energy must be measured relative to a horizontal level the mean water level mwl is naturally chosen as z 0 and x is the coordinate in the wave propagation direction the phase averaged potential energy e p and kinetic energy e k over a wavelength are given as follows 1 e p 1 l x x l 0 η ρ g z

represent the horizontal and vertical velocities respectively substituting the free surface boundary conditions and the bottom boundary conditions into the water wave governing equation the perturbation expansion method is used to solve the equation and the result is accurate to second order then the analytical expressions of second order stokes are obtained the expressions for the wave profile and velocity potential of a second order stokes wave are given as follows note that there is no constant term in the wave profile expression the mean water level is at the origin of the coordinates and the mean of η is zero according to dean and dalrymple 1991 the constant term is related to the bernoulli constant thus the constant term vanishes 3 η a cos θ a k 4 cosh k d cosh 2 k d

first and second order terms of the horizontal velocity respectively substituting the second order stokes wave dispersion relations yields the following 9 ω 2 g k tanh k d and the result of the first term of eq 7 is as follows 10 e k 1 1 4 ρ g k 2 ε 2 k d n 2 s 2 1 2 9 ε 2 16 k d n 2 s 8 2 c 2 1 2 s 6 where c cosh k d and n tanh k d as for the second term of eq 7 the upper limit of the integral is variable the taylor expansion is used to expand the velocity at the mean water level z 0 for the second order stokes wave expanding the velocity to the first derivative term can meet the accuracy requirements the expression is as follows 11 1 2 ρ 0 η u 2 d z 1 2 ρ 0 η u 2 0 u 2 0 z d z substituting the expressions of second order stokes wave profile η and wave velocity u 0 into eq 11 a result that is accurate to ε4 is given as follows 12 e k 2 1 4 ρ g k 2 ε 2 ε 2 1 17 c 2 8 8 s 4 in the same way the third and fourth terms of eq 7 can be obtained as follows 13 e k 3 1 4 ρ g k 2 ε 2 k d n 2

stokes wave for a finite water depth as follows 15 e k 1 4 ρ g k 2 ε 2 1 ε 2 1 52 s 4 36 s 2 9 16 s 6 the total energy per unit area under the free surface of the second order stokes wave is found as

same as those of zou 2005 but are expressed in different forms given wave period t 4 s the water depth d 10 m and d 20 m which represent the application range for the finite and deep water depth respectively the energy of the first order stokes wave is used to obtain the dimensionless energy see eq 20 comparing the analytical solutions with the numerical integration results in the application

2 2 third order stokes wave energy density as for the third order stokes wave theory different and often inconsistent stokes solutions are proposed in the available literature generally the existing third order stokes solutions can be classified into three kinds the first kind has a constant term in the expression of wave profile such as that given by de 1955 and laitone 1962 the second kind such as that due to whitham 1974 and tsuchiya and yasuda 1981 has a non periodic term in the expression of velocity potential in the third kind there is no constant term in the free surface expression or non periodic term in the velocity potential expression such as skjelbreia 1959 and wiegel 1992 the essence for the existing various third order stokes wave solution lies in the different definitions for the perturbation parameter or the water levels as datum here the mean water level mwl is chosen as datum and wave steepness ε as perturbation parameter which is consistent as skjelbreia 1959 thus skjelbreia s 1959 results are considered the wave profile and velocity potential expressions for a third order stokes wave are given as follows 21 η e 1 cos θ e 2 cos 2 θ e 3 cos 3 θ 22 φ a ω k f 1

third order stokes wave profile substituting eq 21 into eq 1 makes it possible to obtain the potential energy of the third order stokes wave for a finite water depth as follows 23 e p 1 4 ρ g k 2 ε 2

the correctness of the analytical expression given the wave period t 4 s the water depth d 10 m and d 20 m which represent the application range for the finite and deep water depth respectively the dimensionless analytical solutions were compared with the numerical integration results in the application range méhauté 1976 of the third order stokes wave as shown in fig 3 it was found that for both the potential and kinetic energy values the analytical solutions were in good agreement with the numerical integration results as the wave steepness increased the kinetic energy and potential energy were no longer equal but the former was larger than the latter compared with the second order stokes wave the difference between the two energy values was more significant 2 3 fifth order

for the potential and kinetic energy of a fifth order stokes wave in deep water a comparison of the results of longuet higgins 1975 who presented eighth order expressions for the potential and kinetic energy in deep water based on the findings of schwartz 1974 showed that the present expressions for the energy are the same as his results until the sixth order however the factors of the eighth order term are different de 1955 laitone 1962 skjelbreia 1959 tsuchiya and yasuda 1981 whitham 1974 wiegel 1992 in order to compare the present expressions with the previous results given the wave period t 4 s within the application range for deep water water depth d is equal to 20 m the different analytical solutions were compared to the numerical integration results black solid line as shown in figs 4 and 5 the present potential and kinetic energy results are both more consistent with the numerical integration results moreover it is obvious that the dimensionless energy is less than 1 0 thus the energy of the fifth order stokes wave is less than that of the first order stokes wave 3 wave energy density found with ham the nonlinear free surface conditions of water wave problems are given as follows 38 η 1 g φ t 1 2 φ 2 b 39 2 φ t 2 g φ z φ 2 t 1 2 φ φ 2 0 the homotopy analysis method is applied to solve this nonlinear problem the nonlinear operators are defined as 40 ℜ 1 φ η 1 g φ t 1 2

sin j θ using the ham scheme with wave period t 4 s water depth d 20 m and wave height h 2 4 m coefficients a j and b j are given in table 1 in the case of n 20 the wave profile and the velocity field were compared with that based on the fifth order stokes theory as shown in fig 6 and fig 7 the ham results were in good agreement with the fifth order stokes wave theory substituting eqs 45 46 into eq 1 and eq 2 makes it possible to obtain the potential energy and kinetic energy based on the ham solution similarly given wave period t 4 s and water depth d 20 m within the deep water application range the present fifth order stokes wave energy was compared with the wave energy calculated based on the ham as shown in fig 8 and fig 9 the potential and kinetic wave energy values calculated based on the ham were both in good agreement with the present fifth order stokes wave energy except near the wave of maximum steepness the difference between the two results will be discussed later 4 results and discussions 4 1 nonlinear stokes wave energy density energy density analytical expressions for the different order nonlinear stokes waves for a finite water depth and deep water were obtained based on the nonlinear stokes wave theory for the second order stokes wave the energy density expression was accurate to ε 4 which was the same as that of zou 2005 but expressed in a different form for the third order stokes wave the analytical expression was accurate to ε 6 these results were in good agreement with the numerical integration results for the fifth order stokes wave an energy expression that was accurate to ε 10 for a finite water depth and deep water was obtained the result for deep water was the same as that obtained by jonsson and steenberg 1999 who derived an energy expression that was accurate to ε 6 for deep water compared with longuet higgins 1975 eighth order results for the fifth order stokes energy in deep water different factors were obtained for the eighth order term and the present energy expression was more consistent with the numerical integration results méhauté 1976 presented the ranges of application of the various wave theories as shown in fig 10 generally an ursell ur value of 26 is the dividing line between the stokes wave theory and cnoidal wave theory in the applicable range of deepwater stokes waves given wave period t 4 s and water depth d 20 m the red in web version solid line in fig 10 it is possible to obtain the trend of the wave energy as the wave steepness increases and compare the energy values of different order stokes waves as follows as shown in figs 11 13 as the wave steepness increases the second order stokes wave energy is generally greater than the linear wave energy however the third order stokes wave energy is less than the second order stokes wave energy because there is a wave amplitude dispersion phenomenon when considering third order stokes waves as shown in eq 24 as the wave height increases so does the wavelength and the wave energy is distributed over a longer range as a result the small parameter ε of the third order stokes wave is smaller than that of the second order stokes wave thus the third order wave energy density is slightly smaller than that of the second order wave energy in addition the fifth order stokes wave energy is even smaller than the linear wave energy the same conclusion could be obtained from the previous expressions for the fifth order stokes wave energy density jonsson and steenberg 1999 longuet higgins 1975 however previous papers did not discuss the reasons for this phenomenon the energy attenuation of fifth order stokes waves was considered to be caused by the interaction between the components of waves the significance of this interaction was revealed when it was strongly nonlinear substituting the fifth order stokes wave profile and velocity into eq 1 and eq 2 and expanding the square terms makes it possible to obtain the following expression 47 η 2 η 1 η 2 η 3 η 4 η 5 2 η 1 2 η 2 2 η 3 2 η 4 2 η 5 2 2 η 1 η 2 2 η 1 η 3 2 η 1 η 4 2 η 1 η 5 2 η 2 η 3 2 η 2 η 4 2 η 2 η 5 2 η 3 η 4 2 η 3 η 5 2 η 4 η 5 48 u 2 u 1 u 2 u 3 u 4 u 5 2 u 1 2 u 2 2 u 3 2 u 4 2 u 5 2 2 u 1 u 2 2 u 1 u 3 2 u 1 u 4 2 u 1 u 5 2 u 2 u 3 2 u 2 u 4 2 u 2 u 5 2 u 3 u 4 2 u 3 u 5 2 u 4 u 5 in order to explain the phenomenon that the fifth order stokes wave energy is less than the linear wave energy the contribution of each order component of the wave to the fifth order stokes wave energy is calculated as shown in figs 14 and 15 the black solid line represents the sum of the energy values of all the components which are expressed by dashed lines in the figures as shown in the figures the first order component plays a dominant role and contributes the most to the energy whereas the other terms are almost equal to 0 which is the same as the results of the present study it is worth noting that the first order and third order interaction term red in web version dashed line and the first order and fifth order interaction term pink in web version dashed line are negative as a result the energy sum is less than the first order component thus the energy of the fifth order stokes wave is smaller than the linear wave energy 4 2 wave energy density found with ham according to figs 8 and 9 there is a slight difference between the wave energy obtained from the ham solution and the fifth order stokes wave energy near the wave of maximum steepness here the reasons for this difference are discussed the free surface boundary condition for water wave problems is given as follows 49 φ t 1 2 φ 2 p ρ g η b where b is an integration constant often called the bernoulli constant the pressure expression at the free surface can be obtained using eq 49 50 p ρ φ t 1 2 φ 2 g η b given wave period t 4 s water depth d 20 m wave height h 2 4 m and substituting the wave profile and velocity potential expressions of the fifth order stokes waves and ham into eq 50 the pressure values at the free surface found using the two methods can be compared in general the wave pressure at the free surface is considered to be zero as shown in fig 16 the pressure at the free surface obtained by the ham is closer to zero and the fluctuation is smaller thus the energy obtained by the ham seemed to be more accurate near the wave of maximum steepness 4 3 distribution of energy in wavelength range given wave period t 4 s water depth d 7 5 m wave height h 2 4 m and a wave steepness of 0 092 it is possible to obtain the wave energy distribution of the fifth order stokes wave in a wavelength range as shown in figs 17 19 it is obvious that the energy below the wave crest is greater than that below the wave trough thus the kinetic energy was divided into two parts the half wavelength energy below the wave crest e c r e s t and the half wavelength energy below the wave trough e t r o u g h the ratio of the energy values of these two parts is given in table 2 in addition how the ratio changed with the wave height was calculated as shown in figs 20 22 as for the first order stokes wave theory when calculating the wave energy the upper limit of the integral of eq 2 was approximately zero thus the energy values below the wave crest and trough were equal as for the fifth order stokes wave with an increase in the wave height the ratio of the crest energy to the trough energy gradually increased with the ratio of the total energy below the wave crest to that below the wave trough changing from 1 00 to 2 60 this meant that when the wave nonlinearity increased the energy distribution inside the wave became more uneven it is well known that the breaking position of a wave usually appears at the wave crest this may provide a way to explain the breaking of waves from an energy perspective 5 conclusions in this study for a finite water depth and deep water the energy density of each order of nonlinear stokes wave was obtained by theoretical derivation then the ham was applied to solve the fully nonlinear partial differential equation for a steady propagating periodic gravity wave and obtain the energy density some of the major conclusions obtained are as follows 1 for the second and third order stokes wave theories the energy density values were accurate to the fourth order and sixth order respectively for the fifth order stokes wave higher order expressions for the energy density were proposed which were accurate to the tenth order compared with previous findings the present energy density was more consistent with the numerical integration result 2 with an increase in the nonlinearity the kinetic energy and potential energy of the wave were no longer equal with the former larger than the latter the energy was no longer a univariate function of the wave height but varied with wave parameters such as the wave height and wave number 3 the energy density of the fifth order stokes wave was less than that of a linear wave as a result of the interaction between the wave components the energy density obtained by the ham was close to that of the fifth order stokes wave but there was a slight difference between the two methods near the wave of maximum steepness the energy obtained by the ham was more accurate near the wave of maximum steepness 4 with an increase in the wave nonlinearity the energy distribution inside the wave became more uneven the ratio of the crest energy to the trough energy gradually increased it is well known that the breaking position of a wave usually appears at the wave crest thus this may provide a way to explain the breaking of waves from an energy perspective credit authorship contribution statement guohai dong conceptualization methodology resource writing review

21308,the energy of surface water waves is a very important concept the most common method for calculating the wave energy is based on the linear or first order stokes wave theory this study investigated the energy density i e the potential kinetic and total energy of very nonlinear waves for a finite water depth and deep water over horizontal bottoms analytical expressions for the wave energy density were derived based on the nonlinear stokes wave theories using the perturbation expansion method and taylor expansion the energy density was accurate to the fourth order and sixth order for the second and third order stokes wave theories respectively as for the fifth order stokes wave theory higher order energy density expressions were proposed which were accurate to the tenth order compared with previous findings the present fifth order stokes wave energy density was more consistent with the numerical integration result then the homotopy analysis method ham was applied to obtain the energy density according to the expressions for the nonlinear wave energy density the energy density was no longer a single variable function of wave height and varied with wave parameters such as the wave height and wave number in addition the kinetic energy and potential energy were not equal and the former was larger than the latter keywords energy density nonlinear wave analytical solution homotopy analysis method ham 1 introduction the energy of surface water waves is a very important concept because the waves basically propagate a certain amount of mechanical energy by transferring between kinetic and potential energy the wave energy is extensively used to index the strength of waves calculate the radiation stress and evaluate the wave field to exploit wave power dean and dalrymple 1991 jacobsen 2016 stokes 1847 the most common method for calculating the wave energy density is based on the linear or first order stokes wave theory dean and dalrymple 1991 and sorensen 2006 calculated the average potential energy and kinetic energy per unit of water by integrating over a wavelength range mei et al 2005 and zou 2005 calculated the energy by integrating over a wave period the result was a univariate function of the wave height which was proportional to the square of the wave height and the kinetic energy was equal to the potential energy because of its simplicity this method is also used for nonlinear waves the nonlinear wave theories have been well developed and many researchers have proposed expressions of higher order wave theories fenton 1985 pihl et al 2001 skjelbreia 1959 song et al 2012 the influence of nonlinear waves on harbors and near shore buildings was receiving more attention gao et al 2016 2017 2020a 2020b however there have been few studies on the properties of nonlinear wave energy longuet higgins 1975 and klopman 1990 derived the exact relations between the integral properties of irrotational periodic gravity surface waves of finite amplitude some of these relationships are limited to the special case of a reference frame moving with a horizontal velocity which makes the mean eulerian velocity vanish at each point below the level of the wave troughs this corresponds to stokes s first definition of wave celerity jonsson and arneborg 1995 derived the energy properties of fifth order stokes waves based on the work of fenton 1985 for a finite water depth and the energy density was accurate to the fourth order jonsson and steenberg 1999 calculated the potential and kinetic energy in deep water which led to an energy density that was correct to the sixth order with the development and enrichment of mathematical methods more and more new computational methods and techniques were used to solve nonlinear water wave problems dehghan and shakeri 2008 used the homotopy perturbation method to solve a boussinesq type partial differential equation in modeling of flow in porous media the variational iteration method was applied to solve the kawahara equation arising in modelling of the water waves saadatmandi and dehghan 2009 dehghan et al 2010 solved the nonlinear fractional partial differential equations by the homotopy analysis method based on that a scheme was developed to obtain the approximate solution of the fractional kdv k 2 2 burgers bbm burgers cubic boussinesq coupled kdv and boussinesq like b m n equations with initial conditions dehghan and abbaszadeh 2017 developed a fast and efficient proper orthogonal decomposition pod meshless radial basis functions finite difference rbf fd technique which was applied to solve the shallow water equations in one and two dimensional cases then abbaszadeh and dehghan 2020 combined the upwind local radial basis function differential quadrature lrbf dq method with the space splitting idea and proposed a numerical procedure based on the meshless method for solving some models arising in water sciences the homotopy analysis method ham was a rapid development analytic approximation method used to solve significantly nonlinear problems liao 2003 lin 2016 lin et al 2014 in contrast to the traditional perturbation method the ham did not depend on a small parameter moreover it was more flexible in relation to the selection of an appropriate set of base functions for the solution and a simple way to control the convergence rate and region of the solution series the ham had been successfully applied to many nonlinear ordinary and partial differential equations including some water wave problems liao 2012 liu et al 2016 2019 this study derives analytical expressions of the nonlinear wave energy density for a finite water depth and deep water including second third and fifth order stokes wave theories and the results are accurate to the fourth order sixth order and tenth order respectively then the homotopy analysis method ham is applied to solve the fully nonlinear partial differential equation for a steady propagating periodic gravity wave and obtain the energy density a comparison of the energy density with that obtained by the stokes wave showed that it was close to that of a fifth order stokes wave and there is a slight difference between the two methods near the wave of maximum steepness the results show that for a nonlinear wave the kinetic energy and potential energy of the wave are no longer equal and the total energy is no longer a univariate function of the wave height but varies with wave parameters such as the wave height and wave number in addition with an increase in nonlinearity the interaction between the various components of the wave would have a significant impact on the wave energy the energy distribution inside the wave would also become more uneven this may provide a way to explain the breaking of waves from an energy perspective therefore for a wave with nonlinearity using wave energy formulas based on the linear wave theory will cause some errors the results of this study have research significance for the calculation of nonlinear wave energy 2 energy density of nonlinear stokes waves 2 1 second order stokes wave energy density the wave induced potential energy per unit of horizontal area under the free surface is considered as shown in fig 1 the potential energy must be measured relative to a horizontal level the mean water level mwl is naturally chosen as z 0 and x is the coordinate in the wave propagation direction the phase averaged potential energy e p and kinetic energy e k over a wavelength are given as follows 1 e p 1 l x x l 0 η ρ g z

represent the horizontal and vertical velocities respectively substituting the free surface boundary conditions and the bottom boundary conditions into the water wave governing equation the perturbation expansion method is used to solve the equation and the result is accurate to second order then the analytical expressions of second order stokes are obtained the expressions for the wave profile and velocity potential of a second order stokes wave are given as follows note that there is no constant term in the wave profile expression the mean water level is at the origin of the coordinates and the mean of η is zero according to dean and dalrymple 1991 the constant term is related to the bernoulli constant thus the constant term vanishes 3 η a cos θ a k 4 cosh k d cosh 2 k d

considering the second order stokes wave profile substituting eq 3 into eq 1 makes it possible to obtain the potential energy of the second order stokes wave for a finite water depth as follows 6 e p

process is divided into two parts the bottom to the mean water level and the mean water level to the wave surface the second order stokes wave kinetic energy can be obtained as follows 7 e k ρ 2 d 0 u

first and second order terms of the horizontal velocity respectively substituting the second order stokes wave dispersion relations yields the following 9 ω 2 g k tanh k d and the result of the first term of eq 7 is as follows 10 e k 1 1 4 ρ g k 2 ε 2 k d n 2 s 2 1 2 9 ε 2 16 k d n 2 s 8 2 c 2 1 2 s 6 where c cosh k d and n tanh k d as for the second term of eq 7 the upper limit of the integral is variable the taylor expansion is used to expand the velocity at the mean water level z 0 for the second order stokes wave expanding the velocity to the first derivative term can meet the accuracy requirements the expression is as follows 11 1 2 ρ 0 η u 2 d z 1 2 ρ 0 η u 2 0 u 2 0 z d z substituting the expressions of second order stokes wave profile η and wave velocity u 0 into eq 11 a result that is accurate to ε4 is given as follows 12 e k 2 1 4 ρ g k 2 ε 2 ε 2 1 17 c 2 8 8 s 4 in the same way the third and fourth terms of eq 7 can be obtained as follows 13 e k 3 1 4 ρ g k 2 ε 2 k d n 2

stokes wave for a finite water depth as follows 15 e k 1 4 ρ g k 2 ε 2 1 ε 2 1 52 s 4 36 s 2 9 16 s 6 the total energy per unit area under the free surface of the second order stokes wave is found as follows 16 e e p e k 1 2 ρ g k 2 ε 2 1 ε 2 5 8 68 s 4 57 s 4 18 32 s 6 for deep water k d eq 6 and eqs 15 16 can be simplified to obtain expressions for the potential energy kinetic energy and total energy 17 e p 1 4 ρ g k 2 ε 2 1 1 4 ε 2 18 e k 1 4 ρ g k 2 ε 2 1 ε 2 19 e e p e k 1 2 ρ g k 2 ε 2 1 5 8 ε 2 the potential and kinetic energy expressions eq 6 eq 15 for a finite water depth are the same as those of zou 2005 but are expressed in different forms given wave period t 4 s the water depth d 10 m and d 20 m which represent the application range for the finite and deep water depth respectively the energy of the first order stokes wave is used to obtain the dimensionless energy see eq 20 comparing the analytical solutions with the numerical integration results in the application range méhauté 1976 for the second order stokes wave as shown in fig 2 20 e p e p 1 4 ρ g a 2 e k e k 1 4 ρ g a 2 e e 1 2 ρ g a 2 the analytical solutions were found to be in good agreement with the numerical integration results and with an increase in the wave steepness the kinetic energy was larger than the potential energy this trend will further strengthen with an increase in the nonlinearity 2 2 third order stokes wave energy density as for the third order stokes wave theory different and often inconsistent stokes solutions are proposed in the available literature generally the existing third order stokes solutions can be classified into three kinds the first kind has a constant term in the expression of wave profile such as that given by de 1955 and laitone 1962 the second kind such as that due to whitham 1974 and tsuchiya and yasuda 1981 has a non periodic term in the expression of velocity potential in the third kind there is no constant term in the free surface expression or non periodic term in the velocity potential expression such as skjelbreia 1959 and wiegel 1992 the essence for the existing various third order stokes wave solution lies in the different definitions for the perturbation parameter or the water levels as datum here the mean water level mwl is chosen as datum and wave steepness ε as perturbation parameter which is consistent as skjelbreia 1959 thus skjelbreia s 1959 results are considered the wave profile and velocity potential expressions for a third order stokes wave are given as follows 21 η e 1 cos θ e 2 cos 2 θ e 3 cos 3 θ 22 φ a ω k f 1 sin θ f 2 sin 2 θ f 3 sin 3 θ the expressions of e i and f i i 1 2 3 are given as follows the third order stokes wave horizontal and vertical velocities can be obtained using the spatial derivative of

third order stokes wave profile substituting eq 21 into eq 1 makes it possible to obtain the potential energy of the third order stokes wave for a finite water depth as follows 23 e p 1 4 ρ g k 2 ε 2

skjelbreia 1959 song et al 2012 24 ω 2 g k tanh k d 1 ε 2 8 s 4 8 s 2 9 16 s 4 2 eqs 21 22 can be substituted into eq 2 the same method as calculating the kinetic energy of the second order stokes wave is adopted to derive the kinetic energy of third order stokes wave a considerable amount of symbolic calculation is involved to obtain the expression for the kinetic energy of the third order stokes wave which is carried out with matlab software a kinetic energy value that is accurate to the sixth order for a finite water depth can be found as follows 25 e k 1 4 ρ g k 2 ε 2 1 ε 2 k 1 ε 4 k

the correctness of the analytical expression given the wave period t 4 s the water depth d 10 m and d 20 m which represent the application range for the finite and deep water depth respectively the dimensionless analytical solutions were compared with the numerical integration results in the application range méhauté 1976 of the third order stokes wave as shown in fig 3 it was found that for both the potential and kinetic energy values the analytical solutions were in good agreement with the numerical integration results as the wave steepness increased the kinetic energy and potential energy were no longer equal but the former was larger than the latter compared with the second order stokes wave the difference between the two energy values was more significant 2 3 fifth order

for the potential and kinetic energy of a fifth order stokes wave in deep water a comparison of the results of longuet higgins 1975 who presented eighth order expressions for the potential and kinetic energy in deep water based on the findings of schwartz 1974 showed that the present expressions for the energy are the same as his results until the sixth order however the factors of the eighth order term are different de 1955 laitone 1962 skjelbreia 1959 tsuchiya and yasuda 1981 whitham 1974 wiegel 1992 in order to compare the present expressions with the previous results given the wave period t 4 s within the application range for deep water water depth d is equal to 20 m the different analytical solutions were compared to the numerical integration results black solid line as shown in figs 4 and 5 the present potential and kinetic energy results are both more consistent with the numerical integration results moreover it is obvious that the dimensionless energy is less than 1 0 thus the energy of the fifth order stokes wave is less than that of the first order stokes wave 3 wave energy density found with ham the nonlinear free surface conditions of water wave problems are given as

were compared with that based on the fifth order stokes theory as shown in fig 6 and fig 7 the ham results were in good agreement with the fifth order stokes wave theory substituting eqs 45 46 into eq 1 and eq 2 makes it possible to obtain the potential energy and kinetic energy based on the ham solution similarly given wave period t 4 s and water depth d 20 m within the deep water application range the present fifth order stokes wave energy was compared with the wave energy calculated based on the ham as shown in fig 8 and fig 9 the potential and kinetic wave energy values calculated based on the ham were both in good agreement with the present fifth order stokes wave energy except near the wave of maximum steepness the difference between the two results will be discussed later 4 results and discussions 4 1 nonlinear stokes wave energy density energy density analytical expressions for the different order nonlinear stokes waves for a finite water depth and deep water were obtained based on the nonlinear stokes wave theory for the second order stokes wave the energy density expression was accurate to ε 4 which was the same as that of zou 2005 but expressed in a different form for the third order stokes wave the analytical expression was accurate to ε 6 these results were in good agreement with the numerical integration results for the fifth order stokes wave an energy expression that was accurate to ε 10 for a finite water depth and deep water was obtained the result for deep water was the same as that obtained by jonsson and steenberg 1999 who derived an energy expression that was accurate to ε 6 for deep water compared with longuet higgins 1975 eighth order results for the fifth order stokes energy in deep water different factors were obtained for the eighth order term and the present energy expression was more consistent with the numerical integration results méhauté 1976 presented the ranges of application of the various wave theories as shown in fig 10 generally an ursell ur value of 26 is the dividing line between the stokes wave theory and cnoidal wave theory in the applicable range of deepwater stokes waves given wave period t 4 s and water depth d 20 m the red in web version solid line in fig 10 it is possible to obtain the trend of the wave energy as the wave steepness increases and compare the energy values of different order stokes waves as follows as shown in figs 11 13 as the wave steepness increases the second order stokes wave energy is generally greater than the linear wave energy however the third order stokes wave energy is less than the second order stokes wave energy because there is a wave amplitude dispersion phenomenon when considering third order stokes waves as shown in eq 24 as the wave height increases so does the wavelength and the wave energy is distributed over a longer range as a result the small parameter ε of the third order stokes wave is smaller than that of the second order stokes wave thus the third order wave energy density is slightly smaller than that of the second order wave energy in addition the fifth order stokes wave energy is even smaller than the linear wave energy the same conclusion could be obtained from the previous expressions for the fifth order stokes wave energy density jonsson and steenberg 1999 longuet higgins 1975 however previous papers did not discuss the reasons for this phenomenon the energy attenuation of fifth order stokes waves was considered to be caused by the interaction between the components of waves the significance of this interaction was revealed when it was strongly nonlinear substituting the fifth order stokes wave profile and velocity into eq 1 and eq 2 and expanding the square terms makes it possible to obtain the following expression 47 η 2 η 1 η 2 η 3 η 4 η 5 2 η 1 2 η 2 2 η 3 2 η 4 2 η 5 2 2 η 1 η 2 2 η 1 η 3 2 η 1 η 4 2 η 1 η 5 2 η 2 η 3 2 η 2 η 4 2 η 2 η 5 2 η 3 η 4 2 η 3 η 5 2 η 4 η 5 48 u 2 u 1 u 2 u 3 u 4 u 5 2 u 1 2 u 2 2 u 3 2 u 4 2 u 5 2 2 u 1 u 2 2 u 1 u 3 2 u 1 u 4 2 u 1 u 5 2 u 2 u 3 2 u 2 u 4 2 u 2 u 5 2 u 3 u 4 2 u 3 u 5 2 u 4 u 5 in order to explain the phenomenon that the fifth order stokes wave energy is less than the linear wave energy the contribution of each order component of the wave to the fifth order stokes wave energy is calculated as shown in figs 14 and 15 the black solid line represents the sum of the energy values of all the components which are expressed by dashed lines in the figures as shown in the figures the first order component plays a dominant role and contributes the most to the energy whereas the other terms are almost equal to 0 which is the same as the results of the present study it is worth noting that the first order and third order interaction term red in web version dashed line and the first order and fifth order interaction term pink in web version dashed line are negative as a result the energy sum is less than the first order component thus the energy of the fifth order stokes wave is smaller than the linear wave energy 4 2 wave energy density found with ham according to figs 8 and 9 there is a slight difference between the wave energy obtained from the ham solution and the fifth order stokes wave energy near the wave of maximum steepness here the reasons for this difference are discussed the free surface boundary condition for water wave problems is given as follows 49 φ t 1 2 φ 2 p ρ g η b where b is an integration constant often called the bernoulli constant the pressure expression at the free surface can be obtained using eq 49 50 p ρ φ t 1 2 φ 2 g η b given wave period t 4 s water depth d 20 m wave height h 2 4 m and substituting the wave profile and velocity potential expressions of the fifth order stokes waves and ham into eq 50 the pressure values at the free surface found using the two methods can be compared in general the wave pressure at the free surface is considered to be zero as shown in fig 16 the pressure at the free surface obtained by the ham is closer to zero and the fluctuation is smaller thus the energy obtained by the ham seemed to be more accurate near the wave of maximum steepness 4 3 distribution of energy in wavelength range given wave period t 4 s water depth d 7 5 m wave height h 2 4 m and a wave steepness of 0 092 it is possible to obtain the wave energy distribution of the fifth order stokes wave in a wavelength range as shown in figs 17 19 it is obvious that the energy below the wave crest is greater than that below the wave trough thus the kinetic energy was divided into two parts the half wavelength energy below the wave crest e c r e s t and the half wavelength energy below the wave trough e t r o u g h the ratio of the energy values of these two parts is given in table 2 in addition how the ratio changed with the wave height was calculated as shown in figs 20 22 as for the first order stokes wave theory when calculating the wave energy the upper limit of the integral of eq 2 was approximately zero thus the energy values below the wave crest and trough were equal as for the fifth order stokes wave with an increase in the wave height the ratio of the crest energy to the trough energy gradually increased with the ratio of the total energy below the wave crest to that below the wave trough changing from 1 00 to 2 60 this meant that when the wave nonlinearity increased the energy distribution inside the wave became more uneven it is well known that the breaking position of a wave usually appears at the wave crest this may provide a way to explain the breaking of waves from an energy perspective 5 conclusions in this study for a finite water depth and deep water the energy density of each order of nonlinear stokes wave was obtained by theoretical derivation then the ham was applied to solve the fully nonlinear partial differential equation for a steady propagating periodic gravity wave and obtain the energy density some of the major conclusions obtained are as follows 1 for the second and third order stokes wave theories the energy density values were accurate to the fourth order and sixth order respectively for the fifth order stokes wave higher order expressions for the energy density were proposed which were accurate to the tenth order compared with previous findings the present energy density was more consistent with the numerical integration result 2 with an increase in the nonlinearity the kinetic energy and potential energy of the wave were no longer equal with the former larger than the latter the energy was no longer a univariate function of the wave height but varied with wave parameters such as the wave height and wave number 3 the energy density of the fifth order stokes wave was less than that of a linear wave as a result of the interaction between the wave components the energy density obtained by the ham was close to that of the fifth order stokes wave but there was a slight difference between the two methods near the wave of maximum steepness the energy obtained by the ham was more accurate near the wave of maximum steepness 4 with an increase in the wave nonlinearity the energy distribution inside the wave became more uneven the ratio of the crest energy to the trough energy gradually increased it is well known that the breaking position of a wave usually appears at the wave crest thus this may provide a way to explain the breaking of waves from an energy perspective credit authorship contribution statement guohai dong conceptualization methodology resource writing review

21309,the effect of the embedment depth is one of the most important issues in calculating the bearing capacity the results of the previous studies show that in most cases it was assumed that the footings are rested at the ground surface and the effect of the embedment depth was considered by applying an equivalent surcharge load to the ground surface in this paper the influence of the embedment of the footings on the bearing capacity of weak rock masses was investigated using the upper bound method of limit analysis the modified hoek brown failure criterion was used for the rock mass the embedment depth of the footings was considered directly in the upper bound calculations according to the obtained results considering the embedment depth results in increasing the ultimate bearing capacity which cannot be anticipated correctly in the methods which replace the embedment depth by an equivalent surcharge the results of this paper were presented in the form of a design table that can be used easily in practical applications keywords bearing capacity hoek brown embedment depth upper bound finite element 1 introduction rock foundations are commonly safe beddings for constructing massive structures the design of footings on rock masses involves investigating various aspects of geotechnical engineering including the determination of bearing capacity various methods were proposed by different researches to determine the bearing capacity of strip footings on rock masses yang and yin 2005 merifield et al 2006 saada et al 2008 mao et al 2012 and alkhafaji et al 2020 different special topics regarding the bearing capacity of rock masses were also investigated among others the effect of stable groundwater and seepage on the bearing capacity of rock masses were investigated by imani et al 2012 and alkhafaji et al 2020 respectively the bearing capacity of circular footings on rock masses was studied by clausen 2013 and chakraborty and kumar 2015 also yang and yin 2005 and saada et al 2008 investigated the effects of different horizontal earthquake accelerations on the bearing capacity of rock masses using the upper bound method in addition to the mentioned methods some numerical investigations were performed to determine the bearing capacity of rock masses javid et al 2015 used the distinct element method to investigate the bearing capacity of two adjacent strip footings resting on rock masses also mansouri et al 2019 presented finite element solutions for the bearing capacity of rock masses subjected to loads of square and rectangular footings it is evident that footings are not commonly built on the ground surface and an embedment depth is always considered therefore the bearing failure lines created in the rock mass beneath the footing extend to the left and right sides of the footing until reaching the ground surface the literature review shows that in all existing methods for determining the bearing capacity of rock masses such an extension of the failure lines has not been considered and the effect of embedment depth was considered by applying an equivalent surcharge to the ground surface around the footing this approximation results in neglecting the shear strength of the rock mass in the embedment depth zone therefore a considerable reduction in the accuracy of the obtained bearing capacity may result in this paper the effect of embedment depth on the bearing capacity of rock masses was investigated using the upper bound and finite element methods the effects of the extension of failure lines in the embedment depth were applied in the proposed upper bound bearing capacity formula only the rock masses with poor and fair strength were considered in this study since in strong rock masses it may not be necessary to construct the footing in the depth of the ground also comprehensive sensitivity analyses were performed to determine the effects of different parameters on the bearing capacity of rock masses considering the embedment depth 2 definition of the problem 2 1 modified hoek brown failure criterion the hoek brown failure criterion is the most practically applicable criterion for analyzing rock mass behavior this criterion provides a good agreement with the experimental results and describes the rock response to a wide range of stress conditions the general form of this criterion which was implemented in the present study is as follows hoek et al 2012 1 σ 1 σ 3 σ c i m b σ 3 σ c i s a where σ 1 and σ 3 are the major and minor principal stresses at failure respectively σ ci is the uniaxial compressive strength of the intact rock and m b s and a can be calculated as follow 2 m b m i exp g s i 100 28 14 d 3 s exp g s i 100 9 3 d 4 a 1 2 1 6 e g s i 15 e 20 3 where m i is a constant parameter for the intact rocks that varies from 4 for very fine weak rocks to 33 for coarse igneous light colored rocks d is the disturbance coefficient which varies from zero for undisturbed in situ rock masses to 1 0 for very disturbed rock masses gsi is the geological strength index of the rock masses which is smaller than 40 in poor quality rock masses sivakugan et al 2013 therefore all analyses performed in this paper are based on gsi 40 to incorporate the nonlinear hoek brown criterion in the upper bound formulation various methods were proposed by different researchers yang and yin 2005 saada et al 2008 mao et al 2012 keshavarz et al 2016 alkhafaji et al 2020 in this paper the linearization technique proposed by mao et al 2012 which provides the most appropriate values for bearing capacity was used according to this method the nonlinear hoek brown criterion was replaced by several tangential lines each of them has a unique slope and y axis intercept which correspond to the internal friction angle and the cohesion of the rock mass respectively therefore different values of friction angle and cohesion can be obtained for the rock mass depending on the existing stress level the values of the internal friction angle were assumed to be unknown and were obtained during the optimization process of the upper bound method then using the optimized values of the internal friction angle the corresponding cohesion values can be obtained using the following equation that was proposed by yang and yin 2005 5 c t σ c i cos ϕ t 2 m a 1 sin ϕ t 2 sin ϕ t a 1 a σ c i tan ϕ t m 1 sin ϕ t a m a 1 sin ϕ t 2 sin ϕ t 1 1 a σ c i s m tan ϕ t 2 2 multi wedge failure mechanism the analysis of the bearing capacity by the upper bound method considerably depends on the assumed failure mechanism reviewing literature shows that the multi wedge failure mechanism is the most commonly used failure mechanism for determining the ultimate bearing capacity soubra 1999 yang and yin 2005 saada et al 2008 mao et al 2012 alkhafaji et al 2020 this type of failure mechanism shown in fig 1 was also used in the present paper as can be seen in addition to considering the embedment depth d f this failure mechanism can take the effects of the surcharge q into account which may or may not exist in an engineering project the users of the presented formulation can easily set q 0 or q 0 according to the conditions of their project in this mechanism the plastic area under the footing was divided into some triangular wedges reaching the ground surface with a quadrilateral wedge in each side of the footing each of the wedges moves as a rigid block the dissipation of plastic energy occurs at the contact surfaces of two adjacent wedges and also at the contact of the rock mass in motion and the underlying stable rock mass the number of wedges in the failure mechanism was determined during the optimization process in a way that the best lowest value of the ultimate bearing capacity be achieved 3 calculation of the bearing capacity 3 1 the geometry of the failure mechanism due to the symmetry only half of the failure mechanism was considered in the upper bound analysis fig 2 presents the velocity vectors for the considered failure mechanism in which n stands for the number of wedges on each side of the central wedge therefore the total number of wedges is equal to 2n 1 also the surcharge q applies to the ground surface on either side of the footing the last wedge was extended to the ground surface so that the shear strength of the rock mass above the base of the footing could be considered in the bearing capacity equation l i and d i are the lengths of the velocity discontinuity lines and s i is the area of the wedges which can be obtained from the equations given in the appendix the central wedge moves downward with the velocity v 0 which results in pushing the sides wedges toward the ground surface the absolute velocity of each wedge is equal to v i and the relative velocity between two adjacent wedges is equal to v i 1 i according to the normality rule the angle between each velocity vector and the corresponding discontinuity line is equal to the internal friction angle chen 1975 due to the use of the multi tangential technique for the linearization of the hoek brown criterion the internal friction angle along each velocity discontinuity line is unique using the hodograph shown in fig 3 all velocity vectors can be calculated in terms of the central wedge velocity using eqs 6 9 6 v 1 v 0 cos θ ϕ 01 sin β 1 ϕ 1 ϕ 01 7 v 01 v 0 cos β 1 θ ϕ 1 sin β 1 ϕ 1 ϕ 01 8 v i v i 1 sin α i 1 β i 1 ϕ i 1 ϕ i 1 i sin β i ϕ i ϕ i 1 i i 2 3 n 9 v i 1 i v i sin α i 1 β i 1 β i ϕ i 1 ϕ i sin α i 1 β i 1 ϕ i 1 ϕ i 1 i i 2 3 n in the presented mechanism there exist some unknown angles including θ α i β i ϕ i ϕ i 1 i which were considered in the bearing capacity equation and their values were determined by the optimization process in order to obtain the best lowest value for the bearing capacity 3 2 upper bound of the bearing capacity of rock masses considering embedment depth in order to calculate the bearing capacity by the upper bound method the total external work performed in the mechanism should be equated to the internal energy dissipated through the velocity discontinuity lines the external works include the work of the footing pressure w q u d the work of the weight of the rock mass w rock and the work of the surcharge w q which were obtained using the following equations 10 w q u d b q u d v 0 11 w r o c k s a b c γ v 0 2 i 1 n s i γ v i sin β i θ j 1 i 1 α j ϕ i 12 w q 2 q l n 1 v n sin β n θ j 1 n 1 α j ϕ n where b is the width of the footing q ud is the footing pressure ultimate bearing capacity considering embedment depth γ is the unit weight of the rock mass and q is the surcharge also internal energy dissipates along the velocity discontinuity lines l i and d i that were obtained as follow 13 d l 2 i 1 n c l i l i v i 1 i cos ϕ i 1 i 14 d d 2 i 1 n c d i d i v i cos ϕ i in which c li and c di are the tangential cohesions along the lines l i and d i respectively which can be obtained using eq 5 due to the variation of the tangential friction angle along different velocity discontinuity lines the tangential cohesion value along each of these velocity discontinuity lines will have a unique magnitude equating the total external work with the internal dissipated energy the ultimate bearing capacity was calculated as follows 15 q u d d l d d w r o c k w q b v 0 after simplification the final form of the ultimate bearing capacity of rock masses with consideration of the embedment depth was obtained as follows 16 q u d s 0 5 σ c i n σ d q n q d 1 2 γ b n γ d where n σ d n q d and n γ d are the bearing capacity factors considering the embedment depth which are as follow 17 n σ d f 1 f 2 f 3 f 4 18 n q d f 5 f 6 f 7 f 8 19 n γ d f 9 f 10 where f 1 to f 10 are dimensionless parameters that can be computed from the equations in the appendix 3 3 optimization the proposed ultimate bearing capacity equation depends on several unknown parameters in which their value must be obtained in a way that the best least possible magnitude of the bearing capacity be derived the genetic algorithm provided in matlab was used for the optimization for the failure mechanism to be kinematically admissible appropriate constraints were considered which are as follows a i 1 n α i θ π for the extension of the failure lines up to the ground surface b α i β i π α i β i β i 1 and to form triangular wedges moving to the ground surface c 0 α i β i β i 1 ϕ i ϕ i 1 π β i 1 ϕ i ϕ i 1 0 and for the correct formation of the velocity hodograph d 1 β i π 1 α i θ ϕ i ϕ i 1 i π 2 and for consideration of the upper and lower limits of unknown angles 3 4 the case of ignoring the weight of rock masses and the surcharge in most previous studies due to the large value of the uniaxial compressive strength of the intact rocks the effect of surcharge and unit weight of the rock masses were ignored in the calculation of the bearing capacity yang and yin 2005 saada et al 2008 and alkhafaji et al 2020 considering the same assumption in the present study the ultimate bearing capacity equation obtained in the present study i e eq 16 changes to the following form 20 q u d s 0 5 σ c i n σ d therefore the bearing capacity factor n σ d will be as follows 21 n σ d q u d s 0 5 σ c i 4 verification 4 1 determination of the optimal number of the wedges the first step in using the upper bound formulation developed in the present paper is the selection of the optimal number of wedges in the failure mechanism according to the considered failure mechanism the total number of the wedges is equal to 2n 1 assuming σ c i 10 mpa m i 15 gsi 30 d 0 γ 0 q 0 and d f b 2 table 1 presents the variation of n σ d obtained from eq 21 versus n as can be seen with increasing n the n σ d decreases the difference between two successive n values decreases gradually and at n 9 falls under 1 therefore in the following analyzes the optimized value of n was obtained equal to 9 which results in 19 wedges in the whole mechanism alkhafaji et al 2020 suggested the same number of wedges for the case of the bearing capacity of a footing resting on the surface of a rock mass 4 2 comparison with the existing analytical methods as explained before the effect of extending the failure lines in the embedment depth of rock masses was not considered in previous studies therefore the results of the method developed in the present paper were compared to the results obtained by other researchers for surface footings containing a surcharge equal to q γd f applied to the ground surface on both sides of the footing fig 4 shows the variation of q ud in terms of d f b assuming γ 21 kn m3 d 0 and gsi 30 as can be seen the bearing capacity obtained from the present paper is more than that of alkhafaji et al 2020 method since both methods applied the multi tangential technique for linearizing the hoek brown criterion and also used the genetic algorithm method for optimization it can be concluded that considering the extension of the failure lines in the embedment depth results in higher bearing capacity than considering an equivalent surcharge therefore using the method presented in this paper in practical engineering problems results in reducing the costs of the foundations also due to the differences in both the linearization of the hoek brown criterion and the applied optimization technique the bearing capacity obtained from the present paper is lower than that proposed by saada et al 2008 and yang and yin 2005 which shows the appropriateness of the multi tangential technique applied in the present paper 4 3 comparison with finite element method the results of the upper bound formulation developed in the present study were compared to the finite element method using the phase2 program the geometry and boundary conditions of the model were shown in fig 5 the displacement of the vertical boundaries was fixed in the horizontal direction while the lower boundary was prevented from displacing in both vertical and horizontal directions modeling was performed using six noded triangular elements a concrete footing was placed in the embedment depth region in order to prevent collapsing the pit during the numerical analysis while the horizontal movements of the walls of the pit were allowed the modulus of elasticity and the poisson s ratio of the concrete were considered equal to 20 gpa and 0 2 respectively an interface was considered between the footing and the surrounding rock mass for which normal and shear stiffnesses were considered equal to k n 2 33 103 mpa m and k s 0 93 103 mpa m respectively son 2013 the footing pressure was applied incrementally at a velocity of 2 10 5 m s to determine the ultimate bearing capacity from the numerical models the stress settlement curve was drawn for a point of the rock mass located exactly in the middle of the footing then using the tangent intersection method trautmann and kulhawy 1998 the bearing capacity was determined it should be noted that the distance of the model boundaries from the edge of the footing the size of the meshes and the applied velocity for the footing pressure were selected based on sensitivity analyses in a way that the values beyond that have not considerable effect on the obtained bearing capacity also other values of k n and k s namely 10 and 0 1 times of the above mentioned magnitudes were also examined and no considerable change was observed in the q ud assuming σ ci 10 mpa m i 15 gsi 30 d 0 q 0 and γ 21 kn m3 fig 6 compares the q ud obtained from the upper bound formulation presented in the current paper i e eq 16 and the results of the numerical analyses as can be seen the trend of variation of the bearing capacity obtained from both methods is the same and the maximum difference between the q ud from the two methods is equal to 11 the upper bound formulation presented in the current paper resulted in lower bearing capacities than the numerical method which is on the safe side for practical applications fig 7 shows the variation of q ud versus gsi considering different values of m i and assuming σ ci 10 mpa γ 21 kn m3 d f b 1 the results of the upper bound method presented in the current research are close to the results of the finite element method the most remarkable difference between these two methods is about 34 for the case of m i 10 and 23 for the case of m i 15 which occurred in the largest gsi i e gsi 40 for the footing pressure corresponds to the ultimate bearing capacity of the rock mass fig 8 shows the shear strain contours and the displacement vectors created below and around the footing the shear zone started from beneath the footing extending to the sides of the footing and finally reached the ground surface this pattern is similar to the shape of the failure mechanism considered in the present study 5 sensitivity analyses in this section extensive sensitivity analyses were performed to investigate the effects of different parameters on the bearing capacity of rock masses considering different values of d f b 5 1 effect of d f on n σ d assuming σ ci 10 mpa and d 0 fig 9 shows the variation of n σ d versus d f b considering different values of gsi as can be seen for all values of gsi n σ d increases with increasing d f b also by increasing m i the rate of increasing n σ d with d f b increases which shows the importance of considering the embedment depth in the rocks with higher strength for the assumed magnitudes of gsi the maximum and minimum increment in the n σ d are equal to 37 and 23 percent respectively 5 2 effect of gsi and m i on n σ d assuming σ ci 10 mpa and d 0 fig 10 illustrates the variation of n σ d versus gsi considering different values of d f b and m i as can be seen the n σ d increases with increasing the of gsi from 10 to 30 while decreases when the gsi increases from 30 to 40 the same trend can be seen from the previous studies regarding the footings resting on the ground surface yang and yin 2005 saada et al 2008 alkhafaji et al 2020 for a constant value of gsi the n σ d are larger for higher d f b ratios 5 3 effect of d on n σ d assuming σ ci 10 mpa and m i 15 fig 11 shows the variation of n σ d versus d considering different magnitudes of the rock masses having gsi and d f b as can be seen n σ d decreases with increasing d the rate of this reduction decreases with increasing the gsi value for rock masses with gsi 10 and 40 as d increases from 0 to 0 6 the maximum reduction of n σ d is about 61 and 13 respectively 5 4 effect of σ ci on n σ d assuming d 0 fig 12 shows the variation of n σ d versus σ ci considering different values of m i and gsi increasing σ ci results in decreasing n σ d by increasing σ ci from 5 to 75 mpa the maximum reduction of n σ d is about 22 it should be noted that the ultimate bearing capacity will increase by increasing σ ci 5 5 effect of q on q ud assuming σ ci 10 mpa m i 10 gsi 30 d 0 and γ 0 the effect of surcharge q on the q ud was investigated and the results were shown in fig 13 it should be noted that for being possible to consider the effect of q the general form of the bearing capacity equation i e eq 16 was used instead of eq 20 it can be seen that increasing q results in increasing the bearing capacity but the rate of this increment depends on the embedment depth for the case of d f b 1 the rate of increment is higher than the case of d f b 2 by increasing q from zero to 50 kpa the maximum increase in q ud is about 32 which corresponds to the case of the footing resting on the surface of the rock mass in comparison the minimum increase in q ud is about 10 which occurred in the embedment depth equal to five times the footing width 5 6 effect of γ on q ud previous researchers have shown that the unit weight of the rock masses does not play an essential rule in the bearing capacity yang and yin 2005 saada et al 2008 alkhafaji et al 2020 for checking the validity of this conclusion in the case of incorporating the embedment depth several analyses were performed considering different magnitudes of γ and the results were shown in fig 14 it was assumed that σ ci 10 mpa m i 15 gsi 30 and d 0 and q ud was obtained using the general form of the bearing capacity equation i e eq 16 the unit weight of the rock masses has an ignorable effect on the bearing capacity for all considered values of d f b by increasing the unit weight of the rock masses from 20 kn m3 to 24 kn m3 the maximum increase in the bearing capacity is equal to 2 4 5 7 effect of b on q ud fig 15 shows the effect of the width of the footing on the bearing capacity assuming σ ci 10 mpa gsi 30 m i 10 and d 0 as can be seen the effect of the footing width on the bearing capacity is small namely by increasing the width of the footing from 0 5 m to 5 m the bearing capacity increases by up to 13 also by increasing the embedment depth the effect of the footing width on the q ud decreases 5 8 the final shape of the failure mechanism after optimization the final shape of the failure mechanism can be drawn after the optimization process as an example assuming σ ci 10 mpa gsi 10 m i 10 d 0 and d f b 1 the final shape of the failure mechanism was shown in fig 16 5 9 design table for practical purposes table 2 presents the values of n σ d considering different rock mass properties and various embedment depths the n σ d obtained from this table can easily be replaced in eq 22 for deriving the ultimate bearing capacity of weightless rock masses in practical applications 6 conclusion in this paper the effect of the embedment depth of the footings on the bearing capacity of rock masses was investigated using the upper bound method of limit analysis and the finite element method the results of this study show the importance of considering the embedment depth on the bearing capacity of rock masses due to the high value of the uniaxial compressive strength of the intact rocks it is essential to consider the extension of failure lines at the elevations above the footing base which results in increasing the bearing capacity with respect to applying an equivalent surcharge replacing the embedment depth with an equivalent surcharge especially in the rock masses with large m i and gsi values results in the bearing capacity values less than the real magnitudes which can lead to the non economical design of the foundations it should be noted that for large values of the embedment depth i e deep foundations the failure lines concentrate beneath the footing and will not extend to the ground surface therefore the bearing failure mode changes from the general shear failure to the punching shear failure further researches are required to distinguish the range of

21309,the effect of the embedment depth is one of the most important issues in calculating the bearing capacity the results of the previous studies show that in most cases it was assumed that the footings are rested at the ground surface and the effect of the embedment depth was considered by applying an equivalent surcharge load to the ground surface in this paper the influence of the embedment of the footings on the bearing capacity of weak rock masses was investigated using the upper bound method of limit analysis the modified hoek brown failure criterion was used for the rock mass the embedment depth of the footings was considered directly in the upper bound calculations according to the obtained results considering the embedment depth results in increasing the ultimate bearing capacity which cannot be anticipated correctly in the methods which replace the embedment depth by an equivalent surcharge the results of this paper were presented in the form of a design table that can be used easily in practical applications keywords bearing capacity hoek brown embedment depth upper bound finite element 1 introduction rock foundations are commonly safe beddings for constructing massive structures the design of footings on rock masses involves investigating various aspects of geotechnical engineering including the determination of bearing capacity various methods were proposed by different researches to determine the bearing capacity of strip footings on rock masses yang and yin 2005 merifield et al 2006 saada et al 2008 mao et al 2012 and alkhafaji et al 2020 different special topics regarding the bearing capacity of rock masses were also investigated among others the effect of stable groundwater and seepage on the bearing capacity of rock masses were investigated by imani et al 2012 and alkhafaji et al 2020 respectively the bearing capacity of circular footings on rock masses was studied by clausen 2013 and chakraborty and kumar 2015 also yang and yin 2005 and saada et al 2008 investigated the effects of different horizontal earthquake accelerations on the bearing capacity of rock masses using the upper bound method in addition to the mentioned methods some numerical investigations were performed to determine the bearing capacity of rock masses javid et al 2015 used the distinct element method to investigate the bearing capacity of two adjacent strip footings resting on rock masses also mansouri et al 2019 presented finite element solutions for the bearing capacity of rock masses subjected to loads of square and rectangular footings it is evident that footings are not commonly built on the ground surface and an embedment depth is always considered therefore the bearing failure lines created in the rock mass beneath the footing extend to the left and right sides of the footing until reaching the ground surface the literature review shows that in all existing methods for determining the bearing capacity of rock masses such an extension of the failure lines has not been considered and the effect of embedment depth was considered by applying an equivalent surcharge to the ground surface around the footing this approximation results in neglecting the shear strength of the rock mass in the embedment depth zone therefore a considerable reduction in the accuracy of the obtained bearing capacity may result in this paper the effect of embedment depth on the bearing capacity of rock masses was investigated using the upper bound and finite element methods the effects of the extension of failure lines in the embedment depth were applied in the proposed upper bound bearing capacity formula only the rock masses with poor and fair strength were considered in this study since in strong rock masses it may not be necessary to construct the footing in the depth of the ground also comprehensive sensitivity analyses were performed to determine the effects of different parameters on the bearing capacity of rock masses considering the embedment depth 2 definition of the problem 2 1 modified hoek brown failure criterion the hoek brown failure criterion is the most practically applicable criterion for analyzing rock mass behavior this criterion provides a good agreement with the experimental results and describes the rock response to a wide range of stress conditions the general form of this criterion which was implemented in the present study is as follows hoek et al 2012 1 σ 1 σ 3 σ c i m b σ 3 σ c i s a where σ 1 and σ 3 are the major and minor principal stresses at failure respectively σ ci is the uniaxial compressive strength of the intact rock and m b s and a can be calculated as follow 2 m b m i exp g s i 100 28 14 d 3 s exp g s i 100 9 3 d 4 a 1 2 1 6 e g s i 15 e 20 3 where m i is a constant parameter for the intact rocks that varies from 4 for very fine weak rocks to 33 for coarse igneous light colored rocks d is the disturbance coefficient which varies from zero for undisturbed in situ rock masses to 1 0 for very disturbed rock masses gsi is the geological strength index of the rock masses which is smaller than 40 in poor quality rock masses sivakugan et al 2013 therefore all analyses performed in this paper are based on gsi 40 to incorporate the nonlinear hoek brown criterion in the upper bound formulation various methods were proposed by different researchers yang and yin 2005 saada et al 2008 mao et al 2012 keshavarz et al 2016 alkhafaji et al 2020 in this paper the linearization technique proposed by mao et al 2012 which provides the most appropriate values for bearing capacity was used according to this method the nonlinear hoek brown criterion was replaced by several tangential lines each of them has a unique slope and y axis intercept which correspond to the internal friction angle and the cohesion of the rock mass respectively therefore different values of friction angle and cohesion can be obtained for the rock mass depending on the existing stress level the values of the internal friction angle were assumed to be unknown and were obtained during the optimization process of the upper bound method then using the optimized values of the internal friction angle the corresponding cohesion values can be obtained using the following equation that was proposed by yang and yin 2005 5 c t σ c i cos ϕ t 2 m a 1 sin ϕ t 2 sin ϕ t a 1 a σ c i tan ϕ t m 1 sin ϕ t a m a 1 sin ϕ t 2 sin ϕ t 1 1 a σ c i s m tan ϕ t 2 2 multi wedge failure mechanism the analysis of the bearing capacity by the upper bound method considerably depends on the assumed failure mechanism reviewing literature shows that the multi wedge failure mechanism is the most commonly used failure mechanism for determining the ultimate bearing capacity soubra 1999 yang and yin 2005 saada et al 2008 mao et al 2012 alkhafaji et al 2020 this type of failure mechanism shown in fig 1 was also used in the present paper as can be seen in addition to considering the embedment depth d f this failure mechanism can take the effects of the surcharge q into account which may or may not exist in an engineering project the users of the presented formulation can easily set q 0 or q 0 according to the conditions of their project in this mechanism the plastic area under the footing was divided into some triangular wedges reaching the ground surface with a quadrilateral wedge in each side of the footing each of the wedges moves as a rigid block the dissipation of plastic energy occurs at the contact surfaces of two adjacent wedges and also at the contact of the rock mass in motion and the underlying stable rock mass the number of wedges in the failure mechanism was determined during the optimization process in a way that the best lowest value of the ultimate bearing capacity be achieved 3 calculation of the bearing capacity 3 1 the geometry of the failure mechanism due to the symmetry only half of the failure mechanism was considered in the upper bound analysis fig 2 presents the velocity vectors for the considered failure mechanism in which n stands for the number of wedges on each side of the central wedge therefore the total number of wedges is equal to 2n 1 also the surcharge q applies to the ground surface on either side of the footing the last wedge was extended to the ground surface so that the shear strength of the rock mass above the base of the footing could be considered in the bearing capacity equation l i and d i are the lengths of the velocity discontinuity lines and s i is the area of the wedges which can be obtained from the equations given in the appendix the central wedge moves downward with the velocity v 0 which results in pushing the sides wedges toward the ground surface the absolute velocity of each wedge is equal to v i and the relative velocity between two adjacent wedges is equal to v i 1 i according to the normality rule the angle between each velocity vector and the corresponding discontinuity line is equal to the internal friction angle chen 1975 due to the use of the multi tangential technique for the linearization of the hoek brown criterion the internal friction angle along each velocity discontinuity line is unique using the hodograph shown in fig 3 all velocity vectors can be calculated in terms of the central wedge velocity using eqs 6 9 6 v 1 v 0 cos θ ϕ 01 sin β 1 ϕ 1 ϕ 01 7 v 01 v 0 cos β 1 θ ϕ 1 sin β 1 ϕ 1 ϕ 01 8 v i v i 1 sin α i 1 β i 1 ϕ i 1 ϕ i 1 i sin β i ϕ i ϕ i 1 i i 2 3 n 9 v i 1 i v i sin α i 1 β i 1 β i ϕ i 1 ϕ i sin α i 1 β i 1 ϕ i 1 ϕ i 1 i i 2 3 n in the presented mechanism there exist some unknown angles including θ α i β i ϕ i ϕ i 1 i which were considered in the bearing capacity equation and their values were determined by the optimization process in order to obtain the best lowest value for the bearing capacity 3 2 upper bound of the bearing capacity of rock masses considering embedment depth in order to calculate the bearing capacity by the upper bound method the total external work performed in the mechanism should be equated to the internal energy dissipated through the velocity discontinuity lines the external works include the work of the footing pressure w q u d the work of the weight of the rock mass w rock and the work of the surcharge w q which were obtained using the following equations 10 w q u d b q u d v 0 11 w r o c k s a b c γ v 0 2 i 1 n s i γ v i sin β i θ j 1 i 1 α j ϕ i 12 w q 2 q l n 1 v n sin β n θ j 1 n 1 α j ϕ n where b is the width of the footing q ud is the footing pressure ultimate bearing capacity considering embedment depth γ is the unit weight of the rock mass and q is the surcharge also internal energy dissipates along the velocity discontinuity lines l i and d i that were obtained as follow 13 d l 2 i 1 n c l i l i v i 1 i cos ϕ i 1 i 14 d d 2 i 1 n c d i d i v i cos ϕ i in which c li and c di are the tangential cohesions along the lines l i and d i respectively which can be obtained using eq 5 due to the variation of the tangential friction angle along different velocity discontinuity lines the tangential cohesion value along each of these velocity discontinuity lines will have a unique magnitude equating the total external work with the internal dissipated energy the ultimate bearing capacity was calculated as follows 15 q u d d l d d w r o c k w q b v 0 after simplification the final form of the ultimate bearing capacity of rock masses with consideration of the embedment depth was obtained as follows 16 q u d s 0 5 σ c i n σ d q n q d 1 2 γ b n γ d where n σ d n q d and n γ d are the bearing capacity factors considering the embedment depth which are as follow 17 n σ d f 1 f 2 f 3 f 4 18 n q d f 5 f 6 f 7 f 8 19 n γ d f 9 f 10 where f 1 to f 10 are dimensionless parameters that can be computed from the equations in the appendix 3 3 optimization the proposed ultimate bearing capacity equation depends on several unknown parameters in which their value must be obtained in a way that the best least possible magnitude of the bearing capacity be derived the genetic algorithm provided in matlab was used for the optimization for the failure mechanism to be kinematically admissible appropriate constraints were considered which are as follows a i 1 n α i θ π for the extension of the failure lines up to the ground surface b α i β i π α i β i β i 1 and to form triangular wedges moving to the ground surface c 0 α i β i β i 1 ϕ i ϕ i 1 π β i 1 ϕ i ϕ i 1 0 and for the correct formation of the velocity hodograph d 1 β i π 1 α i θ ϕ i ϕ i 1 i π 2 and for consideration of the upper and lower limits of unknown angles 3 4 the case of ignoring the weight of rock masses and the surcharge in most previous studies due to the large value of the uniaxial compressive strength of the intact rocks the effect of surcharge and unit weight of the rock masses were ignored in the calculation of the bearing capacity yang and yin 2005 saada et al 2008 and alkhafaji et al 2020 considering the same assumption in the present study the ultimate bearing capacity equation obtained in the present study i e eq 16 changes to the following form 20 q u d s 0 5 σ c i n σ d therefore the bearing capacity factor n σ d will be as follows 21 n σ d q u d s 0 5 σ c i 4 verification 4 1 determination of the optimal number of the wedges the first step in using the upper bound formulation developed in the present paper is the selection of the optimal number of wedges in the failure mechanism according to the considered failure mechanism the total number of the wedges is equal to 2n 1 assuming σ c i 10 mpa m i 15 gsi 30 d 0 γ 0 q 0 and d f b 2 table 1 presents the variation of n σ d obtained from eq 21 versus n as can be seen with increasing n the n σ d decreases the difference between two successive n values decreases gradually and at n 9 falls under 1 therefore in the following analyzes the optimized value of n was obtained equal to 9 which results in 19 wedges in the whole mechanism alkhafaji et al 2020 suggested the same number of wedges for the case of the bearing capacity of a footing resting on the surface of a rock mass 4 2 comparison with the existing analytical methods as explained before the effect of extending the failure lines in the embedment depth of rock masses was not considered in previous studies therefore the results of the method developed in the present paper were compared to the results obtained by other researchers for surface footings containing a surcharge equal to q γd f applied to the ground surface on both sides of the footing fig 4 shows the variation of q ud in terms of d f b assuming γ 21 kn m3 d 0 and gsi 30 as can be seen the bearing capacity obtained from the present paper is more than that of alkhafaji et al 2020 method since both methods applied the multi tangential technique for linearizing the hoek brown criterion and also used the genetic algorithm method for optimization it can be concluded that considering the extension of the failure lines in the embedment depth results in higher bearing capacity than considering an equivalent surcharge therefore using the method presented in this paper in practical engineering problems results in reducing the costs of the foundations also due to the differences in both the linearization of the hoek brown criterion and the applied optimization technique the bearing capacity obtained from the present paper is lower than that proposed by saada et al 2008 and yang and yin 2005 which shows the appropriateness of the multi tangential technique applied in the present paper 4 3 comparison with finite element method the results of the upper bound formulation developed in the present study were compared to the finite element method using the phase2 program the geometry and boundary conditions of the model were shown in fig 5 the displacement of the vertical boundaries was fixed in the horizontal direction while the lower boundary was prevented from displacing in both vertical and horizontal directions modeling was performed using six noded triangular elements a concrete footing was placed in the embedment depth region in order to prevent collapsing the pit during the numerical analysis while the horizontal movements of the walls of the pit were allowed the modulus of elasticity and the poisson s ratio of the concrete were considered equal to 20 gpa and 0 2 respectively an interface was considered between the footing and the surrounding rock mass for which normal and shear stiffnesses were considered equal to k n 2 33 103 mpa m and k s 0 93 103 mpa m respectively son 2013 the footing pressure was applied incrementally at a velocity of 2 10 5 m s to determine the ultimate bearing capacity from the numerical models the stress settlement curve was drawn for a point of the rock mass located exactly in the middle of the footing then using the tangent intersection method trautmann and kulhawy 1998 the bearing capacity was determined it should be noted that the distance of the model boundaries from the edge of the footing the size of the meshes and the applied velocity for the footing pressure were selected based on sensitivity analyses in a way that the values beyond that have not considerable effect on the obtained bearing capacity also other values of k n and k s namely 10 and 0 1 times of the above mentioned magnitudes were also examined and no considerable change was observed in the q ud assuming σ ci 10 mpa m i 15 gsi 30 d 0 q 0 and γ 21 kn m3 fig 6 compares the q ud obtained from the upper bound formulation presented in the current paper i e eq 16 and the results of the numerical analyses as can be seen the trend of variation of the bearing capacity obtained from both methods is the same and the maximum difference between the q ud from the two methods is equal to 11 the upper bound formulation presented in the current paper resulted in lower bearing capacities than the numerical method which is on the safe side for practical applications fig 7 shows the variation of q ud versus gsi considering different values of m i and assuming σ ci 10 mpa γ 21 kn m3 d f b 1 the results of the upper bound method presented in the current research are close to the results of the finite element method the most remarkable difference between these two methods is about 34 for the case of m i 10 and 23 for the case of m i 15 which occurred in the largest gsi i e gsi 40 for the footing pressure corresponds to the ultimate bearing capacity of the rock mass fig 8 shows the shear strain contours and the displacement vectors created below and around the footing the shear zone started from beneath the footing extending to the sides of the footing and finally reached the ground surface this pattern is similar to the shape of the failure mechanism considered in the present study 5 sensitivity analyses in this section extensive sensitivity analyses were performed to investigate the effects of different parameters on the bearing capacity of rock masses considering different values of d f b 5 1 effect of d f on n σ d assuming σ ci 10 mpa and d 0 fig 9 shows the variation of n σ d versus d f b considering different values of gsi as can be seen for all values of gsi n σ d increases with increasing d f b also by increasing m i the rate of increasing n σ d with d f b increases which shows the importance of considering the embedment depth in the rocks with higher strength for the assumed magnitudes of gsi the maximum and minimum increment in the n σ d are equal to 37 and 23 percent respectively 5 2 effect of gsi and m i on n σ d assuming σ ci 10 mpa and d 0 fig 10 illustrates the variation of n σ d versus gsi considering different values of d f b and m i as can be seen the n σ d increases with increasing the of gsi from 10 to 30 while decreases when the gsi increases from 30 to 40 the same trend can be seen from the previous studies regarding the footings resting on the ground surface yang and yin 2005 saada et al 2008 alkhafaji et al 2020 for a constant value of gsi the n σ d are larger for higher d f b ratios 5 3 effect of d on n σ d assuming σ ci 10 mpa and m i 15 fig 11 shows the variation of n σ d versus d considering different magnitudes of the rock masses having gsi and d f b as can be seen n σ d decreases with increasing d the rate of this reduction decreases with increasing the gsi value for rock masses with gsi 10 and 40 as d increases from 0 to 0 6 the maximum reduction of n σ d is about 61 and 13 respectively 5 4 effect of σ ci on n σ d assuming d 0 fig 12 shows the variation of n σ d versus σ ci considering different values of m i and gsi increasing σ ci results in decreasing n σ d by increasing σ ci from 5 to 75 mpa the maximum reduction of n σ d is about 22 it should be noted that the ultimate bearing capacity will increase by increasing σ ci 5 5 effect of q on q ud assuming σ ci 10 mpa m i 10 gsi 30 d 0 and γ 0 the effect of surcharge q on the q ud was investigated and the results were shown in fig 13 it should be noted that for being possible to consider the effect of q the general form of the bearing capacity equation i e eq 16 was used instead of eq 20 it can be seen that increasing q results in increasing the bearing capacity but the rate of this increment depends on the embedment depth for the case of d f b 1 the rate of increment is higher than the case of d f b 2 by increasing q from zero to 50 kpa the maximum increase in q ud is about 32 which corresponds to the case of the footing resting on the surface of the rock mass in comparison the minimum increase in q ud is about 10 which occurred in the embedment depth equal to five times the footing width 5 6 effect of γ on q ud previous researchers have shown that the unit weight of the rock masses does not play an essential rule in the bearing capacity yang and yin 2005 saada et al 2008 alkhafaji et al 2020 for checking the validity of this conclusion in the case of incorporating the embedment depth several analyses were performed considering different magnitudes of γ and the results were shown in fig 14 it was assumed that σ ci 10 mpa m i 15 gsi 30 and d 0 and q ud was obtained using the general form of the bearing capacity equation i e eq 16 the unit weight of the rock masses has an ignorable effect on the bearing capacity for all considered values of d f b by increasing the unit weight of the rock masses from 20 kn m3 to 24 kn m3 the maximum increase in the bearing capacity is equal to 2 4 5 7 effect of b on q ud fig 15 shows the effect of the width of the footing on the bearing capacity assuming σ ci 10 mpa gsi 30 m i 10 and d 0 as can be seen the effect of the footing width on the bearing capacity is small namely by increasing the width of the footing from 0 5 m to 5 m the bearing capacity increases by up to 13 also by increasing the embedment depth the effect of the footing width on the q ud decreases 5 8 the final shape of the failure mechanism after optimization the final shape of the failure mechanism can be drawn after the optimization process as an example assuming σ ci 10 mpa gsi 10 m i 10 d 0 and d f b 1 the final shape of the failure mechanism was shown in fig 16 5 9 design table for practical purposes table 2 presents the values of n σ d considering different rock mass properties and various embedment depths the n σ d obtained from this table can easily be replaced in eq 22 for deriving the ultimate bearing capacity of weightless rock masses in practical applications 6 conclusion in this paper the effect of the embedment depth of the footings on the bearing capacity of rock masses was investigated using the upper bound method of limit analysis and the finite element method the results of this study show the importance of considering the embedment depth on the bearing capacity of rock masses due to the high value of the uniaxial compressive strength of the intact rocks it is essential to consider the extension of failure lines at the elevations above the footing base which results in increasing the bearing capacity with respect to applying an equivalent surcharge replacing the embedment depth with an equivalent surcharge especially in the rock masses with large m i and gsi values results in the bearing capacity values less than the real magnitudes which can lead to the non economical design of the foundations it should be noted that for large values of the embedment depth i e deep foundations the failure lines concentrate beneath the footing and will not extend to the ground surface therefore the bearing failure mode changes from the general shear failure to the punching shear failure further researches are required to distinguish the range of
