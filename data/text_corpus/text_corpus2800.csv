14000,chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons cahs are amongst concerning contaminants with high detection in aquifers and soils this work is focused on removal of tetrachloroethylene and its degradation products through a two step process including a permeable zvi column followed by uv fe pds process the permeable zvi column experiments were designed using response surface method with central composite design optimum condition of the permeable zvi column was initial solution ph 5 2 ml min flow and 26 cm column height which brought about 96 dechlorination efficiency total iron leach in the column effluent was 0 34 mg l the concentrations of cahs in permeable zvi column s effluent were as follows pce 0 08 mg l tce 0 23 mg l cis 1 2 dce 0 36 mg l vc 0 34 mg l thus further treatment step was required to comply with the corresponded standards regarding iron leach a pds based advanced oxidation process was applied on the zvi column s effluent with focus on cumulative removal of cahs complete removal of cahs and 79 2 toc removal were obtained at ph 6 using 0 75 mm pds 6 w uv at 15 min reaction time in uv fe pds process synergy effect of 67 was observed keywords zero valent iron dehalogenation peroxydisulfate chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons tetrachloroethene 1 introduction chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons cahs are amongst contaminants of concern which are widely used in dry cleaning metal degreasing textile processing refrigeration lubricants adhesives etc where they find their ways into the environment due to improper control and disposal 1 3 there has been immense number of reports in case of cahs detection in groundwater and soil 1 4 6 being categorized in priority pollutants list cahs are mostly recalcitrant in aquifers with carcinogenicity teratogenicity and mutagenicity for the human 1 amongst cahs chlorinated ethens such as tetrachloroethene pce and trichloroethene tce are the most ubiquitous and persistent organic pollutants found in groundwater and aquifers crying out for urgent treatment technologies 4 7 8 these compounds have been categorized as group 2b carcinogens with public health concern 9 regarding their higher density and lower viscosity as compared to water pce and tce can penetrate soils and infiltrate into groundwater resources to form plumes of contamination 1 10 various methods have so far been developed for cahs removal including physical chemical and biological treatment processes such as chemical reduction biostimulation or bioaugmentation thermal treatment monitored natural attenuation etc 4 5 11 bioremediation for reduction of cahs has been reported to be a successful but time consuming approach as compared to chemical processes 12 13 besides incomplete sequential dechlorination is commonly reported in bioremediation processes which may result in formation of more toxic compounds 12 on the other hand selection of chemical processes is also tricky since cahs like pce and tce are perhalogenated compounds with negligible affinity towards being decomposed through oxidation 8 10 14 thus they are supposed to be reduced first through lowering the orp for dehalogenation 15 besides their complete dehalogenation is controversial due to fewer affinities of less chlorinated compounds like vinyl chloride vc to dechlorination 1 for the dehalogenation step zero valent iron zvi sounds to be a promising environmental reactant with broad range of unique characteristics such as high reductive capacity excellent catalytic functions environmental friendliness ubiquity low cost and production of non toxic by products after the treatment process 16 19 there are many studies carried out on reductive dehalogenation of a single cahs using zvi 5 11 20 21 zvi is supposed to reduce pce and its chlorinated degradation products through two main interconnected degradation pathways hydrogenolysis replacement of a halogen by a hydrogen and reductive elimination in which two halide ions are released 22 23 indeed complete degradation of the cahs and their degradation products are of supreme importance regarding much higher toxicity and health hazards of some transformation products like vc in comparison with the mother compound 7 24 use of zvi or other metal reactive media is usually concerning due to metal leaching into the solution while this iron leach can be involved in subsequent treatment processes e g in fe based advanced oxidation processes aops 25 peroxydisulfate pds is one of the most promising oxidants with special interest among scientists there are many different activation methods being studied and available for pds 25 28 one of the most interesting of which is use of transition metals such as fe cu co etc leading to generation of reactive oxygen species such as so4 and ho with high oxidation potential for degradation of organic compounds 28 32 the corresponded reactions are as follows 26 29 1 f e 0 s 2 o 8 2 f e 2 2 s o 4 2 2 f e 2 s 2 o 8 2

permeable zvi column was used for reductive dehalogenation of a continuous stream of pce the effects of operational variables including initial solution ph column height and flow rate on dechlorination efficiency were determined using response surface method rsm with central composite design ccd the zvi column s effluent underwent an oxidation step using very low concentration of pds which was supposedly activated through reaction with the remaining fe species in the zvi column s effluent and also a low power of uv during both processes the focus was not only on removal of pce but also on removal of other chlorinated degradation products the selection of the processes was on the basis of low material consumption zvi and pds along with low energy consumption 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents all the chemicals were analytical grade micro zero valent iron 98 mean particle size 1 6 μm and 0 47 m2 g 1 bet surface area was purchased from sigma aldrich perchloroethylene and sodium peroxydisulfate were supplied from merck pce sample was synthetically prepared in constant concentration of 20 mg l solution ph was adjusted by adding certain amount of either 0 01 m sulfuric acid or sodium hydroxide 110 phenantroline monohydrate and hydroxylamine hydrochloride were provided from merck likewise methanol meoh and tert butyl alcohol tba were purchased from merck 2 2 study on permeable zvi column 2 2 1 setup cylindrical permeable zvi column height 50 cm i d 6 cm was made of plexiglass the column was packed with zvi and silica sand zvi silica sand 30 70 v v having a porosity of 0 28 this ratio was selected based on the results obtained in pre tests before packing the column pure silica sand was soaked in hydrochloric acid 6 m solution for 36 h to remove impurities from the grain surfaces followed by rinsing with deionized water and drying in oven at 110 c 34 the prepared silica sand and zvi were mixed before packing of the column 20 five sampling ports were considered on the column wall in heights of 9 18 cm 16 cm 26 cm 36 cm and 42 18 cm these values for sampling heights were predetermined based on the pre tests and designed using rsm in order to provide a better flow distribution inside the column top and bottom of the column were filled with coarse gravel with a porosity of 0 6 a peristaltic pump longer pump yz1515x was applied to provide an up flow current direction to assure complete saturation permeable zvi column was initially flushed with co2 saturated deionized water 5 likewise after each experimental run the column washing was carried out with co2 saturated deionized water until no chloride was detectable in the column s effluent another column was considered as control column with identical condition but with no addition of zvi to the silica sand all the experiments were conducted at room temperature 2 2 2 design of experiment in order to evaluate the influence of independent variables on dechlorination efficiency of pce an rsm based ccd modeling was utilized initial solution ph x1 column height x2 and flow rate x3 were the three independent variables as shown in table 1 a total of 40 experimental runs with two replicates were designed based on the pre determined ranges of each factor total center points were 12 and default value of alpha was 1 6817 the experimental runs were conducted in randomized manner to minimize systematic bias data were analyzed using minitab 16 software experimental points corresponded to the independent variables were set as presented in table 2 sixteen star points α 1 twelve axial points α 1 68 and twelve replicates at the center point α 0 were selected 2 3 second treatment step pds based oxidation pds based oxidation process was applied on the optimized permeable zvi column s effluent the experiments were conducted in batch mode and in a cylindrical pyrex reactor i d 6 5 cm loaded with 188 5 ml solution a uvc mercury vapor lamp 254 nm 4 w 6 w and 10 w philips was placed inside a quartz sleeve i d 2 5 cm being held at the center of the pyrex reactor the reactor was placed on a magnetic stirrer before each experiment the uvc lamp was turned on for 20 min to stabilize the light intensity the photoreactor was loaded with 188 5 ml permeable zvi column s effluent with adjusted solution ph immediately after specific amount of persulfate was added samples were taken at time intervals and analyzed for cahs concentration scavenging tests were carried out to determine the main radical species in degradation reactions for this reason in optimum condition of the pds based oxidation process 50 mg l of either meoh or tba was added in presence of which cahs removal was determined 2 4 analysis chloride concentration was measured using waters alliance system for ion chromatography total iron and ferrous ion concentrations were measured using phenantroline method based on the corresponded procedure in the standard methods 35 determination of pce and its degradation products was carried out by gas chromatography varian cp3800 using a capillary column and flame ionization detector fid along with an electron capture detector ecd the temperature of the column was initially set at 40 c for 1 min while it was raised up to 210 c 50 c min 20 36 3 results and discussion 3 1 reductive dehalogenation using permeable zvi column 3 1 1 ccd for permeable zvi column dechlorination of pce from the results achieved in ccd the correlation of dependent variables and response dechlorination efficiency was revealed using the quadratic second order polynomial response surface model the general equation is as follows 37 38 6 y b 0 i 1 n b i x i i 1 n b i i x i i 2 i j 1 n b i j x i x j where y is the predicted response b0 is a constant xi represents the coded levels of independent variables bi bii and bij are the regression coefficients which stand for linear quadratic and interaction effects respectively based on the general quadratic response surface model the following empirical relationship was obtained for the prediction of dechlorination efficiency regarding various levels of the factors 7 y 136 445 53 76 x 1 5 168 x 2 14 331 x 3 5 583 x 1 2 0 091 x 2 2 3 461 x 3 2 0 194 x 1 x 2 0 501 x 1 x 3 0 141 x 2 x 3 in this equation x1 x2 and x3 represent initial solution ph column height and flow rate respectively the correlation coefficient of 0 9836 endorsed the validity of the corresponded quadratic polynomial equation 38 in other words it confirms that the experimental values are in good agreement with the predicted values of the response parameter estimated values and t test distribution components are presented in table 3 actually p value and t value demonstrate the significance of the coefficient in this way larger t value along with smaller p value indicates that the parameter is of higher significance 38 in table 3 regarding parameter estimates for b1 b2 and b3 it is revealed that initial solution ph was the most influential parameter on dechlorination efficiency with p value of 0 and t value of 22 763 3 1 2 effects of permeable zvi column s variables on dechlorination efficiency solution chemistry operating condition and intrinsic characteristics of zvi are claimed to be the influential factors in performance of a zvi based treatment processes 16 solution ph is a critical factor affecting redox reactions 16 39 as revealed in the previous section initial solution ph was the most influential factor in dechlorination efficiency based on the preliminary batch tests zvi had the best dechlorination efficiencies around weak acidic ph or ph levels below 7 in this way 5 ph levels ranging from 1 63 to 8 36 were considered in addition to ph zvi column thickness here as column height has a definite role in dechlorination efficiency actually solution characteristics change as it passes through the column the highest dechlorination efficiency 96 was achieved in initial ph 5 column height 26 cm and 2 ml min 1 flow rate as depicted in fig 1 in this condition 0 08 mg l pce was detected in the effluent it is hypothesized that the main redox reactions happen on zvi surface consuming h based on eq 8 leading to increase of solution ph 21 40 hence solution ph increased from 5 to 7 29 as flow passed through the permeable zvi column up to 26 cm height in this condition total iron leach was 0 34 mg l indeed using zvi as a reductive reactive media rrm or electron source electron transfer rate as a function of ph was enhanced within lower ph levels 16 41 in a study conducted by dong et al 42 it was also revealed that weak acidic ph was favorable for zvi reactivity due to rapid zvi corrosion resulting in direct involvement of h in alkaline ph the capacity of rrm is reduced due to rapid formation of iron hydroxide precipitates creating a thick passivation layer on the surface of zvi particles inhibiting further dissolution and limiting the mass transfer 42 besides very low ph levels e g 1 63 and 3 in this study were not favorable for reductive dechlorination h in excessive concentrations leads to quick loss of zvi particles as rrm through fe dissolution and generation of hydrogen bubbles attaching on the surface of the media affecting the hydraulic behavior of the influent entering the column 16 clearly this phenomenon inhibits the redox reactions resulting in lower dechlorination efficiency 21 41 chen et al 21 reported excessive amounts of h as one of the major suppressive reasons in reductive dechlorination as it decreases the available reactive surface area besides the effect of solution ph can be complicated through its influence on surface charge distribution of iron oxides hydroxides pka value solubility speciation and complex formation tendency of metal or metalloid contaminants 16 43 about column thickness or column height dechlorination efficiency is generally promoted as amount of reactive zvi increases 40 since redox reactions take place on the surface of the zvi particles the amount of the required zvi highly depends on its available surface area 43 as shown in fig 1b dechlorination efficiency as a function of zvi column thickness increased quite sharply until around 30 cm height while afterwards this ascending trend turned into a steady state one indeed at a constant flow rate increase of column height provides more reactive media or active sites for electron transfer and reduction of pce it has been well established that there is a direct relationship between zvi based reduction processes performance and iron concentration here as column height below the critical concentration while this relationship might be rather linear or exponential in different conditions 16 44 45 on the other hand as a halogenated compound passes through the rrm and loses its halogen atoms it would have less affinity to lose more halogens 1 36 thus dechlorination rate supposedly decreases in upper column heights higher than the optimum height in optimum ph ph 5 and constant flow rate 2 ml min 1 lower reduction rate was observed after solution reaching to a height over 26 cm it is hypothesized that the solution has lost most of its chloride content until 26 cm height it has been well established that perhalogenated hydrocarbons have higher affinity towards being reduced as compared to less halogenated compounds 17 in a pioneering study conducted by gillham and o hannesin 5 dehalogenation of 14 chlorinated methanes ethanes and ethenes was investigated using zvi as reducing agent it was revealed that the reactions followed the pseudo first order kinetic model with respect to the organic compound with the rate constant being directly corresponded to the volume ratio and increasing with higher degree of chlorination 5 to sum up generation of less halogenated products with less affinity to dehalogenation and zvi passivation as a result of solution ph increase ca ph 8 in higher column height serving as a physical barrier to inhibit electron transfer led to lower dechlorination rate 16 46 8 f e 0 r c l h f e 2 r h c l 9 f e 0 2 h 2 o f e 2 h 2 2 o h 10 f e 2 2 o h f e o h 2 s flow rate is another critical factor in optimizing of this process indeed flow rate determines the residence time of the flow as it passes through the rrm actually inadequate residence time in rrm has been reported as the main cause of low treatment efficiency 1 the simultaneous effects of flow rate and column height on dechlorination rate are revealed in fig 1c as seen dechlorination efficiency was enhanced as the flow rate decreased based on the results flow rate of 2 ml min 1 was selected corresponding trends in solution ph and orp are illustrated in fig 2 as discussed earlier solution ph increased from 5 to around 8 5 as a result of h consumption based on eq 8 with increase of solution ph in higher heights of the column dechlorination efficiency was also diminished supposedly due to less affinity of the chlorinated compounds to lose more halogens less available h in solution passivation of the zvi surface where solution ph was over ca 8 and less active surface area 1 20 orp of the solution is also a functional index in reductive dehalogenation processes as seen in fig 2b orp decreased from 210 6 ev to 349 7 ev as flow passed through the column up to the fifth sampling port this sharp decrease of orp endorsed that the condition was supportive for reductive dechlorination 1 8 14 low orp level indicated high electron activity within the solution leading to activation of α elimination process 15 reusability and stability of the reactive media are amongst major concerns from the application point of view one main reason of using zvi as reactive media is its favorable reusability 1 43 in zvi permeable reactive barrier studies very high stability of the media has been reported 1 5 36 40 total fe leaching was detected at different sampling points fig 3 with increase of column height total fe leaching from the media increased to 0 34 mg l until 26 cm height while at 36 cm and 42 8 cm sampling points total iron concentrations decreased to 0 11 mg l and 0 07 mg l respectively actually the ascending trend of ph in the up flow column led to precipitation of iron eqs 9 and 10 and less iron leach into the solution in upper heights 32 however active sites of the reactive media undergo changes over time due to solubilization mostly at acidic ph besides precipitation of non soluble iron species fe oh 3 or fe oh 2 at alkaline ph also changes the surface of the reactive media in upper heights of column precipitation of the aforementioned species has been reported to be in final form of magnetite fe3o4 nonetheless regarding low leach of fe from the column relatively long life times with satisfying efficiency have been reported for zvi reactive barriers 24 in this present study dechlorination efficiency was evaluated in optimum conditions initial solution ph 5 column height 26 cm and 2 ml min 1 flow rate for 20 mg l pce in 40 consecutive runs as seen in fig 4 dechlorination efficiencies ranged from 90 81 to 96 98 3 2 persulfate based oxidation process zvi column s effluent pds process influent characteristics are presented in table 4 as can be seen although high dechlorination efficiency 96 was obtained using permeable zvi column 1 01 0 019 mg l cahs including pce tce cis 1 2 dce and vc were detected with significant health hazards crying out for further treatment regarding the fe leach into solution 0 34 0 011 mg l from the zvi column the effluent has the potential to be treated using an oxidizer like pds in this way fe can be used as catalyst or activator of the pds in the following sections pds based advanced oxidation process is evaluated for cahs removal considering operational variables such as initial solution ph pds concentration and uv power besides synergy study reveals the role of components in combined processes 3 2 1 the effect of initial solution ph in aops ph plays a key role in 1 oxidant activation especially in case of pds 2 speciation of ros 3 speciation of the target contaminant s 5 metals speciation as catalysts or activators and availability in reaction with oxidant and 4 speciation of background ions in water matrix hence initial solution ph was the first parameter whose effect on cahs removal was investigated as illustrated in fig 5 cahs removal was generally higher in acidic ph levels in comparison with alkaline ones which was similar with the result of other similar studies 25 26 the highest cahs removal efficiency 100 was obtained in ph 6 in 15 min reaction during the reaction for initial ph of 6 ph had a descending trend and reached the value of 5 87 after 15 min in acidic conditions so4 is generated from acid catalyzation 26 11 s 2 o 8 2 h h s 2 o 8 12 h s 2 o 8 s o 4 s o 4 2 h it has been stated that at ph 7 so4 prevails while at ph levels as high as 9 ho predominates 26 47 in ph 12 ho strongly predominates as in the following equation 26 48 in alkaline ph 13 s o 4 o h s o 4 2 h o solution ph also affects the speciation of fe 9 31 44 in this case acidic ph was superior since fe is predominantly in form of ferrous ion with high solubility and availability for activation of pds and generation of so4 31 the mechanisms involved in activation of pds via fe2 can be described through eqs 1 and 2 the rest of the equations related to the reactions of ros are as follows 31 14 s o 4 s o 4 s 2 o 8 2 15 s o 4 f e 2 s o 4 2 f e 3 16 s o 4 s 2 o 8 2 s o 4 2 s 2 o 8 17 h o h o h 2 o 2 18 h o s o 4 h s o 4 1 2 o 2 it has been declared that not only homogeneous fe2 but also heterogeneous species such as fe0 amorphous fe2 and oxygen containing groups on the surface of zvi contribute to pds activation 32 to sum up acidic ph was favorable for speciation of pds derived ros and also fe2 iron precipitation at alkaline ph values inhibits the availability of the oxidant and catalyst 44 the cahs removal was higher at ph of 6 than at ph of 4 and 5 which was supposedly due to dissolution of more fe2 followed by generation of more so4 and self scavenging effect of so4 eq 14 or reaction of excessive fe2 with so4 based on eq 15 thus ph 6 was selected for the rest of the experiments 3 2 2 the effect of initial pds concentration pds concentration was varied between 0 25 and 2 mm and consequences on cahs removal efficiency are depicted in fig 6 as seen with increase of pds from 0 25 mm to 0 75 mm cahs removal efficiency was enhanced from 41 to 100 while further increase of pds to 1 and 2 mm did not bring about higher cahs removal due to scavenging reactions of so4 and also the side reaction between excessive s2o8 2 and so4 and generation of s2o8 with less oxidation potential 27 28 hence 0 75 mm was selected for pds concentration in this way the mole ratio of pds fe cah was 100 0 15 0 21 to have a better perspective some similar studies are mentioned for comparison yan et al 49 studied tce degradation using nano fe biochar pds process in optimum condition of pds 4 5 mm catalyst 4 5 mm and tce 0 15 mm 99 4 tce removal was achieved in another study pd fe0 pds process was used for the removal of tce applying tce pds catalyst mole ratio of 1 100 120 50 ji et al 30 investigated p nitrophenol degradation using catalyst pds system using 12 5 mm pds and 30 g l catalyst 98 removal of p nitrophenol 500 mg l was achieved li et al 51 investigated the removal of sulfamethoxazole 10 mg l applying vis cqds γ fe2o3 pds process using 0 2 g l catalyst and 2 mm pds almost complete smx removal was obtained in 120 min comparing these studies it is clear that the amount of catalyst was much less in this current study anyway the purpose was not to supply fe but rather it was supposed to take the advantage of zvi column s fe leach in uv pds process on the other hand efficient removal of cahs was achieved with low concentration of pds which was superior in case of less use of chemicals 3 2 3 the effect of uv and determining the role of components in order to investigate the optimum uv power cahs removal was examined in presence of 4 w 6 w and 10 w uv emissions as presented in fig 7 6 w uv was efficient enough to remove cahs by 100 in 15 min leading to 79 2 toc removal efficiency in other words increase of uv power to 10 w did not significantly boost cahs removal rate supposedly due to recombination of the generated sulfate radicals and hydroxyl radicals in excess amounts as in eqs 14 and 17 based on eq 5 pds reacts with uv photons to produce so4 in this way generation of so4 and other ros especially ho propagates 25 52 also referring back to eq 2 the generated fe3 as a result of fe2 oxidation by pds reacts with uv to form hydroxyl radical and finds a chance to be reduced back to fe2 as follows 53 19 f e 3 h v h 2 o h o f e 2 h as seen in fig 7 unary 6 w uv and pds binary 6 w uv fe fe pds and 6 w uv pds and ternary systems 4 6 or 10 w uv fe pds were evaluated for cahs removal accordingly combined treatment enhanced the process efficiency as compared to single systems pds and uv had negligible effects on cahs removal with 18 9 and 13 1 removal efficiencies respectively low removal efficiency indicated that direct or molecular reaction between pds and cahs did not occur and probably had slow oxidative kinetics 52 combining pds and uv 6 w 73 75 cahs removal was achieved revealing the significant synergy effect nevertheless the other two binary systems of fe pds and 6 w uv fe did not exhibited any synergy effect bringing about merely 23 41 and 19 12 cahs removal efficiencies respectively the concentration of the leached iron was not high enough to fulfill the required ratio of catalyst oxidant while that low concentration of fe made a relatively notable difference in ternary processes indeed presence of fe leach from the permeable zvi column increased cahs removal efficiency from 73 75 to 100 in identical condition ternary processes of uv fe pds well exhibited the synergy effect by which 83 54 100 and 100 cahs removal efficiencies were obtained in 4 w uv fe pds 6 w uv fe pds and 10 w uv fe pds respectively hence it can be claimed that pds was activated through homolysis of peroxide bond leading to generation of ros especially sulfate radical and hydroxyl radical 52 as revealed in radical scavengers tests in the coming section using uv fe pds process 1 solution ph decreased from 6 to 5 89 2 complete removal of cahs was obtained 3 79 2 toc removal was achieved 4 chloride concentration increased from 16 12 mg l to 16 78 mg l control test was carried out using silica sand column with no zvi to reveal the effect of reductive step on final removal of pce and other cahs in uv fe pds process this test was carried out in identical condition 20 mg l pce initial ph 5 column height 26 cm and flow rate 2 ml min 1 using the control column no chloride was detected in column s effluent pce concentration decreased from 20 to 17 04 mg l 14 8 removal efficiency supposedly due to adsorption on the silica sand the silica sand column s effluent entered the uv fe pds process for further treatment in this way pce concentration decreased from 17 04 to 11 29 mg l 33 74 pce removal efficiency in optimum condition initial solution ph 6 0 75 mm pds and 6 w uv in this condition the concentration of total cahs pce tce cis 1 2 dce and vc in the effluent was 15 31 mg l these results indicated that zvi based reduction step had a critical role in preparation of the chlorinated content for the oxidation step in many similar studies on oxidation of cahs reducing agent accompanies with the oxidative agent to reduce the concentration of the required oxidant lower the reaction time and improve the breakdown of the c cl bond through reduction especially in perhalogenated compounds with low intrinsic affinity to oxidation 29 54 56 a synergistic effect was concluded to occur between the single pds system and the other unary systems including uv as well as fe the synergy percentage sy was quantified considering cahs removal efficiency cahs re based on the following equation 52 20 s y c a h s r e p d s b a s e d c s c a h s r e s s c a h s r e p d s b a s e d c s 100 where cs and ss stand for combined systems and single systems respectively based on the data in table 5 synergistic effects of combined systems of fe pds uv pds and uv fe pds were 19 05 56 51 and 67 93 respectively 3 2 4 determining cahs removal mechanism scavenging tests using meoh and tba were carried out to distinguish the dominant ros in removal of cahs tba reacts 1000 fold faster with ho k 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 than with so4 k 4 0 9 1 105 m 1 s 1 52 on the other hand meoh reacts approximately 80 fold faster with ho k 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 than with so4 k 1 1 107 m 1 s 1 52 54 the corresponded reactions are as follows 52 21 h o c h 3 o h h 2 o c h 2 o h 22 h o c h 3 3 coh c h 2 c h 3 2 coh h 2 o 23 s o 4 c h 3 o h s o 4 2 c h 2 o h h 24 s o 4 c h 3 3 coh s o 4 2 c h 2 c h 3 2 coh h as illustrated in fig 8 cahs removal decreased to 23 42 and 38 57 in presence of meoh and tba respectively this finding verified that so4 was the dominant degrading agent in cahs removal within the studied uv fe pds process which is similar to most pds based aops 25 27 28 52 due to the presence of chloride emanated from the zvi column dechlorination process in the solution ros might have been affected in a study conducted by monteagudo et al 52 the influence of chloride in pds based aop was investigated and it was revealed that low concentrations of chloride did not significantly affect the process efficiency they found that mineralization efficiency was decreased from 87 7 to 83 as a result of presence of 20 mg l chloride in the solution 52 generally chloride may affect the pds based aops in two opposite ways 1 decrease of degradation efficiency through reaction of chloride with hydroxyl radical and sulfate radical and generation of less reactive chlorinated species 2 regeneration of hydroxyl radicals the related equations are as follows 57 58 25 s o 4 c l cl s o 4 2 26 cl c l c l 2 27 h o c l clho 28 cl h 2 o clho h 29 c l 2 h 2 o clho c l h it can be hypothesized that in low concentrations of chloride 16 12 0 2 mg l in this study the radical activity is not significantly influenced 52 58 4 conclusion complete removals of pce and other cahs were obtained using permeable zvi column followed by uv fe pds process regarding the low affinity of perhalogenated aliphatic ethens to oxidation dechlorination of pce was initially carried out using zvi based reductive dechlorination step which led to 96 dechlorination efficiency dechlorination step led to formation of transformation products such as tce cis 1 2 dce and vc crying out for further treatment further dechlorination of cis 1 2 dce and vc was not applicable in the studied permeable zvi column so they were transferred to pds based advanced oxidation process uv fe pds 100 cahs removal and 79 2 mineralization were obtained in uv fe pds process using 0 75 mm pds and 6 w uv in 15 min reaction time scavenging test revealed the roles of hydroxyl radical and more predominantly sulfate radical last but not least 67 synergy effect was exhibited in uv fe pds process acknowledgment the authors

14000,chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons cahs are amongst concerning contaminants with high detection in aquifers and soils this work is focused on removal of tetrachloroethylene and its degradation products through a two step process including a permeable zvi column followed by uv fe pds process the permeable zvi column experiments were designed using response surface method with central composite design optimum condition of the permeable zvi column was initial solution ph 5 2 ml min flow and 26 cm column height which brought about 96 dechlorination efficiency total iron leach in the column effluent was 0 34 mg l the concentrations of cahs in permeable zvi column s effluent were as follows pce 0 08 mg l tce 0 23 mg l cis 1 2 dce 0 36 mg l vc 0 34 mg l thus further treatment step was required to comply with the corresponded standards regarding iron leach a pds based advanced oxidation process was applied on the zvi column s effluent with focus on cumulative removal of cahs complete removal of cahs and 79 2 toc removal were obtained at ph 6 using 0 75 mm pds 6 w uv at 15 min reaction time in uv fe pds process synergy effect of 67 was observed keywords zero valent iron dehalogenation peroxydisulfate chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons tetrachloroethene 1 introduction chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons cahs are amongst contaminants of concern which are widely used in dry cleaning metal degreasing textile processing refrigeration lubricants adhesives etc where they find their ways into the environment due to improper control and disposal 1 3 there has been immense number of reports in case of cahs detection in groundwater and soil 1 4 6 being categorized in priority pollutants list cahs are mostly recalcitrant in aquifers with carcinogenicity teratogenicity and mutagenicity for the human 1 amongst cahs chlorinated ethens such as tetrachloroethene pce and trichloroethene tce are the most ubiquitous and persistent organic pollutants found in groundwater and aquifers crying out for urgent treatment technologies 4 7 8 these compounds have been categorized as group 2b carcinogens with public health concern 9 regarding their higher density and lower viscosity as compared to water pce and tce can penetrate soils and infiltrate into groundwater resources to form plumes of contamination 1 10 various methods have so far been developed for cahs removal including physical chemical and biological treatment processes such as chemical reduction biostimulation or bioaugmentation thermal treatment monitored natural attenuation etc 4 5 11 bioremediation for reduction of cahs has been reported to be a successful but time consuming approach as compared to chemical processes 12 13 besides incomplete sequential dechlorination is commonly reported in bioremediation processes which may result in formation of more toxic compounds 12 on the other hand selection of chemical processes is also tricky since cahs like pce and tce are perhalogenated compounds with negligible affinity towards being decomposed through oxidation 8 10 14 thus they are supposed to be reduced first through lowering the orp for dehalogenation 15 besides their complete dehalogenation is controversial due to fewer affinities of less chlorinated compounds like vinyl chloride vc to dechlorination 1 for the dehalogenation step zero valent iron zvi sounds to be a promising environmental reactant with broad range of unique characteristics such as high reductive capacity excellent catalytic functions environmental friendliness ubiquity low cost and production of non toxic by products after the treatment process 16 19 there are many studies carried out on reductive dehalogenation of a single cahs using zvi 5 11 20 21 zvi is supposed to reduce pce and its chlorinated degradation products through two main interconnected degradation pathways hydrogenolysis replacement of a halogen by a hydrogen and reductive elimination in which two halide ions are released 22 23 indeed complete degradation of the cahs and their degradation products are of supreme importance regarding much higher toxicity and health hazards of some transformation products like vc in comparison with the mother compound 7 24 use of zvi or other metal reactive media is usually concerning due to metal leaching into the solution while this iron leach can be involved in subsequent treatment processes e g in fe based advanced oxidation processes aops 25 peroxydisulfate pds is one of the most promising oxidants with special interest among scientists there are many different activation methods being studied and available for pds 25 28 one of the most interesting of which is use of transition metals such as fe cu co etc leading to generation of reactive oxygen species such as so4 and ho with high oxidation potential for degradation of organic compounds 28 32 the corresponded reactions are as follows 26 29 1 f e 0 s 2 o 8 2 f e 2 2 s o 4 2 2 f e 2 s 2 o 8 2

permeable zvi column was used for reductive dehalogenation of a continuous stream of pce the effects of operational variables including initial solution ph column height and flow rate on dechlorination efficiency were determined using response surface method rsm with central composite design ccd the zvi column s effluent underwent an oxidation step using very low concentration of pds which was supposedly activated through reaction with the remaining fe species in the zvi column s effluent and also a low power of uv during both processes the focus was not only on removal of pce but also on removal of other chlorinated degradation products the selection of the processes was on the basis of low material consumption zvi and pds along with low energy consumption 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents all the chemicals were analytical grade micro zero valent iron 98 mean particle size 1 6 μm and 0 47 m2 g 1 bet surface area was purchased from sigma aldrich perchloroethylene and sodium peroxydisulfate were supplied from merck pce sample was synthetically prepared in constant concentration of 20 mg l solution ph was adjusted by adding certain amount of either 0 01 m sulfuric acid or sodium hydroxide 110 phenantroline monohydrate and hydroxylamine hydrochloride were provided from merck likewise methanol meoh and tert butyl alcohol tba were purchased from merck 2 2 study on permeable zvi column 2 2 1 setup cylindrical permeable zvi column height 50 cm i d 6 cm was made of plexiglass the column was packed with zvi and silica sand zvi silica sand 30 70 v v having a porosity of 0 28 this ratio was selected based on the results obtained in pre tests before packing the column pure silica sand was soaked in hydrochloric acid 6 m solution for 36 h to remove impurities from the grain surfaces followed by rinsing with deionized water and drying in oven at 110 c 34 the prepared silica sand and zvi were mixed before packing of the column 20 five sampling ports were considered on the column wall in heights of 9 18 cm 16 cm 26 cm 36 cm and 42 18 cm these values for sampling heights were predetermined based on the pre tests and designed using rsm in order to provide a better flow distribution inside the column top and bottom of the column were filled with coarse gravel with a porosity of 0 6 a peristaltic pump longer pump yz1515x was applied to provide an up flow current direction to assure complete saturation permeable zvi column was initially flushed with co2 saturated deionized water 5 likewise after each experimental run the column washing was carried out with co2 saturated deionized water until no chloride was detectable in the column s effluent another column was considered as control column with identical condition but with no addition of zvi to the silica sand all the experiments were conducted at room temperature 2 2 2 design of experiment in order to evaluate the influence of independent variables on dechlorination efficiency of pce an rsm based ccd modeling was utilized initial solution ph x1 column height x2 and flow rate x3 were the three independent variables as shown in table 1 a total of 40 experimental runs with two replicates were designed based on the pre determined ranges of each factor total center points were 12 and default value of alpha was 1 6817 the experimental runs were conducted in randomized manner to minimize systematic bias data were analyzed using minitab 16 software experimental points corresponded to the independent variables were set as presented in table 2 sixteen star points α 1 twelve axial points α 1 68 and twelve replicates at the center point α 0 were selected 2 3 second treatment step pds based oxidation pds based oxidation process was applied on the optimized permeable zvi column s effluent the experiments were conducted in batch mode and in a cylindrical pyrex reactor i d 6 5 cm loaded with 188 5 ml solution a uvc mercury vapor lamp 254 nm 4 w 6 w and 10 w philips was placed inside a quartz sleeve i d 2 5 cm being held at the center of the pyrex reactor the reactor was placed on a magnetic stirrer before each experiment the uvc lamp was turned on for 20 min to stabilize the light intensity the photoreactor was loaded with 188 5 ml permeable zvi column s effluent with adjusted solution ph immediately after specific amount of persulfate was added samples were taken at time intervals and analyzed for cahs concentration scavenging tests were carried out to determine the main radical species in degradation reactions for this reason in optimum condition of the pds based oxidation process 50 mg l of either meoh or tba was added in presence of which cahs removal was determined 2 4 analysis chloride concentration was measured using waters alliance system for ion chromatography total iron and ferrous ion concentrations were measured using phenantroline method based on the corresponded procedure in the standard methods 35 determination of pce and its degradation products was carried out by gas chromatography varian cp3800 using a capillary column and flame ionization detector fid along with an electron capture detector ecd the temperature of the column was initially set at 40 c for 1 min while it was raised up to 210 c 50 c min 20 36 3 results and discussion 3 1 reductive dehalogenation using permeable zvi column 3 1 1 ccd for permeable zvi column dechlorination of pce from the results achieved in ccd the correlation of dependent variables and response dechlorination efficiency was revealed using the quadratic second order polynomial response surface model the general equation is as follows 37 38 6 y b 0 i 1 n b i x i i 1 n b i i x i i 2 i j 1 n b i j x i x j where y is the predicted response b0 is a constant xi represents the coded levels of independent variables bi bii and bij are the regression coefficients which stand for linear quadratic and interaction effects respectively based on the general quadratic response surface model the following empirical relationship was obtained for the prediction of dechlorination efficiency regarding various levels of the factors 7 y 136 445 53 76 x 1 5 168 x 2 14 331 x 3 5 583 x 1 2 0 091 x 2 2 3 461 x 3 2 0 194 x 1 x 2 0 501 x 1 x 3 0 141 x 2 x 3 in this equation x1 x2 and x3 represent initial solution ph column height and flow rate respectively the correlation coefficient of 0 9836 endorsed the validity of the corresponded quadratic polynomial equation 38 in other words it confirms that the experimental values are in good agreement with the predicted values of the response parameter estimated values and t test distribution components are presented in table 3 actually p value and t value demonstrate the significance of the coefficient in this way larger t value along with smaller p value indicates that the parameter is of higher significance 38 in table 3 regarding parameter estimates for b1 b2 and b3 it is revealed that initial solution ph was the most influential parameter on dechlorination efficiency with p value of 0 and t value of 22 763 3 1 2 effects of permeable zvi column s variables on dechlorination efficiency solution chemistry operating condition and intrinsic characteristics of zvi are claimed to be the influential factors in performance of a zvi based treatment processes 16 solution ph is a critical factor affecting redox reactions 16 39 as revealed in the previous section initial solution ph was the most influential factor in dechlorination efficiency based on the preliminary batch tests zvi had the best dechlorination efficiencies around weak acidic ph or ph levels below 7 in this way 5 ph levels ranging from 1 63 to 8 36 were considered in addition to ph zvi column thickness here as column height has a definite role in dechlorination efficiency actually solution characteristics change as it passes through the column the highest dechlorination efficiency 96 was achieved in initial ph 5 column height 26 cm and 2 ml min 1 flow rate as depicted in fig 1 in this condition 0 08 mg l pce was detected in the effluent it is hypothesized that the main redox reactions happen on zvi surface consuming h based on eq 8 leading to increase of solution ph 21 40 hence solution ph increased from 5 to 7 29 as flow passed through the permeable zvi column up to 26 cm height in this condition total iron leach was 0 34 mg l indeed using zvi as a reductive reactive media rrm or electron source electron transfer rate as a function of ph was enhanced within lower ph levels 16 41 in a study conducted by dong et al 42 it was also revealed that weak acidic ph was favorable for zvi reactivity due to rapid zvi corrosion resulting in direct involvement of h in alkaline ph the capacity of rrm is reduced due to rapid formation of iron hydroxide precipitates creating a thick passivation layer on the surface of zvi particles inhibiting further dissolution and limiting the mass transfer 42 besides very low ph levels e g 1 63 and 3 in this study were not favorable for reductive dechlorination h in excessive concentrations leads to quick loss of zvi particles as rrm through fe dissolution and generation of hydrogen bubbles attaching on the surface of the media affecting the hydraulic behavior of the influent entering the column 16 clearly this phenomenon inhibits the redox reactions resulting in lower dechlorination efficiency 21 41 chen et al 21 reported excessive amounts of h as one of the major suppressive reasons in reductive dechlorination as it decreases the available reactive surface area besides the effect of solution ph can be complicated through its influence on surface charge distribution of iron oxides hydroxides pka value solubility speciation and complex formation tendency of metal or metalloid contaminants 16 43 about column thickness or column height dechlorination efficiency is generally promoted as amount of reactive zvi increases 40 since redox reactions take place on the surface of the zvi particles the amount of the required zvi highly depends on its available surface area 43 as shown in fig 1b dechlorination efficiency as a function of zvi column thickness increased quite sharply until around 30 cm height while afterwards this ascending trend turned into a steady state one indeed at a constant flow rate increase of column height provides more reactive media or active sites for electron transfer and reduction of pce it has been well established that there is a direct relationship between zvi based reduction processes performance and iron concentration here as column height below the critical concentration while this relationship might be rather linear or exponential in different conditions 16 44 45 on the other hand as a halogenated compound passes through the rrm and loses its halogen atoms it would have less affinity to lose more halogens 1 36 thus dechlorination rate supposedly decreases in upper column heights higher than the optimum height in optimum ph ph 5 and constant flow rate 2 ml min 1 lower reduction rate was observed after solution reaching to a height over 26 cm it is hypothesized that the solution has lost most of its chloride content until 26 cm height it has been well established that perhalogenated hydrocarbons have higher affinity towards being reduced as compared to less halogenated compounds 17 in a pioneering study conducted by gillham and o hannesin 5 dehalogenation of 14 chlorinated methanes ethanes and ethenes was investigated using zvi as reducing agent it was revealed that the reactions followed the pseudo first order kinetic model with respect to the organic compound with the rate constant being directly corresponded to the volume ratio and increasing with higher degree of chlorination 5 to sum up generation of less halogenated products with less affinity to dehalogenation and zvi passivation as a result of solution ph increase ca ph 8 in higher column height serving as a physical barrier to inhibit electron transfer led to lower dechlorination rate 16 46 8 f e 0 r c l h f e 2 r h c l 9 f e 0 2 h 2 o f e 2 h 2 2 o h 10 f e 2 2 o h f e o h 2 s flow rate is another critical factor in optimizing of this process indeed flow rate determines the residence time of the flow as it passes through the rrm actually inadequate residence time in rrm has been reported as the main cause of low treatment efficiency 1 the simultaneous effects of flow rate and column height on dechlorination rate are revealed in fig 1c as seen dechlorination efficiency was enhanced as the flow rate decreased based on the results flow rate of 2 ml min 1 was selected corresponding trends in solution ph and orp are illustrated in fig 2 as discussed earlier solution ph increased from 5 to around 8 5 as a result of h consumption based on eq 8 with increase of solution ph in higher heights of the column dechlorination efficiency was also diminished supposedly due to less affinity of the chlorinated compounds to lose more halogens less available h in solution passivation of the zvi surface where solution ph was over ca 8 and less active surface area 1 20 orp of the solution is also a functional index in reductive dehalogenation processes as seen in fig 2b orp decreased from 210 6 ev to 349 7 ev as flow passed through the column up to the fifth sampling port this sharp decrease of orp endorsed that the condition was supportive for reductive dechlorination 1 8 14 low orp level indicated high electron activity within the solution leading to activation of α elimination process 15 reusability and stability of the reactive media are amongst major concerns from the application point of view one main reason of using zvi as reactive media is its favorable reusability 1 43 in zvi permeable reactive barrier studies very high stability of the media has been reported 1 5 36 40 total fe leaching was detected at different sampling points fig 3 with increase of column height total fe leaching from the media increased to 0 34 mg l until 26 cm height while at 36 cm and 42 8 cm sampling points total iron concentrations decreased to 0 11 mg l and 0 07 mg l respectively actually the ascending trend of ph in the up flow column led to precipitation of iron eqs 9 and 10 and less iron leach into the solution in upper heights 32 however active sites of the reactive media undergo changes over time due to solubilization mostly at acidic ph besides precipitation of non soluble iron species fe oh 3 or fe oh 2 at alkaline ph also changes the surface of the reactive media in upper heights of column precipitation of the aforementioned species has been reported to be in final form of magnetite fe3o4 nonetheless regarding low leach of fe from the column relatively long life times with satisfying efficiency have been reported for zvi reactive barriers 24 in this present study dechlorination efficiency was evaluated in optimum conditions initial solution ph 5 column height 26 cm and 2 ml min 1 flow rate for 20 mg l pce in 40 consecutive runs as seen in fig 4 dechlorination efficiencies ranged from 90 81 to 96 98 3 2 persulfate based oxidation process zvi column s effluent pds process influent characteristics are presented in table 4 as can be seen although high dechlorination efficiency 96 was obtained using permeable zvi column 1 01 0 019 mg l cahs including pce tce cis 1 2 dce and vc were detected with significant health hazards crying out for further treatment regarding the fe leach into solution 0 34 0 011 mg l from the zvi column the effluent has the potential to be treated using an oxidizer like pds in this way fe can be used as catalyst or activator of the pds in the following sections pds based advanced oxidation process is evaluated for cahs removal considering operational variables such as initial solution ph pds concentration and uv power besides synergy study reveals the role of components in combined processes 3 2 1 the effect of initial solution ph in aops ph plays a key role in 1 oxidant activation especially in case of pds 2 speciation of ros 3 speciation of the target contaminant s 5 metals speciation as catalysts or activators and availability in reaction with oxidant and 4 speciation of background ions in water matrix hence initial solution ph was the first parameter whose effect on cahs removal was investigated as illustrated in fig 5 cahs removal was generally higher in acidic ph levels in comparison with alkaline ones which was similar with the result of other similar studies 25 26 the highest cahs removal efficiency 100 was obtained in ph 6 in 15 min reaction during the reaction for initial ph of 6 ph had a descending trend and reached the value of 5 87 after 15 min in acidic conditions so4 is generated from acid catalyzation 26 11 s 2 o 8 2 h h s 2 o 8 12 h s 2 o 8 s o 4 s o 4 2 h it has been stated that at ph 7 so4 prevails while at ph levels as high as 9 ho predominates 26 47 in ph 12 ho strongly predominates as in the following equation 26 48 in alkaline ph 13 s o 4 o h s o 4 2 h o solution ph also affects the speciation of fe 9 31 44 in this case acidic ph was superior since fe is predominantly in form of ferrous ion with high solubility and availability for activation of pds and generation of so4 31 the mechanisms involved in activation of pds via fe2 can be described through eqs 1 and 2 the rest of the equations related to the reactions of ros are as follows 31 14 s o 4 s o 4 s 2 o 8 2 15 s o 4 f e 2 s o 4 2 f e 3 16 s o 4 s 2 o 8 2 s o 4 2 s 2 o 8 17 h o h o h 2 o 2 18 h o s o 4 h s o 4 1 2 o 2 it has been declared that not only homogeneous fe2 but also heterogeneous species such as fe0 amorphous fe2 and oxygen containing groups on the surface of zvi contribute to pds activation 32 to sum up acidic ph was favorable for speciation of pds derived ros and also fe2 iron precipitation at alkaline ph values inhibits the availability of the oxidant and catalyst 44 the cahs removal was higher at ph of 6 than at ph of 4 and 5 which was supposedly due to dissolution of more fe2 followed by generation of more so4 and self scavenging effect of so4 eq 14 or reaction of excessive fe2 with so4 based on eq 15 thus ph 6 was selected for the rest of the experiments 3 2 2 the effect of initial pds concentration pds concentration was varied between 0 25 and 2 mm and consequences on cahs removal efficiency are depicted in fig 6 as seen with increase of pds from 0 25 mm to 0 75 mm cahs removal efficiency was enhanced from 41 to 100 while further increase of pds to 1 and 2 mm did not bring about higher cahs removal due to scavenging reactions of so4 and also the side reaction between excessive s2o8 2 and so4 and generation of s2o8 with less oxidation potential 27 28 hence 0 75 mm was selected for pds concentration in this way the mole ratio of pds fe cah was 100 0 15 0 21 to have a better perspective some similar studies are mentioned for comparison yan et al 49 studied tce degradation using nano fe biochar pds process in optimum condition of pds 4 5 mm catalyst 4 5 mm and tce 0 15 mm 99 4 tce removal was achieved in another study pd fe0 pds process was used for the removal of tce applying tce pds catalyst mole ratio of 1 100 120 50 ji et al 30 investigated p nitrophenol degradation using catalyst pds system using 12 5 mm pds and 30 g l catalyst 98 removal of p nitrophenol 500 mg l was achieved li et al 51 investigated the removal of sulfamethoxazole 10 mg l applying vis cqds γ fe2o3 pds process using 0 2 g l catalyst and 2 mm pds almost complete smx removal was obtained in 120 min comparing these studies it is clear that the amount of catalyst was much less in this current study anyway the purpose was not to supply fe but rather it was supposed to take the advantage of zvi column s fe leach in uv pds process on the other hand efficient removal of cahs was achieved with low concentration of pds which was superior in case of less use of chemicals 3 2 3 the effect of uv and determining the role of components in order to investigate the optimum uv power cahs removal was examined in presence of 4 w 6 w and 10 w uv emissions as presented in fig 7 6 w uv was efficient enough to remove cahs by 100 in 15 min leading to 79 2 toc removal efficiency in other words increase of uv power to 10 w did not significantly boost cahs removal rate supposedly due to recombination of the generated sulfate radicals and hydroxyl radicals in excess amounts as in eqs 14 and 17 based on eq 5 pds reacts with uv photons to produce so4 in this way generation of so4 and other ros especially ho propagates 25 52 also referring back to eq 2 the generated fe3 as a result of fe2 oxidation by pds reacts with uv to form hydroxyl radical and finds a chance to be reduced back to fe2 as follows 53 19 f e 3 h v h 2 o h o f e 2 h as seen in fig 7 unary 6 w uv and pds binary 6 w uv fe fe pds and 6 w uv pds and ternary systems 4 6 or 10 w uv fe pds were evaluated for cahs removal accordingly combined treatment enhanced the process efficiency as compared to single systems pds and uv had negligible effects on cahs removal with 18 9 and 13 1 removal efficiencies respectively low removal efficiency indicated that direct or molecular reaction between pds and cahs did not occur and probably had slow oxidative kinetics 52 combining pds and uv 6 w 73 75 cahs removal was achieved revealing the significant synergy effect nevertheless the other two binary systems of fe pds and 6 w uv fe did not exhibited any synergy effect bringing about merely 23 41 and 19 12 cahs removal efficiencies respectively the concentration of the leached iron was not high enough to fulfill the required ratio of catalyst oxidant while that low concentration of fe made a relatively notable difference in ternary processes indeed presence of fe leach from the permeable zvi column increased cahs removal efficiency from 73 75 to 100 in identical condition ternary processes of uv fe pds well exhibited the synergy effect by which 83 54 100 and 100 cahs removal efficiencies were obtained in 4 w uv fe pds 6 w uv fe pds and 10 w uv fe pds respectively hence it can be claimed that pds was activated through homolysis of peroxide bond leading to generation of ros especially sulfate radical and hydroxyl radical 52 as revealed in radical scavengers tests in the coming section using uv fe pds process 1 solution ph decreased from 6 to 5 89 2 complete removal of cahs was obtained 3 79 2 toc removal was achieved 4 chloride concentration increased from 16 12 mg l to 16 78 mg l control test was carried out using silica sand column with no zvi to reveal the effect of reductive step on final removal of pce and other cahs in uv fe pds process this test was carried out in identical condition 20 mg l pce initial ph 5 column height 26 cm and flow rate 2 ml min 1 using the control column no chloride was detected in column s effluent pce concentration decreased from 20 to 17 04 mg l 14 8 removal efficiency supposedly due to adsorption on the silica sand the silica sand column s effluent entered the uv fe pds process for further treatment in this way pce concentration decreased from 17 04 to 11 29 mg l 33 74 pce removal efficiency in optimum condition initial solution ph 6 0 75 mm pds and 6 w uv in this condition the concentration of total cahs pce tce cis 1 2 dce and vc in the effluent was 15 31 mg l these results indicated that zvi based reduction step had a critical role in preparation of the chlorinated content for the oxidation step in many similar studies on oxidation of cahs reducing agent accompanies with the oxidative agent to reduce the concentration of the required oxidant lower the reaction time and improve the breakdown of the c cl bond through reduction especially in perhalogenated compounds with low intrinsic affinity to oxidation 29 54 56 a synergistic effect was concluded to occur between the single pds system and the other unary systems including uv as well as fe the synergy percentage sy was quantified considering cahs removal efficiency cahs re based on the following equation 52 20 s y c a h s r e p d s b a s e d c s c a h s r e s s c a h s r e p d s b a s e d c s 100 where cs and ss stand for combined systems and single systems respectively based on the data in table 5 synergistic effects of combined systems of fe pds uv pds and uv fe pds were 19 05 56 51 and 67 93 respectively 3 2 4 determining cahs removal mechanism scavenging tests using meoh and tba were carried out to distinguish the dominant ros in removal of cahs tba reacts 1000 fold faster with ho k 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 than with so4 k 4 0 9 1 105 m 1 s 1 52 on the other hand meoh reacts approximately 80 fold faster with ho k 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 than with so4 k 1 1 107 m 1 s 1 52 54 the corresponded reactions are as follows 52 21 h o c h 3 o h h 2 o c h 2 o h 22 h o c h 3 3 coh c h 2 c h 3 2 coh h 2 o 23 s o 4 c h 3 o h s o 4 2 c h 2 o h h 24 s o 4 c h 3 3 coh s o 4 2 c h 2 c h 3 2 coh h as illustrated in fig 8 cahs removal decreased to 23 42 and 38 57 in presence of meoh and tba respectively this finding verified that so4 was the dominant degrading agent in cahs removal within the studied uv fe pds process which is similar to most pds based aops 25 27 28 52 due to the presence of chloride emanated from the zvi column dechlorination process in the solution ros might have been affected in a study conducted by monteagudo et al 52 the influence of chloride in pds based aop was investigated and it was revealed that low concentrations of chloride did not significantly affect the process efficiency they found that mineralization efficiency was decreased from 87 7 to 83 as a result of presence of 20 mg l chloride in the solution 52 generally chloride may affect the pds based aops in two opposite ways 1 decrease of degradation efficiency through reaction of chloride with hydroxyl radical and sulfate radical and generation of less reactive chlorinated species 2 regeneration of hydroxyl radicals the related equations are as follows 57 58 25 s o 4 c l cl s o 4 2 26 cl c l c l 2 27 h o c l clho 28 cl h 2 o clho h 29 c l 2 h 2 o clho c l h it can be hypothesized that in low concentrations of chloride 16 12 0 2 mg l in this study the radical activity is not significantly influenced 52 58 4 conclusion complete removals of pce and other cahs were obtained using permeable zvi column followed by uv fe pds process regarding the low affinity of perhalogenated aliphatic ethens to oxidation dechlorination of pce was initially carried out using zvi based reductive dechlorination step which led to 96 dechlorination efficiency dechlorination step led to formation of transformation products such as tce cis 1 2 dce and vc crying out for further treatment further dechlorination of cis 1 2 dce and vc was not applicable in the studied permeable zvi column so they were transferred to pds based advanced oxidation process uv fe pds 100 cahs removal and 79 2 mineralization were obtained in uv fe pds process using 0 75 mm pds and 6 w uv in 15 min reaction time scavenging test revealed the roles of hydroxyl radical and more predominantly sulfate radical last but not least 67 synergy effect was exhibited in uv fe pds process acknowledgment the authors

dissipation potassium persulfate kps and or hydrogen peroxide hp loadings on the extent of degradation has been presented along with comparison of efficacy of microwave ultrasound for activation under best treatment conditions of power and kps loading 99 7 degradation of sds at 80 mg l as initial loading was obtained in only 18 min using the microwave combined with kps approach keeping all operating parameters at the established best use of kps and addition of second oxidant as hydrogen peroxide was investigated and observed to enhance the extent and rate of degradation for the microwave with complete degradation of sds obtained in 12 min ultrasound activation of kps yielded lower efficacy compared to microwave with 95 4 degradation of sds obtained in 120 min under the optimized kps loading as 2 g l molar ratio of kps to sds rox as 26 6 150 w as power and 323 k as the temperature the trials with dual oxidant in the presence of ultrasound showed reduced degradation of sds compared to kps alone as an oxidant the analysis of both approaches clearly revealed that microwave assisted degradation of sds was effective than ultrasound the observed enhancement in rate and extent of sds degradation using two oxidants in the case of microwave assisted approach compared to ultrasound and demonstrated effectiveness of sulfate radical in deciding degradation are the key outcomes of the study keywords advanced oxidation process sulfate radicals hydroxyl radical microwave irradiations ultrasound assisted degradation 1 introduction contamination of water resources in all parts of the world is an issue of immediate concern world water assessment report wwap published by united nations highlights the status of water quality and availability across the globe 1 2 the nature of contaminations discharged into water bodies are changing with advancement in life style habits and anthropogenic activities the recent additions to the class of contaminants are termed as emerging contaminants 3 various sources like farm hospitals household industry animal feeding units dairy farms pharmaceutical processing industries etc discharge different emerging contaminants 4 the emerging contaminants are not listed in regulatory list and hence not monitored and analyzed on a regular basis pharmaceuticals personal care products surfactants pesticides steroids and hormones etc are some examples of such emerging contaminants 5 surfactants which are also listed in this class are most widely used substances these are amphiphilic molecules also known as tenside or detergents 6 typical characteristics of these compounds are that they remain unchanged after use 7 due to the ubiquitous nature and large volume of surfactants consumed they are often present in urban and industrial wastewater 8 10 with recent growing awareness about the need for tackling emerging contaminants there is a strong need into developing approaches for effective treatment of surfactant containing wastewaters amongst the various surfactants anionic surfactants constitutes around 55 of total surfactants manufactured in the world 11 12 sodium dodecyl sulfate sds constitutes major share in anionic surfactants used globally 13 sds is an alkyl sulfate with sodium as counter ion and 12 carbon atoms 14 sds offers significant uses in different applications due to the typical characteristics for example it binds to positively charged hydrophobic residue of protein 15 it is an important ingredient in toothpastes shampoos shaving foam bubble baths personal care products and detergents 16 17 due to the widespread uses there are good chances that it can be released in abundance into the environment 18 19 creating pollution issues permissible limit for anionic surfactants is generally 0 5 mg l for drinking water and 1 mg l for industrial application however lower concentrations are also reported to cause undesirable effects the foam is clearly evident for concentration above 1 mg l 7 the biodegradability of many surfactants is inhibited at concentration levels above 20 to 50 mg l 20 sds is an important surfactant considering the toxicity problems as well it typically comes with backdrop of various concerns related to toxicity and effect on flora and fauna in case concentrations exceeds the permissible limits it is reported to cause aquatic toxicity labored breath diarrhea and carbon metabolism disruption 21 ld50 value of 0 8 1 10 g kg for rat and death of 4 out of 20 animals has been reported in literature 13 due to reported hazards and various environmental concerns it is necessary to treat the effluent containing surfactants like sds and this justifies the selection of surfactant in the present work generally biological treatments are preferred for treatment of industrial and domestic wastewater because of ability to handle large volume and relatively lower treatment cost the efficacy of only biological treatment is generally dependent on the type of the pollutant and its loading 22 in the case of surfactants biological oxidation is typically not effective especially at higher levels of concentrations due to the inhibitory effects on the microorganisms and supply of oxygen in the system there have been some studies reported for mechanistic understanding or the modifications in bioremediation so as to enhanced efficacy for example attwood and flowrence 123 reported that biodegradation of sdbs occurs by ω oxidation whereas that of sds occurs by β oxidation it was also reported that ω oxidation pathway requires oxygen whereas β oxidation does not require oxygen abboud et al 18 investigated biodegradation of sds and sdbs and reported that instead of single bacteria strain consortium of bacteria is more effective in intensifying degradation various other methods such as coagulation 23 adsorption 24 31 physicochemical treatments 32 photo induced degradation 33 35 membrane separations 36 38 electrochemical oxidation 39 40 biodegradation 41 45 ultrasound assisted degradation 8 46 47 advanced oxidation 48 52 and wet air oxidation 20 53 55 have also been reported for the removal or degradation of surfactants present in wastewater all these methods offer some level of treatment of the surfactant containing wastewaters but also offer problems as discussed now adsorptive separation is proven and most widely explored method of treating wastewater it is possible to use varied materials in raw or modified form as an adsorbent it is also possible to tailor the performance either by varying the method of synthesis activation or by functionalization of adsorbents however the application of this method is limited when effluent contains higher concentration of surfactants even the presence of other contaminants can also affect the performance one more point is that adsorption is generally looked as a method that transforms the contaminants from one form to other rather than effective destruction coagulation is another simple method applied for wastewater treatment and generally used for removal of colloidal particulate matter its efficacy for removal of sds has also been reported in literature beltrán heredia and sánchez martín 23 investigated the removal of sds by coagulation based on the use of moringa oleifera extract as a coagulant from sds solution of 25 mg l as the initial concentration 80 sds removal was reported at 40 mg l as the coagulant dose there are no other studies reporting the use of coagulants as effective treatment option for surfactants and this is generally preferred as primary treatment not focusing really on any specific contaminant or as a complete treatment solution chemical oxidation treatment methods generally use chlorine and its derivates such as chlorine dioxide or hypochlorus acid as an oxidation agent these methods suffer from inherent limitation of slow rate of degradation higher cost of chemicals compared to aops based on hydroxyl radicals 56 and therefore generally not preferred by industry wet air oxidation wao though considered effective for degradation of refractory organics requires higher pressures in the range of 1 20 mpa and temperature between 200 300 c typically the oxidation products obtained using wao are amenable for biodegradation 54 and hence this can form as an effective pretreatment option wao effectiveness is also reported to be enhanced with use of oxidants like ozone and hydrogen peroxide 57 and also metal oxides as catalyst for example around 77 degradation higher as compared to without catalyst of 1000 mg l sdbs solution at an oxygen partial pressure of 1 5 mpa and 220 c was reported in 120 min using wao in the presence of cuo zno al2o3 as a catalyst 20 as wao requires very intense operating conditions cost and safety are to be evaluated before these techniques are applied in wastewater treatment advanced oxidation processes are based on the oxidizing radicals such as oh or s o 4 these are potent having higher oxidation potential and non selective than traditional chemical oxidants 58 aops are aqueous phase oxidation processes 59 where the oxidants used are clean in situ generated and do not persist in the environment and therefore don t affect secondary treatment 50 various oxidants like ozone persulfate fenton reagent hydrogen peroxide peroxone mostly in combination or in the presence of activating agents can be applied to generate the hydroxyl radical or the sulfate radicals which are stronger oxidizing agents as compared to native form of oxidants for example persulfate can be activated by thermal energy uv ultrasound microwaves or other chemical reagent to facilitate radical generation which non selectively attacks the persistent organic contaminants present in effluent at higher rate giving enhanced efficacy for degradation similarly combinatin of hydrogen peroxide and ozone at specific ph conditions results in hydroxyl radical formation the reactive free radicals generated in aop enhance biodegradability of wastewater as well as decreases the aquatic toxicity due to generation of low molecular weight relatively simple products and degradation intermediates of main emerging contaminant 60 65 the aop s which uses ps and pms oxidants are denoted as sr aop sulfate radical enhanced advanced oxidation processes 66 typically the oxidation by o h radical based processes occurs by hydrogen atom transfer whereas reaction with sulfate radical involves oxidation by electron transfer 67 ozonation is another chemical advanced oxidation process that involves degradation of organic contaminants by ozone it has strong oxidation potential as 2 07 v activation of ozone by using alkaline conditions uv light or transition metal catalysts generate highly reactive species like hydroxyl and hydroperoxyl radicals which subsequently attacks the pollutants at higher rates hydrogen peroxide has oxidation potential as 1 77 v though individual operation is less effective and therefore always used in combination as advanced oxidation approach activation by photocatalysis tio2 or tio2 uv ferrous sulphate or ozone generates hydroxyl radical which enhance the degradation efficiency however the activation method used depends upon contaminant present and properties of the solution 61 62 66 the use of cavitation based advanced oxidation is also reported for degradation of organic contaminants possibility of ambient temperature oxidation use of various configurations of cavitating devices and flexibility of coupling with advanced oxidation processes are the key attributes of cavitation process 68 again individual operation of cavitation is not considered as effective and therefore coupling with oxidants is necessary to enhance the extent of degradation the current work focuses on the use of ultrasound based cavitation and microwave based oxidation processes coupled with persulfate ps and hydrogen peroxide oxidant alone or in combination as process intensification approach the use of sound energy or microwave can activate the oxidants and facilitate the generation of free radicals leading to intensification ps has less bond dissociation energy when dissolved in water 140 2 kj mol whereas h2o2 has bond dissociation energy of 195 4 kj mol the reported investigations related to treatment of effluents in bitumen manufacturing by ps and peroxy monosulfate pms revealed that the cost of treatment by pms was more than double the cost of treatment by ps considering this aspect only ps was used in the current work the efficacy of treatment in terms of cod reduction is reported as a function of oxidant loading with operating temperature also as a crucial parameter 69 even though temperature is key factor for activation of ps or pms use of appropriate nanocatalyst can also lower the activation temperature for example 3d mesoporous α co oh 2 nanosheets electrodeposited on nickel foam co oh 2 ns pms was reported to degrade phenol completely in just 2 min by low temperature activation of pms between 20 40 c 70 the present work only deals with use of temperature and combination of ps with hydrogen peroxide along with use of microwave ultrasound as controlling variables to intensify degradation the increase in temperature is found to increase the degradation efficiency for ps and pms based processes the enhancement occurs more significantly between 40 to 60 c 71 this justifies the operating temperature selected for ultrasound assisted degradation in the present work the combination of ps and hydrogen peroxide was with an objective that simultaneous availability of sulphate and hydroxyl radicals can be beneficial under presence of activating energy source such as microwave ultrasound or ultraviolet irraidation for example shat et al 2018 investigated the use of bi fe doped zno for solar light mediated photodegradation of norfloxacin nor in the presence of pms the doping with b i 3 and f e 2 prevented hole and electron recombination which enhanced efficacy of the photocatalyst in giving more hydroxyl radicals it was also reported that addition of peroxy monosulfate h s o 5 enhanced the degradation of nor from 80 in absence of pms to 99 by addition of 0 2 mm h s o 5 in 120 min the enhanced degradation is attributed to early activation of pms by b i f e z n o to yield highly reactive s o 4 a n d o h radicals which simultaneously take part in the oxidation 72 microwave based oxidation methods offer good potential for the degradation of contaminants present in wastewater 73 75 direct coupling with polar molecules rapid heating short treatment times and possibility of microwave specific and also non thermal effects are unique attributes of microwave based processes 76 microwave alone may not have enough energy to break the chemical bonds especially in the case of complex compounds such as surfactants however coupling with oxidants or additives which can enhance microwave absorption or hotspot generation or generate radicals can give significant intensification ability of microwave to enhance rate of reaction with typical thermal as well as non thermal effects has aroused the interest for microwave assisted treatments including degradation or effluent treatment 77 the key intensification attributes of microwave assisted process are due to difference in rate and effectiveness of microwave based heating compared to conventional heating method microwave heating offers the advantages as intense and rapid heating at molecular level as compared to the conventional heating approach in the past microwave has been applied for degradation of dyes phenolic compounds and various organic chemicals also highlighting the promising nature of mw for example the degradation enhancement to the extent of 30 1300 are reported for mw assisted aops 78 analysis of literature revealed that not much work has been reported for the application of microwave for the intensification of degradation of anionic surfactants in our earlier work microwave assisted persulfate induced degradation of sdbs was investigated reporting 98 5 degradation obtained in 28 min under the optimized conditions of 280 w as power 2 g l as k2s2o8 loading and using 250 ml sdbs solution the efficacy of microwave non thermal effects was demonstrated with only 51 46 sdbs degradation being obtained by conventional heating based oxidation under similar conditions of operating temperature 79 zhang et al 124 also investigated microwave induced destruction of sdbs in the presence of activated carbon modified by feso4 as catalyst complete degradation of sdbs at loading of 100 mg l in 230 s was reported to be obtained using microwave oxidation at modified activated carbon dose of 2 8 g l whereas only 83 54 degradation was reported using unmodified activated carbon considering that no work has been presented for sds as model surfactant the present work has focused on the application of microwave induced degradation of sds the present work also illustrates the comparison with ultrasound induced oxidation in terms of degradation and the activation effects on different oxidants cavitation induced by ultrasound also generates hydroxyl radical and thereby facilitate the degradation or oxidation of contaminants 80 the collapse of cavities releases very large energy over a micro level in turn generating hot spots and shock waves 81 all these conditions are indeed favorable for degradation of pollutants using ultrasound 56 82 similar to microwave degradation of various organic compounds and contaminants such as trichlorophenol rhodamine b etc 68 83 84 using ultrasound induced cavitation have been reported it is also epected that use of catalyst or oxidants can enhance the efficacy of sonochemical treatment as a specific example study involving degradation of sulfide and organic sulfide contaminants present in real effluent from bitumen manufacturing plant reported that the degradation with acoustic as well as hydrodynamic cavitation approach required 180 min for complete degradation however the use of external oxidants like o3 h2o2 and o3 h2o2 yielded the same result in 30 min only 85 similar trends related to necessity of oxidants in hydrodynamic cavitation based treatment of effluent from bitumen processing plant in alkaline conditions are reported 86 the enhancement in sonochemical degradation of acetaminophen due to the use of catalyst under conditions of 80 khz as ultrasound frequency at supplied power of 256 w was also reported only ultrasound degraded the contaminant to 7 6 which further increased to 75 in 60 min with us and catalyst as zno immobilized on powder stone waste 87 similar investigations related to ultrasound assisted degradation of anionic surfactants 8 46 47 88 has also been reported abu hassan et al 46 investigated the use of low frequency irradiation for degradation of sdbs and reported that under optimized conditions of 22 khz 125 w power and 303 k 80 sdbs degradation is obtained in 120 min manousaki et al 88 also reported 79 and 51 degradation of sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate at two different initial concentrations of 30 and 100 mg l respectively at optimized conditions of 150 w power and 303 k temperature in 240 min dehghani et al 8 reported that ultrasound assisted degradation of sdbs at 293 k 130 khz frequency and acoustic power of 400 w resulted in 51 7 degradation in 120 min it is interesting to note that all the reported literature is focused mainly on sdbs as model surfactant and also based on oh mediated degradation either using only ulrasound or in combination with oxidants catalysts that gives additional hydroxyl radicals it is important to note that s o 4 based degradation of surfactant is not explored in the presence of ultrasound and hence targeted in the present work clearly establishing the novelty persulfate has a high oxidation potential of 2 01 v and also its activation results in more powerful s o 4 radicals with oxidation potential of 2 6 v 89 typically heat metals uv light ultrasound and elevated ph can activate the persulfate leading to formation of sulfate radicals use of persulfate as oxidants has been mainly reported for degradation of polymers like poly ethelyne oxide 90 poly acrylic acid 91 and for removal of refractory organic contaminants 92 as well as in situ oxidation of contaminants present in groundwater 93 it is important to note that not much work is again seen for the persulfate based degradation of surfactants and also comparison of any two modes of activation is not seen in the open literature the present work thus gives novel information on comparison of the efficacy of ultrasound and microwave as modes of activation of persulfate overall the present work deals with microwave and ultrasound assisted degradation of sodium dodecyl sulfate the work also compares the efficacy of s o 4 and oh alone or in combination for oxidation as well as the efficacy of microwave or ultrasound in activating the persulfate so as to yield the formation of oxidants 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the required chemicals as sds analytical grade 99 acridine orange hemi zinc chloride salt with dye content of 87 glacial acetic acid 99 5 ortho phosphoric acid 85 hydrogen peroxide 30 w v and toluene purity of 99 9 were procured from merck potassium persulfate 98 was procured from s d fine chemicals india deionised water obtained freshly in laboratory was used throughout the experimental work especially for required dilutions of the samples a stock solution of sds with concentration as 1000 mg l was prepared initially and subsequently with appropriate dilution different solutions with required initial concentration were obtained for actual experimental runs 2 1 1 modification of domestic microwave oven for degradation trials the details of domestic microwave oven whirlpool make 700 w 2 45 ghz with the required modifications have already been described in our earlier work 79 fig 1 represents the schematic of experimental assembly based on microwave oven as represented a hole was drilled from the top of microwave oven through outer and inner casing round bottom flask rbf of 500 ml capacity used as reactor was placed at centre three neck glass adapter was provided for housing the condenser and sampling ports the empty space between outer metallic cover and inner cavity cover around the hole was filled with teflon disc with collar extending outside the outer cover careful modifications of the oven and reactor assembly ensured that there was no microwave leakage 2 1 2 experimental setup for ultrasound assisted degradation fig 2 depicts the schematic experimental setup for the ultrasound assisted degradation the ultrasonic system horn supplied by dakshin mumbai is made up of titanium tip with diameter of 15 6 mm the operating frequency of the horn is 20 khz and maximum power rating is 200 w the supplied power used in the work 150 w as per the maximum recommended by the supplier temperature controlled water bath ganesh scientific industries mumbai was used a heat source glass bulb thermometer was used to measure the temperature periodically during the progress of treatment the ultrasonic horn tip was dipped about 2 cm into the solution taken in 250 ml beaker covered with aluminum foil and kept in temperature controlled water bath 2 2 experimental procedure from the stock solution of sds 80 mg l sds solution natural ph as 5 86 was prepared every time freshly to be used in the experiments the same concentration of sds solution was used throughout the experimental investigations the selection of the concentration was based on the earlier literature reports 79 the effect of concentration was not investigated in the work as most of the times it is observed that lower concentrations of pollutants give higher rates of degradation though this cannot confirm that dilution is indeed an option for application of wastewater treatment approach at commercial level as higher volumes of effluent will have to be treated considering this fact a fixed concentration of 80 mg l has been used as a representative of commercial samples required quantity of oxidant was added before experiment pre decided microwave or ultrasound power was adjusted and experiment continued for pre decided time periodically samples were taken out and quenched by chilled water immediately to prevent further degradation after sampling this quenching was followed by sample preparation and analysis as per the acridine orange complex method 94 the microwave trials were carried out in power controlled manner and therefore no attempt was made to control the temperature the microwave power was varied between 70 to 280 w kps loading was varied between 0 24 to 0 480 g l to understand the effect of kps loading and then subsequently keeping constant optimum kps loading established in the work hydrogen peroxide hp loading was varied between 0 16 to 0 4 g l the oxidant availability in comparison with pollutant is very important parameter in order to ensure the maximum or complete oxidation of pollutant the oxidant is generally added in excess of stoichiometric requirement for better representation oxidant loading has also been represented in terms of molar ratio of oxidant to pollutant designated as rox 95 for the two oxidants used in the present work the values of oxidant ratio for the studies involving microwave irradiations ranged from 3 2 to 6 4 for the case of kps and from 16 9 to 42 3 for the case of hydrogen peroxide the ultrasound based trials were carried out in controlled manner where temperature was controlled and maintained constant as 323 k during uncontrolled trial the temperature was allowed to change due to sonication without external heating kps oxidant loading was varied from 0 8 to 2 g l whereas hydrogen peroxide loading was varied over the range of 320 800 mg l at fixed kps loading in the combination the rox parameter corresponding to kps and hp in the case of ultrasound varied from 10 6 to 26 6 and from 33 9 to 84 7 respectively the reproducibility of the experiments was checked by repeating experiments at least two times the data represented in the figures and discussion is the average value of the obtained results the errors in the experimental results were within 2 of the reported average values 2 3 method of analysis sds concentration in different samples was quantified using the acridine orange aco complex method 94 the method is also described in details in our earlier work 79 typically in the method the sample solution is mixed with aco and glacial acetic acid where the aco forms complex with residual surfactant the complex is extracted with toluene and the concentration of sds is determined using uv vis spectrophotometer model uv 1800 shimadzu corporation analytical and measuring instruments division japan by measuring absorbance at 499 nm 3 results and discussion 3 1 microwave assisted degradation of sds 3 1 1 effect of kps loading on extent of microwave assisted sds degrdation amongst various oxidants explored in literature persulfate has attracted lot of attention because of possibility of in situ activation stability and possibility of generating strong potent sulfate radical with higher oxidation potential 76 92 ease of storage stability high aqueous solubility and low cost are some of other advantages related to persulfate 96 persulfate unlike other biological or chemical treatment doesn t produces any sludge or any hazardous waste 97 considering these advantages it was decided to explore its efficacy in degradation of sds also microwave alone always does not have enough energy to break chemical bonds typically microwave oven operates at frequency of 2 45 ghz the energy of microwave at this frequency may not be sufficient to break chemical bonds 98 99 present in the surfactants however microwave coupling with oxidant can facilitate the degradation of contaminants 63 in the present work no degradation of sds was observed without kps which was in agreement with our earlier work about microwave induced sdbs degradation 79 therefore microwave assisted degradation of sds in the presence of kps was investigated the degradation requires activation of persulfate to form sulfate radicals which may further get converted to bisulfate anion or hydroxyl radical by successive reactions involving formed radicals typical activation is initiated based on eq 1 that depicts the activation reaction irrespective of activation source 100 1 s 2 o 8 2 a c t i v a t i o n s o u r c e s o 4 s o 4 o r s o 4 2 the thermal microwave activation of persulfate 101 is represented by eq 2 2 s 2 o 8 2 2 s o 4 the subsequent eqs 3 and 4 represents conversion of sulfate radical into hydroxyl radical as well as further interaction of hydroxyl radical with persulfate to form sulfate radical 64 71 3 s o 4 h 2 o o h h s o 4 2 4 s 2 o 8 2 o h h s o 4 s o 4 1 2 o 2 sulfate radical acts as an oxidizing agent and therefore accept electron yielding sulfate anion as represented by eq 5 102 5 s o 4 e s o 4 2 all reactions depicted above illustrate the generation of sulfate and hydroxyl radicals which further participate in oxidation process for conversion of any pollutants including the sds used in the current work the obtained trends of degradation at various kps loadings are shown in fig 3 variation of kps loading with respect to sds from 0 24 g l to 0 48 g l corresponding rox from 3 2 to 6 4 enhanced the degradation of 80 mg l sds solution from 90 6 to 99 7 in 18 min for microwave power of 210 w the obtained results are attributed to increased generation of s o 4 due to increased kps loading and combined action of free radicals generated similar enhancement in microwave assisted degradation of reactive yellow 145 dye 103 methylene blue 104 and sdbs 79 using persulfate is reported in literature in microwave assisted degradation of reactive yellow 145 the extent of degradation increased from 43 6 to 93 2 in 120 s with an increase in kps loading from 0 7 to 3 7 mm at 400 w microwave power for degradation of methylene blue with an increase in sodium persulfate loading from 1 to 5 g l at 70 c temperature the extent of degradation increased from 71 to 93 5 in 8 min at 1600 w power similar enhancement in degradation of sdbs to 98 3 in 28 min was observed for increase in kps loading from 0 to 2 g l the obtained results in present work are in agreement with work reported however the optimum conditions and the observed extent of increase are different highlighting the importance of the current work 3 1 2 effect of hydrogen peroxide loading on extent of microwave assisted sds degradation in the presence of kps the use of dual oxidant may exert synergistic effect and hence it is possible to enhance the extent and rate of degradation in the presence of different oxidants as demonstrated for the treatment of landfill leachate using combination of sodium persulfate and hydrogen peroxide 105 and also for degradation of 1 1 1 trichloroethane using combination of hydrogen peroxide and persulfate 106 combined use of hydrogen peroxide and persulfate can stimulate the formation of sulfate and hydroxyl radicals 107 anticipating the possible synergy and intensification microwave assisted degradation trials using s o 4 and oh obtained from kps and hp have been investigated as maximum degradation was obtained with 0 48 g l as kps loading rox value of 6 4 experiments for combination were performed keeping kps loading constant as 0 48 g l and the hydrogen peroxide loading was varied from 0 16 to 0 4 g l rox for the hp varied from 16 9 to 42 3 under the conditions of constant microwave power as 210 w and 80 mg l as the initial concentration of sds solution fig 4 indicates the observed trends and it can be seen that the rate of degradation increases with an increase in hydrogen peroxide loading complete degradation of sds was obtained in 12 min at hydrogen peroxide loading of 0 320 g l equivalent rox value 33 9 and kps loading of 0 48 g l equivalent rox value of 6 4 under similar conditions with kps alone only 93 5 sds degradation was seen the presence of dual oxidants favors multiradical attack and thereby enhances the rate of degradation 107 similar trends for the treatment of landfill leachate with persulfate hydrogen peroxide alone and combination approaches were reported by hilles et al 105 under the optimum conditions 31 cod reduction and 28 nh3 oxidation was reported using hydrogen peroxide alone whereas higher extents of 45 and 46 respectively with persulfate as an oxidant were observed simultaneous use of persulfate and hydrogen peroxide enhanced cod reduction and ammonia oxidation to 81 and 83 respectively 105 it can be clearly seen that though the trends are similar the quantitative differences in the observed intensification confirm the importance of the current work the reported results for remediation of chorophenol contaminated soil by persulfate and hydrogen peroxide based oxidant 108 also confirm this hypothesis of varying quantitative results with the type of contaminant 3 1 3 comparison of kps and hydrogen peroxide for enhancing the extent of sds degradation the comparison of the sds degradation results with kps and hydrogen peroxide alone in the presence of microwave was performed to investigate the potential of individual oxidants fig 5 represents the results for only kps and only hydrogen peroxide induced degradation of sds under conditions of microwave power of 210 w sds solution concentration of 80 mg l and treatment time of 18 min it was observed that for oxidant loading of 0 32 g l of kps and hydrogen peroxide each equivalent rox value as 4 2 and 33 9 for kps and hp respectively ph of solution after oxidant addition was 5 70 the observed extent of sds degradation was 94 41 and 24 3 respectively it can be thus clearly seen inspite of higher rox loading of hp kps is much more effective the oo bond in persulfate is weaker compared to that in h2o2 therefore due to better activation of persulfate compared to h2o2 kps shows better activity in terms of sds degradation under similar operating conditions 71 thermal activation of persulfate produces s o 4 radical which has a strong oxidation potential in addition reaction of s o 4 radical with water also produces oh radicals thus due to combined action of s o 4 and oh radicals higher degradation is observed using persulfate compared to hydrogen peroxide alone as an oxidant where only hydroxyl radicals are contributing to the degradation the addition of hydrogen peroxide in combination with kps investigated at optimum dose as 0 48 g l corresponding rox as 6 4 is seen to give enhancement as per the data mentioned in fig 4 the use of dual oxidant resulted in degradation rate enhancement as well as higher sds degradation at lower treatment times it is observed that the trials with only kps yielded 99 6 degradation in 18 min whereas at similar conditions with hydrogen peroxide as additional oxidant with rox value as 33 9 complete degradation was obtained in only 12 min the rate of degradation was also faster as in 10 min kps alone gave 71 12 sds degradation whereas when dual oxidant kps and hp corresponding rox value as 33 9 resulted in the extent of degradation as 94 4 the above trends indicate the advantage of dual oxidant system in terms of lowering the required time for complete degradation and enhancing the rate of degradation it it worthwhile to compare the results for efficacy of oxidants operated individually with that reported in literature similar results for the better efficacy of persulphate in the case of microwave assisted degradation of pentachlorophenol compared to the use of hydrogen peroxide are reported in the literature under the optimum condition of ph as 11 microwave power of 600 w sodium persulfate and hydrogen peroxide dose of 0 02 and 0 2 mol l respectively 94 and 83 cod removal was reported by using sodium persulfate and hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant respectively 109 better btex destruction efficacy using sodium persulfate than hydrogen peroxide has also been reported in the literature 110 olmez hanci and arslan alaton 111 investigated shortwave uv uv c assisted peroxy monosulfate pms persulfate ps and hydrogen peroxide based oxidation of 48 mg l phenol solution at an initial ph of 3 with an increase in oxidant loading till optimum the extent of degradation and mineralization of phenol was reported to increase it was observed that complete degradation of phenol was obtained after 50 30 and 75 min with ps uv c h2o2 uv c and pms uv c combinations respectively for the oxidant concentration of 5 mm also the extent of mineralization was highest for h2o2 87 followed by ps 65 and pms 33 the complete mineralization was obtained in 30 40 min for optimum initial ps and pms concentration of 20 mm and h2o2 concentration as 30 mm again it is important to see that though the qualitative trends are similar for most cases the quantitative changes are different depending on the system and hence importance of the current work is clearly established it is also established that for some pollutant and activation source different trends in terms of better efficacy for hydrogen peroxide can be obtained thereby making a detailed investigation into comparison of different oxidants as presented in current work very important 3 1 4 effect of microwave power on extent of sds degradation the effect of microwave power on the extent of sds degradation was studied over the range 70 280 w sds solution of 80 mg l concentration was irradiated for 18 min as the fixed treatment time and also the kps loading of 0 480 g l with rox value as 6 4 ph of solution as 6 33 was maintained constant the observed trends are depicted in fig 6 and it can be seen that with an increase in power from 70 to 280 w the degradation intensified with actual extent changing from 13 86 to 100 only 13 86 degradation obtained at 70 w power is attributed to inadequate energy being available for persulfate activation which subsequently reduced the radical formation and hence the degradation it was also observed that microwave power as 210 and 280 w gave almost similar degradation as 99 7 and 100 indicating that 210 w is the optimum power beyond optimum power the excess energy supplied is used for excessive heating and possible vaporization of solution similar trends were also observed in our earlier work related to the degradation of sdbs for variation in the power from 140 to 350 w the extent of sdbs degradation increased with the actual values as 19 3 50 87 4 and 93 1 for microwave power of 140 210 280 and 350 w respectively 79 it is important to note that the observed changes are different depending on the contaminant in question as the optimum power may or may not be observed thus it is important to perform a detailed investigation into the effect of power dissipation 3 2 ultrasound assisted degradation of sds 3 2 1 using only ultrasound the ultrasound trials for degradation of sds were performed using conditions of 80 mg l as the initial concentration 250 ml as the solution volume for a treatment time of 120 min at varying powers of 100 150 and 200 w for all investigated power range no degradation was observed which indicates that only ultrasound energy is not sufficient enough to induce any degradation of surfactant it is important to note that actual energy transferred into the solution is quite low based on the lower transfer efficiency for ultrasonic horn 112 which coupled with low frequency operation gives lesser intensity of cavitation and the number of hydroxyl radicals generated may not be sufficient to cause any degradation 85 113 114 typical reaction which represents generation of hydroxyl radical by sonolysis is represented by eq 6 6 h 2 o o h h the number of hydroxyl radicals generated depends on applied frequency power and properties of solution 114 it is expected that physical effects dominates at low frequency 115 whereas chemical effects dominates at higher frequency 116 low frequency ultrasound facilitates development of larger bubble cavity and lower intensity cavitation events due to more water vapor present in larger bubble and cushioning effects less hydroxyl radicals are produced at lower frequency it is also reported that for operation between 200 400 khz frequency higher quantum of hydroxyl radicals are generated 116 117 overall no degradation with only low frequency us may be attributed to less hydroxyl radical generation due to less number of cavitation events cushioning action due to more water vapor content and dominance of conditions suitable for physical phenomenon in order to enhance the efficacy of the ultrasound based process the coupling of us based process with oxidants is necessary 118 and hence subsequently us was coupled with oxidants such as persulfate and hp it is also important to note that the observed results cannot be generalized for all anionic surfactants only us assisted degradation of sdbs using ultrasonic bath is indeed reported in literature 8 the varying results are attributed to differences in power and concentration of surfactants used very less sdbs concentration between 0 2 to 2 mg l was used by dehghani et al 8 and power used was much higher in the range of 400 500 w since using higher power was not feasible in the current work oxidant coupling with us based process was attempted at 150 w as power dissipation which was best as per recommendations of the supplier using still higher power over continuous durations might lead to problems to the equipment and hence not applied 3 2 2 ultrasound assisted kps induced degradation the efficacy of using persulfate having oxidation potential 2 01 v 111 as an intensification approach in the presence of ultrasound was also investigated ultrasound alone may initiate the activation of persulfate and the extent of sulfate radicals generated depend on the sonochemical reactor configuration ultrasound frequency power and temperature 85 119 the representative activation reaction is depicted by the eq 7 mentioned below 7 s 2 o 8 2 2 s o 4 the degradation experiments were carried out at fixed ultrasonic power of 150 w applied to sds solution at 250 ml solution volume initial concentration of 80 mg l natural ph condition temperature of 323 k and treatment time of 120 min the kps loading was varied between 0 8 to 2 g l equivalent rox value from 10 6 to 26 6 it was observed that with an increase in loading from 0 8 to 2 g l equivalent rox from 10 6 to 26 6 the degradation increased from 53 1 to 95 4 as per the results shown in fig 7 similar trends are also reported in the literature 96 103 for the effect of presence of kps as well as kps loading using different modes of activation patil and shukla 103 investigated microwave activated persulfate based degradation of reactive yellow 145 over the loading range of 0 7 to 4 4 mm and reported an increase in degradation from 43 6 to 93 2 for an increase in loading up to 3 7 mm however for further increase in kps loading to 4 4 mm the extent of degradation decreased to 80 9 which was attributed to scavenging of s o 4 by additional s 2 o 8 present in solution and not utilized for sulphate radical formation in another study dealing with sonochemical degradation of tetracycline alone and in combination with oxidants reported by soltani et al 120 revealed that use of ultrasound in addition to pms and marite nanoparticle enhanced the degradation only ultrasound or only pms was not found to be effective because of less generation of hydroxyl radicals the degradation rate in absence of ultrasound was found to be 0 048 min 1 whereas application of 37 khz ultrasound at supplied power of 320 w enhanced rate to 0 0770 min 1 120 confirming the necessity of presence of activation agent as well as oxidant similar trends for degradation of amoxicillin by persulfate activation by uv 254 and ultrasound were reported by sepyani et al 64 in a typical experiment at optimized condition 10 degradation of amoxicillin was reported by only ultrasound however ultrasound coupling with persulfate enhanced degradation to 61 2 again confirming better results for combination overall it can be said that typically with increased loading availability of oxidizing radicals increases and subsequently extent of degradation increases it is again worthwhile to comment that though the trends are similar the extent of increase and existence of optimum is dependent on the specific system in question in general it is also established that combination of ultrasound and kps is generally beneficial compared to the individual applications 3 2 3 effect of dual oxidant system as kps and hydrogen peroxide on ultrasound assisted degradation to evaluate efficacy of dual oxidant based degradation 121 experiments were performed using various combinations of kps and hydrogen peroxide in the presence of ultrasound as maximum degradation of 95 4 was obtained for kps loading of 2 g l equivalent rox value of 26 6 trials using combined kps and hydrogen peroxide loading were carried out at fixed kps rox value of 26 6 the power temperature and treatment time were maintained as constant 150 w 323 k and 120 min respectively and the loading of hydrogen peroxide was varied from 0 320 g l to 0 800 g l equivalent rox value of 33 9 84 7 as per the results shown in fig 8 it can be seen that the extent of sds degradation enhanced from 65 3 to 92 7 with an increase in the hydrogen peroxide loading from 0 320 g l to 0 640 g l rox value from 33 9 to 67 7 respectively however the degradation decreased to 78 1 for a further increase in loading to 0 8g l rox to 84 7 from the obtained results it can be said that no synergy in enhancement in degradation was observed for the dual oxidant system the obtained degradation for optimum hydrogen peroxide loading combined with kps was found to be less compared the approach of using only kps at loading of 2 g l rox of 26 6 from the experimental investigations it can be concluded kps is more dominant oxidant than hydrogen peroxide addition of hydrogen peroxide is contributing negatively to the oxidant system perhaps attributed to the dominant role of sulfate radicals in oxidation of sds due to the introduction of hydrogen peroxide ultrasonic energy is utilized for dissociation of hydrogen peroxide and hence the activation effects on kps are reduced which explains the lower degradation observed for the combination 3 2 4 controlled and uncontrolled degradation in the presence of kps acoustic cavitation can be carried out under controlled and uncontrolled conditions of the operating temperature the controlled trials were performed at supplied power of 150 w and constant temperature of 323 k with the heat supplied using constant temperature water bath in uncontrolled experimental trial no external heating was supplied and the temperature rise was attributed to the cavitation effect the maximum temperature reached during uncontrolled trial was 313 k kps loading of 2 g l rox as 26 6 was maintained constant in both the trials the ph of solution after addition of kps was measured as 7 44 95 4 sds degradation was obtained in controlled experiments whereas for the same loading in uncontrolled trials sds degradation reduced to only 45 5 the observed results are represented in fig 9 it was also observed that no degradation was obtained for trials with only ultrasound without oxidant at same supplied power as 150 w the obtained results clearly indicate that temperature and oxidant are major factors responsible for degradation of sds 3 3 comparison of microwave and ultrasound for activation of oxidants efficacy of microwave and ultrasound irradiation for the activation of kps and h2o2 in the combined approach was compared in the present work which is an important consideration as no such study has been reported earlier to the best of our knowledge microwave irradiation results in molecular level intense heating whereas local hotspots are generated due to ultrasound based cavitation microwave directly penetrates in the bulk couples with polar molecules and hence quick and uniform heating of solution is observed with only microwave and ultrasound no degradation was obtained the irradiation of solution with ultrasound and microwave may generate hydroxyl radical which may subsequently attack contaminant molecules however the obtained results indicates that both ultrasound and microwave irradiations alone were not effective in producing sufficient hydroxyl radical and due to this no degradation was obtained table 1 represents the comparative performance of irradiation activation source in terms of the obtained extent of degradation for combination the obtained results indicated that microwave assisted degradation is effective compared to ultrasound assisted degradation for the case of microwave irradiation 96 8 degradation of sds was obtained in 18 min with optimum operative conditions as microwave power of 140 w and kps loading of 0 480 g l rox value as 6 4 the microwave power used for calculation for comparing efficacy was selected such that it is near ultrasound power even though the optimum conditions corresponding to highest rate and extent of degradation are different 210 w as the power for ultrasound assisted degradation with 150 w power dissipation and kps loading of 2 g l rox value as 26 6 95 4 degradation was obtained in 120 min even though the optimum conditions are different under comparable power dissipation microwave assisted degradation is definitely found to be more effective than ultrasound based approach the observed results are attributed to dominant role of temperature and microwave non thermal effects in quick activation of persulfate and subsequent degradation of sds the comparison of energy requirements in both microwave and ultrasound based approach was evaluated at optimum conditions the energy comparison was made by using the parameter electrical energy per order e e o expressed in kwh m3 the parameter signifies the amount of energy required in kwh for 90 degradation of 1 m3 of contaminant solution 122 the detailed calculations are depicted in annexure i e e o estimated for the microwave assisted approach was 154 kwh m3 whereas that for ultrasound assisted degradation was 980 kwh m3 thus from the estimation it is established that the cost of ultrasound assisted degradation would be about 6 times greater than the cost for the microwave based approach 4 conclusions the experimental investigations presented in the work provided important understanding about microwave as well as ultrasound assisted degradation of sodium dodecyl sulfate potential of sulfate vis à vis hydroxyl based oxidants alone or in combination understanding into the effect of different operating conditions activation mechanism and oxidant on the extent of degradation was evaluated it was clearly established that only microwave or only ultrasound alone can t degrade sds effectively and coupling with oxidant like kps and hydrogen peroxide results in significant intensification in the degradation therefore use of irradiation sources along with oxidants is necessary for enhancing the effectiveness the microwave degradation yielded complete sds degradation in 12 min with dual oxidants whereas in the case of ultrasound induced degradation in the presence of kps at 2 g l loading rox value as 26 6 maximum degradation of sds was 95 4 in 120 min the efficacy of kps as an oxidant was found better than hydrogen peroxide the use of dual oxidant enhanced the rate and extent of degradation only in the case of microwave based process in the case of microwave degradation was beneficiated by the use of higher power till an optimum 210 w above which the additional supplied energy was used for boiling rather than activation induced degradation in the case of us based oxidation of sds using dual oxidant as kps and hp was found less effective in sds degradation compared to the use of only kps the parameter indicative of energy requirement as energy per order eeo revealed that at comparative power ultrasound required six times greater energy than that required for microwave based approach with kps as an oxidant the present work has clearly established the efficacy of microwave based irradiation combined with oxidants in removing the sds successfully though to think about commercial applications the future work is being directed to determine the extent of mineralization as well as evaluation of the intermediates and the effects on biotoxicity declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments psb would like to

14001,the present investigation explores application of microwave and ultrasound for degradation of important surfactant as sodium dodecyl sulfate sds understanding into the effects of power dissipation potassium persulfate kps and or hydrogen peroxide hp loadings on the extent of degradation has been presented along with comparison of efficacy of microwave ultrasound for activation under best treatment conditions of power and kps loading 99 7 degradation of sds at 80 mg l as initial loading was obtained in only 18 min using the microwave combined with kps approach keeping all operating parameters at the established best use of kps and addition of second oxidant as hydrogen peroxide was investigated and observed to enhance the extent and rate of degradation for the microwave with complete degradation of sds obtained in 12 min ultrasound activation of kps yielded lower efficacy compared to microwave with 95 4 degradation of sds obtained in 120 min under the optimized kps loading as 2 g l molar ratio of kps to sds rox as 26 6 150 w as power and 323 k as the temperature the trials with dual oxidant in the presence of ultrasound showed reduced degradation of sds compared to kps alone as an oxidant the analysis of both approaches clearly revealed that microwave assisted degradation of sds was effective than ultrasound the observed enhancement in rate and extent of sds degradation using two oxidants in the case of microwave assisted approach compared to ultrasound and demonstrated effectiveness of sulfate radical in deciding degradation are the key outcomes of the study keywords advanced oxidation process sulfate radicals hydroxyl radical microwave irradiations ultrasound assisted degradation 1 introduction contamination of water resources in all parts of the world is an issue of immediate concern world water assessment report wwap published by united nations highlights the status of water quality and availability across the globe 1 2 the nature of contaminations discharged into water bodies are changing with advancement in life style habits and anthropogenic activities the recent additions to the class of contaminants are termed as emerging contaminants 3 various sources like farm hospitals household industry animal feeding units dairy farms pharmaceutical processing industries etc discharge different emerging contaminants 4 the emerging contaminants are not listed in regulatory list and hence not monitored and analyzed on a regular basis pharmaceuticals personal care products surfactants pesticides steroids and hormones etc are some examples of such emerging contaminants 5 surfactants which are also listed in this class are most widely used substances these are amphiphilic molecules also known as tenside or detergents 6 typical characteristics of these compounds are that they remain unchanged after use 7 due to the ubiquitous nature and large volume of surfactants consumed they are often present in urban and industrial wastewater 8 10 with recent growing awareness about the need for tackling emerging contaminants there is a strong need into developing approaches for effective treatment of surfactant containing wastewaters amongst the various surfactants anionic surfactants constitutes around 55 of total surfactants manufactured in the world 11 12 sodium dodecyl sulfate sds constitutes major share in anionic surfactants used globally 13 sds is an alkyl sulfate with sodium as counter ion and 12 carbon atoms 14 sds offers significant uses in different applications due to the typical characteristics for example it binds to positively charged hydrophobic residue of protein 15 it is an important ingredient in toothpastes shampoos shaving foam bubble baths personal care products and detergents 16 17 due to the widespread uses there are good chances that it can be released in abundance into the environment 18 19 creating pollution issues permissible limit for anionic surfactants is generally 0 5 mg l for drinking water and 1 mg l for industrial application however lower concentrations are also reported to cause undesirable effects the foam is clearly evident for concentration above 1 mg l 7 the biodegradability of many surfactants is inhibited at concentration levels above 20 to 50 mg l 20 sds is an important surfactant considering the toxicity problems as well it typically comes with backdrop of various concerns related to toxicity and effect on flora and fauna in case concentrations exceeds the permissible limits it is reported to cause aquatic toxicity labored breath diarrhea and carbon metabolism disruption 21 ld50 value of 0 8 1 10 g kg for rat and death of 4 out of 20 animals has been reported in literature 13 due to reported hazards and various environmental concerns it is necessary to treat the effluent containing surfactants like sds and this justifies the selection of surfactant in the present work generally biological treatments are preferred for treatment of industrial and domestic wastewater because of ability to handle large volume and relatively lower treatment cost the efficacy of only biological treatment is generally dependent on the type of the pollutant and its loading 22 in the case of surfactants biological oxidation is typically not effective especially at higher levels of concentrations due to the inhibitory effects on the microorganisms and supply of oxygen in the system there have been some studies reported for mechanistic understanding or the modifications in bioremediation so as to enhanced efficacy for example attwood and flowrence 123 reported that biodegradation of sdbs occurs by ω oxidation whereas that of sds occurs by β oxidation it was also reported that ω oxidation pathway requires oxygen whereas β oxidation does not require oxygen abboud et al 18 investigated biodegradation of sds and sdbs and reported that instead of single bacteria strain consortium of bacteria is more effective in intensifying degradation various other methods such as coagulation 23 adsorption 24 31 physicochemical treatments 32 photo induced degradation 33 35 membrane separations 36 38 electrochemical oxidation 39 40 biodegradation 41 45 ultrasound assisted degradation 8 46 47 advanced oxidation 48 52 and wet air oxidation 20 53 55 have also been reported for the removal or degradation of surfactants present in wastewater all these methods offer some level of treatment of the surfactant containing wastewaters but also offer problems as discussed now adsorptive separation is proven and most widely explored method of treating wastewater it is possible to use varied materials in raw or modified form as an adsorbent it is also possible to tailor the performance either by varying the method of synthesis activation or by functionalization of adsorbents however the application of this method is limited when effluent contains higher concentration of surfactants even the presence of other contaminants can also affect the performance one more point is that adsorption is generally looked as a method that transforms the contaminants from one form to other rather than effective destruction coagulation is another simple method applied for wastewater treatment and generally used for removal of colloidal particulate matter its efficacy for removal of sds has also been reported in literature beltrán heredia and sánchez martín 23 investigated the removal of sds by coagulation based on the use of moringa oleifera extract as a coagulant from sds solution of 25 mg l as the initial concentration 80 sds removal was reported at 40 mg l as the coagulant dose there are no other studies reporting the use of coagulants as effective treatment option for surfactants and this is generally preferred as primary treatment not focusing really on any specific contaminant or as a complete treatment solution chemical oxidation treatment methods generally use chlorine and its derivates such as chlorine dioxide or hypochlorus acid as an oxidation agent these methods suffer from inherent limitation of slow rate of degradation higher cost of chemicals compared to aops based on hydroxyl radicals 56 and therefore generally not preferred by industry wet air oxidation wao though considered effective for degradation of refractory organics requires higher pressures in the range of 1 20 mpa and temperature between 200 300 c typically the oxidation products obtained using wao are amenable for biodegradation 54 and hence this can form as an effective pretreatment option wao effectiveness is also reported to be enhanced with use of oxidants like ozone and hydrogen peroxide 57 and also metal oxides as catalyst for example around 77 degradation higher as compared to without catalyst of 1000 mg l sdbs solution at an oxygen partial pressure of 1 5 mpa and 220 c was reported in 120 min using wao in the presence of cuo zno al2o3 as a catalyst 20 as wao requires very intense operating conditions cost and safety are to be evaluated before these techniques are applied in wastewater treatment advanced oxidation processes are based on the oxidizing radicals such as oh or s o 4 these are potent having higher oxidation potential and non selective than traditional chemical oxidants 58 aops are aqueous phase oxidation processes 59 where the oxidants used are clean in situ generated and do not persist in the environment and therefore don t affect secondary treatment 50 various oxidants like ozone persulfate fenton reagent hydrogen peroxide peroxone mostly in combination or in the presence of activating agents can be applied to generate the hydroxyl radical or the sulfate radicals which are stronger oxidizing agents as compared to native form of oxidants for example persulfate can be activated by thermal energy uv ultrasound microwaves or other chemical reagent to facilitate radical generation which non selectively attacks the persistent organic contaminants present in effluent at higher rate giving enhanced efficacy for degradation similarly combinatin of hydrogen peroxide and ozone at specific ph conditions results in hydroxyl radical formation the reactive free radicals generated in aop enhance biodegradability of wastewater as well as decreases the aquatic toxicity due to generation of low molecular weight relatively simple products and degradation intermediates of main emerging contaminant 60 65 the aop s which uses ps and pms oxidants are denoted as sr aop sulfate radical enhanced advanced oxidation processes 66 typically the oxidation by o h radical based processes occurs by hydrogen atom transfer whereas reaction with sulfate radical involves oxidation by electron transfer 67 ozonation is another chemical advanced oxidation process that involves degradation of organic contaminants by ozone it has strong oxidation potential as 2 07 v activation of ozone by using alkaline conditions uv light or transition metal catalysts generate highly reactive species like hydroxyl and hydroperoxyl radicals which subsequently attacks the pollutants at higher rates hydrogen peroxide has oxidation potential as 1 77 v though individual operation is less effective and therefore always used in combination as advanced oxidation approach activation by photocatalysis tio2 or tio2 uv ferrous sulphate or ozone generates hydroxyl radical which enhance the degradation efficiency however the activation method used depends upon contaminant present and properties of the solution 61 62 66 the use of cavitation based advanced oxidation is also reported for degradation of organic contaminants possibility of ambient temperature oxidation use of various configurations of cavitating devices and flexibility of coupling with advanced oxidation processes are the key attributes of cavitation process 68 again individual operation of cavitation is not considered as effective and therefore coupling with oxidants is necessary to enhance the extent of degradation the current work focuses on the use of ultrasound based cavitation and microwave based oxidation processes coupled with persulfate ps and hydrogen peroxide oxidant alone or in combination as process intensification approach the use of sound energy or microwave can activate the oxidants and facilitate the generation of free radicals leading to intensification ps has less bond dissociation energy when dissolved in water 140 2 kj mol whereas h2o2 has bond dissociation energy of 195 4 kj mol the reported investigations related to treatment of effluents in bitumen manufacturing by ps and peroxy monosulfate pms revealed that the cost of treatment by pms was more than double the cost of treatment by ps considering this aspect only ps was used in the current work the efficacy of treatment in terms of cod reduction is reported as a function of oxidant loading with operating temperature also as a crucial parameter 69 even though temperature is key factor for activation of ps or pms use of appropriate nanocatalyst can also lower the activation temperature for example 3d mesoporous α co oh 2 nanosheets electrodeposited on nickel foam co oh 2 ns pms was reported to degrade phenol completely in just 2 min by low temperature activation of pms between 20 40 c 70 the present work only deals with use of temperature and combination of ps with hydrogen peroxide along with use of microwave ultrasound as controlling variables to intensify degradation the increase in temperature is found to increase the degradation efficiency for ps and pms based processes the enhancement occurs more significantly between 40 to 60 c 71 this justifies the operating temperature selected for ultrasound assisted degradation in the present work the combination of ps and hydrogen peroxide was with an objective that simultaneous availability of sulphate and hydroxyl radicals can be beneficial under presence of activating energy source such as microwave ultrasound or ultraviolet irraidation for example shat et al 2018 investigated the use of bi fe doped zno for solar light mediated photodegradation of norfloxacin nor in the presence of pms the doping with b i 3 and f e 2 prevented hole and electron recombination which enhanced efficacy of the photocatalyst in giving more hydroxyl radicals it was also reported that addition of peroxy monosulfate h s o 5 enhanced the degradation of nor from 80 in absence of pms to 99 by addition of 0 2 mm h s o 5 in 120 min the enhanced degradation is attributed to early activation of pms by b i f e z n o to yield highly reactive s o 4 a n d o h radicals which simultaneously take part in the oxidation 72 microwave based oxidation methods offer good potential for the degradation of contaminants present in wastewater 73 75 direct coupling with polar molecules rapid heating short treatment times and possibility of microwave specific and also non thermal effects are unique attributes of microwave based processes 76 microwave alone may not have enough energy to break the chemical bonds especially in the case of complex compounds such as surfactants however coupling with oxidants or additives which can enhance microwave absorption or hotspot generation or generate radicals can give significant intensification ability of microwave to enhance rate of reaction with typical thermal as well as non thermal effects has aroused the interest for microwave assisted treatments including degradation or effluent treatment 77 the key intensification attributes of microwave assisted process are due to difference in rate and effectiveness of microwave based heating compared to conventional heating method microwave heating offers the advantages as intense and rapid heating at molecular level as compared to the conventional heating approach in the past microwave has been applied for degradation of dyes phenolic compounds and various organic chemicals also highlighting the promising nature of mw for example the degradation enhancement to the extent of 30 1300 are reported for mw assisted aops 78 analysis of literature revealed that not much work has been reported for the application of microwave for the intensification of degradation of anionic surfactants in our earlier work microwave assisted persulfate induced degradation of sdbs was investigated reporting 98 5 degradation obtained in 28 min under the optimized conditions of 280 w as power 2 g l as k2s2o8 loading and using 250 ml sdbs solution the efficacy of microwave non thermal effects was demonstrated with only 51 46 sdbs degradation being obtained by conventional heating based oxidation under similar conditions of operating temperature 79 zhang et al 124 also investigated microwave induced destruction of sdbs in the presence of activated carbon modified by feso4 as catalyst complete degradation of sdbs at loading of 100 mg l in 230 s was reported to be obtained using microwave oxidation at modified activated carbon dose of 2 8 g l whereas only 83 54 degradation was reported using unmodified activated carbon considering that no work has been presented for sds as model surfactant the present work has focused on the application of microwave induced degradation of sds the present work also illustrates the comparison with ultrasound induced oxidation in terms of degradation and the activation effects on different oxidants cavitation induced by ultrasound also generates hydroxyl radical and thereby facilitate the degradation or oxidation of contaminants 80 the collapse of cavities releases very large energy over a micro level in turn generating hot spots and shock waves 81 all these conditions are indeed favorable for degradation of pollutants using ultrasound 56 82 similar to microwave degradation of various organic compounds and contaminants such as trichlorophenol rhodamine b etc 68 83 84 using ultrasound induced cavitation have been reported it is also epected that use of catalyst or oxidants can enhance the efficacy of sonochemical treatment as a specific example study involving degradation of sulfide and organic sulfide contaminants present in real effluent from bitumen manufacturing plant reported that the degradation with acoustic as well as hydrodynamic cavitation approach required 180 min for complete degradation however the use of external oxidants like o3 h2o2 and o3 h2o2 yielded the same result in 30 min only 85 similar trends related to necessity of oxidants in hydrodynamic cavitation based treatment of effluent from bitumen processing plant in alkaline conditions are reported 86 the enhancement in sonochemical degradation of acetaminophen due to the use of catalyst under conditions of 80 khz as ultrasound frequency at supplied power of 256 w was also reported only ultrasound degraded the contaminant to 7 6 which further increased to 75 in 60 min with us and catalyst as zno immobilized on powder stone waste 87 similar investigations related to ultrasound assisted degradation of anionic surfactants 8 46 47 88 has also been reported abu hassan et al 46 investigated the use of low frequency irradiation for degradation of sdbs and reported that under optimized conditions of 22 khz 125 w power and 303 k 80 sdbs degradation is obtained in 120 min manousaki et al 88 also reported 79 and 51 degradation of sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate at two different initial concentrations of 30 and 100 mg l respectively at optimized conditions of 150 w power and 303 k temperature in 240 min dehghani et al 8 reported that ultrasound assisted degradation of sdbs at 293 k 130 khz frequency and acoustic power of 400 w resulted in 51 7 degradation in 120 min it is interesting to note that all the reported literature is focused mainly on sdbs as model surfactant and also based on oh mediated degradation either using only ulrasound or in combination with oxidants catalysts that gives additional hydroxyl radicals it is important to note that s o 4 based degradation of surfactant is not explored in the presence of ultrasound and hence targeted in the present work clearly establishing the novelty persulfate has a high oxidation potential of 2 01 v and also its activation results in more powerful s o 4 radicals with oxidation potential of 2 6 v 89 typically heat metals uv light ultrasound and elevated ph can activate the persulfate leading to formation of sulfate radicals use of persulfate as oxidants has been mainly reported for degradation of polymers like poly ethelyne oxide 90 poly acrylic acid 91 and for removal of refractory organic contaminants 92 as well as in situ oxidation of contaminants present in groundwater 93 it is important to note that not much work is again seen for the persulfate based degradation of surfactants and also comparison of any two modes of activation is not seen in the open literature the present work thus gives novel information on comparison of the efficacy of ultrasound and microwave as modes of activation of persulfate overall the present work deals with microwave and ultrasound assisted degradation of sodium dodecyl sulfate the work also compares the efficacy of s o 4 and oh alone or in combination for oxidation as well as the efficacy of microwave or ultrasound in activating the persulfate so as to yield the formation of oxidants 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the required chemicals as sds analytical grade 99 acridine orange hemi zinc chloride salt with dye content of 87 glacial acetic acid 99 5 ortho phosphoric acid 85 hydrogen peroxide 30 w v and toluene purity of 99 9 were procured from merck potassium persulfate 98 was procured from s d fine chemicals india deionised water obtained freshly in laboratory was used throughout the experimental work especially for required dilutions of the samples a stock solution of sds with concentration as 1000 mg l was prepared initially and subsequently with appropriate dilution different solutions with required initial concentration were obtained for actual experimental runs 2 1 1 modification of domestic microwave oven for degradation trials the details of domestic microwave oven whirlpool make 700 w 2 45 ghz with the required modifications have already been described in our earlier work 79 fig 1 represents the schematic of experimental assembly based on microwave oven as represented a hole was drilled from the top of microwave oven through outer and inner casing round bottom flask rbf of 500 ml capacity used as reactor was placed at centre three neck glass adapter was provided for housing the condenser and sampling ports the empty space between outer metallic cover and inner cavity cover around the hole was filled with teflon disc with collar extending outside the outer cover careful modifications of the oven and reactor assembly ensured that there was no microwave leakage 2 1 2 experimental setup for ultrasound assisted degradation fig 2 depicts the schematic experimental setup for the ultrasound assisted degradation the ultrasonic system horn supplied by dakshin mumbai is made up of titanium tip with diameter of 15 6 mm the operating frequency of the horn is 20 khz and maximum power rating is 200 w the supplied power used in the work 150 w as per the maximum recommended by the supplier temperature controlled water bath ganesh scientific industries mumbai was used a heat source glass bulb thermometer was used to measure the temperature periodically during the progress of treatment the ultrasonic horn tip was dipped about 2 cm into the solution taken in 250 ml beaker covered with aluminum foil and kept in temperature controlled water bath 2 2 experimental procedure from the stock solution of sds 80 mg l sds solution natural ph as 5 86 was prepared every time freshly to be used in the experiments the same concentration of sds solution was used throughout the experimental investigations the selection of the concentration was based on the earlier literature reports 79 the effect of concentration was not investigated in the work as most of the times it is observed that lower concentrations of pollutants give higher rates of degradation though this cannot confirm that dilution is indeed an option for application of wastewater treatment approach at commercial level as higher volumes of effluent will have to be treated considering this fact a fixed concentration of 80 mg l has been used as a representative of commercial samples required quantity of oxidant was added before experiment pre decided microwave or ultrasound power was adjusted and experiment continued for pre decided time periodically samples were taken out and quenched by chilled water immediately to prevent further degradation after sampling this quenching was followed by sample preparation and analysis as per the acridine orange complex method 94 the microwave trials were carried out in power controlled manner and therefore no attempt was made to control the temperature the microwave power was varied between 70 to 280 w kps loading was varied between 0 24 to 0 480 g l to understand the effect of kps loading and then subsequently keeping constant optimum kps loading established in the work hydrogen peroxide hp loading was varied between 0 16 to 0 4 g l the oxidant availability in comparison with pollutant is very important parameter in order to ensure the maximum or complete oxidation of pollutant the oxidant is generally added in excess of stoichiometric requirement for better representation oxidant loading has also been represented in terms of molar ratio of oxidant to pollutant designated as rox 95 for the two oxidants used in the present work the values of oxidant ratio for the studies involving microwave irradiations ranged from 3 2 to 6 4 for the case of kps and from 16 9 to 42 3 for the case of hydrogen peroxide the ultrasound based trials were carried out in controlled manner where temperature was controlled and maintained constant as 323 k during uncontrolled trial the temperature was allowed to change due to sonication without external heating kps oxidant loading was varied from 0 8 to 2 g l whereas hydrogen peroxide loading was varied over the range of 320 800 mg l at fixed kps loading in the combination the rox parameter corresponding to kps and hp in the case of ultrasound varied from 10 6 to 26 6 and from 33 9 to 84 7 respectively the reproducibility of the experiments was checked by repeating experiments at least two times the data represented in the figures and discussion is the average value of the obtained results the errors in the experimental results were within 2 of the reported average values 2 3 method of analysis sds concentration in different samples was quantified using the acridine orange aco complex method 94 the method is also described in details in our earlier work 79 typically in the method the sample solution is mixed with aco and glacial acetic acid where the aco forms complex with residual surfactant the complex is extracted with toluene and the concentration of sds is determined using uv vis spectrophotometer model uv 1800 shimadzu corporation analytical and measuring instruments division japan by measuring absorbance at 499 nm 3 results and discussion 3 1 microwave assisted degradation of sds 3 1 1 effect of kps loading on extent of microwave assisted sds degrdation amongst various oxidants explored in literature persulfate has attracted lot of attention because of possibility of in situ activation stability and possibility of generating strong potent sulfate radical with higher oxidation potential 76 92 ease of storage stability high aqueous solubility and low cost are some of other advantages related to persulfate 96 persulfate unlike other biological or chemical treatment doesn t produces any sludge or any hazardous waste 97 considering these advantages it was decided to explore its efficacy in degradation of sds also microwave alone always does not have enough energy to break chemical bonds typically microwave oven operates at frequency of 2 45 ghz the energy of microwave at this frequency may not be sufficient to break chemical bonds 98 99 present in the surfactants however microwave coupling with oxidant can facilitate the degradation of contaminants 63 in the present work no degradation of sds was observed without kps which was in agreement with our earlier work about microwave induced sdbs degradation 79 therefore microwave assisted degradation of sds in the presence of kps was investigated the degradation requires activation of persulfate to form sulfate radicals which may further get converted to bisulfate anion or hydroxyl radical by successive reactions involving formed radicals typical activation is initiated based on eq 1 that depicts the activation reaction irrespective of activation source 100 1 s 2 o 8 2 a c t i v a t i o n s o u r c e s o 4 s o 4 o r s o 4 2 the thermal microwave activation of persulfate 101 is represented by eq 2 2 s 2 o 8 2 2 s o 4 the subsequent eqs 3 and 4 represents conversion of sulfate radical into hydroxyl radical as well as further interaction of hydroxyl radical with persulfate to form sulfate radical 64 71 3 s o 4 h 2 o o h h s o 4 2 4 s 2 o 8 2 o h h s o 4 s o 4 1 2 o 2 sulfate radical acts as an oxidizing agent and therefore accept electron yielding sulfate anion as represented by eq 5 102 5 s o 4 e s o 4 2 all reactions depicted above illustrate the generation of sulfate and hydroxyl radicals which further participate in oxidation process for conversion of any pollutants including the sds used in the current work the obtained trends of degradation at various kps loadings are shown in fig 3 variation of kps loading with respect to sds from 0 24 g l to 0 48 g l corresponding rox from 3 2 to 6 4 enhanced the degradation of 80 mg l sds solution from 90 6 to 99 7 in 18 min for microwave power of 210 w the obtained results are attributed to increased generation of s o 4 due to increased kps loading and combined action of free radicals generated similar enhancement in microwave assisted degradation of reactive yellow 145 dye 103 methylene blue 104 and sdbs 79 using persulfate is reported in literature in microwave assisted degradation of reactive yellow 145 the extent of degradation increased from 43 6 to 93 2 in 120 s with an increase in kps loading from 0 7 to 3 7 mm at 400 w microwave power for degradation of methylene blue with an increase in sodium persulfate loading from 1 to 5 g l at 70 c temperature the extent of degradation increased from 71 to 93 5 in 8 min at 1600 w power similar enhancement in degradation of sdbs to 98 3 in 28 min was observed for increase in kps loading from 0 to 2 g l the obtained results in present work are in agreement with work reported however the optimum conditions and the observed extent of increase are different highlighting the importance of the current work 3 1 2 effect of hydrogen peroxide loading on extent of microwave assisted sds degradation in the presence of kps the use of dual oxidant may exert synergistic effect and hence it is possible to enhance the extent and rate of degradation in the presence of different oxidants as demonstrated for the treatment of landfill leachate using combination of sodium persulfate and hydrogen peroxide 105 and also for degradation of 1 1 1 trichloroethane using combination of hydrogen peroxide and persulfate 106 combined use of hydrogen peroxide and persulfate can stimulate the formation of sulfate and hydroxyl radicals 107 anticipating the possible synergy and intensification microwave assisted degradation trials using s o 4 and oh obtained from kps and hp have been investigated as maximum degradation was obtained with 0 48 g l as kps loading rox value of 6 4 experiments for combination were performed keeping kps loading constant as 0 48 g l and the hydrogen peroxide loading was varied from 0 16 to 0 4 g l rox for the hp varied from 16 9 to 42 3 under the conditions of constant microwave power as 210 w and 80 mg l as the initial concentration of sds solution fig 4 indicates the observed trends and it can be seen that the rate of degradation increases with an increase in hydrogen peroxide loading complete degradation of sds was obtained in 12 min at hydrogen peroxide loading of 0 320 g l equivalent rox value 33 9 and kps loading of 0 48 g l equivalent rox value of 6 4 under similar conditions with kps alone only 93 5 sds degradation was seen the presence of dual oxidants favors multiradical attack and thereby enhances the rate of degradation 107 similar trends for the treatment of landfill leachate with persulfate hydrogen peroxide alone and combination approaches were reported by hilles et al 105 under the optimum conditions 31 cod reduction and 28 nh3 oxidation was reported using hydrogen peroxide alone whereas higher extents of 45 and 46 respectively with persulfate as an oxidant were observed simultaneous use of persulfate and hydrogen peroxide enhanced cod reduction and ammonia oxidation to 81 and 83 respectively 105 it can be clearly seen that though the trends are similar the quantitative differences in the observed intensification confirm the importance of the current work the reported results for remediation of chorophenol contaminated soil by persulfate and hydrogen peroxide based oxidant 108 also confirm this hypothesis of varying quantitative results with the type of contaminant 3 1 3 comparison of kps and hydrogen peroxide for enhancing the extent of sds degradation the comparison of the sds degradation results with kps and hydrogen peroxide alone in the presence of microwave was performed to investigate the potential of individual oxidants fig 5 represents the results for only kps and only hydrogen peroxide induced degradation of sds under conditions of microwave power of 210 w sds solution concentration of 80 mg l and treatment time of 18 min it was observed that for oxidant loading of 0 32 g l of kps and hydrogen peroxide each equivalent rox value as 4 2 and 33 9 for kps and hp respectively ph of solution after oxidant addition was 5 70 the observed extent of sds degradation was 94 41 and 24 3 respectively it can be thus clearly seen inspite of higher rox loading of hp kps is much more effective the oo bond in persulfate is weaker compared to that in h2o2 therefore due to better activation of persulfate compared to h2o2 kps shows better activity in terms of sds degradation under similar operating conditions 71 thermal activation of persulfate produces s o 4 radical which has a strong oxidation potential in addition reaction of s o 4 radical with water also produces oh radicals thus due to combined action of s o 4 and oh radicals higher degradation is observed using persulfate compared to hydrogen peroxide alone as an oxidant where only hydroxyl radicals are contributing to the degradation the addition of hydrogen peroxide in combination with kps investigated at optimum dose as 0 48 g l corresponding rox as 6 4 is seen to give enhancement as per the data mentioned in fig 4 the use of dual oxidant resulted in degradation rate enhancement as well as higher sds degradation at lower treatment times it is observed that the trials with only kps yielded 99 6 degradation in 18 min whereas at similar conditions with hydrogen peroxide as additional oxidant with rox value as 33 9 complete degradation was obtained in only 12 min the rate of degradation was also faster as in 10 min kps alone gave 71 12 sds degradation whereas when dual oxidant kps and hp corresponding rox value as 33 9 resulted in the extent of degradation as 94 4 the above trends indicate the advantage of dual oxidant system in terms of lowering the required time for complete degradation and enhancing the rate of degradation it it worthwhile to compare the results for efficacy of oxidants operated individually with that reported in literature similar results for the better efficacy of persulphate in the case of microwave assisted degradation of pentachlorophenol compared to the use of hydrogen peroxide are reported in the literature under the optimum condition of ph as 11 microwave power of 600 w sodium persulfate and hydrogen peroxide dose of 0 02 and 0 2 mol l respectively 94 and 83 cod removal was reported by using sodium persulfate and hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant respectively 109 better btex destruction efficacy using sodium persulfate than hydrogen peroxide has also been reported in the literature 110 olmez hanci and arslan alaton 111 investigated shortwave uv uv c assisted peroxy monosulfate pms persulfate ps and hydrogen peroxide based oxidation of 48 mg l phenol solution at an initial ph of 3 with an increase in oxidant loading till optimum the extent of degradation and mineralization of phenol was reported to increase it was observed that complete degradation of phenol was obtained after 50 30 and 75 min with ps uv c h2o2 uv c and pms uv c combinations respectively for the oxidant concentration of 5 mm also the extent of mineralization was highest for h2o2 87 followed by ps 65 and pms 33 the complete mineralization was obtained in 30 40 min for optimum initial ps and pms concentration of 20 mm and h2o2 concentration as 30 mm again it is important to see that though the qualitative trends are similar for most cases the quantitative changes are different depending on the system and hence importance of the current work is clearly established it is also established that for some pollutant and activation source different trends in terms of better efficacy for hydrogen peroxide can be obtained thereby making a detailed investigation into comparison of different oxidants as presented in current work very important 3 1 4 effect of microwave power on extent of sds degradation the effect of microwave power on the extent of sds degradation was studied over the range 70 280 w sds solution of 80 mg l concentration was irradiated for 18 min as the fixed treatment time and also the kps loading of 0 480 g l with rox value as 6 4 ph of solution as 6 33 was maintained constant the observed trends are depicted in fig 6 and it can be seen that with an increase in power from 70 to 280 w the degradation intensified with actual extent changing from 13 86 to 100 only 13 86 degradation obtained at 70 w power is attributed to inadequate energy being available for persulfate activation which subsequently reduced the radical formation and hence the degradation it was also observed that microwave power as 210 and 280 w gave almost similar degradation as 99 7 and 100 indicating that 210 w is the optimum power beyond optimum power the excess energy supplied is used for excessive heating and possible vaporization of solution similar trends were also observed in our earlier work related to the degradation of sdbs for variation in the power from 140 to 350 w the extent of sdbs degradation increased with the actual values as 19 3 50 87 4 and 93 1 for microwave power of 140 210 280 and 350 w respectively 79 it is important to note that the observed changes are different depending on the contaminant in question as the optimum power may or may not be observed thus it is important to perform a detailed investigation into the effect of power dissipation 3 2 ultrasound assisted degradation of sds 3 2 1 using only ultrasound the ultrasound trials for degradation of sds were performed using conditions of 80 mg l as the initial concentration 250 ml as the solution volume for a treatment time of 120 min at varying powers of 100 150 and 200 w for all investigated power range no degradation was observed which indicates that only ultrasound energy is not sufficient enough to induce any degradation of surfactant it is important to note that actual energy transferred into the solution is quite low based on the lower transfer efficiency for ultrasonic horn 112 which coupled with low frequency operation gives lesser intensity of cavitation and the number of hydroxyl radicals generated may not be sufficient to cause any degradation 85 113 114 typical reaction which represents generation of hydroxyl radical by sonolysis is represented by eq 6 6 h 2 o o h h the number of hydroxyl radicals generated depends on applied frequency power and properties of solution 114 it is expected that physical effects dominates at low frequency 115 whereas chemical effects dominates at higher frequency 116 low frequency ultrasound facilitates development of larger bubble cavity and lower intensity cavitation events due to more water vapor present in larger bubble and cushioning effects less hydroxyl radicals are produced at lower frequency it is also reported that for operation between 200 400 khz frequency higher quantum of hydroxyl radicals are generated 116 117 overall no degradation with only low frequency us may be attributed to less hydroxyl radical generation due to less number of cavitation events cushioning action due to more water vapor content and dominance of conditions suitable for physical phenomenon in order to enhance the efficacy of the ultrasound based process the coupling of us based process with oxidants is necessary 118 and hence subsequently us was coupled with oxidants such as persulfate and hp it is also important to note that the observed results cannot be generalized for all anionic surfactants only us assisted degradation of sdbs using ultrasonic bath is indeed reported in literature 8 the varying results are attributed to differences in power and concentration of surfactants used very less sdbs concentration between 0 2 to 2 mg l was used by dehghani et al 8 and power used was much higher in the range of 400 500 w since using higher power was not feasible in the current work oxidant coupling with us based process was attempted at 150 w as power dissipation which was best as per recommendations of the supplier using still higher power over continuous durations might lead to problems to the equipment and hence not applied 3 2 2 ultrasound assisted kps induced degradation the efficacy of using persulfate having oxidation potential 2 01 v 111 as an intensification approach in the presence of ultrasound was also investigated ultrasound alone may initiate the activation of persulfate and the extent of sulfate radicals generated depend on the sonochemical reactor configuration ultrasound frequency power and temperature 85 119 the representative activation reaction is depicted by the eq 7 mentioned below 7 s 2 o 8 2 2 s o 4 the degradation experiments were carried out at fixed ultrasonic power of 150 w applied to sds solution at 250 ml solution volume initial concentration of 80 mg l natural ph condition temperature of 323 k and treatment time of 120 min the kps loading was varied between 0 8 to 2 g l equivalent rox value from 10 6 to 26 6 it was observed that with an increase in loading from 0 8 to 2 g l equivalent rox from 10 6 to 26 6 the degradation increased from 53 1 to 95 4 as per the results shown in fig 7 similar trends are also reported in the literature 96 103 for the effect of presence of kps as well as kps loading using different modes of activation patil and shukla 103 investigated microwave activated persulfate based degradation of reactive yellow 145 over the loading range of 0 7 to 4 4 mm and reported an increase in degradation from 43 6 to 93 2 for an increase in loading up to 3 7 mm however for further increase in kps loading to 4 4 mm the extent of degradation decreased to 80 9 which was attributed to scavenging of s o 4 by additional s 2 o 8 present in solution and not utilized for sulphate radical formation in another study dealing with sonochemical degradation of tetracycline alone and in combination with oxidants reported by soltani et al 120 revealed that use of ultrasound in addition to pms and marite nanoparticle enhanced the degradation only ultrasound or only pms was not found to be effective because of less generation of hydroxyl radicals the degradation rate in absence of ultrasound was found to be 0 048 min 1 whereas application of 37 khz ultrasound at supplied power of 320 w enhanced rate to 0 0770 min 1 120 confirming the necessity of presence of activation agent as well as oxidant similar trends for degradation of amoxicillin by persulfate activation by uv 254 and ultrasound were reported by sepyani et al 64 in a typical experiment at optimized condition 10 degradation of amoxicillin was reported by only ultrasound however ultrasound coupling with persulfate enhanced degradation to 61 2 again confirming better results for combination overall it can be said that typically with increased loading availability of oxidizing radicals increases and subsequently extent of degradation increases it is again worthwhile to comment that though the trends are similar the extent of increase and existence of optimum is dependent on the specific system in question in general it is also established that combination of ultrasound and kps is generally beneficial compared to the individual applications 3 2 3 effect of dual oxidant system as kps and hydrogen peroxide on ultrasound assisted degradation to evaluate efficacy of dual oxidant based degradation 121 experiments were performed using various combinations of kps and hydrogen peroxide in the presence of ultrasound as maximum degradation of 95 4 was obtained for kps loading of 2 g l equivalent rox value of 26 6 trials using combined kps and hydrogen peroxide loading were carried out at fixed kps rox value of 26 6 the power temperature and treatment time were maintained as constant 150 w 323 k and 120 min respectively and the loading of hydrogen peroxide was varied from 0 320 g l to 0 800 g l equivalent rox value of 33 9 84 7 as per the results shown in fig 8 it can be seen that the extent of sds degradation enhanced from 65 3 to 92 7 with an increase in the hydrogen peroxide loading from 0 320 g l to 0 640 g l rox value from 33 9 to 67 7 respectively however the degradation decreased to 78 1 for a further increase in loading to 0 8g l rox to 84 7 from the obtained results it can be said that no synergy in enhancement in degradation was observed for the dual oxidant system the obtained degradation for optimum hydrogen peroxide loading combined with kps was found to be less compared the approach of using only kps at loading of 2 g l rox of 26 6 from the experimental investigations it can be concluded kps is more dominant oxidant than hydrogen peroxide addition of hydrogen peroxide is contributing negatively to the oxidant system perhaps attributed to the dominant role of sulfate radicals in oxidation of sds due to the introduction of hydrogen peroxide ultrasonic energy is utilized for dissociation of hydrogen peroxide and hence the activation effects on kps are reduced which explains the lower degradation observed for the combination 3 2 4 controlled and uncontrolled degradation in the presence of kps acoustic cavitation can be carried out under controlled and uncontrolled conditions of the operating temperature the controlled trials were performed at supplied power of 150 w and constant temperature of 323 k with the heat supplied using constant temperature water bath in uncontrolled experimental trial no external heating was supplied and the temperature rise was attributed to the cavitation effect the maximum temperature reached during uncontrolled trial was 313 k kps loading of 2 g l rox as 26 6 was maintained constant in both the trials the ph of solution after addition of kps was measured as 7 44 95 4 sds degradation was obtained in controlled experiments whereas for the same loading in uncontrolled trials sds degradation reduced to only 45 5 the observed results are represented in fig 9 it was also observed that no degradation was obtained for trials with only ultrasound without oxidant at same supplied power as 150 w the obtained results clearly indicate that temperature and oxidant are major factors responsible for degradation of sds 3 3 comparison of microwave and ultrasound for activation of oxidants efficacy of microwave and ultrasound irradiation for the activation of kps and h2o2 in the combined approach was compared in the present work which is an important consideration as no such study has been reported earlier to the best of our knowledge microwave irradiation results in molecular level intense heating whereas local hotspots are generated due to ultrasound based cavitation microwave directly penetrates in the bulk couples with polar molecules and hence quick and uniform heating of solution is observed with only microwave and ultrasound no degradation was obtained the irradiation of solution with ultrasound and microwave may generate hydroxyl radical which may subsequently attack contaminant molecules however the obtained results indicates that both ultrasound and microwave irradiations alone were not effective in producing sufficient hydroxyl radical and due to this no degradation was obtained table 1 represents the comparative performance of irradiation activation source in terms of the obtained extent of degradation for combination the obtained results indicated that microwave assisted degradation is effective compared to ultrasound assisted degradation for the case of microwave irradiation 96 8 degradation of sds was obtained in 18 min with optimum operative conditions as microwave power of 140 w and kps loading of 0 480 g l rox value as 6 4 the microwave power used for calculation for comparing efficacy was selected such that it is near ultrasound power even though the optimum conditions corresponding to highest rate and extent of degradation are different 210 w as the power for ultrasound assisted degradation with 150 w power dissipation and kps loading of 2 g l rox value as 26 6 95 4 degradation was obtained in 120 min even though the optimum conditions are different under comparable power dissipation microwave assisted degradation is definitely found to be more effective than ultrasound based approach the observed results are attributed to dominant role of temperature and microwave non thermal effects in quick activation of persulfate and subsequent degradation of sds the comparison of energy requirements in both microwave and ultrasound based approach was evaluated at optimum conditions the energy comparison was made by using the parameter electrical energy per order e e o expressed in kwh m3 the parameter signifies the amount of energy required in kwh for 90 degradation of 1 m3 of contaminant solution 122 the detailed calculations are depicted in annexure i e e o estimated for the microwave assisted approach was 154 kwh m3 whereas that for ultrasound assisted degradation was 980 kwh m3 thus from the estimation it is established that the cost of ultrasound assisted degradation would be about 6 times greater than the cost for the microwave based approach 4 conclusions the experimental investigations presented in the work provided important understanding about microwave as well as ultrasound assisted degradation of sodium dodecyl sulfate potential of sulfate vis à vis hydroxyl based oxidants alone or in combination understanding into the effect of different operating conditions activation mechanism and oxidant on the extent of degradation was evaluated it was clearly established that only microwave or only ultrasound alone can t degrade sds effectively and coupling with oxidant like kps and hydrogen peroxide results in significant intensification in the degradation therefore use of irradiation sources along with oxidants is necessary for enhancing the effectiveness the microwave degradation yielded complete sds degradation in 12 min with dual oxidants whereas in the case of ultrasound induced degradation in the presence of kps at 2 g l loading rox value as 26 6 maximum degradation of sds was 95 4 in 120 min the efficacy of kps as an oxidant was found better than hydrogen peroxide the use of dual oxidant enhanced the rate and extent of degradation only in the case of microwave based process in the case of microwave degradation was beneficiated by the use of higher power till an optimum 210 w above which the additional supplied energy was used for boiling rather than activation induced degradation in the case of us based oxidation of sds using dual oxidant as kps and hp was found less effective in sds degradation compared to the use of only kps the parameter indicative of energy requirement as energy per order eeo revealed that at comparative power ultrasound required six times greater energy than that required for microwave based approach with kps as an oxidant the present work has clearly established the efficacy of microwave based irradiation combined with oxidants in removing the sds successfully though to think about commercial applications the future work is being directed to determine the extent of mineralization as well as evaluation of the intermediates and the effects on biotoxicity declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments psb would like to

14002,this study evaluated the sustainability of biological mine drainage md treatment using industrial by products crude glycerol cg from biodiesel production and trub a brewery waste were used as electron donors for the biological reduction of sulfate batch assays were prepared using anaerobic inoculum from a domestic sewage treatment plant and mine drainage from a gold mining company the md showed high concentrations of pollutants in mg l 1 3 860 5 sulfate 1 39 arsenic 14 77 cadmium 1 78 lead 3 85 antimony and 209 03 zin under a chemical oxygen demand so4 2 ratio of 3 2 sulfate removal was similar among tested substrates and positive controls of pure glycerol pg and ethanol between 89 5 and 92 2 of sulfate removed the removal of pb using crude glycerol was 88 3 while that for the other metals was above 99 on the other hand the removal of all metals was over 99 using trub the substrates cg and trub were good carbon sources as compared to the positive controls it is thus believed that industrial by products are as effective as positive controls in making the md treatment more sustainable by eliminating organic substrate acquisition costs and the consumption of products requiring treatment before environment discharge to obtain 1 g of cod with trub 538 ml of product is consumed at no cost to obtain the same cod value with cg pg and ethanol is necessary to invest us 0 0053 0 1184 and 14 4 respectively keywords rock drainage bioremediation biodiesel waste brewery waste sulfate reduction 1 introduction the most significant form of sulfur pollution in terms of volume is sulfate rich water from mining waste mine drainage md has high concentrations of sulfates and potentially toxic elements such as as pb al cd zn cu and cr 1 the biological treatment of md in anaerobic reactors involving sulfate reducing bacteria srb consists of anaerobic sulfate reduction so4 2 due to electron consumption from an organic substrate 2 sulfide h2s g produced in sulfate reduction precipitates cations into metal sulfides 3 md biological treatment requires research to improve the efficiency and economic and environmental feasibility of the system the application of such research requires that laboratory systems approach industrial scale conditions an atmosphere with low oxygen concentrations should be maintained similar to a industrial scale anaerobic treatment where low oxygen levels μg o2 l 1 are expected 4 this approach may increase the chances of successful industrial scale system reproduction these conditions were applied in the present research to reduce the financial and environmental costs of the consumer goods production chain the use of organic substrates from industrial waste is an important research issue the use of ethanol and pure glycerol pg as carbon sources is technically feasible 5 6 but limited by cost 7 the microbial diversity and its intrinsic ability to metabolize wide ranging organic substrates present a possibility to use organic waste for the treatment of sulfate rich waters the use of organic waste for electron donation is now considered feasible for the simultaneous treatment with md providing even higher rates of sulfate and metal removal 8 compared to conventional organic waste treatment the use of md can reduce sludge production and greenhouse gas generation while providing an aeration free electron receiver 9 the use of organic waste can even provide macro and micro nutrient inputs to the md treatment system 10 among the various sources of carbon that can provide greater process sustainability crude glycerol cg a by product of biodiesel production is a potential source biodiesel production has been increasing and the volume of cg is approximately 10 20 of that of manufactured biodiesel 11 glycerol is also produced during the manufacture of soap bioethanol and other cleaning products although there are over 2000 applications of glycerol there has been no destination defined by the producing plants with greater availability than applications crude glycerol is considered a waste glycerol can cause serious environmental impacts if disposed of without proper treatment 12 after the slower start up acclimatization period sulfidogenesis with cg is similar to that obtained with pure glycerol 13 despite this potential cg has not yet been applied in md biological treatment with a high sulfate concentration and metal loading cg has been used as a carbon source albeit in wastewater with a low sulfate concentration 220 mg l 1 14 as well as in oil wells 13 despite the research is correlated with md behrooz and bord 15 applied cg to solid mine tailings in the research of zamzow et al 16 the accounted cod disregarded the organic impurities presented in the cg without setting affluent cod values the knowledge gap about the use of this type of substrate in md treatment remains in addition to glycerol brewery by products are also a source of concern owing to the expanding industry branch for each unit of brewed beer 3 20 units of wastewater are produced presenting high cod ranging from 2 000 6 000 mg l 1 trub from the boiling and fermentation tanks accounts for only 3 of this volume however it represents 97 of the organic load 126 366 15 381 mg cod l 1 17 demonstrating a substantial proportion of the waste treatment cost of the brewing process this substrate may have applicability as a carbon source for sulfate reduction since the srb may symbiotically work with methanogenic species in the oxidation of molecules available in the trub in this study trub and cg were evaluated for the first time as a carbon source applied to the biological treatment of md with high sulfate content under consideration of real md conditions substrates were compared for their efficiency as electron donors in sulfate biological reduction with pure glycerol and ethanol as positive controls the materials used as positive controls are limited by production and purification costs in addition to its demand for environmental resources the sugar energy industry has 21 wastes and by products that may cause water soil and air pollution for every three tons of sugarcane produced one ton of bagasse is generated 18 glycerol purification has significant operating costs using temperature controlled high vacuum distillation active carbon treatment or ion exchange 19 the main purpose of this paper was to address whether cg and trub are economically environmentally and technically viable options in treating md containing high sulfate content real md and

discussion 3 1 first phase 3 1 1 sulfur removal after two months of using the cod so4 2 ratio of 2 the values of sulfate concentrations at the beginning and end of the last batch were considered for calculating the removal efficiency as shown in the first line of table 4 then after two additional months under the cod so4 2 ratio of 3 the sulfate concentration values obtained in the last batch were used to obtain the removal values as presented in the second line of table 2 to obtain the values presented for the tested substrates and positive controls the removal value in the negative control vial was subtracted this was performed so that sulfate removal by inoculum adsorption or endogenous reduction could be disregarded only sulfate reduction using the electron donor was investigated in the first phase the inoculum that was previously applied in a methanogenic system with domestic sewage was adapted to the presence of sulfate and the substrates used the improvement in the removal of sulfate in the second condition was more clearly attributed to the selection of species capable of metabolizing the available substrates than to the cod so4 2 ratio variation note that even with the substrate concentration increase the final ph was higher in the second condition this may be owing to more effective consumption of intermediate metabolites and therefore less accumulation of volatile fatty acids vfa although the employed by products had recalcitrant or toxic molecules that could make sulfidogenesis difficult the results showed that a microbial consortium in the long term could overcome this challenge the variety of carbon sources may have compensated the disadvantage caused by toxic and recalcitrant molecules srb can metabolize a wide range of electron donors such as hydrogen carboxylic acids alcohols sugars aromatic compounds carbon monoxide methane 22 and amino acids 23 in environments with various organic substrates decomposition of long chain carbohydrates and other high molecular weight molecules promoted by species among hydrolytic acidogenic acetogenic and acetoclastic methanogenic processes favors srb presence 24 fermentation bacteria can form products from glycerol degradation such as hydrogen and methanoate which are key components in synergistic degradation and excellent electron donors for srb such as members from desulfomicrobium genus 25 the carbon acclimated inoculum can for example use metabolic intermediates of glycerol degradation more completely than it does with the acetate produced by ethanol oxidation 16 mixed carbon sources may favor treatment with anaerobic microbial consortia 26 inoculum from domestic sewage treatment presented great microbial diversity which may have favored adaptation to the complex substrate inoculum of the same origin used in this study was already successfully applied in complex effluent treatments including textile effluent containing the azo dye reactive blue hfrl 27 the results obtained after four months of adaptation were subjected to statistical tests statistically there was no difference between the tested substrates and the control electron donors the similarity was verified by the analysis of variance test anova presenting a maximum f value of 0 4988 the maximum f value for degrees of freedom mqf 3 and mqe 8 was 5 42 sulfate removal values were submitted to the tukey test with 95 confidence the result confirmed that the sulfate removal efficiency was the same as the tested substrates and the positive controls whereas they significantly differed from the negative control the tukey test is presented in fig 1 although there was no difference in efficiency among the electron donors to sulfidogenesis the use of industrial by products becomes more sustainable compared to pure substrates when considering their economic and environmental costs based on the cod values obtained in this study and product costs 11 28 the costs for each substrate were calculated the cost of 100 g of cod for ethanol and pg are us 14 4 and 0 1184 respectively while the cost of the same amount of cod is us 0 0053 from the cg to obtain 100 g of cod 538 ml of trub is consumed which does not have a marked value in addition it is important to note that under the conditions evaluated in this study the microaerobic environment did not prevent sulfate reduction as obtained in other non strictly anaerobic sulfidogenic systems mora et al 2018 realizing the effective functioning of the system without complete anaerobiosis is important for the feasibility of an industrial scale system application wherein complete anaerobiosis is extremely difficult despite being a strictly anaerobic group the srb can be found active under temporary aerobic conditions srb can employ mechanisms such as displacement of organisms to anoxic regions creation of anoxic microenvironments through granulation and creation of enzymatic systems that reduce and eliminate o2 the presence of o2 has been shown to slow sulfidogenesis nevertheless sulfidogenic species was generally favored over methanogenics and acetogenicsesis mora lafuente 2018 the behavior of the biological system is best observed considering the fate of the carbon source as described in the following item 3 1 2 cod removal a favorable condition for the microbial consortium was promoted by using a cod so4 2 ratio higher than the stoichiometric ratio of 0 67 for sulfate reduction however for all substrates other organic matter oxidation metabolic pathways besides sulfidogenesis also occurred the amount of total consumed cod and the portion directed to sulfidogenesis in the last batch of four months of adaptation are presented in fig 2 previous studies had proven that glycerol and trub are good carbon sources for methanogenesis 12 29 31 the waste can serve as an anaerobic consortium substrate because it is derived from cooking processes which favor a crystallinity decrease surface area increase and sugar release which correspond to 57 4 of total solids 31 thus part of these substrates may have followed to the methanogenesis justifying their lower proportion to sulfidogenesis in relation to ethanol although both substrates can also feed competing microorganisms of the species that promote treatment the results showed that this fact did not preclude sulfate removal moreover after srb enrichment the higher was the electron donor excess the more efficient was the sulfate removal in addition cg and trub byproducts provided greater cod targeting to sulfidogenesis as compared to pure glycerol this indicates that under a longer adaptation period the tested substrates promoted greater enrichment of the species of interest than the pure substrate used as a positive control as presented in fig 2 the substrates that provided the highest cod removal rate had the lowest percentages of electrons directed to sulfidogenesis this fact suggests a relationship between the available electron targeting according to srb competition with non sulfidogenic species although non sulfidogenic species are fortified with pure glycerol and trub electron excess ensures that sulfate reduction is also promoted with these electron donors as with ethanol the preferred substrate in this case the presence of toxic elements in crude glycerol may have affected non sulfidogenic species providing lower cod consumption while less cod was consumed with cg in relation to pure glycerol and trub a higher cod proportion was directed to sulfate reduction thereby enabling satisfactory sulfate removal in a system with a lower initial sulfate concentration 220 mg l 1 mora et al 32 obtained a higher amount of cod for sulfidogenesis with cg compared to acetate cheese whey swine manure and vinasse while srb can metabolize inhibitory substances such as alkanes aromatic compounds organochlorines and long chain fatty acids methanogenic species are sensitive to them 33 in addition to organic inhibitors cg can have sodium ions between 0 36and 19 g l 1 and potassium between 0 08and 92 g l 1 13 this may explain the cod removal efficiency when cg was employed as competitors methanogens are more fragile than srb to the inhibitor compounds and were impaired in the system therefore it can be inferred that impurities present in crude glycerol may have indirectly favored sulfate reduction the lowest sulfidogenesis directed cod presented by trub in relation to ethanol and cg may have been caused by the most recalcitrant lignocellulosic solid fraction the trub evaluated by perimenis et al 31 presented cellulose hemicellulose and lignin as 8 2 5 6 and 8 0 as a percentage of total solids respectively this substrate was slow to become available to srb within the microbial pool or even to be precipitated by mixing with inoculum nevertheless the impure characteristic of trub may have been the cause of the lower methanogenic action in relation to pure glycerol with respect to ph the higher was the proportion of cod directed to sulfidogenesis the higher was the effluent ph obtained sulfidogenesis with complete oxidation must have been favored in systems that presented higher sulfate removal where with lower accumulation of metabolic intermediates also had a higher effluent ph microbial diversity likely changed and led to the development of more fermentative bacteria capable of hydrolyzing crude glycerol faster overall the reduction of sulfate having crude glycerol as the carbon source may have been more efficient than using pure glycerol or ethanol the effluent acidity of each substrate did not align with the amount of residual cod in which the largest residual cod was with the crude glycerol moreover the latter did not have the lowest effluent ph the final ph is defined not only by the amount of organic matter but also by the organic matter composition the result of each metabolic pathway by which substrates are consumed and the formation consumption and accumulation of metabolic intermediates non sulfidogenic pathways can lead to an accumulation of vfa such as acetic butyric and caproic acids from trub oxidation perimenis et al 2018 incomplete oxidation of glycerol can also lead to an increase in acetate lactate and 1 3 propanediol 34 propionate qatibi et al 1991 or butyrate 7 the decline of ph and a residual cod indicate that there may have been an accumulation of vfa in this study as well some vfa such as capric acid and acetate have high economic values on account of their possible refined applications in the food pharmaceutical and polymer industries or their functions as precursors to fuels and chemicals perimenis et al 2018 35 therefore residual cod can be directed to industrial applications instead of being treated as a pollutant 3 1 3 metal and metalloid removal sulfide h2s g produced in sulfate reduction has a chemical affinity with some metal cations it precipitates them into metal sulfides that have low solubility over a wide ph range 3 high removal efficiencies of metals were observed with the tested substrates the results are presented in table 3 in accounting for statistical errors the metal removal could be considered similar among treatments with each substrate since metal removal occurred by a reaction with the sulfidogenesis product and the sulfate reduction rates under both conditions were similar it holds that the metal removal rates were also similar under the conditions employed in this study the cod removal excess obtained in relation to that required for sulfate reduction indicated that other oxidation pathways may have occurred the removal of metals may have occurred through bioprecipitation for example by reducing asv to asiii with precipitation of the latter through a reaction with sulfide the mechanism occurred through the action of dissimilatory arsenate as reducing bacteria darb the bioprecipitation of as by darb action has already been described by rodriguez freire et al 36 3 2 second phase cod so4 2 ratio after consistent sulfidogenesis was achieved thereby confirming inoculum adaptation to the study system the test phase of the best cod so4 2 ratio was applied in this phase sulfate removal was gradually higher in accordance with the higher cod so4 2 applied ratio under a ratio of 5 the treatment complied with brazilian requirements for sulfate concentration 250 mg l 1 while considering the treated wastewater discharge in a class 2 water body conama 230 2011 the final sulfate concentration with crude glycerol and trub was 246 12 7 70 and 113 21 3 24 respectively the effluent ph gradually decreased as a higher cod so4 2 ratio was applied the residual cod of the effluents from the reactors with a cod so4 2 ratio of 5 with trub and crude glycerol was 4 7 0 02 g l 1 and 4 9 0 05 g l 1 respectively vfa accumulation was likely the cause of the lower ph in these effluents the removal rates and the effluent ph are presented in table 4 after 120 h the sulfate concentration stabilized with up to 87 5 removal in the cod so4 2 ratios of 1 and 2 5 with both substrates through the ratio of cod so4 2 5 in 120 h the removal rates were 87 8 and 87 9 with trub and cg respectively and they continued to increase until reaching the values detailed in table 4 in 168 h the results support the conclusion that starting from the lowest cod so4 2 ratios the concentration of molecules that could be oxidized by srb may have been no longer sufficient after 120 h although there was residual cod under cod so4 2 of 2 5 of 3076 24 1 and 3709 64 06 mg l 1 with trub and cg respectively the residual organic molecules did not appear to be directed to sulfidogenesis the residual cod under the cod so4 2 ratio of 5 was 4820 5 20 03 and 4992 7 56 3 mg l 1 with trub and cg respectively the results are consistent with those of papirio et al 37 who evaluated the same range of cod so4 2 ratios those authors obtained 68 and 88 sulfate removal under cod so4 2 ratios of 1 and 5 respectively by employing synthetic effluent containing 1500 mg so4 2 l 1 and using lactate as an electron donor although high cod so4 2 ratios applied to reactors with methanogenic inoculum may lead to srb suppression the results showed that when this group is already enriched ratios above the stoichiometric ratio for sulfidogenesis may favor sulfidogenesis the present research confirmed the position of hao et al 22 who studied the treatment of sulfate rich waters and determined that cod so4 2 between 2 4 and 4 8 favors sulfidogenesis after the removal of sulfate and metals the effluent produced presents metabolic intermediate acids from anaerobic digestion value added molecules such as acetate and caproic acid can be found in this effluent the organic acids producedcan also be applied for methane production after ph adjustment similarly to what was promoted with the substrates trub and glycerol by oliveira et al 38 mora et al 32 and perimenis et al 31 this polishing strategy is advantageous in relation to the application of these substrates directly to methanogenesis because the md replaces the demand for clean water to dilute industrial by products the results obtained in this work suggest the applicability of industrial by products trub and cg in treating md in an environmentally and economically suitable technique 4 recommendations although the optimal cod so4 2 ratio for sulfidogenesis was the highest one the treated effluent presented a high residual organic concentration the effluent may cease being considered an organic pollutant as long as it is confirmed to comprise acids of industrial interest as noted in the references cited in the discussion moreover the effluent may potentially generate biogas the effluent generated in the experiment is similar to those used in biogas generation research using trub however for the procedure described by perimenis et al 31 the trub was diluted in clean water while the effluent of the present research would not involve the use of clean water and the pollutants from the added md are no longer at levels that impair methanogenesis further research is recommended for effluent use by exploring the possibility of recovering economically important substances thereby further improving the sustainability of md treatment 5 conclusions both cg and trub tested substrates can be efficiently used as electron donors in md biological treatment statistical analysis reveals that no significant difference exists between sulfate removal in the tested substrates and that of pure glycerol and ethanol positive controls after the treatment the effluent had a low concentration of highly hazardous pollutants such as metals metalloids and sulfates previously present in md sulfate removal from pollutant rich waters 3860 mg l 1 was greater than 89 with ethanol pure glycerol trub and cg the removal of as pb sb zn and cd was also satisfactory with both trub and cg tested substrates both being greater than 88 despite the similar efficiency there was greater sustainability of their use compared to substrates used as a positive control ethanol and pure glycerol incur production and purification costs in terms of financial and natural resources the use of cg is 2700 times cheaper than the use of ethanol and 22 times cheaper than the use of pg the trub has no acquisition cost furthermore the ability to replicate the system in industrial scale is more notably guaranteed since the obtained results were obtained from a micro aerobic system with real wastewater and were closer to industrial scale conditions the treated effluent can be directed to polishing strategies that take advantage of the potential for generating methane and or recovering organic molecules of interest for methanogenesis from the low ph effluent an inoculum that is adapted to these conditions or addition of substances to raise the ph can be

14002,this study evaluated the sustainability of biological mine drainage md treatment using industrial by products crude glycerol cg from biodiesel production and trub a brewery waste were used as electron donors for the biological reduction of sulfate batch assays were prepared using anaerobic inoculum from a domestic sewage treatment plant and mine drainage from a gold mining company the md showed high concentrations of pollutants in mg l 1 3 860 5 sulfate 1 39 arsenic 14 77 cadmium 1 78 lead 3 85 antimony and 209 03 zin under a chemical oxygen demand so4 2 ratio of 3 2 sulfate removal was similar among tested substrates and positive controls of pure glycerol pg and ethanol between 89 5 and 92 2 of sulfate removed the removal of pb using crude glycerol was 88 3 while that for the other metals was above 99 on the other hand the removal of all metals was over 99 using trub the substrates cg and trub were good carbon sources as compared to the positive controls it is thus believed that industrial by products are as effective as positive controls in making the md treatment more sustainable by eliminating organic substrate acquisition costs and the consumption of products requiring treatment before environment discharge to obtain 1 g of cod with trub 538 ml of product is consumed at no cost to obtain the same cod value with cg pg and ethanol is necessary to invest us 0 0053 0 1184 and 14 4 respectively keywords rock drainage bioremediation biodiesel waste brewery waste sulfate reduction 1 introduction the most significant form of sulfur pollution in terms of volume is sulfate rich water from mining waste mine drainage md has high concentrations of sulfates and potentially toxic elements such as as pb al cd zn cu and cr 1 the biological treatment of md in anaerobic reactors involving sulfate reducing bacteria srb consists of anaerobic sulfate reduction so4 2 due to electron consumption from an organic substrate 2 sulfide h2s g produced in sulfate reduction precipitates cations into metal sulfides 3 md biological treatment requires research to improve the efficiency and economic and environmental feasibility of the system the application of such research requires that laboratory systems approach industrial scale conditions an atmosphere with low oxygen concentrations should be maintained similar to a industrial scale anaerobic treatment where low oxygen levels μg o2 l 1 are expected 4 this approach may increase the chances of successful industrial scale system reproduction these conditions were applied in the present research to reduce the financial and environmental costs of the consumer goods production chain the use of organic substrates from industrial waste is an important research issue the use of ethanol and pure glycerol pg as carbon sources is technically feasible 5 6 but limited by cost 7 the microbial diversity and its intrinsic ability to metabolize wide ranging organic substrates present a possibility to use organic waste for the treatment of sulfate rich waters the use of organic waste for electron donation is now considered feasible for the simultaneous treatment with md providing even higher rates of sulfate and metal removal 8 compared to conventional organic waste treatment the use of md can reduce sludge production and greenhouse gas generation while providing an aeration free electron receiver 9 the use of organic waste can even provide macro and micro nutrient inputs to the md treatment system 10 among the various sources of carbon that can provide greater process sustainability crude glycerol cg a by product of biodiesel production is a potential source biodiesel production has been increasing and the volume of cg is approximately 10 20 of that of manufactured biodiesel 11 glycerol is also produced during the manufacture of soap bioethanol and other cleaning products although there are over 2000 applications of glycerol there has been no destination defined by the producing plants with greater availability than applications crude glycerol is considered a waste glycerol can cause serious environmental impacts if disposed of without proper treatment 12 after the slower start up acclimatization period sulfidogenesis with cg is similar to that obtained with pure glycerol 13 despite this potential cg has not yet been applied in md biological treatment with a high sulfate concentration and metal loading cg has been used as a carbon source albeit in wastewater with a low sulfate concentration 220 mg l 1 14 as well as in oil wells 13 despite the research is correlated with md behrooz and bord 15 applied cg to solid mine tailings in the research of zamzow et al 16 the accounted cod disregarded the organic impurities presented in the cg without setting affluent cod values the knowledge gap about the use of this type of substrate in md treatment remains in addition to glycerol brewery by products are also a source of concern owing to the expanding industry branch for each unit of brewed beer 3 20 units of wastewater are produced presenting high cod ranging from 2 000 6 000 mg l 1 trub from the boiling and fermentation tanks accounts for only 3 of this volume however it represents 97 of the organic load 126 366 15 381 mg cod l 1 17 demonstrating a substantial proportion of the waste treatment cost of the brewing process this substrate may have applicability as a carbon source for sulfate reduction since the srb may symbiotically work with methanogenic species in the oxidation of molecules available in the trub in this study trub and cg were evaluated for the first time as a carbon source applied to the biological treatment of md with high sulfate content under consideration of real md conditions substrates were compared for their efficiency as electron donors in sulfate biological reduction with pure glycerol and ethanol as positive controls the materials used as positive controls are limited by production and purification costs in addition to its demand for environmental resources the sugar energy industry has 21 wastes and by products that may cause water soil and air pollution for every three tons of sugarcane produced one ton of bagasse is generated 18 glycerol purification has significant operating costs using temperature controlled high vacuum distillation active carbon treatment or ion exchange 19 the main purpose of this paper was to address whether cg and trub are economically environmentally and technically viable options in treating md containing high sulfate content real md and a micro aerobic atmosphere were used to enable the experimental system to approximate industrial scale conditions 2 material and methods 2 1 procedure in this study trub and cg were separately used as

reduction as obtained in other non strictly anaerobic sulfidogenic systems mora et al 2018 realizing the effective functioning of the system without complete anaerobiosis is important for the feasibility of an industrial scale system application wherein complete anaerobiosis is extremely difficult despite being a strictly anaerobic group the srb can be found active under temporary aerobic conditions srb can employ mechanisms such as displacement of organisms to anoxic regions creation of anoxic microenvironments through granulation and creation of enzymatic systems that reduce and eliminate o2 the presence of o2 has been shown to slow sulfidogenesis nevertheless sulfidogenic species was generally favored over methanogenics and acetogenicsesis mora lafuente 2018 the behavior of the biological system is best observed considering the fate of the carbon source as described in the following item 3 1 2 cod removal a favorable condition for the microbial consortium was promoted by using a cod so4 2 ratio higher than the stoichiometric ratio of 0 67 for sulfate reduction however for all substrates other organic matter oxidation metabolic pathways besides sulfidogenesis also occurred the amount of total consumed cod and the portion directed to sulfidogenesis in the last batch of four months of adaptation are presented in fig 2 previous studies had proven that glycerol and trub are good carbon sources for methanogenesis 12 29 31 the waste can serve as an anaerobic consortium substrate because it is derived from cooking processes which favor a crystallinity decrease surface area increase and sugar release which correspond to 57 4 of total solids 31 thus part of these substrates may have followed to the methanogenesis justifying their lower proportion to sulfidogenesis in relation to ethanol although both substrates can also feed competing microorganisms of the species that promote treatment the results showed that this fact did not preclude sulfate removal moreover after srb enrichment the higher was the electron donor excess the more efficient was the sulfate removal in addition cg and trub byproducts provided greater cod targeting to sulfidogenesis as compared to pure glycerol this indicates that under a longer adaptation period the tested substrates promoted greater enrichment of the species of interest than the pure substrate used as a positive control as presented in fig 2 the substrates that provided the highest cod removal rate had the lowest percentages of electrons directed to sulfidogenesis this fact suggests a relationship between the available electron targeting according to srb competition with non sulfidogenic species although non sulfidogenic species are fortified with pure glycerol and trub electron excess ensures that sulfate reduction is also promoted with these electron donors as with ethanol the preferred substrate in this case the presence of toxic elements in crude glycerol may have affected non sulfidogenic species providing lower cod consumption while less cod was consumed with cg in relation to pure glycerol and trub a higher cod proportion was directed to sulfate reduction thereby enabling satisfactory sulfate removal in a system with a lower initial sulfate concentration 220 mg l 1 mora et al 32 obtained a higher amount of cod for sulfidogenesis with cg compared to acetate cheese whey swine manure and vinasse while srb can metabolize inhibitory substances such as alkanes aromatic compounds organochlorines and long chain fatty acids methanogenic species are sensitive to them 33 in addition to organic inhibitors cg can have sodium ions between 0 36and 19 g l 1 and potassium between 0 08and 92 g l 1 13 this may explain the cod removal efficiency when cg was employed as competitors methanogens are more fragile than srb to the inhibitor compounds and were impaired in the system therefore it can be inferred that impurities present in crude glycerol may have indirectly favored sulfate reduction the lowest sulfidogenesis directed cod presented by trub in relation to ethanol and cg may have been caused by the most recalcitrant lignocellulosic solid fraction the trub evaluated by perimenis et al 31 presented cellulose hemicellulose and lignin as 8 2 5 6 and 8 0 as a percentage of total solids respectively this substrate was slow to become available to srb within the microbial pool or even to be precipitated by mixing with inoculum nevertheless the impure characteristic of trub may have been the cause of the lower methanogenic action in relation to pure glycerol with respect to ph the higher was the proportion of cod directed to sulfidogenesis the higher was the effluent ph obtained sulfidogenesis with complete oxidation must have been favored in systems that presented higher sulfate removal where with lower accumulation of metabolic intermediates also had a higher effluent ph microbial diversity likely changed and led to the development of more fermentative bacteria capable of hydrolyzing crude glycerol faster overall the reduction of sulfate having crude glycerol as the carbon source may have been more efficient than using pure glycerol or ethanol the effluent acidity of each substrate did not align with the amount of residual cod in which the largest residual cod was with the crude glycerol moreover the latter did not have the lowest effluent ph the final ph is defined not only by the amount of organic matter but also by the organic matter composition the result of each metabolic pathway by which substrates are consumed and the formation consumption and accumulation of metabolic intermediates non sulfidogenic pathways can lead to an accumulation of vfa such as acetic butyric and caproic acids from trub oxidation perimenis et al 2018 incomplete oxidation of glycerol can also lead to an increase in acetate lactate and 1 3 propanediol 34 propionate qatibi et al 1991 or butyrate 7 the decline of ph and a residual cod indicate that there may have been an accumulation of vfa in this study as well some vfa such as capric acid and acetate have high economic values on account of their possible refined applications in the food pharmaceutical and polymer industries or their functions as precursors to fuels and chemicals perimenis et al 2018 35 therefore residual cod can be directed to industrial applications instead of being treated as a pollutant 3 1 3 metal and metalloid removal sulfide h2s g produced in sulfate reduction has a chemical affinity with some metal cations it precipitates them into metal sulfides that have low solubility over a wide ph range 3 high removal efficiencies of metals were observed with the tested substrates the results are presented in table 3 in accounting for statistical errors the metal removal could be considered similar among treatments with each substrate since metal removal occurred by a reaction with the sulfidogenesis product and the sulfate reduction rates under both conditions were similar it holds that the metal removal rates were also similar under the conditions employed in this study the cod removal excess obtained in relation to that required for sulfate reduction indicated that other oxidation pathways may have occurred the removal of metals may have occurred through bioprecipitation for example by reducing asv to asiii with precipitation of the latter through a reaction with sulfide the mechanism occurred through the action of dissimilatory arsenate as reducing bacteria darb the bioprecipitation of as by darb action has already been described by rodriguez freire et al 36 3 2 second phase cod so4 2 ratio after consistent sulfidogenesis was achieved thereby confirming inoculum adaptation to the study system the test phase of the best cod so4 2 ratio was applied in this phase sulfate removal was gradually higher in accordance with the higher cod so4 2 applied ratio under a ratio of 5 the treatment complied with brazilian requirements for sulfate concentration 250 mg l 1 while considering the treated wastewater discharge in a class 2 water body conama 230 2011 the final sulfate concentration with crude glycerol and trub was 246 12 7 70 and 113 21 3 24 respectively the effluent ph gradually decreased as a higher cod so4 2 ratio was applied the residual cod of the effluents from the reactors with a cod so4 2 ratio of 5 with trub and crude glycerol was 4 7 0 02 g l 1 and 4 9 0 05 g l 1 respectively vfa accumulation was likely the cause of the lower ph in these effluents the removal rates and the effluent ph are presented in table 4 after 120 h the sulfate concentration stabilized with up to 87 5 removal in the cod so4 2 ratios of 1 and 2 5 with both substrates through the ratio of cod so4 2 5 in 120 h the removal rates were 87 8 and 87 9 with trub and cg respectively and they continued to increase until reaching the values detailed in table 4 in 168 h the results support the conclusion that starting from the lowest cod so4 2 ratios the concentration of molecules that could be oxidized by srb may have been no longer sufficient after 120 h although there was residual cod under cod so4 2 of 2 5 of 3076 24 1 and 3709 64 06 mg l 1 with trub and cg respectively the residual organic molecules did not appear to be directed to sulfidogenesis the residual cod under the cod so4 2 ratio of 5 was 4820 5 20 03 and 4992 7 56 3 mg l 1 with trub and cg respectively the results are consistent with those of papirio et al 37 who evaluated the same range of cod so4 2 ratios those authors obtained 68 and 88 sulfate removal under cod so4 2 ratios of 1 and 5 respectively by employing synthetic effluent containing 1500 mg so4 2 l 1 and using lactate as an electron donor although high cod so4 2 ratios applied to reactors with methanogenic inoculum may lead to srb suppression the results showed that when this group is already enriched ratios above the stoichiometric ratio for sulfidogenesis may favor sulfidogenesis the present research confirmed the position of hao et al 22 who studied the treatment of sulfate rich waters and determined that cod so4 2 between 2 4 and 4 8 favors sulfidogenesis after the removal of sulfate and metals the effluent produced presents metabolic intermediate acids from anaerobic digestion value added molecules such as acetate and caproic acid can be found in this effluent the organic acids producedcan also be applied for methane production after ph adjustment similarly to what was promoted with the substrates trub and glycerol by oliveira et al 38 mora et al 32 and perimenis et al 31 this polishing strategy is advantageous in relation to the application of these substrates directly to methanogenesis because the md replaces the demand for clean water to dilute industrial by products the results obtained in this work suggest the applicability of industrial by products trub and cg in treating md in an environmentally and economically suitable technique 4 recommendations although the optimal cod so4 2 ratio for sulfidogenesis was the highest one the treated effluent presented a high residual organic concentration the effluent may cease being considered an organic pollutant as long as it is confirmed to comprise acids of industrial interest as noted in the references cited in the discussion moreover the effluent may potentially generate biogas the effluent generated in the experiment is similar to those used in biogas generation research using trub however for the procedure described by perimenis et al 31 the trub was diluted in clean water while the effluent of the present research would not involve the use of clean water and the pollutants from the added md are no longer at levels that impair methanogenesis further research is recommended for effluent use by exploring the possibility of recovering economically important substances thereby further improving the sustainability of md treatment 5 conclusions both cg and trub tested substrates can be efficiently used as electron donors in md biological treatment statistical analysis reveals that no significant difference exists between sulfate removal in the tested substrates and that of pure glycerol and ethanol positive controls after the treatment the effluent had a low concentration of highly hazardous pollutants such as metals metalloids and sulfates previously present in md sulfate removal from pollutant rich waters 3860 mg l 1 was greater than 89 with ethanol pure glycerol trub and cg the removal of as pb sb zn and cd was also satisfactory with both trub and cg tested substrates both being greater than 88 despite the similar efficiency there was greater sustainability of their use compared to substrates used as a positive control ethanol and pure glycerol incur production and purification costs in terms of financial and natural resources the use of cg is 2700 times cheaper than the use of ethanol and 22 times cheaper than the use of pg the trub has no acquisition cost furthermore the ability to replicate the system in industrial scale is more notably guaranteed since the obtained results were obtained from a micro aerobic system with real wastewater and were closer to industrial scale conditions the treated effluent can be directed to polishing strategies that take advantage of the potential for generating methane and or recovering organic molecules of interest for methanogenesis from the low ph effluent an inoculum that is adapted to these conditions or addition of substances to raise the ph can be

14003,in conventional hollow fiber reverse osmosis hf ro modules the lumen side has one end sealed in an epoxy resin and the other end opened 1way ro for permeate collection this study investigates the effect of having both ends open 2way ro in the hf modules the ro experiments were conducted using de ionized di water in two ends opened hf module the 2way ro experiments produced 10 more permeate flow rate than 1way ro at the same average shell side pressure this can be attributed to the building of pressure at the closed end lumen side which reached up to 1 7 bar at 1 09 l min permeate flow rate further the axial flow hf ro model was improvised to simulate the 2way ro operations the hagen poiseuille and ergun equations were also modified to predict the pressure drop with better accuracy reduction in the hf inner diameter and increase in the friction factor at the lumen wall were considered to modify the hagen poiseuille equation the models based on the above factors deviated by 2 and

water while the other end is embedded in an epoxy seal 1 various studies 2 5 on the hf module considered that the permeate flow in the lumen side is laminar and the pressure drop results from the skin friction at the wall surface as a result the pressure drop in the lumen side is generally estimated using the hagen poiseuille equation with the boundary condition that the pressure at the open end is atmospheric the backward addition of the pressure in the lumen side employed in the previous studies indicated that the lumen pressure was highest at the feed entrance of the axial flow hf ro module and this directly affects the net permeate flow rate 2 3 thus to minimize the effect of high pressure at the entrance of the hf module a second permeate outlet at the entrance could be considered the permeation in the hf ro modules occurs on the wall of the lumen throughout its length this permeation causes disturbances in the cross sectional area and wall roughness this increases the pressure drop as reported in various literature 6 7 in addition the hagen poiseuille model strictly applies to pipes with uniform cross section and roughness and this might result in an inaccurate prediction of the pressure drop in the lumen side similarly though the shell side pressure drop in the axial flow hf modules is due to the viscous and inertial forces flow channelling and non uniform velocities which are commonly observed during the experiment have a significant effect this limits the use of the ergun equation in its generic form for predicting the pressure drop in the shell side 8 9 thus in this study the ergun equation is modified to incorporate these effects in this work the effect of providing two lumen side permeate outlet on the total performance of the axial flow hf module is investigated the hf modules with single and double outlets are referred to as 1way ro and 2way ro respectively the study also discusses various models considered for estimating the permeate flow rate and pressure variation in the lumen and shell side of the axial flow hf module the developed models will be calibrated by 1way ro experiments followed by validation using 2way ro experimental data 2 material and methods the ro experiments were conducted in a toyobo axial hf module effective length 0 56 m and area 30 5 m2 with two ends opened as it provides a second opening in the lumen side required for the 2way ro studies the experimental setup is presented in fig 1 de ionized water from millipore water synthesis unit model no elix 3 milli q make m s millipore usa was used to conduct the ro experiments the feed solution fs was pumped using a 300 gpd heavy duty booster pump to the shell side of the module while the permeate was collected through the lumen side the fs flow rate and pressure were measured using pp helical flow meter and ascorp digital pressure gauge supplied by asma industrial corporation india the flow meter and pressure gauges were placed on both sides of the module to measure the inlet and outlet flow rates and hydraulic pressures as shown in fig 1 the feed pressure was regulated by a manually operated control valve once the pressure and flow rates at the inlet and exit of the module reached steady value the permeate flow rate was then measured by weighing balance the temperature of the fs was maintained at 25 c during all the experiments this procedure was carried out for both 1way and 2way ro systems further in order to avoid experimental error all the experiments were conducted three times and the average was taken in the 1way ro system one end of the lumen side was closed and the pressure at this end was measured in the 2way both the lumen side outlets were opened for permeate collection where the additional outlet is denoted by secondary outlet in fig 1 the experimental data from the 1way ro system was used for parameter estimation and these parameters were validated with the 2way ro experimental data 3 modeling of 1way and 2way ro system in this study the solution diffusion sd model was used to estimate the transport of the solvent through the hf membrane 2 5 the solvent flux can be calculated by eq 1 when de ionized di

condition in 1way ro a zero velocity position in the 2way ro module is assumed at a position where the permeate starts flowing the opposite direction to estimate this position a length lc has been introduced to denote the division of the permeate flow direction in the lumen side as depicted in fig 1 the boundary condition for the lumen pressure in the 1way ro model is also extended into the 2way ro model by considering the pressure at both the outlets to be atmospheric the governing transport equations were modified for the two portions based on flow direction as 1 for z 0 to lc 7 d v p

the respective ergun equation coefficients 150 and 1 75 8 9 the hagen poiseuille equation is used to calculate the lumen side pressure drop as far as the reynold number 2100 the applicability of the hagen poiseuille equation requires that the fluid flow should be laminar and the pressure loss mainly occurs due to the friction at the inner surface of the hf however the permeation from the lumen side affects the flow and pressure distribution along the length of the hf module to incorporate these effects in the hagen poiseuille two models are considered in this study based on the available literature these models are discussed below 3 1 effective hf inner diameter model due to the permeation of water into the lumen side the net available area for the water flow is constricted and results in local acceleration it is assumed that there is a formation of a permeate layer on the membrane surface which lowers the overall cross section area of the lumen this is included in the hagen poiseuille equation and lumen velocity calculation by replacing the inner diameter of the hf di fiber with the effective inner diameter di fiber eff 6 10 the di fiber eff is assumed to be constant along the length of the lumen and thus it reflects the average inner hf diameter of the lumen the di fiber eff and corresponding lumen pressure drop equation are shown in eq 11a and 11b 11a d i f i b

entering the lumen with friction factor considered in the hagen poiseuille equation the energy loss of the lumen permeate stream due to perpendicular inflow of fresh permeate is incorporated by including a wall perforation friction factor fp to the darcy friction factor fd 6 7 11 this modification results in 12 f f p f d f p 64 n r e 13 d p p d z f p ρ v p 2 2 d i f i b e r 32 μ v p d i f i

and modified ergun equation 2 wall perforation model the models were solved by applying the finite difference method by partitioning the module into n 1 segments resulting in n points in the axial direction the zero velocity point in 2way ro models defined by the nc was estimated using a simple search technique an initial lc and thus nc is assumed such that pp out 0 eq 14 and then lc is gradually increased till the following termination satisfied 14 p p o u t p p z l 32 μ l s d i f i b e r 2 v p z l 0 the flow chart for solving the 1way and 2way ro model is shown in fig 2 the parameters permeability and pressure equation constants were estimated by minimizing the squared error between the experimental results and model output the estimated parameters in the models were water permeability constants of lumen side pressure drop equation and constants of shell side pressure drop equation the water permeability depends on membrane material 12 13 and water temperature and thus needs to be tuned when the membrane of different materials or feed temperature is used for a given application but in this study the feed temperature is fixed at constant and single membrane is used for all the experiments therefore water permeability is expected to be constant for this experimental data similarly the pressure drop equation coefficient for lumen side might vary based on flow conditions i e laminar or turbulent in this study the flow through the lumen side was in laminar range with reynolds number 5 the pressure drop equation coefficient for shell side depends on flow condition and fiber packing density thus it must be adjusted according to the membrane module specifications and flow conditions in this study a commercial module from toyobo co ltd japan with fixed packing density is used for experimental study and the effect of flow condition is evaluated by varying feed flow rate and pressure therefore the coefficient of pressure drop equation is also expected to be constant for the experimental data generated in this study however establishing dependency of these parameters concerning module packing density may require experimental data generated from membrane modules with different packing density the models considered in this study along with the parameters and experimental results are used for calibration as displayed in table 1 the models are arranged in the order of increasing number of parameters to depict the inefficiency of simpler models to accurately define the system 15 e r r o r x exp x mod e l 2 x in eq 15 refers to the experimental data considered for error evaluation as provided in table 1 an unconstrained minimization tool fminsearch was used to minimize the error function the initial point was generated using a genetic algorithm ga tool from matlab 2019 academic license 4 results and discussion 4 1 performance comparison of 1way and 2way ro mode the ro experiments were conducted using a toyobo axial hf membrane with 1way and 2way lumen side outlets the permeate flow rate obtained in the 1way and 2way ro system with respect to the average pressure drop in the module is shown in fig 3 a the results indicated that the permeate flow rate in the 2way ro mode was at least 10 higher than that of the 1way ro mode this might be due to the effect of permeate pressure at the closed end of the lumen side which varied from 0 65 to 1 7 bar in another aspect the 1way ro mode has a higher lumen pressure drop than the 2way ro mode for the same permeate flow rate therefore the average permeate pressure in the 1way ro mode is expected to be more than the 2way ro mode and it is also expected to increase with feed pressure the net driving force for the water flux will be proportional to the pressure difference between the feed and permeate side on another side of the membrane i e the shell side pressure drop decreased with an increase in feed pressure and it was found to be very minimal above feed pressure of 5 56 bar due to both opposing phenomena occurring in permeate and feed side the difference in effective driving force between 1way and 2way ro mode is reaching to asymptotic value beyond average feed pressure of 5 56 bar as shown in fig 3 b the net difference between the 1way and 2way ro permeate flow rate increased up to 0 12 l min as the average pressure on the feed side reached 5 56 bar and later there was almost no further increment in the permeate flow rate in the case of 2way ro mode the water flux across the fiber length is expected to be more uniform than the 1way ro mode and accordingly the fouling rate across the 2way ro is expected to be more uniform than the 1way ro mode due to this the overall fouling of the 2way ro mode is expected to be lower than that of 1way ro mode however this must be evaluated with appropriate fouling experiments 4 2 performance of considered models in order to investigate the applicability of the considered models the performances of various models used in this study are compared and summarized in tables 2 and 3 as explained in previous sections the experimental data of 1way ro were used to estimate the parameters followed by validation using the results of 2way experiments the comparison of model predicted permeate flow rate with the 1way ro experimental data is shown in fig 4 a it is observed that all the models followed the permeate flow rate within an acceptable range as depicted in table 2 the water permeability for each model was found to be different the water permeability estimated using the combined sd the ergun and hagen poiseuille model has a minimum value as it does not capture the large pressure drops occurring in the shell and lumen side with the modification of the ergun equation the estimated water permeability value increased further and with the modification of the hagen poiseuille equation it reached a maximum value table 3 shows 66 error in permeate dead end pressure and 16 error in reject pressure when the pressure models are defined in their generic form this emphasizes the need for improvising the pressure drop models for both shell and lumen side flows the 1way ro model with respect to the reject pressure is described in fig 4 b apparently all models with modified versions of the ergun equation were deviating less than 1 5 from the experimental results the pressure drop in the lumen side was well projected by the type 1 hagen poiseuille equation and followed by the type 2 equation fig 4 c whereas the models with unchanged hagen poiseuille equation were underestimating the pressured drop across the hf lumen side based on the hagen poiseuille equation the reduction in the hf inner diameter 1 c can be correlated to the increase in lumen pressure drop by a factor c2 the estimated parameters were used to predict the 2way ro experiment data and the average percentage error is given in table 3 the value of pp out is interrelated to nc and dz through the eq 8 10 and 14 such that smaller n could result in large pp out value which is not observed during the experiments thus it is recommended to have a large number of segments n the permeate flow rate fig 4 d and reject pressure fig 4 e were compared among the different models to assess their effectiveness in replicating the ro system the comparison result revealed that the models without the modified hagen poiseuille equation under predicted the permeate flow rate during calibration these models projected a lower lumen pressure drop than the experimental results fig 4 c which led to low estimated water permeability value as a result the low permeate flow rate was predicted in the validation study however the permeate flow rate obtained by the modified hagen poiseuille models agreed with experiment results until the reject pressure reached 5 bar at higher fs pressure these models over predicted the permeate flow rate the reject pressure results fig 4 e justify the modifications made in the ergun equation with an average error of less than 2 in this study two models that consider the effective inner diameter and wall perforation effect on the pressure drop in the lumen side were examined the results showed that the average percentile error related to the former was 3 21 in permeate flow rate and 0 34 in reject pressure while the latter deviated by 5 47 and 1 17 respectively the lumen pressure profiles predicted by the modified models are shown in fig 4 f at the lowest 2 7 bar and highest 6 8 bar average shell side pressure unlike 1way ro the pressure profiles of 2way ro are maximum near the center of the module and then decline on either side the simulations result revealed that the maximum pressure built in the 2way ro was three times less than the closed end pressure observed in 1way ro the pressure values at the lumen entrance and exit were non zero due to the pressure drop considered in the lumen fixed with epoxy resin 5 conclusion this study described the effect of providing a secondary permeate outlet on the lumen side of the axial hf ro module a comparative study has been carried out between 1way and 2way ro system via experimentation modeling and validation a minimum of 10 permeate flow rate improvement in 2way ro performance was observed owing to the two outlets for permeate collection the 2way ro system reduced the pressure build up at the closed end of the hf ro module and resulted in better performance further to estimate and predict the ro performance various models were adapted and applied to the 1way and 2way ro system the pressure at the closed end of the lumen side was found to be three times higher than the pressure estimated by the hagen poiseuille equation the reduction in the effective diameter of the hf described this phenomenon more effectively the error between the 2way experimental results and model output when both the ergun and hagen poiseuille equations were modified was less than 6 this study can be further extended to other hf module membrane applications like forward osmosis fo and pressure retarded osmosis pro as far as the permeate flows through the lumen declaration

14003,in conventional hollow fiber reverse osmosis hf ro modules the lumen side has one end sealed in an epoxy resin and the other end opened 1way ro for permeate collection this study investigates the effect of having both ends open 2way ro in the hf modules the ro experiments were conducted using de ionized di water in two ends opened hf module the 2way ro experiments produced 10 more permeate

water while the other end is embedded in an epoxy seal 1 various studies 2 5 on the hf module considered that the permeate flow in the lumen side is laminar and the pressure drop results from the skin friction at the wall surface as a result the pressure drop in the lumen side is generally estimated using the hagen poiseuille equation with the boundary condition that the pressure at the open end is atmospheric the backward addition of the pressure in the lumen side employed in the previous studies indicated that the lumen pressure was highest at the feed entrance of the axial flow hf ro module and this directly affects the net permeate flow rate 2 3 thus to minimize the effect of high pressure at the entrance of the hf module a second permeate outlet at the entrance could be considered the permeation in the hf ro modules occurs on the wall of the lumen throughout its length this permeation causes disturbances in the cross sectional area and wall roughness this increases the pressure drop as reported in various literature 6 7 in addition the hagen poiseuille model strictly applies to pipes with uniform cross section and roughness and this might result in an inaccurate prediction of the pressure drop in the lumen side similarly though the shell side pressure drop in the axial flow hf modules is due to the viscous and inertial forces flow channelling and non uniform velocities which are commonly observed during the experiment have a significant effect this limits the use of the ergun equation in its generic form for predicting the pressure drop in the shell side 8 9 thus in this study the ergun equation is modified to incorporate these effects in this work the effect of providing two lumen side permeate outlet on the total performance of the axial flow hf module is investigated the hf modules with single and double outlets are referred to as 1way ro and 2way ro respectively the study also discusses various models considered for estimating the permeate flow rate and pressure variation in the lumen and shell side of the axial flow hf module the developed models will be calibrated by 1way ro experiments followed by validation using 2way ro experimental data 2 material and methods the ro experiments were conducted in a toyobo axial hf module effective length 0 56 m and area 30 5 m2 with two ends opened as it provides a second opening in the lumen side required for the 2way ro studies the experimental setup is presented in fig 1 de ionized water from millipore water synthesis unit model no elix 3 milli q make m s millipore usa was used to conduct the ro experiments the feed solution fs was pumped using a 300 gpd heavy duty booster pump to the shell side of the module while the permeate was collected through the lumen side the fs flow rate and pressure were measured using pp helical flow meter and ascorp digital pressure gauge supplied by asma industrial corporation india the flow meter and pressure gauges were placed on both sides of the module to measure the inlet and outlet flow rates and hydraulic pressures as shown in fig 1 the feed pressure was regulated by a manually operated control valve once the pressure and flow rates at the inlet and exit of the module reached steady value the permeate flow rate was then measured by weighing balance the temperature of the fs was maintained at 25 c during all the experiments this procedure was carried out for both 1way and 2way ro systems further in order to avoid experimental error all the experiments were conducted three times and the average was taken in the 1way ro system one end of the lumen side was closed and the pressure at this end was measured in the 2way both the lumen side outlets were opened for permeate collection where the additional outlet is denoted by secondary outlet in fig 1 the experimental data from the 1way ro system was used for parameter estimation and these parameters were validated with the 2way ro experimental data 3 modeling of 1way and 2way ro system in this study the solution diffusion sd model was used to estimate the transport of the solvent through the hf membrane 2 5 the solvent flux can be calculated by eq 1 when de ionized di

condition in 1way ro a zero velocity position in the 2way ro module is assumed at a position where the permeate starts flowing the opposite direction to estimate this position a length lc has been introduced to denote the division of the permeate flow direction in the lumen side as depicted in fig 1 the boundary condition for the lumen pressure in the 1way ro model is also extended into the 2way ro model by considering the pressure at both the outlets to be atmospheric the governing transport equations were modified for the two portions based on flow direction as 1 for z 0 to lc 7 d v p

the respective ergun equation coefficients 150 and 1 75 8 9 the hagen poiseuille equation is used to calculate the lumen side pressure drop as far as the reynold number 2100 the applicability of the hagen poiseuille equation requires that the fluid flow should be laminar and the pressure loss mainly occurs due to the friction at the inner surface of the hf however the permeation from the lumen side affects the flow and pressure distribution along the length of the hf module to incorporate these effects in the hagen poiseuille two models are considered in this study based on the available literature these models are discussed below 3 1 effective hf inner diameter model due to the permeation of water into the lumen side the net available area for the water flow is constricted and results in local acceleration it is assumed that there is a formation of a permeate layer on the membrane surface which lowers the overall cross section area of the lumen this is included in the hagen poiseuille equation and lumen velocity calculation by replacing the inner diameter of the hf di fiber with the effective inner diameter di fiber eff 6 10 the di fiber eff is assumed to be constant along the length of the lumen and thus it reflects the average inner hf diameter of the lumen the di fiber eff and corresponding lumen pressure drop equation are shown in eq 11a and 11b 11a d i f i b

entering the lumen with friction factor considered in the hagen poiseuille equation the energy loss of the lumen permeate stream due to perpendicular inflow of fresh permeate is incorporated by including a wall perforation friction factor fp to the darcy friction factor fd 6 7 11 this modification results in 12 f f p f d f p 64 n r e 13 d p p d z f p ρ v p 2 2 d i f i b e r 32 μ v p d i f i

and modified ergun equation 2 wall perforation model the models were solved by applying the finite difference method by partitioning the module into n 1 segments resulting in n points in the axial direction the zero velocity point in 2way ro models defined by the nc was estimated using a simple search technique an initial lc and thus nc is assumed such that pp out 0 eq 14 and then lc is gradually increased till the following termination satisfied 14 p p o u t p p z l 32 μ l s d i f i b e r 2 v p z l 0 the flow chart for solving the 1way and 2way ro model is shown in fig 2 the parameters permeability and pressure equation constants were estimated by minimizing the squared error between the experimental results and model output the estimated parameters in the models were water permeability constants of lumen side pressure drop equation and constants of shell side pressure drop equation the water permeability depends on membrane material 12 13 and water temperature and thus needs to be tuned when the membrane of different materials or feed temperature is used for a given application but in this study the feed temperature is fixed at constant and single membrane is used for all the experiments therefore water permeability is expected to be constant for this experimental data similarly the pressure drop equation coefficient for lumen side might vary based on flow conditions i e laminar or turbulent in this study the flow through the lumen side was in laminar range with reynolds number 5 the pressure drop equation coefficient for shell side depends on flow condition and fiber packing density thus it must be adjusted according to the membrane module specifications and flow conditions in this study a commercial module from toyobo co ltd japan with fixed packing density is used for experimental study and the effect of flow condition is evaluated by varying feed flow rate and pressure therefore the coefficient of pressure drop equation is also expected to be constant for the experimental data generated in this study however establishing dependency of these parameters concerning module packing density may require experimental data generated from membrane modules with different packing density the models considered in this study along with the parameters and experimental results are used for calibration as displayed in table 1 the models are arranged in the order of increasing number of parameters to depict the inefficiency of simpler models to accurately define the system 15 e r r o r x exp x mod e l 2 x in eq 15 refers to the experimental data considered for error evaluation as provided in table 1 an unconstrained minimization tool fminsearch was used to minimize the error function the initial point was generated using a genetic algorithm ga tool from matlab 2019 academic license 4 results and discussion 4 1 performance comparison of 1way and 2way ro mode the ro experiments were conducted using a toyobo axial hf membrane with 1way and 2way lumen side outlets the permeate flow rate obtained in the 1way and 2way ro system with respect to the average pressure drop in the module is shown in fig 3 a the results indicated that the permeate flow rate in the 2way ro mode was at least 10 higher than that of the 1way ro mode this might be due to the effect of permeate pressure at the closed end of the lumen side which varied from 0 65 to 1 7 bar in another aspect the 1way ro mode has a higher lumen pressure drop than the 2way ro mode for the same permeate flow rate therefore the average permeate pressure in the 1way ro mode is expected to be more than the 2way ro mode and it is also expected to increase with feed pressure the net driving force for the water flux will be proportional to the pressure difference between the feed and permeate side on another side of the membrane i e the shell side pressure drop decreased with an increase in feed pressure and it was found to be very minimal above feed pressure of 5 56 bar due to both opposing phenomena occurring in permeate and feed side the difference in effective driving force between 1way and 2way ro mode is reaching to asymptotic value beyond average feed pressure of 5 56 bar as shown in fig 3 b the net difference between the 1way and 2way ro permeate flow rate increased up to 0 12 l min as the average pressure on the feed side reached 5 56 bar and later there was almost no further increment in the permeate flow rate in the case of 2way ro mode the water flux across the fiber length is expected to be more uniform than the 1way ro mode and accordingly the fouling rate across the 2way ro is expected to be more uniform than the 1way ro mode due to this the overall fouling of the 2way ro mode is expected to be lower than that of 1way ro mode however this must be evaluated with appropriate fouling experiments 4 2 performance of considered models in order to investigate the applicability of the considered models the performances of various models used in this study are compared and summarized in tables 2 and 3 as explained in previous sections the experimental data of 1way ro were used to estimate the parameters followed by validation using the results of 2way experiments the comparison of model predicted permeate flow rate with the 1way ro experimental data is shown in fig 4 a it is observed that all the models followed the permeate flow rate within an acceptable range as depicted in table 2 the water permeability for each model was found to be different the water permeability estimated using the combined sd the ergun and hagen poiseuille model has a minimum value as it does not capture the large pressure drops occurring in the shell and lumen side with the modification of the ergun equation the estimated water permeability value increased further and with the modification of the hagen poiseuille equation it reached a maximum value table 3 shows 66 error in permeate dead end pressure and 16 error in reject pressure when the pressure models are defined in their generic form this emphasizes the need for improvising the pressure drop models for both shell and lumen side flows the 1way ro model with respect to the reject pressure is described in fig 4 b apparently all models with modified versions of the ergun equation were deviating less than 1 5 from the experimental results the pressure drop in the lumen side was well projected by the type 1 hagen poiseuille equation and followed by the type 2 equation fig 4 c whereas the models with unchanged hagen poiseuille equation were underestimating the pressured drop across the hf lumen side based on the hagen poiseuille equation the reduction in the hf inner diameter 1 c can be correlated to the increase in lumen pressure drop by a factor c2 the estimated parameters were used to predict the 2way ro experiment data and the average percentage error is given in table 3 the value of pp out is interrelated to nc and dz through the eq 8 10 and 14 such that smaller n could result in large pp out value which is not observed during the experiments thus it is recommended to have a large number of segments n the permeate flow rate fig 4 d and reject pressure fig 4 e were compared among the different models to assess their effectiveness in replicating the ro system the comparison result revealed that the models without the modified hagen poiseuille equation under predicted the permeate flow rate during calibration these models projected a lower lumen pressure drop than the experimental results fig 4 c which led to low estimated water permeability value as a result the low permeate flow rate was predicted in the validation study however the permeate flow rate obtained by the modified hagen poiseuille models agreed with experiment results until the reject pressure reached 5 bar at higher fs pressure these models over predicted the permeate flow rate the reject pressure results fig 4 e justify the modifications made in the ergun equation with an average error of less than 2 in this study two models that consider the effective inner diameter and wall perforation effect on the pressure drop in the lumen side were examined the results showed that the average percentile error related to the former was 3 21 in permeate flow rate and 0 34 in reject pressure while the latter deviated by 5 47 and 1 17 respectively the lumen pressure profiles predicted by the modified models are shown in fig 4 f at the lowest 2 7 bar and highest 6 8 bar average shell side pressure unlike 1way ro the pressure profiles of 2way ro are maximum near the center of the module and then decline on either side the simulations result revealed that the maximum pressure built in the 2way ro was three times less than the closed end pressure observed in 1way ro the pressure values at the lumen entrance and exit were non zero due to the pressure drop considered in the lumen fixed with epoxy resin 5 conclusion this study described the effect of providing a secondary permeate outlet on the lumen side of the axial hf ro module a comparative study has been carried out between 1way and 2way ro system via experimentation modeling and validation a minimum of 10 permeate flow rate improvement in 2way ro performance was observed owing to the two outlets for permeate collection the 2way ro system reduced the pressure build up at the closed end of the hf ro module and resulted in better performance further to estimate and predict the ro performance various models were adapted and applied to the 1way and 2way ro system the pressure at the closed end of the lumen side was found to be three times higher than the pressure estimated by the hagen poiseuille equation the reduction in the effective diameter of the hf described this phenomenon more effectively the error between the 2way experimental results and model output when both the ergun and hagen poiseuille equations were modified was less than 6 this study can be further extended to other hf module membrane applications like forward osmosis fo and pressure retarded osmosis pro as far as the permeate flows through the lumen declaration

smx degradation rate the iron precursor salt favors the anchoring of the metal in different oxidation state on the catalyst in a proportion of fe2 fe3 4 1 for c ac afe 1 5 for c ac sfe and 1 7 for c ac nfe which is related to the oh generated 53 8 μm g 1 37 9 μm g 1 and 42 4 μm g 1 respectively the oh generation kinetics were described by a pseudo first order model with rate constants of 0 0252 and 0 0299 min 1 for c ac afe and c ac sfe respectively which coincide with the kinetic constants for the degradation of smx 0 0262 and 0 0297 min 1 therefore the oxidation process is carried out by oh in the case of c ac nfe fe was fixed within the texture of the carbon and the oh generation was the lowest 0 0005 min 1 explaining the reaction is limited by diffusion for smx the degradation

generation kinetics sulfamethoxazole degradation 1 introduction pharmaceutic compounds have been found increasingly in surface water and groundwater being its presence and concentration levels one of the main environmental problems to be mitigated at present 1 these types of compounds are considered to be persistent and although they are present in relatively low concentrations being capable of causing detrimental effects on aquatic ecosystems and even human health 2 among the most commonly found pharmaceutical compounds in water are antibiotics of the sulphonamide group being sulfamethoxazole smx one of the most concern due to the high concentration present in the environment which have been reported in the order of 0 1 1 9 μg l 1 in wastewater effluents besides that it can be persistent in the environment for long periods leading to an irreversibly damage to the ecosystem 3 due to the recalcitrant nature of this pollutant advanced oxidation processes aop s have been tested for their elimination one of the most studied processes are those based on fenton type reactions homogeneous and heterogeneous fenton photo fenton electro fenton etc 4 heterogeneous fenton has the advantage that the amount of sludge and byproducts generated are minimal and therefore is considered friendly with the environment 5 6 in this process the fenton reaction is carried out using a metal catalyst supported on the surface of a solid matrix the most common transition metal that have been used as an active phase to promote this reaction is iron due to its redox activity and economical value 7 iron can be fixed into the support material by impregnation using a precursor salt as previously demonstrated by duarte et al 8 which showed that the nature of the iron precursor plays a crucial role on the physicochemical characterization of the final catalyst obtained and therefore on the degradation of pollutants however one of the critical factors to determine if the process is taking place in a radical way is to analyze the presence of highly oxidizing species in the system oh about this the studies published at the moment showed in an indirect way how the process is carried out relating the decrease in the concentration of a model compound to the efficiency of the advanced oxidation process 9 10 which has led to great discussions in this context the present research study the generation of oh radicals in a heterogeneous fenton type process using carbon fe catalysts and its application to the degradation of a pollutant model of environmental concern sulfamethoxazole therefore the effect of the iron precursor salt was evaluated by relating the physicochemical characterization physisorption of n2 sem xrd edx ftir xps of three carbon fe catalysts prepared from iron acetate fe c2h3o2 2 iron sulphate feso4 7h2o and iron nitrate fe no2 39 h2o with the kinetics of the radical generation oh and the kinetics of the pollutant degradation 2 experimental 2 1 preparation of carbon fe catalysts commercial granular activated carbon clarimex product number pr 200 labeled as sample c was used as a support material to fix iron and be used as a catalyst in the fenton type process in heterogeneous phase in a first stage functionalization of the activated carbon was carried out by introducing oxygenated groups which serve as metal anchoring sites the methodology used was similar to that reported by zárate guzmán et al 11 the material obtained was labeled as c ac in order to fix the metal in the c ac sample a method similar to incipient wetness impregnation was used for which the following precursor salts were used iron ii nitrate iron ii acetate and iron ii sulfate similar to that reported by duarte et al 8 for this process the necessary quantities of these reagents were dissolved in the least amount of water possible until achieving 9 wt iron on the c ac carbon considering the pka of each of the iron salts the ph of each of the prepared solutions was adjusted using 0 1 m hcl or naoh in order to favor the presence of the fe2 species in solution these were ph 2 for iron ii acetate and ph 3 for the other salts the solution corresponding to each precursor salt was added dropwise in a mass of 5 g of c ac sample until being moistened homogeneously these moistened c ac remained humid for 12 h to favor the diffusion of the salt within the texture of the carbon subsequently the solvent was removed by evaporation using a conventional oven at 105 c finally the dry sample was placed in a tubular furnace for the thermal treatment in inert atmosphere using a heating ramp of 10 c min 1 up to 400 c and then maintaining for 2 h 12 the obtained catalysts were designated as c ac afe c ac nfe and c ac sfe according to each of the salts used 2 2 characterization of carbon fe catalysts the textural properties of the carbon materials were studied using a n2 physisorption method at 196 c using a quadrasorb si quantachrome inc equipment from the obtained isotherms the specific surface area and the micro and meso pore size distribution were calculated using the bet equation 13 14 and the qsdft model quenched solid density functional theory assuming slit shaped pores 15 the elemental composition and morphology of the materials was studied by means of scanning electron microscopy coupled to dispersive energy spectroscopy sem edx using a jeol electronic microscope model jsm 6510lv eds in order to evaluate the presence of iron in the materials surface x ray diffraction xrd analysis were carried out to study

order to characterize the composition of the elements present in the outermost surface of the materials the x ray photoemission spectroscopy xps technique was used the analysis was performed using an xps equipment brand k alpha from thermo scientific the xps spectra were obtained with a monochromatic x ray source al kα 1486 71 ev at a pressure of 6 10 10 torr in the analytical chamber for the wide scan spectra an energy range of 0 1100 ev was used with a step energy of 80 ev and a step size of 1 ev once the signals were examined high resolution scans were performed for the c1s o1s and fe2p regions using a step energy of 40 ev and a step size of 0 05 ev each region of interest was scanned several times to obtain good signal to noise ratios with the aim of acquire the number of components the position of each peak and its areas the resulting spectra were adjusted to lorentz and gauss curves voigt profile after the correction of the background signal shirley model 2 3 detection and o h radical quantification the identification and quantification of the oh radicals was carried out by fluorescence spectroscopy using an agilent fluorescence spectrophotometer model cary eclipse for this method coumarin was used as a probe molecule due to the fact that when reacts with oh radical produce 7 hydroxycoumarin 7 hc which is a stable fluorescent compound 16 17 easily measured this method is highly effective in the determination of oh radicals due to its high sensitivity detection limits of 3 10 18 mol l 1 and selectivity 16 18 for the analysis excitation and emission slit were set at 10 0 nm for all determinations the experiments were carried out in a complete stirred tank reactor of where coumarin was placed at a concentration of 1 mm 0 5 g of each of the carbon fe catalysts and h2o2 at a concentration of 2 5 mm the solution was adjusted to ph 3 the optimum value for which the fenton reaction is carried out each of the experiments was monitored for 250 min for each time interval the fluorescence intensity corresponding to the 7 hc molecule was obtained at a wavelength of 455 nm which corresponds to the maximum wavelength of its emission spectrum finally with the help of a calibration curve the concentrations of 7 hc and therefore of generated oh radicals were obtained for each sampling time all the experiments were performed in duplicate and the presented data are average values 2 4 sulfamethoxazole smx degradation reaction the smx degradation studies were carried out using a complete stirred tank reactor which was operated at a 200 rpm ph 3 and temperature of 25 c the initial concentration of smx used was 20 mg l 1 detection and quantification of smx was performed by high performance liquid chromatography hplc using a waters e2695 hplc chromatographic

total organic carbon was determined by the method of catalytic oxidation by combustion using a shimadzu total organic carbon analyzer model toc l csn 3 results and discussion 3 1 carbon fe catalysts characterization n2 adsorption desorption isotherms as well as the pore size distribution of the samples studied are presented in fig 1 all the studied materials present both microporosity and mesoporosity being mostly mesoporous materials in this sense it can be expressed that all the samples present a combination of type i and type iv n2 isotherms characteristic of mesoporous solids fig 1a likewise according to the iupac classification the hysteresis cycle observed can be classified as type h3 characteristic of mesoporous solids that have pores in the form of parallel plates 20 this is evident when analyzing the pore size distribution fig 1b since all the samples have an average pore diameter of 5 nm and an average pore width of 0 61 cm3 g 1 table 1 shows a compilation of the textural properties of all the materials studied it is observed that the carbon support c ac presented a bet surface area of 769 m2 g 1 while for the catalysts c ac afe c ac nfe and c ac sfe were of 587 603 and 575 m2 g 1 accordingly indicating that the surface area decreases after the impregnation process thus this decrease can be associated with the entry of iron into the porous structure of the carbon which blocks the porosity of the material as shown by the significant decreases in the volume of micropores w0 n2 and the volume of mesoporous vmes in order to identify the presence of iron in the carbon fe catalysts a semi quantitative analysis was carried out by means of dispersive energy spectroscopy edx the scan was carried out in three different zones for each of the samples finding the presence of iron in an average percentage of 9 by weight in all the samples being consistent with theoretical calculations fig s1 supplementary material shows the morphology of samples c and c ac of these it is important to note that acid functionalization does not cause significant damage to the texture of activated carbon it is appreciated that this acid treatment achieves the removal of impurities present in the material and achieves the opening of channels that benefit the subsequent anchoring of the metal fig 2 shows the distribution of the metal on the catalysts surface analyzed by sem edx mappings in order to be representative the mappings were carried out in triplicate in different areas of the material for the three elements iron in red oxygen in green and carbon in blue for all samples the presence of oxygen was observed due to the presence of oxygenated groups on the surface in the case of the sample c ac afe signals marked with a more intense red color are observed showing the agglomeration of iron particles the same case but in smaller proportion can be noticed for c ac sfe on the other hand the material c ac nfe shows a different metal dispersion the image shows that the supported metal is mostly within the porous carbon network which could be associated with a smaller size of the iron particles sem edx analysis were complemented with studies by x ray diffraction fig 3 a these results showed an amorphous surface for all samples which are characteristic of micro and meso porous activated carbon for the prepared carbon fe catalysts four main signals were identified the first one as a broad diffraction peak in the region 2θ 15 to 30 attributable to the amorphous carbon structures the second one at 26 5 is associated with the reflection plane of the graphite the third at 35 5 corresponds to crystallographic structures similar to the 110 plane of the hematite fe2o3 and the 311 plane of the magnetite fe3o4 21 finally the fourth signal at a diffraction angle of 63 4 can be attributed to the plane 440 of the cubic structure of magnetite 22 the intensity and width of the peaks in the diffractograms can be associated to the size of the iron particles placed in the carbon surface therefore for the obtained materials are in the order c ac afe c a c s fe c ac nfe these results are equivalent to those obtained by sem edx where the metal dispersion and the formation of metallic particle agglomerates for the samples c ac afe and c a c s fe are observed this effect can be attributed to the solubility of the iron precursor salt iron nitrate ii 879 g l 1 sulfate and iron nitrate ii 400 g l 1 during the impregnation process a lower solubility will lead to a higher probability that the iron particles interact with each other developing larger agglomerates that remain in the support when removing the solvent infrared spectroscopy ftir analysis were performed to study the surface functional groups of the carbon and carbon fe prepared materials and to corroborate the anchoring with the metal fig 3b shows the ft ir spectra corresponding to all studied samples in which five main bands are identified the first of them at 3400 cm 1 is associated with oh bonds due to phenolic hydroxyl and carboxyl functional groups 23 24 the band at 1620 cm 1 is attributed to co bonds 23 25 the third signal at 1100 cm 1 is only appreciable for the c ac sample and is associated with the oxidation process of the carbon 26 finally two signals are observed at 705 and 563 cm 1 these are only perceptible for the samples c ac afe c ac nfe and c ac sfe and are associated with fe o bonds in the same way that are present in crystalline structures like magnetite and hematite respectively 27 therefore confirming the presence of iron bound to the oxygenated groups in the carbon surface complementing the rest of the studied characterization techniques xp spectroscopy studies for the prepared materials are presented in fig 4 the binding energies determined from the deconvolution of the high resolution spectra for the c1s o1s and fe2p regions are shown in table 2 for all the materials the c1s region has been decomposed into six peaks similarly for other activated carbons of the same origin 11 28 in such a way that the binding energy close to 284 7 ev is attributed to cc bonds the peak at 286 0 ev is associated with ch bonds while the peak at 287 2 ev is due to coh bonds the signals observed at 288 9 ev and 290 6 ev are associated with co and cooh bonds respectively finally the peak at 292 2 ev can be associated with transitions between the aromatic rings present in the graphitic planes of the material as expected the previously described groups are confirmed in the deconvoluted spectra of the o1s region which have broad peaks as the main characteristic indicating the presence of organic and inorganic oxygen the spectra for the samples c ac afe and c ac sfe were decomposed in 2 peaks centered on 531 6 and 533 0 ev that can be attributed to the species co and co 29 30 corresponding to carboxyl functional groups carbonyl and ester the sample c ac nfe showed a different behavior on the result for this material the spectrum in the o1s region was decomposed into three peaks 530 6 ev 532 8 ev and 535 ev corresponding to functional groups co co and hydroxyl groups and or water chemisorbed respectively 28 the presence of chemisorbed water in this catalyst is attributed to having a higher percentage of fe3 ions which form several complexes such as fe oh 2 and fe2 oh 2 4 to complete the analysis xp spectra were obtained in high resolution for the fe2p region fig 4c after the decomposition of all the spectra the characteristic doublet of iron is observed showing two predominant peaks centered at 712 and 725 ev corresponding to the 2p3 2 and 2p1 2 contributions respectively 31 the position and separation of energy are very similar to those observed for feo oh structures 28 32 for the sample c ac afe the decomposition of the spectrum was performed in two double peaks the first of them located at 711 1 ev associated with fe2 7 and the second one located at 713 6 ev corresponding to the fe3 species 33 34 for the rest of the samples c ac nfe and c ac sfe the decomposition was performed in a similar way but considering a peak centered at 719 ev which is attributed to a satellite peak characteristic of fe3 species 35 considering the ratio of the peak at 711 1 ev and 713 6 ev it is possible to obtain the fe2 fe3 ratio of each of the samples on its outermost surface according to the calculated ratios the percentage of iron in the samples are c ac afe 60 fe2 c ac sfe 43 fe2 c ac nfe 28 fe2 which is consistent with the pka and the dissociation of the salts used during the impregnation process 3 2 identification and quantification of oh radicals in the heterogeneous phase fenton reaction in order to determine the effect of the iron precursor salt on the generation of oh radicals the identification and quantification of oh radicals was carried out using the carbon fe catalysts these studies were carried out following the methodology proposed by zárate guzmán et al 11 the experimental data obtained for each of the prepared catalysts materials are shown in fig 5 according to voelker 36 it has been considered that the generation of radicals oh follows a pseudo first order model described by eq 1 1 d oh dt k oh oh where k oh is the formation constant of radical oh expressed in min 1 oh is the concentration of radicals oh in μm and t is time expressed in s this model was fit to the experimental data fig 5 solid line and the kinetic parameters calculated for each of the catalysts are shown in table 3 for the prepared catalysts c ac afe and c ac sfe it was observed that the concentration of radicals obtained experimentally oh exp and the concentration of radicals calculated from the model oh calc had very close values showing the accuracy of the model nevertheless for the catalyst c ac nfe a significant difference between these values oh exp vs oh calc was found showing that the kinetics of radical formation is governed by a different process additionally the rate constants of oh radical generation k oh for the catalysts c ac afe and c ac sfe showed very similar values 0 0252 min 1 and 0 0299 min 1 respectively in both samples the kinetics followed a similar behavior during the first 120 min where a high rate of radicals oh generation was observed which is associated with the fact that the reaction is carried out using the iron readily accessible at the external surface of the carbon such as observed in the sem edx mappings after the first 120 min the experimental data began to achieve a constant value reaching an average maximum concentration of 2 46 μm g 1 and 53 8 μm g 1 respectively this due to the fact that coumarin responsible for the detection of the radicals oh starts to be in a lower concentration than required thus limiting the reaction in the case of the c ac nfe catalyst the kinetics of radical formation oh is much slower k oh 0 0005 min 1 and presents a different behavior in the reaction with c ac nfe catalyst the generation of radicals increases gradually without reaching a constant value this effect can be associated with the availability of iron on the surface of the material according to the characterization of the catalyst iron is found mostly within the porous structure of the carbon which implies that the generation of radicals oh will be governed by diffusion processes within the pore this was validated by relating the iron crystal size of each of the catalysts studied with the production of oh radicals the estimation of the average crystal size was made using the scherrer equation eq 2 2 τ kλ β cos θ where τ average crystal size nm k crystal shape factor 0 9 λ length wavelength of the radiation used λcu 1 5406 β width average of peak and θ diffraction angle fig 6 shows these results where the concentration of oh obtained for each catalyst is related to the average crystal size of fe supported onto the carbon surface for which was obtained a linear correlation with a coefficient r2 0 9406 of the catalysts evaluated c ac nfe had the lowest average iron particle size 6 3 nm and generate a lower concentration of oh radicals 18 9 μm in the heterogeneous reaction which is reasonably related to the results obtained by sem edx this effect is due to the fact that as having iron particles a smaller size the metal is more dispersed on the inside the pores and channels on the carbon surface hindering their interaction with the h2o2 due to mass transfer limitations resulting in a less efficient and slower radical generation rate oh an important fact to highlight is that for all samples the maximum concentration reached in the generation of radicals oh is proportional to the amount of fe2 present in the catalyst as shown in fig 5b in which the amount of fe2 obtained by xps was related to the maximum concentration of oh obtained for each catalyst therefore the process of generation of radicals in a heterogeneous fenton type process is due to the reaction between the ferrous ion fe2 present in the carbon fe catalyst surface and the hydrogen peroxide h2o2 in the water resulting in a change in the oxidation state of the iron fe2 in the catalyst similar to the reaction in homogeneous phase eq 3 3 carbon fe 2 h 2 o 2 carbon fe 3 oh oh 3 3 identification and quantification of oh radicals in the homogeneous phase fenton reaction in order to determine if the oh radicals generation previously evaluated is carried out exclusively by the iron supported onto the carbon surface or the iron leached to the water during the process the concentration of fe2 in solution was analyzed thus to determine the stability of the catalyst according the leaching of the metal fig 7 a shows the leaching kinetics of fe2 using carbon fe catalysts according to these results the maximum concentrations of leached iron were for each case c a c s fe 0 24 mg l 1 c ac afe 0 23 mg l 1 and c ac nfe 0 18 mg l 1 in addition it is important to note that the concentration of iron leached to the water during the heterogeneous fenton reaction does not exceed the wastewater limits established by the epa environmental protection agency and the actual european legislation which establish as maximum contaminant levels mcls a concentration of 2 mg l 1 of iron once the leaching kinetics were determined experiments were performed using the iron concentration obtained to evaluate the fenton reaction in homogeneous phase fig 7b shows the kinetics of oh generation for the fenton reaction in homogeneous phase considering the leached iron of the carbon fe catalysts this was fit to a pseudo first order model all the catalysts studied presented a similar behavior for this reaction at first follows an exponential behavior during 60 min then achieving a constant value because the catalyst present in solution begins to deplete the highest concentration of oh radical obtained according to the catalyst material used for the reaction were c ac afe 1 35 μm c ac nfe 0 73 μm and c ac sfe 3 12 μm the kinetic parameters obtained are shown in table 3 the radical generation constant oh k oh was similar for all test using the different prepared catalysts materials indicating that the kinetics in homogeneous fenton reaction is the same regardless of the type of iron salt used according to the information presented it is concluded that the generation of oh radicals using carbon fe catalysts is carried out through two processes i the fenton type reaction in heterogeneous phase using the iron attached to the carbon surface and ii the fenton reaction in homogeneous phase through the leached iron in solution the fenton type reaction in heterogeneous phase contributed to the total generation of oh radicals by 95 97 and 88 for the catalysts c ac afe c ac nfe and c ac sfe respectively the rest corresponds to the fenton reaction in homogeneous phase by 5 3 and 12 respectively 3 4 sulfamethoxazole smx degradation as a model pollutant the fenton type reaction in heterogeneous phase using the catalysts described above was evaluated in the degradation of sulfamethoxazole as model emerging pollutant the experimental data was fit to a first order kinetic model described by eq 4 4 d smx dt k smx smx where smx is the sulfamethoxazole concentration in mg l 1 ksmx is the degradation rate constant of sulfamethoxazole expressed in min 1 and t represents the reaction time in min fig 8 shows the smx degradation kinetics fit to the first order model for the three studied catalysts r 0 99 this kinetics data was compared with the generation of oh radicals described in the previous section for all the samples the degradation kinetics of smx showed an exponential decay for samples c ac afe and c ac sfe the concentration of smx reached a value of zero at 120 min this is directly related with the time to reach the maximum concentration of radicals oh for each of the catalysts used for the reaction however the sample c ac nfe presented a different behavior after 210 min of reaction the concentration of smx was maintained at a nearly constant value of 2 mgl 1 thus not being able to completely eliminate the smx molecule the fenton reaction in heterogeneous phase using this sample is associated with diffusion process restrictions therefore being the slower and less efficient degradation process of smx the degradation rate constants of the smx molecule ksmx were also obtained for each of the catalysts these values were compared with the oh radical generation constants for each catalyst fig 8 for samples c ac afe and c ac sfe similar kinetic constants were obtained ksmx 0 0262 min 1 vs koh 0 0252 min 1 and ksmx 0 0297 min 1 vs koh 0 0299 min 1 respectively this shows that both processes are carried out with the same rate the mechanism by which the contaminant degradation is achieved is still under discussion nevertheless three possible routes of degradation have been proposed the first is based on the hydroxylation of the isozaxol ring on the smx molecule this leads to the formation of two hydroxylated products c10h12n3o4 and c10h12n3o4s fig s2 the second route is based on the oxidation of the amino group in the benzene ring of smx this leads to the formation of nitro derivatives such as c10h8n3o5s which is capable of being hydroxylated to other degradation byproducts of lower molecular weight this process is followed by the breakdown of the isoxazole ring leading to the formation of simpler byproducts such as c6h4no5s fig s3 finally the proposed third degradation pathway is based on an attack through the sulfonamide bond sn and the cs bond of smx resulting in the formation of 4 aminobenzenesulfonic acid c5h8no3s and 5 methylisoxazole 3 sulfonamide acid c4h5n2o4s the subsequent oxidation of these molecules generates the breakdown of the benzene ring and isoxazole which leads to the formation of low molecular weight compounds such as alcohols aldehydes and carboxylic acids fig s4 in none of these proposed routes is achieved the mineralization of smx to co2 and water however according to ribeiro et al through the third route it is possible to obtain a mineralization rate in the order of 42 37 in the present work the removal of total organic carbon toc in the smx degradation test were 80 64 and 76 in the case of using c ac afe c ac nfe and c ac sfe respectively these results are higher than those mineralization percentages obtained by ribeiro et al therefore it is proposed that the degradation of smx follows the third proposed route since low molecular weight compounds such as alcohols aldehydes and carboxylic acids would provide a low concentration of toc 4 conclusions the amount and dispersion of fe2 on the carbon surface depends on the iron precursor salt used in the synthesis of catalyst material for heterogeneous fenton reaction being favored in the order c ac afe c ac sfe c ac nfe likewise it was observed that the use of iron nitrate favors the dispersion of the active phase at the carbon surface which results in higher stability but lower catalytic activity due to mass transfer limitations the fenton type reaction using carbon fe catalysts is composed of two processes i the reaction by the heterogeneous phase which contributes 97 to the total generation of oh radicals and ii the reaction in homogeneous phase which contributes 3 to the total generation of oh radicals sulfamethoxazole degradation studies by the carbon fe catalytic processes was obtained achieving a degradation rate of 98 at 120 min of reaction and 80 of mineralization up to co2 and water the kinetics of oh radical generation and smx degradation are similar demonstrating that both processes are simultaneously improved declaration of competing interest

14004,the influence of the iron precursor salt on the preparation of carbon fe catalysts was evaluated based on the generation of oh radicals in a heterogeneous fenton process applied to the degradation of sulfamethoxazole smx carbon catalysts were obtained with 9 fe by weight using three iron salts iron acetate c ac afe iron sulfate c ac sfe and iron nitrate c ac nfe characterization of catalysts was evaluated by n2 physisorption x ray diffraction scanning electron microscopy and spectroscopic techniques ftir edx xps these properties were related to the oh generation kinetics and to smx degradation rate the iron precursor salt favors the anchoring of the metal in different oxidation state on the catalyst in a proportion of fe2 fe3 4 1 for c ac afe 1 5 for c ac sfe and 1 7 for c ac nfe which is related to the oh generated 53 8 μm g 1 37 9 μm g 1 and 42 4 μm g 1 respectively the oh generation kinetics were described by a pseudo first order model with rate constants of 0 0252 and 0 0299 min 1 for c ac afe and c ac sfe respectively which coincide with the kinetic constants for the degradation of smx 0 0262 and 0 0297 min 1 therefore the oxidation process is carried out by oh in the case of c ac nfe fe was fixed within the texture of the carbon and the oh generation was the lowest 0 0005 min 1 explaining the reaction is limited by diffusion for smx the degradation percentage achieved for 20 mg l 1 was 98 2 in 120 min for c ac afe 98 1 in 180 min for c ac sfe and 92 8 in 210 min for c ac nfe keywords iron salt carbon fe catalysts heterogeneous fenton reaction oh generation kinetics sulfamethoxazole degradation 1 introduction pharmaceutic compounds have been found increasingly in surface water and groundwater being its presence and concentration levels one of the main environmental problems to be mitigated at present 1 these types of compounds are considered to be persistent and although they are present in relatively low concentrations being capable of causing detrimental effects on aquatic ecosystems and even human health 2 among the most commonly found pharmaceutical compounds in water are antibiotics of the sulphonamide group being sulfamethoxazole smx one of the most concern due to the high concentration present in the environment which have been reported in the order of 0 1 1 9 μg l 1 in wastewater effluents besides that it can be persistent in the environment for long periods leading to an irreversibly damage to the ecosystem 3 due to the recalcitrant nature of this pollutant advanced oxidation processes aop s have been tested for their elimination one of the most studied processes are those based on fenton type reactions homogeneous and heterogeneous fenton photo fenton electro fenton etc 4 heterogeneous fenton has the advantage that the amount of sludge and byproducts generated are minimal and therefore is considered friendly with the environment 5 6 in this process the fenton reaction is carried out using a metal catalyst supported on the surface of a solid matrix the most common transition metal that have been used as an active phase to promote this reaction is iron due to its redox activity and economical value 7 iron can be fixed into the support material by impregnation using a precursor salt as previously demonstrated by duarte et al 8 which showed that the nature of the iron precursor plays a crucial role on the physicochemical characterization of the final catalyst obtained and therefore on the degradation of pollutants however one of the critical factors to determine if the process is taking place in a radical way is to analyze the presence of highly oxidizing species in the system oh about this the studies published at the moment showed in an indirect way how the process is carried out relating the decrease in the concentration of a model compound to the efficiency of the advanced oxidation process 9 10 which has led to great discussions in this context the present research study the generation of oh radicals in a heterogeneous fenton type process using carbon fe catalysts and its application to the degradation of a pollutant model of environmental concern sulfamethoxazole therefore the effect of the iron precursor salt was evaluated by relating the physicochemical characterization physisorption of n2 sem xrd edx ftir xps of three carbon fe catalysts prepared from iron acetate fe c2h3o2 2 iron sulphate feso4 7h2o and iron nitrate fe no2 39 h2o with the kinetics of the radical generation oh and the kinetics of the pollutant degradation 2 experimental 2 1 preparation of carbon fe catalysts commercial granular activated carbon clarimex product number pr 200 labeled as sample c was used as a support material to fix iron and be used as a catalyst in the fenton type process in heterogeneous phase in a first stage functionalization of the activated carbon was carried out by introducing oxygenated groups which serve as metal anchoring sites the methodology used was similar to that reported by zárate guzmán et al 11 the material obtained was labeled as c ac in order to fix the metal in the c ac sample a method similar to incipient wetness impregnation was used for which the following precursor salts were used iron ii nitrate iron ii acetate and iron ii sulfate similar to that reported by duarte et al 8 for this process the necessary quantities of these reagents were dissolved in the least amount of water possible until achieving 9 wt iron on the c ac carbon considering the pka of each of the iron salts the ph of each of the prepared solutions was adjusted using 0 1 m hcl or naoh in order to favor the presence of the fe2 species in solution these were ph 2 for iron ii acetate and ph 3 for the other salts the solution corresponding to each precursor salt was added dropwise in a mass of 5 g of c ac sample until being moistened homogeneously these moistened c ac remained humid for 12 h to favor the diffusion of the salt within the texture of the carbon subsequently the solvent was removed by evaporation using a conventional oven at 105 c finally the dry sample was placed in a tubular furnace for the thermal treatment in inert atmosphere using a heating ramp of 10 c min 1 up to 400 c and then maintaining for 2 h 12 the obtained catalysts were designated as c ac afe c ac nfe and c ac sfe according to each of the salts used 2 2 characterization of carbon fe catalysts the textural properties of the carbon materials were studied using a n2 physisorption method at 196 c using a quadrasorb si quantachrome inc equipment from the obtained isotherms the specific surface area and the micro and meso pore size distribution were calculated using the bet equation 13 14 and the qsdft model quenched solid density functional theory assuming slit shaped pores 15 the elemental composition and morphology of the materials was studied by means of scanning electron microscopy coupled to dispersive energy spectroscopy sem edx using a jeol electronic microscope model jsm 6510lv eds in order to evaluate the presence of iron in the materials surface x ray diffraction xrd analysis were carried out to study the crystallographic phases of iron present in the c ac samples these experiments were performed at room temperature using an xrd bruker d8 advance diffractometer at a speed of 0 17 min 1 in a range of 10 70 2θ the materials surface chemistry was studied by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir in a region between 4000 to 400 cm 1 using a shimadzu spectrophotometer model iraffinity 1s in order to characterize the composition of the elements present in the outermost surface of the materials the x ray photoemission spectroscopy xps technique was used the analysis was performed using an xps equipment brand k alpha from thermo scientific the xps spectra were obtained with a monochromatic x ray source al kα 1486 71 ev at a pressure of 6 10 10 torr in the analytical chamber for the wide scan spectra an energy range of 0 1100 ev was used with a step energy of 80 ev and a step size of 1 ev once the signals were examined high resolution scans were performed for the c1s o1s and fe2p regions using a step energy of 40 ev and a step size of 0 05 ev each region of interest was scanned several times to obtain good signal to noise ratios with the aim of acquire the number of components the position of each peak and its areas the resulting spectra were adjusted to lorentz and gauss curves voigt profile after the correction of the background signal shirley model 2 3 detection and o h radical quantification the identification and quantification of the oh radicals was carried out by fluorescence spectroscopy using an agilent fluorescence spectrophotometer model cary eclipse for this method coumarin was used as a probe molecule due to the fact that when reacts with oh radical produce 7 hydroxycoumarin 7 hc which is a stable fluorescent compound 16 17 easily measured this method is highly effective in the determination of oh radicals due to its high sensitivity detection limits of 3 10 18 mol l 1 and selectivity 16 18 for the analysis excitation and emission slit were set at 10 0 nm for all determinations the experiments were carried out in a complete stirred tank reactor of where coumarin was placed at a concentration of 1 mm 0 5 g of each of the carbon fe catalysts and h2o2 at a concentration of 2 5 mm the solution was adjusted to ph 3 the optimum value for which the fenton reaction is carried out each of the experiments was monitored for 250 min for each time interval the fluorescence intensity corresponding to the 7 hc molecule was obtained at a wavelength of 455 nm which corresponds to the maximum wavelength of its emission spectrum finally with the help of a calibration curve the concentrations of 7 hc and therefore of generated oh radicals were obtained for each sampling time all the experiments were performed in duplicate and the presented data are average values 2 4 sulfamethoxazole smx degradation reaction the smx degradation studies were carried out using a complete stirred tank reactor which was operated at a 200 rpm ph 3 and temperature of 25 c the initial concentration of smx used was 20 mg l 1 detection and quantification of smx was performed by high performance liquid chromatography hplc using a waters e2695 hplc chromatographic separation was performed using a waters symmetry c18 column 150 mm 4 6 mm 5 mm the mobile phase consisted of 0 1 acetic acid and acetonitrile with a ratio of 70 30 v v the flow rate of the mobile phase was set at 1 ml min 1 the temperature of the column was maintained at 30 c and the detection wavelength was 265 nm the retention time for smx detection corresponded to 5 01 min 19 finally the total organic carbon was determined by the method of catalytic oxidation by combustion using a shimadzu total organic carbon analyzer model toc l csn 3 results and discussion 3 1 carbon fe catalysts characterization n2 adsorption desorption isotherms as well as the pore size distribution of the samples studied are presented in fig 1 all the studied materials present both microporosity and mesoporosity being mostly mesoporous materials in this sense it can be expressed that all the samples present a combination of type i and type iv n2 isotherms characteristic of mesoporous solids fig 1a likewise according to the iupac classification the hysteresis cycle observed can be classified as type h3 characteristic of mesoporous solids that have pores in the form of parallel plates 20 this is evident when analyzing the pore size distribution fig 1b since all the samples have an average pore diameter of 5 nm and an average pore width of 0 61 cm3 g 1 table 1 shows a compilation of the textural properties of all the materials studied it is observed that the carbon support c ac presented a bet surface area of 769 m2 g 1 while for the catalysts c ac afe c ac nfe and c ac sfe were of 587 603 and 575 m2 g 1 accordingly indicating that the surface area decreases after the impregnation process thus this decrease can be associated with the entry of iron into the porous structure of the carbon which blocks the porosity of the material as shown by the significant decreases in the volume of micropores w0 n2 and the volume of mesoporous vmes in order to identify the presence of iron in the carbon fe catalysts a semi quantitative analysis was carried out by means of dispersive energy spectroscopy edx the scan was carried out in three different zones for each of the samples finding the presence of iron in an average percentage of 9 by weight in all the samples being consistent with theoretical calculations fig s1 supplementary material shows the morphology of samples c and c ac of these it is important to note that acid functionalization does not cause significant damage to the texture of activated carbon it is appreciated that this acid treatment achieves the removal of impurities present in the material and achieves the opening of channels that benefit the subsequent anchoring of the metal fig 2 shows the distribution of the metal on the catalysts surface analyzed by sem edx mappings in order to be representative the mappings were carried out in triplicate in different areas of the material for the three elements iron in red oxygen in green and carbon in blue for all samples the presence of oxygen was observed due to the presence of oxygenated groups on the surface in the case of the sample c ac afe signals marked with a more intense red color are observed showing the agglomeration of iron particles the same case but in smaller proportion can be noticed for c ac sfe on the other hand the material c ac nfe shows a different metal dispersion the image shows that the supported metal is mostly within the porous carbon network which could be associated with a smaller size of the iron particles sem edx analysis were complemented with studies by x ray diffraction fig 3 a these results showed an amorphous surface for all samples which are characteristic of micro and meso porous activated carbon for the prepared carbon fe catalysts four main signals were identified the first one as a broad diffraction peak in the region 2θ 15 to 30 attributable to the amorphous carbon structures the second one at 26 5 is associated with the reflection plane of the graphite the third at 35 5 corresponds to crystallographic structures similar to the 110 plane of the hematite fe2o3 and the 311 plane of the magnetite fe3o4 21 finally the fourth signal at a diffraction angle of 63 4 can be attributed to the plane 440 of the cubic structure of magnetite 22 the intensity and width of the peaks in the diffractograms can be associated to the size of the iron particles placed in the carbon surface therefore for the obtained materials are in the order c ac afe c a c s fe c ac nfe these results are equivalent to those obtained by sem edx where the metal dispersion and the formation of metallic particle agglomerates for the samples c ac afe and c a c s fe are observed this effect can be attributed to the solubility of the iron precursor salt iron nitrate ii 879 g l 1 sulfate and iron nitrate ii 400 g l 1 during the impregnation process a lower solubility will lead to a higher probability that the iron particles interact with each other developing larger agglomerates that remain in the support when removing the solvent infrared spectroscopy ftir analysis were performed to study the surface functional groups of the carbon and carbon fe prepared materials and to corroborate the anchoring with the metal fig 3b shows the ft ir spectra corresponding to all studied samples in which five main bands are identified the first of them at 3400 cm 1 is associated with oh bonds due to phenolic hydroxyl and carboxyl functional groups 23 24 the band at 1620 cm 1 is attributed to co bonds 23 25 the third signal at 1100 cm 1 is only appreciable for the c ac sample and is associated with the oxidation process of the carbon 26 finally two signals are observed at 705 and 563 cm 1 these are only perceptible for the samples c ac afe c ac nfe and c ac sfe and are associated with fe o bonds in the same way that are present in crystalline structures like magnetite and hematite respectively 27 therefore confirming the presence of iron bound to the oxygenated groups in the carbon surface complementing the rest of the studied characterization techniques xp spectroscopy studies for the prepared materials are presented in fig 4 the binding energies determined from the deconvolution of the high resolution spectra for the c1s o1s and fe2p regions are shown in table 2 for all the materials the c1s region has been decomposed into six peaks similarly for other activated carbons of the same origin 11 28 in such a way that the binding energy close to 284 7 ev is attributed to cc bonds the peak at 286 0 ev is associated with ch bonds while the peak at 287 2 ev is due to coh bonds the signals observed at 288 9 ev and 290 6 ev are associated with co and cooh bonds respectively finally the peak at 292 2 ev can be associated with transitions between the aromatic rings present in the graphitic planes of the material as expected the previously described groups are confirmed in the deconvoluted spectra of the o1s region which have broad peaks as the main characteristic indicating the presence of organic and inorganic oxygen the spectra for the samples c ac afe and c ac sfe were decomposed in 2 peaks centered on 531 6 and 533 0 ev that can be attributed to the species co and co 29 30 corresponding to carboxyl functional groups carbonyl and ester the sample c ac nfe showed a different behavior on the result for this material the spectrum in the o1s region was decomposed into three peaks 530 6 ev 532 8 ev and 535 ev corresponding to functional groups co co and hydroxyl groups and or water chemisorbed respectively 28 the presence of chemisorbed water in this catalyst is attributed to having a higher percentage of fe3 ions which form several complexes such as fe oh 2 and fe2 oh 2 4 to complete the analysis xp spectra were obtained in high resolution for the fe2p region fig 4c after the decomposition of all the spectra the characteristic doublet of iron is observed showing two predominant peaks centered at 712 and 725 ev corresponding to the 2p3 2 and 2p1 2 contributions respectively 31 the position and separation of energy are very similar to those observed for feo oh structures 28 32 for the sample c ac afe the decomposition of the spectrum was performed in two double peaks the first of them located at 711 1 ev associated with fe2 7 and the second one located at 713 6 ev corresponding to the fe3 species 33 34 for the rest of the samples c ac nfe and c ac sfe the decomposition was performed in a similar way but considering a peak centered at 719 ev which is attributed to a satellite peak characteristic of fe3 species 35 considering the ratio of the peak at 711 1 ev and 713 6 ev it is possible to obtain the fe2 fe3 ratio of each of the samples on its outermost surface according to the calculated ratios the percentage of iron in the samples are c ac afe 60 fe2 c ac sfe 43 fe2 c ac nfe 28 fe2 which is consistent with the pka and the dissociation of the salts used during the impregnation process 3 2 identification and quantification of oh radicals in the heterogeneous phase fenton reaction in order to determine the effect of the iron precursor salt on the generation of oh radicals the identification and quantification of oh radicals was carried out using the carbon fe catalysts these studies were carried out following the methodology proposed by zárate guzmán et al 11 the experimental data obtained for each of the prepared catalysts materials are shown in fig 5 according to voelker 36 it has been considered that the generation of radicals oh follows a pseudo first order model described by eq 1 1 d oh dt k oh oh where k oh is the formation constant of radical oh expressed in min 1 oh is the concentration of radicals oh in μm and t is time expressed in s this model was fit to the experimental data fig 5 solid line and the kinetic parameters calculated for each of the catalysts are shown in table 3 for the prepared catalysts c ac afe and c ac sfe it was observed that the concentration of radicals obtained experimentally oh exp and the concentration of radicals calculated from the model oh calc had very close values showing the accuracy of the model nevertheless for the catalyst c ac nfe a significant difference between these values oh exp vs oh calc was found showing that the kinetics of radical formation is governed by a different process additionally the rate constants of oh radical generation k oh for the catalysts c ac afe and c ac sfe showed very similar values 0 0252 min 1 and 0 0299 min 1 respectively in both samples the kinetics followed a similar behavior during the first 120 min where a high rate of radicals oh generation was observed which is associated with the fact that the reaction is carried out using the iron readily accessible at the external surface of the carbon such as observed in the sem edx mappings after the first 120 min the experimental data began to achieve a constant value reaching an average maximum concentration of 2 46 μm g 1 and 53 8 μm g 1 respectively this due to the fact that coumarin responsible for the detection of the radicals oh starts to be in a lower concentration than required thus limiting the reaction in the case of the c ac nfe catalyst the kinetics of radical formation oh is much slower k oh 0 0005 min 1 and presents a different behavior in the reaction with c ac nfe catalyst the generation of radicals increases gradually without reaching a constant value this effect can be associated with the availability of iron on the surface of the material according to the characterization of the catalyst iron is found mostly within the porous structure of the carbon which implies that the generation of radicals oh will be governed by diffusion processes within the pore this was validated by relating the iron crystal size of each of the catalysts studied with the production of oh radicals the estimation of the average crystal size was made using the scherrer equation eq 2 2 τ kλ β cos θ where τ average crystal size nm k crystal shape factor 0 9 λ length wavelength of the radiation used λcu 1 5406 β width average of peak and θ diffraction angle fig 6 shows these results where the concentration of oh obtained for each catalyst is related to the average crystal size of fe supported onto the carbon surface for which was obtained a linear correlation with a coefficient r2 0 9406 of the catalysts evaluated c ac nfe had the lowest average iron particle size 6 3 nm and generate a lower concentration of oh radicals 18 9 μm in the heterogeneous reaction which is reasonably related to the results obtained by sem edx this effect is due to the fact that as having iron particles a smaller size the metal is more dispersed on the inside the pores and channels on the carbon surface hindering their interaction with the h2o2 due to mass transfer limitations resulting in a less efficient and slower radical generation rate oh an important fact to highlight is that for all samples the maximum concentration reached in the generation of radicals oh is proportional to the amount of fe2 present in the catalyst as shown in fig 5b in which the amount of fe2 obtained by xps was related to the maximum concentration of oh obtained for each catalyst therefore the process of generation of radicals in a heterogeneous fenton type process is due to the reaction between the ferrous ion fe2 present in the carbon fe catalyst surface and the hydrogen peroxide h2o2 in the water resulting in a change in the oxidation state of the iron fe2 in the catalyst similar to the reaction in homogeneous phase eq 3 3 carbon fe 2 h 2 o 2 carbon fe 3 oh oh 3 3 identification and quantification of oh radicals in the homogeneous phase fenton reaction in order to determine if the oh radicals generation previously evaluated is carried out exclusively by the iron supported onto the carbon surface or the iron leached to the water during the process the concentration of fe2 in solution was analyzed thus to determine the stability of the catalyst according the leaching of the metal fig 7 a shows the leaching kinetics of fe2 using carbon fe catalysts according to these results the maximum concentrations of leached iron were for each case c a c s fe 0 24 mg l 1 c ac afe 0 23 mg l 1 and c ac nfe 0 18 mg l 1 in addition it is important to note that the concentration of iron leached to the water during the heterogeneous fenton reaction does not exceed the wastewater limits established by the epa environmental protection agency and the actual european legislation which establish as maximum contaminant levels mcls a concentration of 2 mg l 1 of iron once the leaching kinetics were determined experiments were performed using the iron concentration obtained to evaluate the fenton reaction in homogeneous phase fig 7b shows the kinetics of oh generation for the fenton reaction in homogeneous phase considering the leached iron of the carbon fe catalysts this was fit to a pseudo first order model all the catalysts studied presented a similar behavior for this reaction at first follows an exponential behavior during 60 min then achieving a constant value because the catalyst present in solution begins to deplete the highest concentration of oh radical obtained according to the catalyst material used for the reaction were c ac afe 1 35 μm c ac nfe 0 73 μm and c ac sfe 3 12 μm the kinetic parameters obtained are shown in table 3 the radical generation constant oh k oh was similar for all test using the different prepared catalysts materials indicating that the kinetics in homogeneous fenton reaction is the same regardless of the type of iron salt used according to the information presented it is concluded that the generation of oh radicals using carbon fe catalysts is carried out through two processes i the fenton type reaction in heterogeneous phase using the iron attached to the carbon surface and ii the fenton reaction in homogeneous phase through the leached iron in solution the fenton type reaction in heterogeneous phase contributed to the total generation of oh radicals by 95 97 and 88 for the catalysts c ac afe c ac nfe and c ac sfe respectively the rest corresponds to the fenton reaction in homogeneous phase by 5 3 and 12 respectively 3 4 sulfamethoxazole smx degradation as a model pollutant the fenton type reaction in heterogeneous phase using the catalysts described above was evaluated in the degradation of sulfamethoxazole as model emerging pollutant the experimental data was fit to a first order kinetic model described by eq 4 4 d smx dt k smx smx where smx is the sulfamethoxazole concentration in mg l 1 ksmx is the degradation rate constant of sulfamethoxazole expressed in min 1 and t represents the reaction time in min fig 8 shows the smx degradation kinetics fit to the first order model for the three studied catalysts r 0 99 this kinetics data was compared with the generation of oh radicals described in the previous section for all the samples the degradation kinetics of smx showed an exponential decay for samples c ac afe and c ac sfe the concentration of smx reached a value of zero at 120 min this is directly related with the time to reach the maximum concentration of radicals oh for each of the catalysts used for the reaction however the sample c ac nfe presented a different behavior after 210 min of reaction the concentration of smx was maintained at a nearly constant value of 2 mgl 1 thus not being able to completely eliminate the smx molecule the fenton reaction in heterogeneous phase using this sample is associated with diffusion process restrictions therefore being the slower and less efficient degradation process of smx the degradation rate constants of the smx molecule ksmx were also obtained for each of the catalysts these values were compared with the oh radical generation constants for each catalyst fig 8 for samples c ac afe and c ac sfe similar kinetic constants were obtained ksmx 0 0262 min 1 vs koh 0 0252 min 1 and ksmx 0 0297 min 1 vs koh 0 0299 min 1 respectively this shows that both processes are carried out with the same rate the mechanism by which the contaminant degradation is achieved is still under discussion nevertheless three possible routes of degradation have been proposed the first is based on the hydroxylation of the isozaxol ring on the smx molecule this leads to the formation of two hydroxylated products c10h12n3o4 and c10h12n3o4s fig s2 the second route is based on the oxidation of the amino group in the benzene ring of smx this leads to the formation of nitro derivatives such as c10h8n3o5s which is capable of being hydroxylated to other degradation byproducts of lower molecular weight this process is followed by the breakdown of the isoxazole ring leading to the formation of simpler byproducts such as c6h4no5s fig s3 finally the proposed third degradation pathway is based on an attack through the sulfonamide bond sn and the cs bond of smx resulting in the formation of 4 aminobenzenesulfonic acid c5h8no3s and 5 methylisoxazole 3 sulfonamide acid c4h5n2o4s the subsequent oxidation of these molecules generates the breakdown of the benzene ring and isoxazole which leads to the formation of low molecular weight compounds such as alcohols aldehydes and carboxylic acids fig s4 in none of these proposed routes is achieved the mineralization of smx to co2 and water however according to ribeiro et al through the third route it is possible to obtain a mineralization rate in the order of 42 37 in the present work the removal of total organic carbon toc in the smx degradation test were 80 64 and 76 in the case of using c ac afe c ac nfe and c ac sfe respectively these results are higher than those mineralization percentages obtained by ribeiro et al therefore it is proposed that the degradation of smx follows the third proposed route since low molecular weight compounds such as alcohols aldehydes and carboxylic acids would provide a low concentration of toc 4 conclusions the amount and dispersion of fe2 on the carbon surface depends on the iron precursor salt used in the synthesis of catalyst material for heterogeneous fenton reaction being favored in the order c ac afe c ac sfe c ac nfe likewise it was observed that the use of iron nitrate favors the dispersion of the active phase at the carbon surface which results in higher stability but lower catalytic activity due to mass transfer limitations the fenton type reaction using carbon fe catalysts is composed of two processes i the reaction by the heterogeneous phase which contributes 97 to the total generation of oh radicals and ii the reaction in homogeneous phase which contributes 3 to the total generation of oh radicals sulfamethoxazole degradation studies by the carbon fe catalytic processes was obtained achieving a degradation rate of 98 at 120 min of reaction and 80 of mineralization up to co2 and water the kinetics of oh radical generation and smx degradation are similar demonstrating that both processes are simultaneously improved declaration of competing interest
