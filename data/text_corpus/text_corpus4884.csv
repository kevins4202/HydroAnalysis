24420,noise is a form of pollution resulting from the undeniable increase in industrialization worldwide consequently it is becoming increasingly important to understand the underlying mechanisms and potential effects of noise on ecosystems in this study we propose a deterministic mathematical model that uses a system of nonlinear non autonomous differential equations to describe the population dynamics of a single species exposed to noise the lombard effect is a phenomenon that involves increasing the intensity of acoustic signals in response to noise which can mask and degrade acoustic signals and prevent them from being recognized or discriminated by their target receivers however when the anthropogenic noise is chronic and critical i e that by its long duration and high intensity positively affects the mortality rate the increase in the intensity of acoustic signals due to the lombard effect only increases the chronic critical anthropogenic noise and also increase energetic behavioral and predation costs therefore the critical noise generated by the use of higher intensity acoustic signals due to the lombard effect together with the chronic critical anthropogenic noise negatively affect population survival we analyzed the persistence of the population and found that our results are consistent with the observed ecological data as they suggest that the maximum intensity level of critical chronic anthropogenic noise consequently by the lombard effect the maximum intensity of self generated acoustic signals must decrease to ensure population persistence however when the maximum intensity level of critical chronic anthropogenic noise is uncontrollable it is sufficient to reduce its mean intensity level to ensure persistence in the population mean furthermore decreasing the degree to which noise affects the population favors the survival of the species finally to validate our results we performed numerical simulations keywords mathematical modeling chronic critical anthropogenic noise acoustic signals lombard effect persistence extinction 1 introduction the soundscape is all the sounds existing in our environment and is composed of three types of sounds produced by three different sources anthropogenic biological and geophysical krause 2008 farina 2014 for instance sounds produced by anthropogenic sources such as cars airplanes and factories are called anthropophony mcgregor et al 2013 those produced by biological sources such as animal songs are called biophony pijanowski et al 2011a the sounds produced by any geophysical source such as sounds caused by rain or wind are called geophony pijanowski et al 2011b sounds that exceed acceptable thresholds so as not to interfere with communication between individuals or their activities relevant to their survival permissible sound intensity limit are called noises algers et al 1978 however although the permissible sound intensity limit is generally considered to be 90 db pienkowski and eggermont 2010 susceptibility to noise hearing depends on the species and has been shown to be genetically determined henry 1992 lanier et al 2000 for example annoyance thresholds for cattle have been observed between 90 and 100 db with physical damage to hearing at 110 db and above phillips 2009 and in birds annoyance thresholds have been observed between 95 and 100 db algers et al 1978 in particular noises produced by anthropogenic sources are considered to be anthropogenic noises moudon 2009 the world health organization the european commission marine strategy framework directive and international legislation such as the u s national environmental policy act state that anthropogenic noise is one of the most dangerous forms of pollution becoming omnipresent in terrestrial aerial and aquatic ecosystems simpson et al 2016 kunc and schmidt 2019 world health organization copenhagen 2011 thus anthropogenic noise acts as a sound that masks the acoustic signals of animals negatively affecting communication distribution and foraging slabbekoorn et al 2018 dooling et al 2009 erbe et al 2016 römer 2013 sueur and farina 2015 de vincenzi et al 2021 goldbogen et al 2013 goodwin and shriver 2011 hildebrand 2009 parris and schneider 2009 slabbekoorn and peet 2003 popper and hawkins 2016 however at the population level direct evidence of its effect on survival is rare this is because for example as animals move away from anthropogenic noise sources and their distance from the emitting source increases exposure levels lower and their effects are less severe richardson et al 2013 hawkins and popper 2017 however although these effects are less severe at the individual level the potential effects at the population or community level may increase because the number of exposed individuals also increases babisch 2002 the permissible sound intensity limit is critical when the effects of chronic anthropogenic noise now critical on mortality are negative correlating evidence suggests that naval sonar causes the stranding of beaked whales thus increasing their mortality filadelfo et al 2009 noise above 100 db from ships negatively affects predator avoidance behavior in damsel fish thus increasing their predation induced mortality simpson et al 2016 and negatively affecting the early survival of marine invertebrates by increasing the mortality of newly hatched larvae nedelec et al 2014 chronic noise above 65 db from traffic affects growth rates and embryo mortality in zebra finches potvin and macdougall shackleton 2015 therefore the effects of chronic anthropogenic noise on ecosystems are increasing as they tend to cause a decrease in species richness and population size kunc et al 2016 kight and swaddle 2011 on the other hand in response to increased ambient noise animals increase the intensity of their acoustic signals this phenomenon is known as the lombard effect lombard 1911 sinnott et al 1975 katti and warren 2004 the lombard effect in animals such as mammals fish and birds has been mostly limited to short term studies and suggests a positive effect on population survival this is because acoustic communication is often limited by the effects of noise which masks and degrades the acoustic signals thus by increasing the intensity of these signals the animals continue to be recognized or discriminated by their target receivers luo et al 2018 holt and johnston 2014 holt et al 2009 helble et al 2020 however when chronic anthropogenic noise is critical the use of higher intensity self generated acoustic signals not only increases the noise but also the energy costs of signaling brackenbury 1979 calder iii 1990 oberweger and goller 2001 warren et al 2006 barber et al 2010 read et al 2014 brown et al 2021 such increases in intensity are also linked to behavioral costs swaddle et al 2015 farina and gage 2017 moreover other factors such as detection by unwanted receptors e g predators also contribute to the cost of intensity increase zollinger and brumm 2015 brumm and todt 2002 brumm 2004 luczkovich et al 2016 therefore in the exposure to critical chronic anthropogenic noise the increase in the intensity of acoustic signals as a result of the lombard effect could negatively influence survival rates of animals sementili cardoso and donatelli 2021 existing mathematical models that study noise as an important factor in population dynamics consider noise a stochastic factor vilar and solé 1998 spagnolo et al 2003 upadhyay et al 2007 das and samanta 2018 however these models do not consider the thought that when noise exceeds a permissible limit the use of higher intensity of acoustic signals due to the lombard effect increases energetic behavioral and predation costs which could negatively influence the persistence of animals in noisy environments to our knowledge there is no literature on deterministic mathematical models describing the negative effects of anthropogenic noise and the lombard effect on the population dynamics of a species this paper presents a new deterministic mathematical model consisting of a system of nonlinear non autonomous differential equations to describe the population dynamics of a single species exposed to chronic noise we assume that the chronic noise is critical that is it exceeds a critical permissible sound intensity limit the limit up to which the noise does not affect the population mortality rate in the model noise is generated by a chronic and critical anthropogenic noise source and in response due to the lombard effect a biological source that emits acoustic signals of increased intensity by conspecifics thus increasing energetic behavioral and predation costs that in the long term negatively affect population survival population density is negative related to the noise intensity to which the population is exposed through a mortality rate response equation with respect to noise filadelfo et al 2009 simpson et al 2016 nedelec et al 2014 potvin and macdougall shackleton 2015 sinnott et al 1975 katti and warren 2004 oberweger and goller 2001 therefore this study aimed to analyze the effects of noise on the population persistence of a single species experiencing the lombard effect more specifically we tried to answer the following question what are the sufficient conditions for the model parameters to guarantee the persistence of the population when exposed to noise our results are discussed together with ecological data suggesting that the maximum intensity level of critical chronic anthropogenic noise consequently by the lombard effect the maximum intensity of self generated acoustic signals must decrease to ensure population persistence however when the maximum intensity level of critical chronic anthropogenic noise is uncontrollable it is sufficient to reduce its mean intensity level to ensure persistence in the population mean furthermore decreasing the degree to which noise affects the population favors the survival of the species finally to validate our results we performed numerical simulations 2 model formulation we considered a population of biological species in which the mortality rate is positively affected by noise individual organisms in the population were assumed to be identical and uniformly distributed in their habitats the state variables of the model are non negative functions of time n t and i t denoting the population size and chronic noise intensity to which the population is exposed at time t respectively 2 1 population growth considering the positive constants b 0 b 1 d 0 and d 1 b 0 d 0 b n b 0 b 1 n and d n d 0 d 1 n are thought to be the linear representations for abundance of the respective population birth and death rates then in the absence of noise or when the noise has not reached or has still not reached a certain threshold n follows the classical logistic equation n r 0 λ n n for t 0 where r 0 b 0 d 0 0 is the intrinsic growth rate and λ b 1 d 1 represents the per capita loss of growth due to intraspecific competition we assume that the critical limit of permissible noise intensity is i μ a limit up to which the noise does not affect the mortality rate of the population thus when i i μ the population follows classical logistic growth implicitly this is explained by the positive effect of the lombard effect that is the population increases the intensity of its songs to maintain a constant signal to noise ratio otherwise when i i μ called critical noise which from now on we will simply call now noise implicitly this is the noise has a positive effect on mortality rate thus increase in the intensity of acoustic signals due to the lombard effect only increases the chronic critical anthropogenic noise and also increase energetic behavioral and predation costs therefore the noise generated by the use of higher intensity acoustic signals due to the lombard effect together with the chronic critical anthropogenic noise negatively affect population survival thus the noise intensity experienced by the population increases the per capita mortality rate proportionally to the noise by an amount d 0 for each unit of noise i e d n i d n d i thus the new per capita growth rate as a function of noise and population size is r n i b n d n i r 0 d i λ n which explicitly depends linearly on i therefore the population dynamics of this phenomenon can be described by the following equation of logistic type 1 n t r n i n r 0 d χ i i μ i λ n n where the function χ r 0 1 is defined as χ i i μ 0 when i i μ and χ i i μ 1 when i i μ with the new intrinsic growth rate given by r 0 d i 2 2 noise intensity sound intensity can be classified into physical or exposed and auditory or perceived intensities the physical intensity measured in watts per square meter w m 2 is given by the equation i p a where p denotes the transmitted power per unit area a perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the acoustic wave at a point in the acoustic field auditory intensity measured in dimensionless decibels d b is given by the equation l 10 log i i where i denotes the minimum physical intensity audible to an individual this last equation is based on the weber fechner psychophysical law dehaene 2003 which establishes a logarithmic relationship between the physical intensity of sound i and the minimum physical intensity audible to individual i auditory intensity is the most common method to measure sound however unlike physical intensity the sum of the decibels does not occur in a linear manner for example the sum of decibels l 1 and l 2 is given by l 1 l 2 10 log 1 0 l 1 10 1 0 l 2 10 for this reason in this article we considered our state variable i as the measured physical intensity and called it intensity 2 3 the lombard effect previous research has shown that in several species of birds mammals and fish the intensity of their acoustic signals may increase in response to increased ambient noise to compensate for the masking of acoustic signals by this noise brackenbury 1979 calder iii 1990 oberweger and goller 2001 warren et al 2006 barber et al 2010 read et al 2014 brown et al 2021 thus according to the lombard effect the intensity of an individual s song increases as the intensity of noise increases however owing to physiological limitations the song intensity is limited therefore the function intensity of the song emitted by a conspecific per unit time in response to an environmental intensity i denoted by β i must be positive increasing and bounded in mathematical terms 2 β i 0 β i 0 i 0 and β sup i 0 β 0 2 4 noise intensity variation given an instant t and a time variation of δ t to calculate the variation in the noise intensity δ i i t δ t i t at the extremes of the time interval t t δ t it should be noted that the noise intensity a increases with a 1 the noise intensity α f t emitted by an anthropogenic source the function f t represents the noise intensity measured in situ per unit time and is assumed to be bounded by sup t 0 f t f the adimensional parameter α 0 is negatively correlated with the distance average of the population to the source a 2 the higher intensity acoustic signals β i n emitted by the biological source that is by the total song or population song that is the sum of the songs of conspecifics b decreases with the different atmospheric attenuation mechanisms γ i where γ 0 is the attenuation coefficient per unit time thus the following noise intensity balance equation is obtained 3 i t δ t i t α f t δ t β i n t δ t γ i t δ t considering δ i δ t when δ t 0 we obtain 4 i t α f t β i t n t γ i t 2 5 differential model therefore a mathematical model describing the dynamics of the abundance of a species exposed to noise emitted by an anthropogenic source and the self generated biological species is formulated by the following system of differential equations 5 n r 0 d χ i i μ i λ n n i α f t β i n γ i defined in the time interval 0 with positive initial conditions given by n 0 n 0 0 and i 0 i 0 0 the definitions and units of the variables and parameters of model 5 are summarized in table 1 3 model analysis and results this section introduces some of the necessary notations and definitions we then show that model 5 behaves well namely given an initial state it determines a unique positive and bounded trajectory finally we present the main results of this research which characterize the dynamic behavior of the population size by parametric conditions note that the right hand side of model 5 is discontinuous thus admitting a solution analysis in a carathéodory sense in the intervals where i i μ the first equation of model 5 becomes the well known logistic equation the logistic equation has a unique positive and bounded solution and the population persists if r 0 0 then interesting dynamics occur in the intervals where the population experiences noise that is when i i μ in this study we focused only on the case in which the population always experiences noise for this we set i μ inf i so that χ 1 for all t 0 3 1 notations and definitions given a real valued function x defined over a domain 0 we denoted simplicity x t as its average over the interval 0 t in other words 6 x t 1 t 0 t x s d s t 0 definition given a population and a corresponding abundance function n defined in 0 we say that the population is persistent if there exist constants α 1 0 y α 2 0 such that 0 α 1 lim inf t n t lim sup t n t α 2 mean persistent if there is a constant m 0 such that 0 lim sup t n t m moving towards extinction if lim t n t 0 note that it follows from these definitions and rule of l hospital s that for a given population persistence implies persistence at the mean 3 2 uniqueness positivity and boundedness as we are concerned about a biological phenomenon we must consider certain regularities in the solution of the ode system given by 5 such as uniqueness positivity and boundedness in the following theorem we prove the existence of a solution that satisfies these regularity parameters theorem 3 1 given the constants n 0 0 and i 0 0 for the ode system given by 5 there exists a solution n i such that n 0 i 0 n 0 i 0 which is a unique b positive and c bounded proof a as for χ 1 with t 0 the right hand side of model 5 is completely continuous and locally lipschitzian there is a unique solution n i defined on 0 a where 0 a see hale and lunel 2013 b for n 0 0 from the first equation of model 5 we have 7 n t n 0 exp 0 t r 0 d i s λ n s d s 0 t 0 below we show that i t 0 for t 0 by contradiction suppose there exists a first instant τ 0 a in which i τ 0 and the differentiability forces i τ 0 however the existence of such a case is contradicted by the second equation of model 5 as i τ α f τ β 0 n τ 0 therefore i t 0 for t 0 c from the first equation of model 5 we have n t r 0 λ n t n t subsequently using the comparison principle we obtain lim sup t n t r 0 λ however from the second equation of the model i t α f β n γ i then by the principle of comparison we obtain 8 lim sup t i t λ f λ β where λ f α f γ represents the equilibrium at which the anthropogenic noise intensity stabilizes if there is a source emitting at the top f and no population is present similarly λ β β r 0 λ γ is the equilibrium biological sound intensity resulting from population singing in the absence of an anthropogenic noise source but with the population at its carrying capacity permanently singing at maximum capacity β 3 3 persistence and extinction we now present the most important results of this research sufficient conditions were provided to test the model parameters for population survival theorem 3 2 if 0 f r 0 α γ d β λ then β γ λ d and the population persists proof from in eq 8 we have that for any ɛ 0 there exists t 0 0 such that i t λ f λ β ɛ for t t 0 then from the first equation of model 5 we obtain n r 0 d λ f λ β ɛ λ n n t t 0 from this hypothesis we obtain l r 0 d λ f λ β 0 we can choose ɛ small enough such that l d ɛ l 0 for a certain positive l that exists for the density of real numbers thus n l λ n n then by a principle of comparison we obtain 9 lim inf t n t l λ the results of theorem 3 2 indicate that it is easier for the population to survive with a lesser degree of noise affectation d higher growth rates r 0 and noise attenuation γ are more useful for population survival when f r 0 α γ d β λ the conclusions of the following theorem provide sufficient conditions that guarantee persistence at the mean and in the worst case extinction of the population theorem 3 3 a if lim inf t f t r 0 γ α d the population persists at its mean b if lim inf t f t r 0 γ α d the population will become extinct proof a if what is stated in theorem 3 3 is false that is lim sup t n t 0 it is concluded that lim t n t 0 this results in a contradiction first we proved that lim inf t i t r 0 d integrating the second equation in model 5 over 0 t t 0 we can rewrite 10 i t i 0 t α f t β i n t γ i t as β is bounded lim t β i n t 0 then applying the lower limit to both sides in eq 10 we obtain 11 lim inf t f t γ α lim inf t i t therefore lim inf t i t r 0 d is an immediate consequence of the hypothesis of the theorem dividing the first equation in model 5 by n t and integrating over 0 t t 0 we obtain 12 ln n t n 0 r 0 t d 0 t i s d s λ 0 t n s d s which when rearranging and dividing by t we have 13 1 t ln n t n 0 λ n t r 0 d i t then taking the upper limit on both sides of eq 13 and recalling that n t 0 we obtain 14 lim sup t 1 t ln n t n 0 r 0 lim sup t d i t r 0 d lim inf t i t furthermore we know that lim inf t i t r 0 d and thus we have 15 lim sup t 1 t ln n t n 0 0 which is a contradiction because n is bounded therefore the conclusion of this theorem is valid b when by contradiction we assume that the population will not go extinct that is lim inf t n t 0 we can rewrite second equation of the model 5 as 16 i t γ 1 α f t β i n t i t i 0 t then replacing eq 16 in eq 13 we obtain 17 1 t ln n t n 0 λ n t r 0 d γ 1 α f t β i n t i t i 0 t and thus we obtain 18 d α f t r 0 γ γ t ln n t n 0 γ λ n t d β i n t d i t i 0 t using the lower limit in eq 18 we obtain lim inf t f t r 0 γ α d which is a contradiction the conclusions of theorem 3 3 show that the lower limit of the anthropogenic noise intensity level must be lower than the r 0 γ α d value to maintain persistence at the population mean if the attenuation of anthropogenic noise is low i e α is larger and the degree to which noise affects population d is large the above value tends to decrease as the intrinsic growth rate r 0 and noise attenuation γ increase the level of anthropogenic noise that the population can withstand increases the following is an example of analyzing the survival of a population exposed to constant anthropogenic noise emission example 1 we suppose that the anthropogenic noise intensity is represented by the constant function f t f 0 0 and the biological sound intensity is represented by β i β i i 1 β 0 model 5 has two equilibrium points e 1 n i with n 0 i 0 and e 2 0 α f 0 γ whose stability analysis leads to the persistence and extinction of the population respectively note that n 0 and i 0 satisfy n γ i α f 0 i 1 β i and i r 0 λ n d the jacobian matrix of model 5 in n i is given by 19 j n i r 0 d i d n β i β i i n γ and characteristic polynomial is given by 20 p δ δ 2 s δ p where s r 0 d i β i i n γ p r 0 d i β i i n γ β i d n then the hurwitz matrix of polynomial 20 is 21 h n i s 0 1 p applying the hurwitz criterion barnett and cameron 1975 we find that polynomial 20 has roots with a negative real part only if s 0 and p 0 that is equilibrium point e 1 is asymptotically stable if i r 0 d analogously we find that equilibrium point e 2 is asymptotically stable if i r 0 d these results are consistent with theorems 3 2 and 3 3 in summary we have if f 0 r 0 γ α d then the population persists if f 0 r 0 γ α d then the population goes to extinct the previous result can be observed in fig 1 by analyzing the intersection between the isoclines n 1 i r 0 d i λ n 2 i γ i α f 0 i 1 β i n 3 i 0 and the change in the sign of the rates of change in the population density and the level of noise intensity experienced by the population 4 numerical simulations in this section we present numerical simulations to corroborate the results obtained in theorems 3 2 and 3 3 the results can be illustrated as follows if the population growth rate and noise attenuation can increase or the degree to which the population is affected by noise is smaller the population will persist otherwise the population will die out when the values of the following parameters are r 0 1 λ 0 5 α 0 3 and γ 0 4 then model 5 will be considered with initial conditions n 0 1 and i 0 0 1 so that it becomes n 1 d i 0 5 n n i 0 3 f t β i n 0 4 i fig 2 shows the evolution of the dynamics of population density and the level of noise intensity experienced by the population over time 5 discussion there is evidence that chronic exposure to noise can cause changes in the mortality rates of a population causing that the effects of noise over time can negatively affect the persistence and extinction of a population sementili cardoso and donatelli 2021 babisch 2002 filadelfo et al 2009 nedelec et al 2014 potvin and macdougall shackleton 2015 jaeger et al 2005 reijnen et al 1996 in the current research we modeled these changes by considering the population mortality rate to be a function of the population size and the intensity of the noise to which the population is exposed our results are consistent with observations that a lower level of anthropogenic noise intensity is favorable for population survival farina 2014 pijanowski et al 2011a slabbekoorn et al 2018 kunc et al 2016 kight and swaddle 2011 de vincenzi et al 2021 goldbogen et al 2013 hildebrand 2009 likewise although the lombard effect is known to be beneficial in that important acoustic signals are not masked by noise when noise exceeds the permissible limit a limit up to which noise has no effect on the population observations indicate that the use of higher intensity acoustic signals increases energetic behavioral and predation costs which could result in lower ecological fitness influencing animal survival rates in noisy environments brackenbury 1979 calder iii 1990 oberweger and goller 2001 warren et al 2006 barber et al 2010 read et al 2014 brown et al 2021 swaddle et al 2015 farina and gage 2017 zollinger and brumm 2015 brumm and todt 2002 brumm 2004 luczkovich et al 2016 sementili cardoso and donatelli 2021 in other words from theorem 3 2 if an effort is made to reduce the intensity level of anthropogenic noise f and the maximum intensity level of acoustic signals emitted by conspecifics β which otherwise increases with respect to noise due to the lombard effect then the population will persist however according to theorem 3 3 a for the persistence of the population to remain at the mean it is sufficient to reduce the anthropogenic noise intensity level because the maximum intensity level of the acoustic signals generated by the population does not have a significant impact on the mean population persistence in particular when the degree to which noise affects the population d is lower persistence and mean persistence are benefitted see figs 2 b and 2 c conversely theorem 3 3 b indicates that when intensity of anthropogenic noise is high or the degree to which noise affects the population is greater the population goes to extinction see fig 2 d population extinction can also be understood as the displacement or migration of a population away from an anthropogenic noise source parameter d which indicates the degree to which noise affects the population can be understood to have a negative correlation with the degree of noise adaptation therefore some species show a considerable degree of adaptation to noisy environments for example invertebrates show evidence that they are capable of evolutionary adaptation and behavioral plasticity in response to noise sources morley et al 2014 in addition animal song plasticity facilitates vocal adjustments that contribute to reduced noise masking fernandez juricic 2001 brumm 2004 rheindt 2003 these adjustments may be the outcome of physiological adaptations such as those present in some fish that exhibit adaptations that convey sensitivity to sound pressure in fish these adaptations include having a gas bubble or swim bladder that is close to or connected to the ear schulz mirbach et al 2012 for instance the swim bladder of the atlantic cod gadus morhua is located near the ear and when filled with gas the organism s sensitivity to sound pressure is reduced sand et al 1973 however as the mechanisms of adaptation to noise are unique for each species the manipulation of the parameter d is uncontrollable therefore the best way to mitigate the effects of noise on a population is to control the level of noise intensity of the anthropogenic source in conclusion our model responds to growing concerns about the possible effects of noise at the population level we believe that our research will motivate other researchers to consider the effects of biological sounds and the lombard effect on population persistence note that we only analyzed the long term effects of noise on population density however even in the short term the population is exposed to noise which can have behavioral or physiological effects on the individuals of a population to evaluate this controlled experiments are required to measure the parameters that appear during noise exposure credit

24420,noise is a form of pollution resulting from the undeniable increase in industrialization worldwide consequently it is becoming increasingly important to understand the underlying mechanisms and potential effects of noise on ecosystems in this study we propose a deterministic mathematical model that uses a system of nonlinear non autonomous differential equations to describe the population dynamics of a single species exposed to noise the lombard effect is a phenomenon that involves increasing the intensity of acoustic signals in response to noise which can mask and degrade acoustic signals and prevent them from being recognized or discriminated by their target receivers however when the anthropogenic noise is chronic and critical i e that by its long duration and high intensity positively affects the mortality rate the increase in the intensity of acoustic signals due to the lombard effect only increases the chronic critical anthropogenic noise and also increase energetic behavioral and predation costs therefore the critical noise generated by the use of higher intensity acoustic signals due to the lombard effect together with the chronic critical anthropogenic noise negatively affect population survival we analyzed the persistence of the population and found that our results are consistent with the observed ecological data as they suggest that the maximum intensity level of critical chronic anthropogenic noise consequently by the lombard effect the maximum intensity of self generated acoustic signals must decrease to ensure population persistence however when the maximum intensity level of critical chronic anthropogenic noise is uncontrollable it is sufficient to reduce its mean intensity level to ensure persistence in the population mean furthermore decreasing the degree to which noise affects the population favors the survival of the species finally to validate our results we performed numerical simulations keywords mathematical modeling chronic critical anthropogenic noise acoustic signals lombard effect persistence extinction 1 introduction the soundscape is all the sounds existing in our environment and is composed of three types of sounds produced by three different sources anthropogenic biological and geophysical krause 2008 farina 2014 for instance sounds produced by anthropogenic sources such as cars airplanes and factories are called anthropophony mcgregor et al 2013 those produced by biological sources such as animal songs are called biophony pijanowski et al 2011a the sounds produced by any geophysical source such as sounds caused by rain or wind are called geophony pijanowski et al 2011b sounds that exceed acceptable thresholds so as not to interfere with communication between individuals or their activities relevant to their survival permissible sound intensity limit are called noises algers et al 1978 however although the permissible sound intensity limit is generally considered to be 90 db pienkowski and eggermont 2010 susceptibility to noise hearing depends on the species and has been shown to be genetically determined henry 1992 lanier et al 2000 for example annoyance thresholds for cattle have been observed between 90 and 100 db with physical damage to hearing at 110 db and above phillips 2009 and in birds annoyance thresholds have been observed between 95 and 100 db algers et al 1978 in particular noises produced by anthropogenic sources are considered to be anthropogenic noises moudon 2009 the world health organization the european commission marine strategy framework directive and international legislation such as the u s national environmental policy act state that anthropogenic noise is one of the most dangerous forms of pollution becoming omnipresent in terrestrial aerial and aquatic ecosystems simpson et al 2016 kunc and schmidt 2019 world health organization copenhagen 2011 thus anthropogenic noise acts as a sound that masks the acoustic signals of animals negatively affecting communication distribution and foraging slabbekoorn et al 2018 dooling et al 2009 erbe et al 2016 römer 2013 sueur and farina 2015 de vincenzi et al 2021 goldbogen et al 2013 goodwin and shriver 2011 hildebrand 2009 parris and schneider 2009 slabbekoorn and peet 2003 popper and hawkins 2016 however at the population level direct evidence of its effect on survival is rare this is because for example as animals move away from anthropogenic noise sources and their distance from the emitting source increases exposure levels lower and their effects are less severe richardson et al 2013 hawkins and popper 2017 however although these effects are less severe at the individual level the potential effects at the population or community level may increase because the number of exposed individuals also increases babisch 2002 the permissible sound intensity limit is critical when the effects of chronic anthropogenic noise now critical on mortality are negative correlating evidence suggests that naval sonar causes the stranding of beaked whales thus increasing their mortality filadelfo et al 2009 noise above 100 db from ships negatively affects predator avoidance behavior in damsel fish thus increasing their predation induced mortality simpson et al 2016 and negatively affecting the early survival of marine invertebrates by increasing the mortality of newly hatched larvae nedelec et al 2014 chronic noise above 65 db from traffic affects growth rates and embryo mortality in zebra finches potvin and macdougall shackleton 2015 therefore the effects of chronic anthropogenic noise on ecosystems are increasing as they tend to cause a decrease in species richness and population size kunc et al 2016 kight and swaddle 2011 on the other hand in response to increased ambient noise animals increase the intensity of their acoustic signals this phenomenon is known as the lombard effect lombard 1911 sinnott et al 1975 katti and warren 2004 the lombard effect in animals such as mammals fish and birds has been mostly limited to short term studies and suggests a positive effect on population survival this is because acoustic communication is often limited by the effects of noise which masks and degrades the acoustic signals thus by increasing the intensity of these signals the animals continue to be recognized or discriminated by their target receivers luo et al 2018 holt and johnston 2014 holt et al 2009 helble et al 2020 however when chronic anthropogenic noise is critical the use of higher intensity self generated acoustic signals not only increases the noise but also the energy costs of signaling brackenbury 1979 calder iii 1990 oberweger and goller 2001 warren et al 2006 barber et al 2010 read et al 2014 brown et al 2021 such increases in intensity are also linked to behavioral costs swaddle et al 2015 farina and gage 2017 moreover other factors such as detection by unwanted receptors e g predators also contribute to the cost of intensity increase zollinger and brumm 2015 brumm and todt 2002 brumm 2004 luczkovich et al 2016 therefore in the exposure to critical chronic anthropogenic noise the increase in the intensity of acoustic signals as a result of the lombard effect could negatively influence survival rates of animals sementili cardoso and donatelli 2021 existing mathematical models that study noise as an important factor in population dynamics consider noise a stochastic factor vilar and solé 1998 spagnolo et al 2003 upadhyay et al 2007 das and samanta 2018 however these models do not consider the thought that when noise exceeds a permissible limit the use of higher intensity of acoustic signals due to the lombard effect increases energetic behavioral and predation costs which could negatively influence the persistence of animals in noisy environments to our knowledge there is no literature on deterministic mathematical models describing the negative effects of anthropogenic noise and the lombard effect on the population dynamics of a species this paper presents a new deterministic mathematical model consisting of a system of nonlinear non autonomous differential equations to describe the population dynamics of a single species exposed to chronic noise we assume that the chronic noise is critical that is it exceeds a critical permissible sound intensity limit the limit up to which the noise does not affect the population mortality rate in the model noise is generated by a chronic and critical anthropogenic noise source and in response due to the lombard effect a biological source that emits acoustic signals of increased intensity by conspecifics thus increasing energetic behavioral and predation costs that in the long term negatively affect population survival population density is negative related to the noise intensity to which the population is exposed through a mortality rate response equation with respect to noise filadelfo et al 2009 simpson et al 2016 nedelec et al 2014 potvin and macdougall shackleton 2015 sinnott et al 1975 katti and warren 2004 oberweger and goller 2001 therefore this study aimed to analyze the effects of noise on the population persistence of a single species experiencing the lombard effect more specifically we tried to answer the following question what are the sufficient conditions for the model parameters to guarantee the persistence of the population when exposed to noise our results are discussed together with ecological data suggesting that the maximum intensity level of critical chronic anthropogenic noise consequently by the lombard effect the maximum intensity of self generated acoustic signals must decrease to ensure population persistence however when the maximum intensity level of critical chronic anthropogenic noise is uncontrollable it is sufficient to reduce its mean intensity level to ensure persistence in the population mean furthermore decreasing the degree to which noise affects the population favors the survival of the species finally to validate our results we performed numerical simulations 2 model formulation we considered a population of biological species in which the mortality rate is positively affected by noise individual organisms in the population were assumed to be identical and uniformly distributed in their habitats the state variables of the model are non negative functions of time n t and i t denoting the population size and chronic noise intensity to which the population is exposed at time t respectively 2 1 population growth considering the positive constants b 0 b 1 d 0 and d 1 b 0 d 0 b n b 0 b 1 n and d n d 0 d 1 n are thought to be the linear representations for abundance of the respective population birth and death rates then in the absence of noise or when the noise has not reached or has still not reached a certain threshold n follows the classical logistic equation n r 0 λ n n for t 0 where r 0 b 0 d 0 0 is the intrinsic growth rate and λ b 1 d 1 represents the per capita loss of growth due to intraspecific competition we assume that the critical limit of permissible noise intensity is i μ a limit up to which the noise does not affect the mortality rate of the population thus when i i μ the population follows classical logistic growth implicitly this is explained by the positive effect of the lombard effect that is the population increases the intensity of its songs to maintain a constant signal to noise ratio otherwise when i i μ called critical noise which from now on we will simply call now noise implicitly this is the noise has a positive effect on mortality rate thus increase in the intensity of acoustic signals due to the lombard effect only increases the chronic critical anthropogenic noise and also increase energetic behavioral and predation costs therefore the noise generated by the use of higher intensity acoustic signals due to the lombard effect together with the chronic critical anthropogenic noise negatively affect population survival thus the noise intensity experienced by the population increases the per capita mortality rate proportionally to the noise by an amount d 0 for each unit of noise i e d n i d n d i thus the new per capita growth rate as a function of noise and population size is r n i b n d n i r 0 d i λ n which explicitly depends linearly on i therefore the population dynamics of this phenomenon can be described by the following equation of logistic type 1 n t r n i n r 0 d χ i i μ i λ n n where the function χ r 0 1 is defined as χ i i μ 0 when i i μ and χ i i μ 1 when i i μ with the new intrinsic growth rate given by r 0 d i 2 2 noise intensity sound intensity can be classified into physical or exposed and auditory or perceived intensities the physical intensity measured in watts per square meter w m 2 is given by the equation i p a where p denotes the transmitted power per unit area a perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the acoustic wave at a point in the acoustic field auditory intensity measured in dimensionless decibels d b is given by the equation l 10 log i i where i denotes the minimum physical intensity audible to an individual this last equation is based on the weber fechner psychophysical law dehaene 2003 which establishes a logarithmic relationship between the physical intensity of sound i and the minimum physical intensity audible to individual i auditory intensity is the most common method to measure sound however unlike physical intensity the sum of the decibels does not occur in a linear manner for example the sum of decibels l 1 and l 2 is given by l 1 l 2 10 log 1 0 l 1 10 1 0 l 2 10 for this reason in this article we considered our state variable i as the measured physical intensity and called it intensity 2 3 the lombard effect previous research has shown that in several species of birds mammals and fish the intensity of their acoustic signals may increase in response to increased ambient noise to compensate for the masking of acoustic signals by this noise brackenbury 1979 calder iii 1990 oberweger and goller 2001 warren et al 2006 barber et al 2010 read et al 2014 brown et al 2021 thus according to the lombard effect the intensity of an individual s song increases as the intensity of noise increases however owing to physiological limitations the song intensity is limited therefore the function intensity of the song emitted by a conspecific per unit time in response to an environmental intensity i denoted by β i must be positive increasing and bounded in mathematical terms 2 β i 0 β i 0 i 0 and β sup i 0 β 0 2 4 noise intensity variation given an instant t and a time variation of δ t to calculate the variation in the noise intensity δ i i t δ t i t at the extremes of the time interval t t δ t it should be noted that the noise intensity a increases with a 1 the noise intensity α f t emitted by an anthropogenic source the function f t represents the noise intensity measured in situ per unit time and is assumed to be bounded by sup t 0 f t f the adimensional parameter α 0 is negatively correlated with the distance average of the population to the source a 2 the higher intensity acoustic signals β i n emitted by the biological source that is by the total song or population song that is the sum of the songs of conspecifics b decreases with the different atmospheric attenuation mechanisms γ i where γ 0 is the attenuation coefficient per unit time thus the following noise intensity balance equation is obtained 3 i t δ t i t α f t δ t β i n t δ t γ i t δ t considering δ i δ t when δ t 0 we obtain 4 i t α f t β i t n t γ i t 2 5 differential model therefore a mathematical model describing the dynamics of the abundance of a species exposed to noise emitted by an anthropogenic source and the self generated biological species is formulated by the following system of differential equations 5 n r 0 d χ i i μ i λ n n i α f t β i n γ i defined in the time interval 0 with positive initial conditions given by n 0 n 0 0 and i 0 i 0 0 the definitions and units of the variables and parameters of model 5 are summarized in table 1 3 model analysis and results this section introduces some of the necessary notations and definitions we then show that model 5 behaves well namely given an initial state it determines a unique positive and bounded trajectory finally we present the main results of this research which characterize the dynamic behavior of the population size by parametric conditions note that the right hand side of model 5 is discontinuous thus admitting a solution analysis in a carathéodory sense in the intervals where i i μ the first equation of model 5 becomes the well known logistic equation the logistic equation has a unique positive and bounded solution and the population persists if r 0 0 then interesting dynamics occur in the intervals where the population experiences noise that is when i i μ in this study we focused only on the case in which the population always experiences noise for this we set i μ inf i so that χ 1 for all t 0 3 1 notations and definitions given a real valued function x defined over a domain 0 we denoted simplicity x t as its average over the interval 0 t in other words 6 x t 1 t 0 t x s d s t 0 definition given a population and a corresponding abundance function n defined in 0 we say that the population is persistent if there exist constants α 1 0 y α 2 0 such that 0 α 1 lim inf t n t lim sup t n t α 2 mean persistent if there is a constant m 0 such that 0 lim sup t n t m moving towards extinction if lim t n t 0 note that it follows from these definitions and rule of l hospital s that for a given population persistence implies persistence at the mean 3 2 uniqueness positivity and boundedness as we are concerned about a biological phenomenon we must consider certain regularities in the solution of the ode system given by 5 such as uniqueness positivity and boundedness in the following theorem we prove the existence of a solution that satisfies these regularity parameters theorem 3 1 given the constants n 0 0 and i 0 0 for the ode system given by 5 there exists a solution n i such that n 0 i 0 n 0 i 0 which is a unique b positive and c bounded proof a as for χ 1 with t 0 the right hand side of model 5 is completely continuous and locally lipschitzian there is a unique solution n i defined on 0 a where 0 a see hale and lunel 2013 b for n 0 0 from the first equation of model 5 we have 7 n t n 0 exp 0 t r 0 d i s λ n s d s 0 t 0 below we show that i t 0 for t 0 by contradiction suppose there exists a first instant τ 0 a in which i τ 0 and the differentiability forces i τ 0 however the existence of such a case is contradicted by the second equation of model 5 as i τ α f τ β 0 n τ 0 therefore i t 0 for t 0 c from the first equation of model 5 we have n t r 0 λ n t n t subsequently using the comparison principle we obtain lim sup t n t r 0 λ however from the second equation of the model i t α f β n γ i then by the principle of comparison we obtain 8 lim sup t i t λ f λ β where λ f α f γ represents the equilibrium at which the anthropogenic noise intensity stabilizes if there is a source emitting at the top f and no population is present similarly λ β β r 0 λ γ is the equilibrium biological sound intensity resulting from population singing in the absence of an anthropogenic noise source but with the population at its carrying capacity permanently singing at maximum capacity β 3 3 persistence and extinction we now present the most important results of this research sufficient conditions were provided to test the model parameters for population survival theorem 3 2 if 0 f r 0 α γ d β λ then β γ λ d and the population persists proof from in eq 8 we have that for any ɛ 0 there exists t 0 0 such that i t λ f λ β ɛ for t t 0 then from the first equation of model 5 we obtain n r 0 d λ f λ β ɛ λ n n t t 0 from this hypothesis we obtain l r 0 d λ f λ β 0 we can choose ɛ small enough such that l d ɛ l 0 for a certain positive l that exists for the density of real numbers thus n l λ n n then by a principle of comparison we obtain 9 lim inf t n t l λ the results of theorem 3 2 indicate that it is easier for the population to survive with a lesser degree of noise affectation d higher growth rates r 0 and noise attenuation γ are more useful for population survival when f r 0 α γ d β λ the conclusions of the following theorem provide sufficient conditions that guarantee persistence at the mean and in the worst case extinction of the population theorem 3 3 a if lim inf t f t r 0 γ α d the population persists at its mean b if lim inf t f t r 0 γ α d the population will become extinct proof a if what is stated in theorem 3 3 is false that is lim sup t n t 0 it is concluded that lim t n t 0 this results in a contradiction first we proved that lim inf t i t r 0 d integrating the second equation in model 5 over 0 t t 0 we can rewrite 10 i t i 0 t α f t β i n t γ i t as β is bounded lim t β i n t 0 then applying the lower limit to both sides in eq 10 we obtain 11 lim inf t f t γ α lim inf t i t therefore lim inf t i t r 0 d is an immediate consequence of the hypothesis of the theorem dividing the first equation in model 5 by n t and integrating over 0 t t 0 we obtain 12 ln n t n 0 r 0 t d 0 t i s d s λ 0 t n s d s which when rearranging and dividing by t we have 13 1 t ln n t n 0 λ n t r 0 d i t then taking the upper limit on both sides of eq 13 and recalling that n t 0 we obtain 14 lim sup t 1 t ln n t n 0 r 0 lim sup t d i t r 0 d lim inf t i t furthermore we know that lim inf t i t r 0 d and thus we have 15 lim sup t 1 t ln n t n 0 0 which is a contradiction because n is bounded therefore the conclusion of this theorem is valid b when by contradiction we assume that the population will not go extinct that is lim inf t n t 0 we can rewrite second equation of the model 5 as 16 i t γ 1 α f t β i n t i t i 0 t then replacing eq 16 in eq 13 we obtain 17 1 t ln n t n 0 λ n t r 0 d γ 1 α f t β i n t i t i 0 t and thus we obtain 18 d α f t r 0 γ γ t ln n t n 0 γ λ n t d β i n t d i t i 0 t using the lower limit in eq 18 we obtain lim inf t f t r 0 γ α d which is a contradiction the conclusions of theorem 3 3 show that the lower limit of the anthropogenic noise intensity level must be lower than the r 0 γ α d value to maintain persistence at the population mean if the attenuation of anthropogenic noise is low i e α is larger and the degree to which noise affects population d is large the above value tends to decrease as the intrinsic growth rate r 0 and noise attenuation γ increase the level of anthropogenic noise that the population can withstand increases the following is an example of analyzing the survival of a population exposed to constant anthropogenic noise emission example 1 we suppose that the anthropogenic noise intensity is represented by the constant function f t f 0 0 and the biological sound intensity is represented by β i β i i 1 β 0 model 5 has two equilibrium points e 1 n i with n 0 i 0 and e 2 0 α f 0 γ whose stability analysis leads to the persistence and extinction of the population respectively note that n 0 and i 0 satisfy n γ i α f 0 i 1 β i and i r 0 λ n d the jacobian matrix of model 5 in n i is given by 19 j n i r 0 d i d n β i β i i n γ and characteristic polynomial is given by 20 p δ δ 2 s δ p where s r 0 d i β i i n γ p r 0 d i β i i n γ β i d n then the hurwitz matrix of polynomial 20 is 21 h n i s 0 1 p applying the hurwitz criterion barnett and cameron 1975 we find that polynomial 20 has roots with a negative real part only if s 0 and p 0 that is equilibrium point e 1 is asymptotically stable if i r 0 d analogously we find that equilibrium point e 2 is asymptotically stable if i r 0 d these results are consistent with theorems 3 2 and 3 3 in summary we have if f 0 r 0 γ α d then the population persists if f 0 r 0 γ α d then the population goes to extinct the previous result can be observed in fig 1 by analyzing the intersection between the isoclines n 1 i r 0 d i λ n 2 i γ i α f 0 i 1 β i n 3 i 0 and the change in the sign of the rates of change in the population density and the level of noise intensity experienced by the population 4 numerical simulations in this section we present numerical simulations to corroborate the results obtained in theorems 3 2 and 3 3 the results can be illustrated as follows if the population growth rate and noise attenuation can increase or the degree to which the population is affected by noise is smaller the population will persist otherwise the population will die out when the values of the following parameters are r 0 1 λ 0 5 α 0 3 and γ 0 4 then model 5 will be considered with initial conditions n 0 1 and i 0 0 1 so that it becomes n 1 d i 0 5 n n i 0 3 f t β i n 0 4 i fig 2 shows the evolution of the dynamics of population density and the level of noise intensity experienced by the population over time 5 discussion there is evidence that chronic exposure to noise can cause changes in the mortality rates of a population causing that the effects of noise over time can negatively affect the persistence and extinction of a population sementili cardoso and donatelli 2021 babisch 2002 filadelfo et al 2009 nedelec et al 2014 potvin and macdougall shackleton 2015 jaeger et al 2005 reijnen et al 1996 in the current research we modeled these changes by considering the population mortality rate to be a function of the population size and the intensity of the noise to which the population is exposed our results are consistent with observations that a lower level of anthropogenic noise intensity is favorable for population survival farina 2014 pijanowski et al 2011a slabbekoorn et al 2018 kunc et al 2016 kight and swaddle 2011 de vincenzi et al 2021 goldbogen et al 2013 hildebrand 2009 likewise although the lombard effect is known to be beneficial in that important acoustic signals are not masked by noise when noise exceeds the permissible limit a limit up to which noise has no effect on the population observations indicate that the use of higher intensity acoustic signals increases energetic behavioral and predation costs which could result in lower ecological fitness influencing animal survival rates in noisy environments brackenbury 1979 calder iii 1990 oberweger and goller 2001 warren et al 2006 barber et al 2010 read et al 2014 brown et al 2021 swaddle et al 2015 farina and gage 2017 zollinger and brumm 2015 brumm and todt 2002 brumm 2004 luczkovich et al 2016 sementili cardoso and donatelli 2021 in other words from theorem 3 2 if an effort is made to reduce the intensity level of anthropogenic noise f and the maximum intensity level of acoustic signals emitted by conspecifics β which otherwise increases with respect to noise due to the lombard effect then the population will persist however according to theorem 3 3 a for the persistence of the population to remain at the mean it is sufficient to reduce the anthropogenic noise intensity level because the maximum intensity level of the acoustic signals generated by the population does not have a significant impact on the mean population persistence in particular when the degree to which noise affects the population d is lower persistence and mean persistence are benefitted see figs 2 b and 2 c conversely theorem 3 3 b indicates that when intensity of anthropogenic noise is high or the degree to which noise affects the population is greater the population goes to extinction see fig 2 d population extinction can also be understood as the displacement or migration of a population away from an anthropogenic noise source parameter d which indicates the degree to which noise affects the population can be understood to have a negative correlation with the degree of noise adaptation therefore some species show a considerable degree of adaptation to noisy environments for example invertebrates show evidence that they are capable of evolutionary adaptation and behavioral plasticity in response to noise sources morley et al 2014 in addition animal song plasticity facilitates vocal adjustments that contribute to reduced noise masking fernandez juricic 2001 brumm 2004 rheindt 2003 these adjustments may be the outcome of physiological adaptations such as those present in some fish that exhibit adaptations that convey sensitivity to sound pressure in fish these adaptations include having a gas bubble or swim bladder that is close to or connected to the ear schulz mirbach et al 2012 for instance the swim bladder of the atlantic cod gadus morhua is located near the ear and when filled with gas the organism s sensitivity to sound pressure is reduced sand et al 1973 however as the mechanisms of adaptation to noise are unique for each species the manipulation of the parameter d is uncontrollable therefore the best way to mitigate the effects of noise on a population is to control the level of noise intensity of the anthropogenic source in conclusion our model responds to growing concerns about the possible effects of noise at the population level we believe that our research will motivate other researchers to consider the effects of biological sounds and the lombard effect on population persistence note that we only analyzed the long term effects of noise on population density however even in the short term the population is exposed to noise which can have behavioral or physiological effects on the individuals of a population to evaluate this controlled experiments are required to measure the parameters that appear during noise exposure credit

24421,wind turbines cause direct mortality of bats through collision with turbine blades however accurate bat fatality estimates are unavailable for many facilities and regions due to lack of physically consistent guidance for surveying bat carcasses we develop a monte carlo based 3 d ballistics model to address this important gap to guide carcass surveys help improve fatality estimates by combining it with statistical models and offer post construction impact assessment guidelines monte carlo simulations account for variability of environmentally relevant parameters and subsequently the variability of the generated carcass fall zone distributions the input parameters are bat characteristics including mass size and drag coefficient wind speed turbine rpm yaw bat flight speed bat strike angle and bat strike locations on the rotor using turbine scada supervisory control and data acquisition bat biometrics data and carcass drag coefficient range probability density functions of the input parameters were computed with the help of carcass survey and scada details bat fatalities were selected and monte carlo based ballistics model simulations were performed using corresponding values of the input parameters of the ballistics model the surveyed carcass location for a bat found on the same day was in good agreement with the modelled fall zone distribution providing a measure of model validation next simulations were conducted for a bat fatality for which the carcass was found four days after collision it was found that the observed location was within the modeled fall zone distribution showing the model capacity for planning surveys further monte carlo based 3 d ballistics model simulations were performed for the full migration season and the resulting 1 d radial and 2 d surface histograms were compared with the survey 1 d and 2 d histograms respectively the modelled 2 d fall zone distribution hot spot overlaps with surveyed carcass positions indicating the model robustness over a wide range of meteorological conditions and time scales however by comparison the modeled 1 d fall zone distribution was found to be different from the surveyed 1 d fall zone distribution we hypothesize that uncertainty in bat radial strike location distribution of bat collisions on turbine blades in radial direction distribution is primary source of difference between the surveyed and modelled 1 d fall zone distribution there are no measurements available for this key input parameter as a next step the sensitivity of carcass fall zone distributions with respect to bat radial strike location distributions were tested it was found that the probability density function for bat radial strike location affects the modelled fall zone distributions significantly there is a need to measure bat radial and angular strike locations which can be used as input in the ballistics modeling framework to improve prediction of carcass fall zone distributions the proposed model is useful for carcass survey planning improving survey estimates designing turbine curtailment studies and collision risk modeling graphical abstarct image graphical abstract keywords ballistics model bat carcass survey monte carlo probability density function scada wind energy impacts 1 introduction bats play a key role in ecosystems by feeding on nocturnal insects and control insect transmitting diseases to humans reiskind and wund 2009 bats provide ecosystem services estimated to be 3 7 53 billion us yr in north america boyles et al 2011 ecosystem services refers to the benefits obtained from the environment leading to the well being of humans bats play an important role in maintaining environmental stability via arthropod suppression seed dispersal hence promoting forest regeneration and pollination kunz et al 2011 bats are not only important for balanced functioning of natural landscapes but they also offer enormous monetary benefits to the humans therefore making a strong case for enhancing their conservation a few documented examples are brazilian free tailed bats tadarida brasiliensis help southern texas farmers by negating the insecticide cost and consequent cotton production loss that mount to us 741 000 yr cleveland et al 2006 bats pollinate durio zibethinus a common fruit crop in indonesia that has the fiscal value of 117 ha in the peak season sheherazade and tsang 2019 it is important to address the impact to bats from human activity to preserve both ecological and economic value in parallel the growing need of green energy is resulting to wind farm installation in large numbers which can negatively affect wildlife the mortality of birds and bats are caused by collision with turbine blades rosenzweig 2003 getachew 2016 by altering breeding and migratory behaviors cryan et al 2014 millon et al 2015 and by habitat loss due to wind farm development drewitt and langston 2006 wulff et al 2016 minimizing bird and bat fatalities especially threatened and endangered species is critically important to both wildlife conservation and public acceptance of wind energy development a direct impact of wind energy is avian fatality due to collision with spinning blades orloff and flannery 1992 kunz et al 2007 hayes 2013 smallwood 2013 wind power development also causes indirect impacts through alteration and loss of bats habitat due to construction installation and operation of wind turbines kuvlesky et al 2007 agencies responsible for wildlife conservation propose post construction impact assessment guidelines during construction and operation of wind power facilities including carcass searches to quantify the number of birds and bats killed at a facility huso et al 2016a 2016b which is the focus of the present study numerous studies in the past have investigated bat mortalities at wind plants and computed cumulative impacts across multiple facilities choi et al 2020 examined the patterns in bird and bat carcass fall distances at wind energy facilities in the northeastern united states they used publicly available and u s fish and wildlife service usfws data of 44 wind facilities reporting 2039 bird fatalities covering 128 species and 22 wind facilities reporting 418 bat fatalities which include five species they found that for bird and bat data combined together turbine size positively influenced the carcass fall distance smallwood 2020 investigated the role of turbine size tower height and fatality survey interval on bat fatalities by reviewing the publicly available fatality reports at north american wind energy facilities through 2014 smallwood 2020 concluded that shorter search interval results in larger bat fatality estimates cabrera cruz et al 2020 estimated bird and bat mortality at three wind farms in the coastal plains of isthmus of tehuantepec mexico they conducted carcass surveys between 6th june and 30th november 2015 and found 75 bird and 72 bat carcasses representing 30 and 20 species respectively a team of three surveyors visited one of the wind farms every day except for rainy days the surveyors searched carcasses along the access roads between turbines within the wind farm they considered the carcasses found on the access roads to be associated with direct impact with wind turbine the carcass discovery interval per turbine was 13 9 13 7 and 13 5 days for the three wind farms however not all carcasses are found during the survey visits this is because of imperfect searcher efficiency carcass scavenging and because not all mortalities fall within the limited search area of access roads therefore the number of carcasses found during the search operation does not reflect the true fatality count and a correction is required to account for all these factors cabrera cruz et al 2020 proposed a probabilistic model to compute the potential number of facilities incorporating searcher efficiency and carcass daily persistence they concluded the corrected bird and bat mortality range as 9 13 birds mw yr and 20 44 bats mw yr respectively estimation of bat fatalities in a wind farm requires regular searching of the ground within a representative search area around wind turbines during the bat migration season when bats are most likely to be killed however the extent and direction of the carcass search area is highly uncertain there is a limited list of heuristic guidelines statistical models and physics based models resulting in significant variation for prescribed search area of bat carcasses table 1 provides a summary of the approach and their recommendations of bat carcass search radius around turbines during the bat migration season multiple bat species interact with utility scale wind turbines operating under varying atmospheric conditions the studies listed in table 1 did not consider all the possibilities of wind wildlife interactions in their investigations making it difficult for turbine operators to guide the carcass survey efforts in the wind farm also the studies in table 1 do not consider the effect wind direction may have on the likely fall zone and the direction in which the surveys should focus which might lead to increased likelihood of missing carcasses during survey campaign the variable carcass search frequency at turbine facilities is also a major source of uncertainty in estimating the exact carcass count over the migration season based on the studies reviewed it can be concluded that carcass counts at wind energy facilities are obtained from different sampling techniques or fatality estimators as also pointed by huso et al 2016a different survey methods make it difficult to predict accurate avian fatalities in a wind plant huso et al 2016b or cumulative impacts across multiple facilities at different locations loss et al 2013 in addition huso et al 2018 found a correlation between the spatial distribution of bat carcasses and nightly wind speed they conducted daily search operations at a site in midwestern u s for non curtailed turbines and related the carcass fall distance to prior night average wind speed for fresh carcasses they found that fraction of carcasses landing beyond 60 m of the turbine base increased with increasing wind speed this highlights that curtailment studies may bias results as strikes occurring at higher wind speeds may land outside survey plot there is a critical need to address the challenges associated with post construction survey design frequency of survey plot size and accurately correct limited surveys for unsearched areas the statistical model computations are primarily based on limited survey data and are applicable to a wind farm where the survey was conducted a model for describing carcass fall zone distribution should incorporate uncertainties in the relevant parameters affecting wind wildlife interactions in different geographic conditions and generate results useful for correcting unsearched areas for seasonal take estimation and for planning survey based on likely fall zone distributions such a tool would be immensely helpful for designing and conducting a technically sound survey to help operators quantify impact on species of concern and to evaluate overall project impacts on bats this study introduces a methodology that utilizes a monte carlo method with a recently developed three dimensional 3 d ballistics model prakash and markfort 2021 to evaluate bat carcass fall zone distributions at wind turbines the monte carlo method is added to account for the uncertainty in the input parameters of the ballistics model allowing for estimating the range of possible combinations of wind wildlife interactions on the resulting carcass fall zone distributions the paper is organized as follows description of the study area and data sources description of the ballistics model and approach integration of the monte carlo method with the 3 d ballistics model and determining the input parameter probability density functions based on data from a midwest u s a wind farm in the results section we present the modelled results for two of the surveyed bat fatalities and extend the application of the proposed tool to model the fall zone distributions for all the bat fatalities surveyed at a wind farm during autumn migration season and compared the results with the survey fall zone distribution further we investigated the sensitivity of the fall zone distribution to assumption of the bat strike distribution at the turbine rotor and explained the model limitations and its application for wind farm managers 2 study area and dataset the study area is a wind farm in central iowa with 51 siemens swt 2 3 mw wind turbines with rotor radius r and hub height hhub of 54 m and 80 m respectively owned by midamerican energy located near macksburg iowa the turbine scada records include meteorological data wind speed and turbine operational data yaw and blade rotation rate rpm the carcass survey data were collected by professional bat biometrologists to estimate the fall zone distribution of bat fatalities and total number of fatalities at the wind farm the survey data reports include carcass species name date on which carcass was found estimated time since death global positioning system location where carcass was discovered and carcass condition if it s intact or scavenged in the present analysis carcass survey data and turbine scada data for 2018 were used the carcass survey data of 2018 bat migration period 15th july 13th october reported overall 261 bat fatalities in the wind farm approximately 95 of these fatalities consist of following bat species the big brown bat eptesicus fuscus the eastern red bat lasiurus borealis the evening bat nycticeius humeralis the hoary bat lasiurus cinereus and the silver haired bat lasionycteris noctivagans fig 1 a and b show one dimensional 1 d total radial distance histogram and two dimensional 2 d surface fall zone distribution of the bat fatalities based on the 2018 carcass survey data respectively fig 1 a shows that almost 90 of bat fatalities are found within 50 m and carcasses fell up to a maximum distance of 90 m whereas in fig 1 b we can see that 2 d carcass fall zone distributions are uniformly confined to 50 m in all directions fig 2 shows the histogram of site averaged wind speed collected at 10 s resolution and wind direction data of macksburg wind farm in iowa wind typically blows from the south during summer and from the north in winter this trend is evident in the figure as well which shows the wind is typically from the north 0 or the south 180 direction during the bat migration period 3 methodology 3 1 ballistics model prakash and markfort 2021 introduced a ballistics model with three degrees of freedom to compute the carcass fall trajectories after strike by a turbine blade the model was used to describe how bat carcass fall zone distribution is a function of bat biophysical and aerodynamic characteristics meteorological conditions and corresponding turbine operational features bat flight speed bat strike angle and bat strike location on the rotor they conducted sensitivity analysis to identify the relative importance of these parameters affecting the carcass fall trajectory and determined bat likely strike distribution on the rotor plane using scada records and carcass survey data the ballistics model governing equations described by eqs 1 4 are solved using fourth order runge kutta method the solution time step was selected as 0 01 s 1 d 2 x c d t 2 ρ a 2 c d a c m c d x c d t v r 2 d 2 y c d t 2 ρ a 2 c d a c m c d y c d t w s v r 3 d 2 z c d t 2 ρ a 2 c d a c m c d z c d t v r g 4 v r d x c d t 2 d y c d t w s 2 d z c d t 2 where mc is carcass mass kg ac is carcass projected area m2 cd is carcass drag coefficient unitless ws is the wind speed in the y direction m s vr is the resultant carcass speed after strike m s ρa is air density kg m3 g is gravitational acceleration in the z direction m s2 and xc yc and zc are the components of carcass position vector relative to the ground in the x y and z directions m respectively the carcass projected area is defined as π 4 deq 2 where deq is the equivalent diameter of sphere with the same volume as that of the ellipsoid shaped bat fig 3 a below shows a bat in solid red getting hit by the turbine blade spinning at the rotation rate of ω at radial distance r and angle θ on the rotor measured positive in anticlockwise direction with respect to the horizontal fig 3 b displays the blade geometry with ψ being the angle at which bats strike the turbine blades with this configuration the initial position and velocity of the bat carcass at t 0 are rcosθ 0 hhub rsinθ and 1 e rωcosψsin 90 ψ sinθ vbat 1 e rωcosψcos 90 ψ 1 e rω cosψsin 90 ψ cosθ respectively here e is the coefficient of restitution unitless that determines the fraction of energy transferred from rotating turbine blade to a bat carcass mathematically it is defined as the ratio of restoration and deformation impulses in a direction perpendicular to the plane of contact vbat is the bat flight speed m s in y direction normal to the rotor plane prior to strike the assumptions of the 3 d ballistics model are following 1 bat flight trajectory prior to strike is normal to the rotor plane 2 carcasses are mortally injured and remain intact after blade strike 3 wind is constant ws x y z c and aligned normal to the rotor plane 4 the carcass projected area during the fall is constant 5 lift forces on the falling carcasses are negligible 6 carcasses do not bounce after hitting the ground 3 2 combining monte carlo method with ballistics model for computing the carcass fall zone distributions at a wind farm for the bat migration season one needs to account for representative combinations of the ballistics model parameters to model the wind wildlife interactions to our knowledge this is the first research that addresses how the uncertainties in the ballistics model parameters propagate or translate to carcass ground impact patterns i e the spot where a carcass lands on the ground after striking a turbine blade resulting in mortal injury this section presents the uncertainty propagation method applied in the present study and how it is combined with our ballistics model to introduce a tool for predicting the bat fate at a wind farm during the bat migration season one method for incorporating uncertainties in the parameters of the deterministic ballistics model and further combining these different uncertainties to compute the final uncertainty in the carcass fall distance is the monte carlo technique anderson 1976 farrance and frenkel 2014 monte carlo method involves the repeated generation of random values sampled from the probability density functions of the input datasets the probability density functions are decided after reviewing the relevant data or literature of the input parameters these repeated computations produce a distribution that can be used as an uncertainty distribution once these simulations are completed they are applied to the ballistics model to calculate the final distributions of the output variable i e carcass fall distance in this case fig 4 shows a flow chart for how the monte carlo technique is integrated with the 3 d ballistics model with input distributions yielding the final fall zone distribution of bat carcasses it should be noted here that with the input parameter distributions of the ballistics model except yaw φ firstly the output distribution of carcass fall position was computed and further the addition of yaw in the ballistics model accounts for the variability of bat carcass fall zone distribution with respect to the wind direction the rotation rate of the turbine rotor depends on wind speed and the projected area of bat carcass was found to correlate with bat mass therefore these parameters are combined and not treated as independent in the monte carlo algorithm a wind speed vs rpm relationship developed in martin et al 2017 from the scada data of siemens swt 2 3 mw wind turbines fig 5 is used in the present study for finding wind speed dependent turbine rpm a least squares regression analysis for mass vs projected area of bats was determined by using the bat biometrics data www vertnet org of typical iowa bats and bat carcasses collected in field surveys prakash and markfort 2020 the bat species include the big brown bat the eastern red bat the evening bat the hoary bat the indiana bat the northern long eared bat and the silver haired bat fig 6 shows the linear model eq 5 describing the bat projected area in cm2 as a function of bat mass in g obtained using bat biometrics data and prakash and markfort 2020 observations 5 a c 0 55 m c 4 95 the modelling framework considers the input probability density functions of carcass mass mc carcass drag coefficient cd wind speed ws yaw φ bat flight speed vbat bat strike angle ψ and bat strike locations r θ and using the functional form the input probability density function for projected area ac and rpm is estimated which also goes as an input in the ballistics model the monte carlo method generates a randomly sampled values of the input parameters mc ac cd ws rpm φ vbat ψ r θ from their respective probability density function further each set of input sample values were fed into the ballistics model to give the probabilistic output of carcass fall distance 3 3 probability density functions of input parameters this section describes how the probability density functions of the seasonal input parameters of the ballistics model are determined using scada and bat biophysical and drag characteristics data for conducting the monte carlo based ballistic model simulations 3 3 1 wind speed ws site averaged nightly wind speed data of macksburg wind farm between 8 pm to 5 am was used for modeling the wind speed during autumn migration season bats are most active in the evening and overnight period cryan et al 2014 therefore we only consider the times between sunset and sunrise in this analysis the mean and maximum of site averaged nightly wind speed is 6 m s and 17 m s respectively generalized gaussian distribution ggd dytso et al 2018 characterized by eqs 6 and 7 was fitted shown in red curve to the wind speed histogram in fig 7 ggd represents a large family of probability distributions which provides the scope for addition of a flexible shape parameter q in addition to mean μ and standard deviation σ the shape parameter allows the probability density function to have both heavier tail q 2 and lighter tail q 2 than the gaussian distribution the gaussian and the uniform distribution are the special cases of ggd corresponding to q 2 and q respectively the red curve in fig 7 shows the fitted ggd to the seasonal nightly wind speed data with the computed parameters as μ 6 σ 3 15 and q 3 04 the corresponding probability density function of rpm is determined by using functional relation proposed in martin et al 2017 6 f x c q σ e x μ q 2 σ q x r a n d q 0 7 c q q 2 q 1 q γ 1 q where γ is the gamma function 3 3 2 mass mc the bat biometrics data of iowa bats along with the measurements of prakash and markfort 2020 reporting bat mass and body dimensions was used for selecting the best probability density function representing the bat carcass mass mc fig 8 shows the bat mass histogram and the gamma distribution eq 8 denoted by fitted red curve the symbol a and b in eq 8 represents shape parameter and scale parameter respectively fitting the gamma probability density function to bat biometrics data yielded a 3 22 and b 4 09 the corresponding probability density function of projected area for monte carlo simulations is computed by using the relationship in eq 5 8 f x 1 b a γ a x a 1 e x b x 0 however it should be noted that in case of single bat fatality case the uniform distribution describing the range of bat mass of a specific species prakash and markfort 2021 was used for sampling the bat mass in the monte carlo based ballistics model simulations 3 3 3 drag coefficient cd present study uses the drag coefficient range 0 70 1 23 of bat carcasses established in prakash and markfort 2020 the uniform distribution characterized by eq 9 was used as an input probability density function for sampling carcass drag coefficient in the monte carlo based ballistic model simulations the symbol c and d in eq 9 are the lower and upper bounds of the uniform distribution 9 f x 1 d c 0 c x d otherwise 3 3 4 bat radial r and angular θ strike location the bat radial 0 54 m and angular strike locations 0 360 on the rotor plane in the present study were approximated by the uniform distribution 3 5 5 bat flight speed vbat and bat strike angle ψ in the past few studies have reported the bat flight speeds which are mentioned here hayward and davis 1964 summarized the flight speed of the big brown bats in the range of 2 7 m s mccracken et al 2016 examined the flight behavior of seven brazilian free tailed bats and reported the median flight speed as 5 7 m s martin et al 2017 reported the flight speeds of species of concern in the midwestern region e g indiana bat little brown bat between 5 and 10 m s based on above mentioned studies the bat flight speed was approximated as the uniform distribution between 5 and 10 m s in downwind direction for conducting monte carlo based ballistic model simulations bat strike angle was also modelled as the uniform distribution in the range of 90 upwind to 90 downwind 3 3 6 yaw φ site averaged nightly yaw data fig 9 of macksburg wind farm between 8 pm and 5 am was used for incorporating yaw in the monte carlo based ballistics model simulations the figure shows two peaks around 0 and 180 indicating most of the time wind blows either from the north or the south during bat migration season for accounting the effect of wind direction on carcass fall zone distributions firstly monte carlo simulations were conducted for wind direction normal to the rotor plane to determine the carcass fall zone distributions afterwards the modelled yaw distribution was applied to the computed ground impact patterns to estimate the carcass fall zone distributions thereby accounting for the wind direction variability yaw is characterized by the kernel density function atanasiu 2020 for random sampling to be used as an input in the proposed model a kernel distribution is nonparametric probability density function of a random variable and is used in either of the following two situations i when a parametric distribution is not able to describe the data appropriately or ii in order to avoid making assumptions about the underlying distribution of the dataset it is defined by a smoothing function k and a bandwidth value h that affects how smooth is the resultant curve the kernel density estimator is expressed by eq 10 as 10 f x 1 n h j 1 n k x x j h x r where n is the sample size and xj j 1 2 n are the values that random sampling from an unknown distribution generates fig 9 displays the site averaged nightly wind direction histogram and fitted kernel density function shown by red curve 4 results 4 1 monte carlo based 3 d ballistics model simulations this section describes the integration of monte carlo methodology with the 3 d ballistics model to generate the computations of carcass fall zone distributions for following cases a bat fatality listed as last night invariant yaw with carcass normal distance 10 m b bat fatality discovered on fourth day after the strike c case which includes multiple bat species interacting with turbine blades during the bat migration season d sensitivity of carcass fall zone distributions with respect to bat radial strike location probability density function choice it should be noted here that in these simulations we are using a constant value of e as 0 1 martin et al 2017 the optimal number of monte carlo simulations are determined by running different number of monte carlo realizations and computing the standard deviation of carcass total distance in each of these cases the process is stopped when the variation of the standard deviation achieves the asymptotic state in our case this feature was found for 5000 realizations and the results in the subsequent sections are presented for 5000 realizations of monte carlo based ballistics model simulations 4 1 1 fall zone distribution for last night invariant yaw with carcass normal distance 10 m bat fatality using carcass survey and scada records of 2018 prakash and markfort 2021 identified the bat fatalities for which the carcass position with respect to the rotor plane can be established with confidence and these fatalities were named as last night invariant yaw with carcass normal distance 10 m a hoary bat out of these classified fatalities was selected for comparing the modelled distribution with the carcass survey location to validate the proposed model the described bat fatality happened at turbine 44 with carcass search date reported as 8th september 2018 the carcass in plane and normal distance was computed as 18 m and 35 m respectively the yaw mean and standard deviation was observed to be 46 and 4 respectively for running monte carlo simulations the probability density functions and corresponding ranges of the input parameters i e drag coefficient bat flight speed bat strike angle and bat radial and angular strike locations were selected on the basis of section 3 3 however since it is a single species case of the hoary bat mass was assumed to be uniformly distributed in the range of 18 38 g as reported in prakash and markfort 2021 the corresponding projected area was computed using the relationship described in eq 5 the wind speed and yaw data for 8 pm on 7th september to 5 am on 8th september was selected for running the simulation fig 10 a and b show the wind speed and yaw histogram obtained from scada along with the fitted ggd and kernel density functions respectively the random sampling of wind speed and yaw is done from fitted ggd and kernel density function respectively to conduct monte carlo simulations for the four cases described in section 4 1 nieslony 2020 fig 11 shows the carcass fall zone distribution of the above mentioned hoary bat fatality obtained from monte carlo based ballistics model simulations with the carcass survey location denoted by x in red superimposed over it the black dot in the figure shows the turbine location whereas the arrow shows the wind direction at an angle of 46 it is evident from the figure that the recorded carcass survey position is within the periphery of the modelled distribution and overlaps with the fall zone distribution hotspot i e spot with highest probability of carcass landing the result in fig 11 confirms that the proposed model can predict the carcass fall zone distribution accurately for a bat fatality in which the carcass position from rotor plane can be determined with high confidence level 4 1 2 fall zone distribution of bat fatality discovered after four days of its death a hoary bat fatality with carcass search date after four days of its death was selected from 2018 carcass survey data and was modelled with the proposed monte carlo based 3 d ballistics model the purpose of choosing such a bat fatality was to demonstrate the capacity of the model in survey planning for efficient and successful detection of bat carcasses the bat carcass was found on 12th september 2018 at turbine 34 the total distance and bearing of the carcass was reported as 44 m and 344 respectively the sight averaged nightly wind speed and yaw were extracted from scada records for four consecutive days 8th september 12th september fig 12 shows the wind speed and yaw histogram and fitted probability density functions selected according to section 3 3 for the considered bat fatality mass was assumed to be uniformly distributed 18 38 g as it was in the previous case of the hoary bat fatality fig 13 shows the comparison of the modelled fall zone distribution of this hoary bat fatality with reported carcass survey location denoted by red x it is evident from the figure that the carcass observed location lies within the modelled fall zone distribution obtained from the proposed model and is adjacent to the hotspot of the carcass fall zone distribution this is an interesting finding as it demonstrates that if the wind speed and wind direction forecast is known the proposed model can be implemented to send the surveyors towards the spots with highest probability of carcass landing resulting in successful survey campaigns at a wind facility 4 1 3 fall zone distribution for bat migration season with multiple bat species striking turbine blades the monte carlo based 3 d ballistics model was further applied for fall migration season involving multiple bat species interacting with turbine blades this particular case represents the range of plausible uncertainties in the input parameters of the ballistics model during the three month window of bat migration activity the sampling of all the input parameters of the ballistics model was performed by considering the probability density function described in section 3 3 it should be noted here that for the full season case the bat mass is modelled as the gamma distribution fig 8 involving multiple bat species fig 14 a and b show the modeled 1 d and 2 d carcass fall zone distributions obtained using the proposed model for full migration season at macksburg wind farm it is noticeable from fig 14 a that 48 of the bat fatalities fall within first 50 m distance from the turbine base the modelled maximum total distance was 185 m as compared to the observed 90 m distance from the carcass survey data fig 15 displays the comparison of carcass surveyed and modeled fall zone distributions in fig 15 a for surveyed 1 d fall zone distribution almost 25 of discovered carcasses were found in the first bin of 0 10 m whereas for modelled 1 d fall zone distribution there are very few bat mortalities in the first bin fig 15 b highlights nice overlap of 2 d fall zone distribution obtained from monte carlo based ballistics model simulations with surveyed carcasses shown by red cross x it was hypothesized that the plausible reason of difference between surveyed and modelled 1 d fall zone distribution in the first few bins is because of the uncertainty in the bat strike location distributions as a next step we investigated the sensitivity of carcass fall zone distributions with respect to different probability density functions of bat strike locations in section 4 1 4 4 1 4 sensitivity of carcass fall zone distributions with respect to bat radial strike location distribution this section discusses the sensitivity of carcass fall zone distributions with respect to bat radial strike locations on the rotor plane in the present study bats were assumed to be uniformly distributed on the rotor plane like hull and muir 2010 as there are no measurements of the bat likely strike locations prakash and markfort 2020 however kunz et al 2007 has quoted heat attraction hypothesis which says that bats move towards nacelle searching for flying insects attracted to the heat produced by the nacelle of wind turbines based on the limited carcass survey and scada records prakash and markfort 2021 found the back trajectory of bat carcasses around the rotor hub by using the 3 d ballistics model which ranged from hub to rotor tip this underpins the need to investigate the fall zone distribution results with different probability density function assumptions of bat radial strike location to analyze this effect the bat radial strike locations was modelled with the exponential distribution thus assigning higher bat strike probability towards the nacelle region the exponential distribution is characterized by the following expression 11 f x e x μ μ x 0 where μ 0 is the mean parameter the sensitivity of seasonal carcass fall zone distributions is tested by varying the mean parameter of the exponential distribution for bat radial strike location while keeping the remaining distributions same as in the section 3 3 fig 16 shows the bat strike locations blue dots on the rotor plane by approximating bat angular strike location as the uniform distribution and radial strike location by both uniform fig 16 a and exponential distribution fig 16 b d three values of mean parameter μ 5 m 15 m 25 m in the exponential distribution were selected for the analysis the uniform distribution assigns equal probability of bat strike anywhere on the rotor plane whereas the exponential distribution weighs the bat strike locations on the rotor depending upon the mean parameter value it is clear from fig 16 b that for μ 5 m the bat strike location is heavily distributed towards the nacelle on increasing μ in fig 16 c the bat strike locations start spreading gradually over the rotor plane and for μ 25 m in fig 16 d the bat strike location becomes very similar to the one with the uniform distribution in fig 16 a the bat carcass fall zone distributions were computed from the proposed model by approximating the bat radial strike locations with the distributions considered in fig 16 and remaining parameters with the distributions described in section 3 3 fig 17 shows the comparison of the 2 d carcass fall zone distributions from different assumptions of radial strike location distributions in the proposed model a uniform b exponential μ 5 m c exponential μ 15 m and d exponential μ 25 m on comparing fig 17 a and b it is clear that as bat strike probability starts concentrating towards the rotor hub represented by the exponential distribution μ 5 m the extent of the fall zone distribution decreases and the distribution hotspot close to turbine base becomes more evident on further increasing the mean parameter μ to 15 m fig 17 c and 25 m fig 17 d the fall zone distribution starts spreading out and ultimately for μ 25 m becomes very similar to the fall zone distribution obtained from the uniform distribution assumption of bat radial strike location these results conclude that carcass fall zone distribution results are very sensitive to the choice of bat strike location distributions which further affects the carcass planning and survey efforts the sensitivity analysis emphasizes the need of accurate measurements of bat likely radial strike locations to correctly model the carcass fall zone distributions so that the survey planning efforts do not take huge time money and manual effort fig 18 shows the corresponding 1 d total distance distributions for the bat strike location distribution cases considered in fig 16 for the uniform distribution assumption of bat radial strike location the maximum fall distance was computed as 185 m whereas for the three cases of the exponential distribution the maximum fall distance was estimated as 137 m μ 5 m 159 m μ 15 m and 177 m μ 25 m for the exponential distribution with μ 5 m approximately 60 of the bat fatalities were confined within 50 m distance from turbine base whereas with the uniform distribution approximation 48 of the bat fatalities are covered within 50 m distance sensitivity analysis results reveal that with the accurate measurements of bat strike location distributions on the rotor plane a higher percentage of bat fatalities can be discovered accurately by sampling a small area around turbines the small area refers to the search area covered by high probability spots in the carcass fall zone distributions the magnitude of small area varies depending upon bat species colliding with different sized turbine blades under different meteorological and operational conditions and in the present study it corresponds to a search area of 0 4 ha 0 6 ha and 0 8 ha for daily weekly and seasonal time scales of survey respectively 5 model applications and conditions of model application this section describes the potential areas and guidelines where the proposed model can be applied by wind farm managers for multiple purposes such as 1 carcass survey planning in order to determine the survey distance and direction a surveyor needs distribution for the following parameters to simulate a fall zone distribution meteorological condition forecast after few days i e wind speed and direction turbine operational characteristics and bat biophysical and aerodynamic characteristics if the wind speed and direction is known from a nearby meteorological station then based on the turbine operational curve corresponding functional rpm can be determined the bat biophysical and aerodynamic characteristics are represented by the probability density functions as described in section 3 3 of the manuscript with all these pieces of information plugged into the model along with turbine geometry simulations can be performed to find the most likely fall locations of bats in future days to plan and conduct the survey effectively 2 improve seasonal fatality estimates at wind farms bat fatality estimates are often incomplete due to limitations with carcass surveys such as searching around connecting roads and pads only or unsearched area in the wind farms due to difficult terrain huso et al 2014 proposed a statistical model accounting for unsearched areas by relating carcass density to distance from the turbine base hence giving the fraction of carcasses expected to land in the searched areas the carcass fall zone distributions from the proposed model can be coupled with the approach proposed by huso et al 2014 to estimate the area correction factor and extrapolate these results subsequently to compute the bat fatalities at wind farms in a year to get fatality rates 3 design turbine curtailment studies prakash and markfort 2021 performed a model sensitivity analysis and found that bats fall further from the turbine at higher wind speeds current turbine curtailment strategies shut down turbines at low wind speeds and operate only at higher wind speeds this leads to occurrence of bat fatalities at high wind speed only and in the absence of large search plots carcasses are more likely to be missed the proposed framework is useful for evaluating the effect of curtailment on fatality estimates 4 collision risk modeling the proposed model is particularly useful for investigating bat behavior near the rotor and to determine distribution of blade collisions prakash and markfort 2021 demonstrate how to use the 3 d ballistics model with surveyed carcass locations to estimate bat strike location on the turbine rotor this model along with the thermal surveillance of bat trajectories around turbine rotors can be used to develop a quantitative framework for collision risk since the simulations are based on the assumptions listed in section 3 1 the following conditions associated with its application in wind farms are given as 1 the model is applicable to conditions when a falling carcass experiences constant wind 2 the proposed model is best suited for computing trajectories of bat carcasses experiencing negligible lift force 6 model limitations the monte carlo based 3 d ballistics model is founded upon the assumptions described in section 3 1 because of which the model has its limitations in wind farm applications which are discussed here 1 the model assumes constant uniform wind in a direction normal to the rotor plane however blade rotation cause turbine wakes resulting in lower wind speed in the downwind region of the turbine which could result in reduced wind drift effect on the distance in the downwind direction we propose to include wind speed variation due to the wakes in the model for operational purposes 2 the model is limited by the availability of experimental results for drag coefficient and coefficient of restitution prakash and markfort 2020 therefore the findings of the present study are based on limited data and there is a need for further testing with larger dataset 3 the bat flight speed range is based on the limited species quoted in the literature hayward and davis 1964 mccracken et al 2016 martin et al 2017 to improve the model bat flight trajectories of different species prior to collision can be recorded using thermal video observations to provide a more complete range of bat flight speed 4 the model is limited by the dearth of information about bat strike distributions on the turbine rotor causing uncertainty in the resultant fall zone distributions obtained from the model 7 conclusions this study introduces a computational modeling framework that combines a 3 d ballistics model with monte carlo technique to simulate the fate of bats interacting with an operational utility scale wind turbine prakash 2020 the objective is to develop a tool for predicting bat fate so that impact of wind farm projects on bats can be evaluated accurately the probability density functions of input parameters of the ballistics model were modelled with scada from an operational wind farm and bat biometrics data the wind speed was modelled with the generalized gaussian yaw with the kernel density function bat mass with the gamma whereas carcass drag coefficient bat flight speed bat strike angle and bat radial and angular strike location were modelled with the uniform distribution the probability density function of rpm and carcass projected area were computed by using functional relationships from martin et al 2017 and eq 5 respectively firstly monte carlo based ballistics model simulations were performed for a well defined hoary bat fatality in which the carcass normal distance can be established with respect to the rotor with confidence and it was found that the recorded survey location is in good agreement with the modelled distribution demonstrating the accuracy of the model secondly a hoary bat fatality with carcass discovered four days after death was modelled using the proposed monte carlo approach the survey location was found to be coincident with the modeled likely fall zone distribution confirming the model robustness for planning targeted carcass surveys next monte carlo based ballistics model simulations were performed for the whole migration season using the site averaged nightly wind speed and yaw records involving multiple bat species recorded at wind farms the hotspots of modelled 2 d fall zone distribution were found to be in agreement with the recorded survey locations showing the capability of the model for predicting carcass fall zone for the bat migration season however the seasonal surveyed and modelled 1 d fall zone distributions were found to be different from each other to investigate this bat carcass fall zone distribution sensitivity is tested with respect to bat radial strike locations on the turbine rotor by assuming a range of possible strike distributions the results revealed that changing the bat strike location probability density function alters the bat carcass fall zone distributions significantly for example if bats are more likely to strike closer to the hub the fall zone radius is significantly reduced this finding underpins the need for measurement of bat radial and angular strike locations at turbine blades in order to develop an accurate model the process of conducting regular carcass surveys in wind farms is expensive surveys require significant human resources advanced instrumentation and significant time during the migration season surveying hundreds or thousands of turbines daily or even weekly and occasionally in dangerous terrains can be infeasible due to these constraints it is not possible to search every turbine on daily basis which leads to an incomplete carcass count in addition there is uncertainty about the required survey area distance and direction to be searched the present model considers the bat biophysical and aerodynamic characteristics along with the meteorological and turbine geometry and operational conditions to give the fall zone distributions of the bat carcasses this information can be used for optimizing the carcass search area and direction based on the high probability fall zones another potential application of this model is to fill in the gaps of inconsistent or intermittent survey frequency which can reduce the economic burden of performing daily surveys in future the model can be integrated with infra red camera measurements of bat trajectories prior to strike and bat strike location measurements to accurately model the carcass fall zone distributions by incorporating real world strike distributions the addition of lift force will be helpful in extending the model application particularly to carcasses of large birds also the physics of the model can be enriched by incorporating wind shear and turbulence in the modeling framework author contributions sp

24421,wind turbines cause direct mortality of bats through collision with turbine blades however accurate bat fatality estimates are unavailable for many facilities and regions due to lack of physically consistent guidance for surveying bat carcasses we develop a monte carlo based 3 d ballistics model to address this important gap to guide carcass surveys help improve fatality estimates by combining it with statistical models and offer post construction impact assessment guidelines monte carlo simulations account for variability of environmentally relevant parameters and subsequently the variability of the generated carcass fall zone distributions the input parameters are bat characteristics including mass size and drag coefficient wind speed turbine rpm yaw bat flight speed bat strike angle and bat strike locations on the rotor using turbine scada supervisory control and data acquisition bat biometrics data and carcass drag coefficient range probability density functions of the input parameters were computed with the help of carcass survey and scada details bat fatalities were selected and monte carlo based ballistics model simulations were performed using corresponding values of the input parameters of the ballistics model the surveyed carcass location for a bat found on the same day was in good agreement with the modelled fall zone distribution providing a measure of model validation next simulations were conducted for a bat fatality for which the carcass was found four days after collision it was found that the observed location was within the modeled fall zone distribution showing the model capacity for planning surveys further monte carlo based 3 d ballistics model simulations were performed for the full migration season and the resulting 1 d radial and 2 d surface histograms were compared with the survey 1 d and 2 d histograms respectively the modelled 2 d fall zone distribution hot spot overlaps with surveyed carcass positions indicating the model robustness over a wide range of meteorological conditions and time scales however by comparison the modeled 1 d fall zone distribution was found to be different from the surveyed 1 d fall zone distribution we hypothesize that uncertainty in bat radial strike location distribution of bat collisions on turbine blades in radial direction distribution is primary source of difference between the surveyed and modelled 1 d fall zone distribution there are no measurements available for this key input parameter as a next step the sensitivity of carcass fall zone distributions with respect to bat radial strike location distributions were tested it was found that the probability density function for bat radial strike location affects the modelled fall zone distributions significantly there is a

diseases to humans reiskind and wund 2009 bats provide ecosystem services estimated to be 3 7 53 billion us yr in north america boyles et al 2011 ecosystem services refers to the benefits obtained from the environment leading to the well being of humans bats play an important role in maintaining environmental stability via arthropod suppression seed dispersal hence promoting forest regeneration and pollination kunz et al 2011 bats are not only important for balanced functioning of natural landscapes but they also offer enormous monetary benefits to the humans therefore making a strong case for enhancing their conservation a few documented examples are brazilian free tailed bats tadarida brasiliensis help southern texas farmers by negating the insecticide cost and consequent cotton production loss that mount to us 741 000 yr cleveland et al 2006 bats pollinate durio zibethinus a common fruit crop in indonesia that has the fiscal value of 117 ha in the peak season sheherazade and tsang 2019 it is important to address the impact to bats from human activity to preserve both ecological and economic value in parallel the growing need of green energy is resulting to wind farm installation in large numbers which can negatively affect wildlife the mortality of birds and bats are caused by collision with turbine blades rosenzweig 2003 getachew 2016 by altering breeding and migratory behaviors cryan et al 2014 millon et al 2015 and by habitat loss due to wind farm development drewitt and langston 2006 wulff et al 2016 minimizing bird and bat fatalities especially threatened and endangered species is critically important to both wildlife conservation and public acceptance of wind energy development a direct impact of wind energy is avian fatality due to collision with spinning blades orloff and flannery 1992 kunz et al 2007 hayes 2013 smallwood 2013 wind power development also causes indirect impacts through alteration and loss of bats habitat due to construction installation and operation of wind turbines kuvlesky et al 2007 agencies responsible for wildlife conservation propose post construction impact assessment guidelines during construction and operation of wind power facilities including carcass searches to quantify the number of birds and bats killed at a facility huso et al 2016a 2016b which is the focus of the present study numerous studies in the past have investigated bat mortalities at wind plants and computed cumulative impacts across multiple facilities choi et al 2020 examined the patterns in bird and bat carcass fall distances at wind energy facilities in the northeastern united states they used publicly available and u s fish and wildlife service usfws data of 44 wind facilities reporting 2039 bird fatalities covering 128 species and 22 wind facilities reporting 418 bat fatalities which include five species they found that for bird and bat data combined together turbine size positively influenced the carcass fall distance smallwood 2020 investigated the role of turbine size tower height and fatality survey interval on bat fatalities by reviewing the publicly available fatality reports at north american wind energy facilities through 2014 smallwood 2020 concluded that shorter search interval results in larger bat fatality estimates cabrera cruz et al 2020 estimated bird and bat mortality at three wind farms in the coastal plains of isthmus of tehuantepec mexico they conducted carcass surveys between 6th june and 30th november 2015 and found 75 bird and 72 bat carcasses representing 30 and 20 species respectively a team of three surveyors visited one of the wind farms every day except for rainy days the surveyors searched carcasses along the access roads between turbines within the wind farm they considered the carcasses found on the access roads to be associated with direct impact with wind turbine the carcass discovery interval per turbine was 13 9 13 7 and 13 5 days for the three wind farms however not all carcasses are found during the survey visits this is because of imperfect searcher efficiency carcass scavenging and because not all mortalities fall within the limited search area of access roads therefore the number of carcasses found during the search operation does not reflect the true fatality count and a correction is required to account for all these factors cabrera cruz et al 2020 proposed a probabilistic model to compute the potential number of facilities incorporating searcher efficiency and carcass daily persistence they concluded the corrected bird and bat mortality range as 9 13 birds mw yr and 20 44 bats mw yr respectively estimation of bat fatalities in a wind farm requires regular searching of the ground within a representative search area around wind turbines during the bat migration season when bats are most likely to be killed however the extent and direction of the carcass search area is highly uncertain there is a limited list of heuristic guidelines statistical models and physics based models resulting in significant variation for prescribed search area of bat carcasses table 1 provides a summary of the approach and their recommendations of bat carcass search radius around turbines during the bat migration season multiple bat species interact with utility scale wind turbines operating under varying atmospheric conditions the studies listed in table 1 did not consider all the possibilities of wind wildlife interactions in their investigations making it difficult for turbine operators to guide the carcass survey efforts in the wind farm also the studies in table 1 do not consider the effect wind direction may have on the likely fall zone and the direction in which the surveys should focus which might lead to increased likelihood of missing carcasses during survey campaign the variable carcass search frequency at turbine facilities is also a major source of uncertainty in estimating the exact carcass count over the migration season based on the studies reviewed it can be concluded that carcass counts at wind energy facilities are obtained from different sampling techniques or fatality estimators as also pointed by huso et al 2016a different survey methods make it difficult to predict accurate avian fatalities in a wind plant huso et al 2016b or cumulative impacts across multiple facilities at different locations loss et al 2013 in addition huso et al 2018 found a correlation between the spatial distribution of bat carcasses and nightly wind speed they conducted daily search operations at a site in midwestern u s for non curtailed turbines and related the carcass fall distance to prior night average wind speed for fresh carcasses they found that fraction of carcasses landing beyond 60 m of the turbine base increased with increasing wind speed this highlights that curtailment studies may bias results as strikes occurring at higher wind speeds may land outside survey plot there is a critical need to address the challenges associated with post construction survey design frequency of survey plot size and accurately correct limited surveys for unsearched areas the statistical model computations are primarily based on limited survey data and are applicable to a wind farm where the survey was conducted a model for describing carcass fall zone distribution should incorporate uncertainties in the relevant parameters affecting wind wildlife interactions in different geographic conditions and generate results useful for correcting unsearched areas for seasonal take estimation and for planning survey based on likely fall zone distributions such a tool would be immensely helpful for designing and conducting a technically sound survey to help operators quantify impact on species of concern and to evaluate overall project impacts on bats this study introduces a methodology that utilizes a monte carlo method with a recently developed three dimensional 3 d ballistics model prakash and markfort 2021 to evaluate bat carcass fall zone distributions at wind turbines the monte carlo method is added to account for the uncertainty in the input parameters of the ballistics model allowing for estimating the range of possible combinations of wind wildlife interactions on the resulting carcass fall zone distributions the paper is organized as follows description of the study area and data sources description of the ballistics model and approach integration of the monte carlo method with the 3 d ballistics model and determining the input parameter probability density functions based on data from a midwest u s a wind farm in the results section we present the modelled results for two of the surveyed bat fatalities and extend the application of the proposed tool to model the fall zone distributions for all the bat fatalities surveyed at a wind farm during autumn migration season and compared the results with the survey fall zone distribution further we investigated the sensitivity of the fall zone distribution to assumption of the bat strike distribution at the turbine rotor and explained the model limitations and its application for wind farm managers 2 study area and dataset the study area is a wind farm in central iowa with 51 siemens swt 2 3 mw wind turbines with rotor radius r and hub height hhub of 54 m and 80 m respectively owned by midamerican energy located near macksburg iowa the turbine scada records include meteorological data wind speed and turbine operational data yaw and blade rotation rate rpm the carcass survey data were collected by professional bat biometrologists to estimate the fall zone distribution of bat fatalities and total number of fatalities at the wind farm the survey data reports include carcass species name date on which carcass was found estimated time since death global positioning system location where carcass was discovered and carcass condition if it s intact or scavenged in the present analysis carcass survey data and turbine scada data for 2018 were used the carcass survey data of 2018 bat migration period 15th july 13th october reported overall 261 bat fatalities in the wind farm approximately 95 of these fatalities consist of following bat species the big brown bat eptesicus fuscus the eastern red bat lasiurus borealis the evening bat nycticeius humeralis the hoary bat lasiurus cinereus and the silver haired bat lasionycteris noctivagans fig 1 a and b show one dimensional 1 d total radial distance histogram and two dimensional 2 d surface fall zone distribution of the bat fatalities based on the 2018 carcass survey data respectively fig 1 a shows that almost 90 of bat fatalities are found within 50 m and carcasses fell up to a maximum distance of 90 m whereas in fig 1 b we can see that 2 d carcass fall zone distributions are uniformly confined to 50 m in all directions fig 2 shows the histogram of site averaged wind speed collected at 10 s resolution and wind direction data of macksburg wind farm in iowa wind typically blows from the south during summer and from the north in winter this trend is evident in the figure as well which shows the wind is typically from the north 0 or the south 180 direction during the bat migration period 3 methodology 3 1 ballistics model prakash and markfort 2021 introduced a ballistics model with three degrees of freedom to compute the carcass fall trajectories after strike by a turbine blade the model was used to describe how bat carcass fall zone distribution is a function of bat biophysical and aerodynamic characteristics meteorological conditions and corresponding turbine operational features bat flight speed bat strike angle and bat strike location on the rotor they conducted sensitivity analysis to identify the relative importance of these parameters affecting the carcass fall trajectory and determined bat likely strike distribution on the rotor plane using scada records and carcass survey data the ballistics model governing equations described by eqs 1 4 are solved using fourth order runge kutta method the solution time step was selected as 0 01 s 1 d 2 x c d t 2 ρ a 2 c d a c m c d x c d t v r 2 d 2 y c d t 2 ρ a 2 c d a c m c d y c d t w s v r 3 d 2 z c d t 2 ρ a 2 c d a c m c d z c d t v r g 4 v r d x c d t 2 d y c d t w s 2 d z c d t 2 where mc is carcass mass kg ac is carcass projected area m2 cd is carcass drag coefficient unitless ws is the wind speed in the y direction m s vr is the resultant carcass speed after strike m s ρa is air density kg m3 g is gravitational acceleration in the z direction m s2 and xc yc and zc are the components of carcass position vector relative to the ground in the x y and z directions m respectively the carcass projected area is defined as π 4 deq 2 where deq is the equivalent diameter of sphere with the same volume as that of the ellipsoid shaped bat fig 3 a below shows a bat in solid red getting hit by the turbine blade spinning at the rotation rate of ω at radial distance r and angle θ on the rotor measured positive in anticlockwise direction with respect to the horizontal fig 3 b displays the blade geometry with ψ being the angle at which bats strike the turbine blades with this configuration the initial position and velocity of the bat carcass at t 0 are rcosθ 0 hhub rsinθ and 1 e rωcosψsin 90 ψ sinθ vbat 1 e rωcosψcos 90 ψ 1 e rω cosψsin 90 ψ cosθ respectively here e is the coefficient of restitution unitless that determines the fraction of energy transferred from rotating turbine blade to a bat carcass mathematically it is defined as the ratio of restoration and deformation impulses in a direction perpendicular to the plane of contact vbat is the bat flight speed m s in y direction normal to the rotor plane prior to strike the assumptions of the 3 d ballistics model are following 1 bat flight trajectory prior to strike is normal to the rotor plane 2 carcasses are mortally injured and remain intact after blade strike 3 wind is constant ws x y z c and aligned normal to the rotor plane 4 the carcass projected area during the fall is constant 5 lift forces on the falling carcasses are negligible 6 carcasses do not bounce after hitting the ground 3 2 combining monte carlo method with ballistics model for computing the carcass fall zone distributions at a wind farm for the bat migration season one needs to account for representative combinations of the ballistics model parameters to model the wind wildlife interactions to our knowledge this is the first research that addresses how the uncertainties in the ballistics model parameters propagate or translate to carcass ground impact patterns i e the spot where a carcass lands on the ground after striking a turbine blade resulting in mortal injury this section presents the uncertainty propagation method applied in the present study and how it is combined with our ballistics model to introduce a tool for predicting the bat fate at a wind farm during the bat migration season one method for incorporating uncertainties in the parameters of the deterministic ballistics model and further combining these different uncertainties to compute the final uncertainty in the carcass fall distance is the monte carlo technique anderson 1976 farrance and frenkel 2014 monte carlo method involves the repeated generation of random values sampled from the probability density functions of the input datasets the probability density functions are decided after reviewing the relevant data or literature of the input parameters these repeated computations produce a distribution that can be used as an uncertainty distribution once these simulations are completed they are applied to the ballistics model to calculate the final distributions of the output variable i e carcass fall distance in this case fig 4 shows a flow chart for how the monte carlo technique is integrated with the 3 d ballistics model with input distributions yielding the final fall zone distribution of bat carcasses it should be noted here that with the input parameter distributions of the ballistics model except yaw φ firstly the output distribution of carcass fall position was computed and further the addition of yaw in the ballistics model accounts for the variability of bat carcass fall zone distribution with respect to the wind direction the rotation rate of the turbine rotor depends on wind speed and the projected area of bat carcass was found to correlate with bat mass therefore these parameters are combined and not treated as independent in the monte carlo algorithm a wind speed vs rpm relationship developed in martin et al 2017 from the scada data of siemens swt 2 3 mw wind turbines fig 5 is used in the present study for finding wind speed dependent turbine rpm a least squares regression analysis for mass vs projected area of bats was determined by using the bat biometrics data www vertnet org of typical iowa bats and bat carcasses collected in field surveys prakash and markfort 2020 the bat species include the big brown bat the eastern red bat the evening bat the hoary bat the indiana bat the northern long eared bat and the silver haired bat fig 6 shows the linear model eq 5 describing the bat projected area in cm2 as a function of bat mass in g obtained using bat biometrics data and prakash and markfort 2020 observations 5 a c 0 55 m c 4 95 the modelling framework considers the input probability density functions of carcass mass mc carcass drag coefficient cd wind speed ws yaw φ bat flight speed vbat bat strike angle ψ and bat strike locations r θ and using the functional form the input probability density function for projected area ac and rpm is estimated which also goes as an input in the ballistics model the monte carlo method generates a randomly sampled values of the input parameters mc ac cd ws rpm φ vbat ψ r θ from their respective probability density function further each set of input sample values were fed into the ballistics model to give the probabilistic output of carcass fall distance 3 3 probability density functions of input parameters this section describes how the probability density functions of the seasonal input parameters of the ballistics model are determined using scada and bat biophysical and drag characteristics data for conducting the monte carlo based ballistic model simulations 3 3 1 wind speed ws site averaged nightly wind speed data of macksburg wind farm between 8 pm to 5 am was used for modeling the wind speed during autumn migration season bats are most active in the evening and overnight period cryan et al 2014 therefore we only consider the times between sunset and sunrise in this analysis the mean and maximum of site averaged nightly wind speed is 6 m s and 17 m s respectively generalized gaussian distribution ggd dytso et al 2018 characterized by eqs 6 and 7 was fitted shown in red curve to the wind speed histogram in fig 7 ggd represents a large family of probability distributions which provides the scope for addition of a flexible shape parameter q in addition to mean μ and standard deviation σ the shape parameter allows the probability density function to have both heavier tail q 2 and lighter tail q 2 than the gaussian distribution the gaussian and the uniform distribution are the special cases of ggd corresponding to q 2 and q respectively the red curve in fig 7 shows the fitted ggd to the seasonal nightly wind speed data with the computed parameters as μ 6 σ 3 15 and q 3 04 the corresponding probability density function of rpm is determined by using functional relation proposed in martin et al 2017 6 f x c q σ e x μ q 2 σ q x r a n d q 0 7 c q q 2 q 1 q γ 1 q where γ is the gamma function 3 3 2 mass mc the bat biometrics data of iowa bats along with the measurements of prakash and markfort 2020 reporting bat mass and body dimensions was used for selecting the best probability density function representing the bat carcass mass mc fig 8 shows the bat mass histogram and the gamma distribution eq 8 denoted by fitted red curve the symbol a and b in eq 8 represents shape parameter and scale parameter respectively fitting the gamma probability density function to bat biometrics data yielded a 3 22 and b 4 09 the corresponding probability density function of projected area for monte carlo simulations is computed by using the relationship in eq 5 8 f x 1 b a γ a x a 1 e x b x 0 however it should be noted that in case of single bat fatality case the uniform distribution describing the range of bat mass of a specific species prakash and markfort 2021 was used for sampling the bat mass in the monte carlo based ballistics model simulations 3 3 3 drag coefficient cd present study uses the drag coefficient range 0 70 1 23 of bat carcasses established in prakash and markfort 2020 the uniform distribution characterized by eq 9 was used as an input probability density function for sampling carcass drag coefficient in the monte carlo based ballistic model simulations the symbol c and d in eq 9 are the lower and upper bounds of the uniform distribution 9 f x 1 d c 0 c x d otherwise 3 3 4 bat radial r and angular θ strike location the bat radial 0 54 m and angular strike locations 0 360 on the rotor plane in the present study were approximated by the uniform distribution 3 5 5 bat flight speed vbat and bat strike angle ψ in the past few studies have reported the bat flight speeds which are mentioned here hayward and davis 1964 summarized the flight speed of the big brown bats in the range of 2 7 m s mccracken et al 2016 examined the flight behavior of seven brazilian free tailed bats and reported the median flight speed as 5 7 m s martin et al 2017 reported the flight speeds of species of concern in the midwestern region e g indiana bat little brown bat between 5 and 10 m s based on above mentioned studies the bat flight speed was approximated as the uniform distribution between 5 and 10 m s in downwind direction for conducting monte carlo based ballistic model simulations bat strike angle was also modelled as the uniform distribution in the range of 90 upwind to 90 downwind 3 3 6 yaw φ site averaged nightly yaw data fig 9 of macksburg wind farm between 8 pm and 5 am was used for incorporating yaw in the monte carlo based ballistics model simulations the figure shows two peaks around 0 and 180 indicating most of the time wind blows either from the north or the south during bat migration season for accounting the effect of wind direction on carcass fall zone distributions firstly monte carlo simulations were conducted for wind direction normal to the rotor plane to determine the carcass fall zone distributions afterwards the modelled yaw distribution was applied to the computed ground impact patterns to estimate the carcass fall zone distributions thereby accounting for the wind direction variability yaw is characterized by the kernel density function atanasiu 2020 for random sampling to be used as an input in the proposed model a kernel distribution is nonparametric probability density function of a random variable and is used in either of the following two situations i when a parametric distribution is not able to describe the data appropriately or ii in order to avoid making assumptions about the underlying distribution of the dataset it is defined by a smoothing function k and a bandwidth value h that affects how smooth is the resultant curve the kernel density estimator is expressed by eq 10 as 10 f x 1 n h j 1 n k x x j h x r where n is the sample size and xj j 1 2 n are the values that random sampling from an unknown distribution generates fig 9 displays the site averaged nightly wind direction histogram and fitted kernel density function shown by red curve 4 results 4 1 monte carlo based 3 d ballistics model simulations this section describes the integration of monte carlo methodology with the 3 d ballistics model to generate the computations of carcass fall zone distributions for following cases a bat fatality listed as last night invariant yaw with carcass normal distance 10 m b bat fatality discovered on fourth day after the strike c case which includes multiple bat species interacting with turbine blades during the bat migration season d sensitivity of carcass fall zone distributions with respect to bat radial strike location probability density function choice it should be noted here that in these simulations we are using a constant value of e as 0 1 martin et al 2017 the optimal number of monte carlo simulations are determined by running different number of monte carlo realizations and computing the standard deviation of carcass total distance in each of these cases the process is stopped when the variation of the standard deviation achieves the asymptotic state in our case this feature was found for 5000 realizations and the results in the subsequent sections are presented for 5000 realizations of monte carlo based ballistics model simulations 4 1 1 fall zone distribution for last night invariant yaw with carcass normal distance 10 m bat fatality using carcass survey and scada records of 2018 prakash and markfort 2021 identified the bat fatalities for which the carcass position with respect to the rotor plane can be established with confidence and these fatalities were named as last night invariant yaw with carcass normal distance 10 m a hoary bat out of these classified fatalities was selected for comparing the modelled distribution with the carcass survey location to validate the proposed model the described bat fatality happened at turbine 44 with carcass search date reported as 8th september 2018 the carcass in plane and normal distance was computed as 18 m and 35 m respectively the yaw mean and standard deviation was observed to be 46 and 4 respectively for running monte carlo simulations the probability density functions and corresponding ranges of the input parameters i e drag coefficient bat flight speed bat strike angle and bat radial and angular strike locations were selected on the basis of section 3 3 however since it is a single species case of the hoary bat mass was assumed to be uniformly distributed in the range of 18 38 g as reported in prakash and markfort 2021 the corresponding projected area was computed using the relationship described in eq 5 the wind speed and yaw data for 8 pm on 7th september to 5 am on 8th september was selected for running the simulation fig 10 a and b show the wind speed and yaw histogram obtained from scada along with the fitted ggd and kernel density functions respectively the random sampling of wind speed and yaw is done from fitted ggd and kernel density function respectively to conduct monte carlo simulations for the four cases described in section 4 1 nieslony 2020 fig 11 shows the carcass fall zone distribution of the above mentioned hoary bat fatality obtained from monte carlo based ballistics model simulations with the carcass survey location denoted by x in red superimposed over it the black dot in the figure shows the turbine location whereas the arrow shows the wind direction at an angle of 46 it is evident from the figure that the recorded carcass survey position is within the periphery of the modelled distribution and overlaps with the fall zone distribution hotspot i e spot with highest probability of carcass landing the result in fig 11 confirms that the proposed model can predict the carcass fall zone distribution accurately for a bat fatality in which the carcass position from rotor plane can be determined with high confidence level 4 1 2 fall zone distribution of bat fatality discovered after four days of its death a hoary bat fatality with carcass search date after four days of its death was selected from 2018 carcass survey data and was modelled with the proposed monte carlo based 3 d ballistics model the purpose of choosing such a bat fatality was to demonstrate the capacity of the model in survey planning for efficient and successful detection of bat carcasses the bat carcass was found on 12th september 2018 at turbine 34 the total distance and bearing of the carcass was reported as 44 m and 344 respectively the sight averaged nightly wind speed and yaw were extracted from scada records for four consecutive days 8th september 12th september fig 12 shows the wind speed and yaw histogram and fitted probability density functions selected according to section 3 3 for the considered bat fatality mass was assumed to be uniformly distributed 18 38 g as it was in the previous case of the hoary bat fatality fig 13 shows the comparison of the modelled fall zone distribution of this hoary bat fatality with reported carcass survey location denoted by red x it is evident from the figure that the carcass observed location lies within the modelled fall zone distribution obtained from the proposed model and is adjacent to the hotspot of the carcass fall zone distribution this is an interesting finding as it demonstrates that if the wind speed and wind direction forecast is known the proposed model can be implemented to send the surveyors towards the spots with highest probability of carcass landing resulting in successful survey campaigns at a wind facility 4 1 3 fall zone distribution for bat migration season with multiple bat species striking turbine blades the monte carlo based 3 d ballistics model was further applied for fall migration season involving multiple bat species interacting with turbine blades this particular case represents the range of plausible uncertainties in the input parameters of the ballistics model during the three month window of bat migration activity the sampling of all the input parameters of the ballistics model was performed by considering the probability density function described in section 3 3 it should be noted here that for the full season case the bat mass is modelled as the gamma distribution fig 8 involving multiple bat species fig 14 a and b show the modeled 1 d and 2 d carcass fall zone distributions obtained using the proposed model for full migration season at macksburg wind farm it is noticeable from fig 14 a that 48 of the bat fatalities fall within first 50 m distance from the turbine base the modelled maximum total distance was 185 m as compared to the observed 90 m distance from the carcass survey data fig 15 displays the comparison of carcass surveyed and modeled fall zone distributions in fig 15 a for surveyed 1 d fall zone distribution almost 25 of discovered carcasses were found in the first bin of 0 10 m whereas for modelled 1 d fall zone distribution there are very few bat mortalities in the first bin fig 15 b highlights nice overlap of 2 d fall zone distribution obtained from monte carlo based ballistics model simulations with surveyed carcasses shown by red cross x it was hypothesized that the plausible reason of difference between surveyed and modelled 1 d fall zone distribution in the first few bins is because of the uncertainty in the bat strike location distributions as a next step we investigated the sensitivity of carcass fall zone distributions with respect to different probability density functions of bat strike locations in section 4 1 4 4 1 4 sensitivity of carcass fall zone distributions with respect to bat radial strike location distribution this section discusses the sensitivity of carcass fall zone distributions with respect to bat radial strike locations on the rotor plane in the present study bats were assumed to be uniformly distributed on the rotor plane like hull and muir 2010 as there are no measurements of the bat likely strike locations prakash and markfort 2020 however kunz et al 2007 has quoted heat attraction hypothesis which says that bats move towards nacelle searching for flying insects attracted to the heat produced by the nacelle of wind turbines based on the limited carcass survey and scada records prakash and markfort 2021 found the back trajectory of bat carcasses around the rotor hub by using the 3 d ballistics model which ranged from hub to rotor tip this underpins the need to investigate the fall zone distribution results with different probability density function assumptions of bat radial strike location to analyze this effect the bat radial strike locations was modelled with the exponential distribution thus assigning higher bat strike probability towards the nacelle region the exponential distribution is characterized by the following expression 11 f x e x μ μ x 0 where μ 0 is the mean parameter the sensitivity of seasonal carcass fall zone distributions is tested by varying the mean parameter of the exponential distribution for bat radial strike location while keeping the remaining distributions same as in the section 3 3 fig 16 shows the bat strike locations blue dots on the rotor plane by approximating bat angular strike location as the uniform distribution and radial strike location by both uniform fig 16 a and exponential distribution fig 16 b d three values of mean parameter μ 5 m 15 m 25 m in the exponential distribution were selected for the analysis the uniform distribution assigns equal probability of bat strike anywhere on the rotor plane whereas the exponential distribution weighs the bat strike locations on the rotor depending upon the mean parameter value it is clear from fig 16 b that for μ 5 m the bat strike location is heavily distributed towards the nacelle on increasing μ in fig 16 c the bat strike locations start spreading gradually over the rotor plane and for μ 25 m in fig 16 d the bat strike location becomes very similar to the one with the uniform distribution in fig 16 a the bat carcass fall zone distributions were computed from the proposed model by approximating the bat radial strike locations with the distributions considered in fig 16 and remaining parameters with the distributions described in section 3 3 fig 17 shows the comparison of the 2 d carcass fall zone distributions from different assumptions of radial strike location distributions in the proposed model a uniform b exponential μ 5 m c exponential μ 15 m and d exponential μ 25 m on comparing fig 17 a and b it is clear that as bat strike probability starts concentrating towards the rotor hub represented by the exponential distribution μ 5 m the extent of the fall zone distribution decreases and the distribution hotspot close to turbine base becomes more evident on further increasing the mean parameter μ to 15 m fig 17 c and 25 m fig 17 d the fall zone distribution starts spreading out and ultimately for μ 25 m becomes very similar to the fall zone distribution obtained from the uniform distribution assumption of bat radial strike location these results conclude that carcass fall zone distribution results are very sensitive to the choice of bat strike location distributions which further affects the carcass planning and survey efforts the sensitivity analysis emphasizes the need of accurate measurements of bat likely radial strike locations to correctly model the carcass fall zone distributions so that the survey planning efforts do not take huge time money and manual effort fig 18 shows the corresponding 1 d total distance distributions for the bat strike location distribution cases considered in fig 16 for the uniform distribution assumption of bat radial strike location the maximum fall distance was computed as 185 m whereas for the three cases of the exponential distribution the maximum fall distance was estimated as 137 m μ 5 m 159 m μ 15 m and 177 m μ 25 m for the exponential distribution with μ 5 m approximately 60 of the bat fatalities were confined within 50 m distance from turbine base whereas with the uniform distribution approximation 48 of the bat fatalities are covered within 50 m distance sensitivity analysis results reveal that with the accurate measurements of bat strike location distributions on the rotor plane a higher percentage of bat fatalities can be discovered accurately by sampling a small area around turbines the small area refers to the search area covered by high probability spots in the carcass fall zone distributions the magnitude of small area varies depending upon bat species colliding with different sized turbine blades under different meteorological and operational conditions and in the present study it corresponds to a search area of 0 4 ha 0 6 ha and 0 8 ha for daily weekly and seasonal time scales of survey respectively 5 model applications and conditions of model application this section describes the potential areas and guidelines where the proposed model can be applied by wind farm managers for multiple purposes such as 1 carcass survey planning in order to determine the survey distance and direction a surveyor needs distribution for the following parameters to simulate a fall zone distribution meteorological condition forecast after few days i e wind speed and direction turbine operational characteristics and bat biophysical and aerodynamic characteristics if the wind speed and direction is known from a nearby meteorological station then based on the turbine operational curve corresponding functional rpm can be determined the bat biophysical and aerodynamic characteristics are represented by the probability density functions as described in section 3 3 of the manuscript with all these pieces of information plugged into the model along with turbine geometry simulations can be performed to find the most likely fall locations of bats in future days to plan and conduct the survey effectively 2 improve seasonal fatality estimates at wind farms bat fatality estimates are often incomplete due to limitations with carcass surveys such as searching around connecting roads and pads only or unsearched area in the wind farms due to difficult terrain huso et al 2014 proposed a statistical model accounting for unsearched areas by relating carcass density to distance from the turbine base hence giving the fraction of carcasses expected to land in the searched areas the carcass fall zone distributions from the proposed model can be coupled with the approach proposed by huso et al 2014 to estimate the area correction factor and extrapolate these results subsequently to compute the bat fatalities at wind farms in a year to get fatality rates 3 design turbine curtailment studies prakash and markfort 2021 performed a model sensitivity analysis and found that bats fall further from the turbine at higher wind speeds current turbine curtailment strategies shut down turbines at low wind speeds and operate only at higher wind speeds this leads to occurrence of bat fatalities at high wind speed only and in the absence of large search plots carcasses are more likely to be missed the proposed framework is useful for evaluating the effect of curtailment on fatality estimates 4 collision risk modeling the proposed model is particularly useful for investigating bat behavior near the rotor and to determine distribution of blade collisions prakash and markfort 2021 demonstrate how to use the 3 d ballistics model with surveyed carcass locations to estimate bat strike location on the turbine rotor this model along with the thermal surveillance of bat trajectories around turbine rotors can be used to develop a quantitative framework for collision risk since the simulations are based on the assumptions listed in section 3 1 the following conditions associated with its application in wind farms are given as 1 the model is applicable to conditions when a falling carcass experiences constant wind 2 the proposed model is best suited for computing trajectories of bat carcasses experiencing negligible lift force 6 model limitations the monte carlo based 3 d ballistics model is founded upon the assumptions described in section 3 1 because of which the model has its limitations in wind farm applications which are discussed here 1 the model assumes constant uniform wind in a direction normal to the rotor plane however blade rotation cause turbine wakes resulting in lower wind speed in the downwind region of the turbine which could result in reduced wind drift effect on the distance in the downwind direction we propose to include wind speed variation due to the wakes in the model for operational purposes 2 the model is limited by the availability of experimental results for drag coefficient and coefficient of restitution prakash and markfort 2020 therefore the findings of the present study are based on limited data and there is a need for further testing with larger dataset 3 the bat flight speed range is based on the limited species quoted in the literature hayward and davis 1964 mccracken et al 2016 martin et al 2017 to improve the model bat flight trajectories of different species prior to collision can be recorded using thermal video observations to provide a more complete range of bat flight speed 4 the model is limited by the dearth of information about bat strike distributions on the turbine rotor causing uncertainty in the resultant fall zone distributions obtained from the model 7 conclusions this study introduces a computational modeling framework that combines a 3 d ballistics model with monte carlo technique to simulate the fate of bats interacting with an operational utility scale wind turbine prakash 2020 the objective is to develop a tool for predicting bat fate so that impact of wind farm projects on bats can be evaluated accurately the probability density functions of input parameters of the ballistics model were modelled with scada from an operational wind farm and bat biometrics data the wind speed was modelled with the generalized gaussian yaw with the kernel density function bat mass with the gamma whereas carcass drag coefficient bat flight speed bat strike angle and bat radial and angular strike location were modelled with the uniform distribution the probability density function of rpm and carcass projected area were computed by using functional relationships from martin et al 2017 and eq 5 respectively firstly monte carlo based ballistics model simulations were performed for a well defined hoary bat fatality in which the carcass normal distance can be established with respect to the rotor with confidence and it was found that the recorded survey location is in good agreement with the modelled distribution demonstrating the accuracy of the model secondly a hoary bat fatality with carcass discovered four days after death was modelled using the proposed monte carlo approach the survey location was found to be coincident with the modeled likely fall zone distribution confirming the model robustness for planning targeted carcass surveys next monte carlo based ballistics model simulations were performed for the whole migration season using the site averaged nightly wind speed and yaw records involving multiple bat species recorded at wind farms the hotspots of modelled 2 d fall zone distribution were found to be in agreement with the recorded survey locations showing the capability of the model for predicting carcass fall zone for the bat migration season however the seasonal surveyed and modelled 1 d fall zone distributions were found to be different from each other to investigate this bat carcass fall zone distribution sensitivity is tested with respect to bat radial strike locations on the turbine rotor by assuming a range of possible strike distributions the results revealed that changing the bat strike location probability density function alters the bat carcass fall zone distributions significantly for example if bats are more likely to strike closer to the hub the fall zone radius is significantly reduced this finding underpins the need for measurement of bat radial and angular strike locations at turbine blades in order to develop an accurate model the process of conducting regular carcass surveys in wind farms is expensive surveys require significant human resources advanced instrumentation and significant time during the migration season surveying hundreds or thousands of turbines daily or even weekly and occasionally in dangerous terrains can be infeasible due to these constraints it is not possible to search every turbine on daily basis which leads to an incomplete carcass count in addition there is uncertainty about the required survey area distance and direction to be searched the present model considers the bat biophysical and aerodynamic characteristics along with the meteorological and turbine geometry and operational conditions to give the fall zone distributions of the bat carcasses this information can be used for optimizing the carcass search area and direction based on the high probability fall zones another potential application of this model is to fill in the gaps of inconsistent or intermittent survey frequency which can reduce the economic burden of performing daily surveys in future the model can be integrated with infra red camera measurements of bat trajectories prior to strike and bat strike location measurements to accurately model the carcass fall zone distributions by incorporating real world strike distributions the addition of lift force will be helpful in extending the model

24422,traps are routinely used in insect ecology conservation and pest control but the understanding of trap counts remains limited a well developed theory only exists for non baited traps e g pitfall traps and the simplest animal movement modes such as brownian motion but not for more complex or realistic situations in particular important questions as to how the trap counts may differ in case of a baited trap and what its effect can be on the population distribution in the domain where the trap is installed are largely open in order to bridge this gap in our knowledge here we use straightforward yet powerful simulation framework of individual based modelling a baited trap has a strong effect on the animal movement pattern changing it from the correlated random walk to the biased random walk this in turn is shown to have a dramatic effect on the trap counts we show that a baited trap can introduce strong heterogeneity into the spatial population distribution hence resulting in spatiotemporal pattern formation we also consider a system of multiple traps and show that the trap efficiency can decrease if the traps are installed close to each other keywords baited trap trap counts pattern formation individual based modelling 1 introduction evaluation of population abundance is a task frequently arising in ecology and agro ecology seber 1982 for instance in the context of nature conservation or pest control binns et al 2000 pedigo 1999 depending on the species traits the overall goal of a study and the available resources there is a variety of means to do it e g by direct counting of the individuals mcdonald and hodgson 2021 one of the common approaches in particular for small arthropods such as insects and gastropods is the use of the traps pedigo 1999 baars 1979 epsky et al 2008 jonason et al 2014 raworth and choi 2001 one or several traps are installed in a study area to which we will refer as a field after a certain time interval their content is checked and the number of individuals of a given species is counted based on the trap count a conclusion is then made about the corresponding population abundance in the field often the traps remain in the field over a considerable stretch of time so that the above procedure is repeated several or many times hence resulting in a series of trap counts straightforward as it may seem at the first sight interpretation of the trap count s often poses a significant challenge jonason et al 2014 engel et al 2017 boetzl et al 2018 ahmed and petrovskii 2019 in fact there is only one conclusion that can be made unambiguously if the trap count contains individuals of a given species then this species is indeed present in the field however the opposite is not true the absence of individuals of a given species in the trap count does not necessarily mean that the species is absent from the field because animal movement often can be regarded as a random process codling et al 2008 turchin 1998 their absence in the trap count may as well happen simply by chance e g if the population density is low and the time of trap exposure was not long enough it can also result from an inefficient or inadequate trap design that does not fully take into account species traits thus even the interpretation of presence absence data may bring some difficulties and the estimation of the population density based on trap counts is a much more difficult problem petrovskii et al 2014 in fact due to the inherent randomness of the processes resulting in trapping to work out a sensible estimate based on a single trap count is impossible in the case where several trap counts are available the estimation in principle becomes possible but strongly depends on the trap type or design brown and matthews 2016 a consistent theory only exists in the case of passive non baited traps 1 1 for instance for ground walking insects such non baited trap can be just a hole in the ground to which they occasionally fall the so called pitfall traps pedigo 1999 ahmed and petrovskii 2019 bearup et al 2016 petrovskii et al 2012 i e in the case where the presence of the trap does not change the animals movement pattern until they fall into the trap an alternative trap type is refereed to as active or baited traps the general idea of a baited trap is that they contain a bait or a lure something that animals can perceive from a considerable distance and that attracts them to its source i e to the trap the nature of the lure depends on the species traits for instance there are pheromone baited light baited and colour baited traps epsky et al 2008 whichever is the case the generic effect of a baited trap is to change the inherent animal movement pattern by making their movement towards the trap more likely baited traps are frequently used due to their proven efficiency in catching animals not only for monitoring purposes but also for pest control as they are capable to catch individuals of a harmful species in large numbers the corresponding control strategy being known as mass trapping el sayed et al 2006 in spite of that somewhat paradoxically any consistent theory allowing for the baited trap counts analysis is largely missing but see byers et al 1989 byers 1999 their interpretation is usually relative rather than absolute i e a larger trap count is assumed to correspond to a larger population density and is often based on heuristic semi intuitive concepts and quantities such as for instance the attraction radius and the trap catchment area also known as the effective sampling area e g turchin and odendaal 1996 perhaps even more importantly the effect of the baited traps on the distribution of the monitored population is hardly known at all meanwhile such effect can be significant as even non baited traps are known to disturb the animal distribution considerably petrovskii et al 2012 2014 we mention here that good understanding of the effect of baited traps on monitored species is also needed in a broader framework of ecosystem scale processes indeed animal movement e g in the context of animal dispersal is regarded as a major factor that brings different aspects of ecosystem s functioning together clobert et al 2001 bullock et al 2002 turchin 2013 disruption or alternation of natural animal movement patterns can cause significant disruption in the ecosystem level processes and functions therefore mathematical models of the whole system processes in particular in agricultural systems must take the effect of traps on the population distribution of targeted species into account guichard et al 2012 tonnanga et al 2017 yamanaka et al 2003 in this paper we endeavour to partially bridge this gap in our knowledge by looking into the effect of baited traps on the spatial distribution of an animal population to which we for convenience will refer as insects and the variety of situations and factors affecting the trap counts the paper is organised as follows in section 2 we describe our mathematical model and the details of simulation procedure in section 3 we present the simulation results obtained in the case of a single trap in particular to reveal the effect of persistence in the individual animal movement the strength of attraction by a baited trap the effect of the trap design and the domain shape in section 4 we extend our investigation onto the case where a few traps e g two or three are installed in particular we will show that depending on the distance between the traps they can start interacting and that can have a significant effect both on the trap counts and the spatial population distribution in section 5 we discuss our main findings and their implications 2 mathematical model 2 1 individual based vs mean field models there exists a variety of modelling techniques to simulate the evolution of population distribution in the presence of trap s they can roughly be sorted into two qualitatively different types such as individual based models ibm and mean field mf models the latter describes the population as a whole in terms of the population density usually models of this type consist of either partial differential equations e g the diffusion equation bearup et al 2015 2016 or the telegrapher equation alharbi and petrovskii 2018 tilles and petrovskii 2019 or integral equations petrovskii et al 2014 the former describes the movement of every individual in a given population jopp and reuter 2005 this information can be summarised to reveal the corresponding changes in the population distribution petrovskii et al 2022 each of these approaches has its strengths and weaknesses the power of the ibm is that it allows to account for details of individual behaviour at the microscale related to a single individual also it is usually straightforward to implement which makes it accessible to a broad variety of researchers with different background its main drawback is that it is essentially simulation based every particular simulation run uses a particular parameter set and hence by itself gives only very little information about the system properties more generally in order to obtain such information e g the structure of the parameter space one has to perform many simulation runs for different parameter values which can be expensive and time consuming the main power of the mf models is that they can in principle be solved or analysed analytically at least sometimes which can provide a general and reliable information about the system properties as a whole in practice however a comprehensive mathematical analysis is rarely possible even for the standard model such as the diffusion equation its explicit solution is only available for spatial domains with a simple idealised geometry any more realistic problem has to be solved numerically often using elaborate numerical methods so that in practical terms there is little difference between the ibm and the mf models as simulations have to be used anyway moreover for mf models more complicated and arguably more realistic than the diffusion equation there may arise more fundamental problems related to the adequate choice of the boundary conditions for instance in the case of the telegrapher equation which is the mf counterpart for the correlated individual random walk the solution is only positively defined only for a specific choice of the boundary and or initial conditions alharbi and petrovskii 2018 tilles and petrovskii 2019 given the above in this paper we use the ibm approach as it seems to be better fit for the goals of the study details of our model are described in the next section 2 2 the baseline ibm model in its movement an animal usually follows a curvilinear path however curves are difficult to analyse a common approach kareiva and shigesada 1983 jopp and reuter 2005 edelhoff et al 2016 approximates the continuous time by a discrete time with a certain time step δ t i e t i 1 t i δ t where i 0 1 2 generally speaking δ t can also be a function of i here we consider it constant in terms of empirical studies on animal movement moments t i correspond to the moments when the animal position is recorded correspondingly 1 r i r t i i 0 1 2 where r i x i y i is the animal s position at time t i hence considering the movement in a 2d space e g on the surface of the ground r 0 being its initial position correspondingly a given continuous curve movement path is replaced with a broken line a given broken line is fully determined by the corresponding sequence of step sizes l i where l i is the length of the link connecting two subsequent positions l i δ r i r i 1 r i and the sequence of the turning angles θ i between the two adjacent links since δ r i δ x i δ y i obviously 2 l i 2 δ x i 2 δ y i 2 and θ i arctan δ y i δ x i note that eqs 2 effectively describe the change in the path description between the cartesian and polar coordinates if animal movement can be regarded as random which is often the case but see turchin 1998 for a discussion of the bugbear of randomness both l i and θ i become random values defined by their probability distribution functions say s l and p θ respectively different movement patterns correspond to s and p with different properties and vice versa for instance the rate of decay in s at large l is a property that differentiates between brownian and non brownian random walks while the exponential or faster than exponential rates are characteristic for the brownian motion bm a slower rate e g a power law with a sufficiently small exponent correspond to a levy walk klafter et al 1996 viswanathan et al 1996 2011 in this study we mostly focus on the effect of the turning angle see below and hence stick to the case where s l decays sufficiently fast specifically we consider s to be the half normal distribution 3 s l δ 2 δ π exp l 2 2 δ 2 l 0 where δ is the distribution parameter the probability distribution of the turning angle is a factor that help to further differentiate between different random walk types in case of bm the angle is distributed uniformly over the circle 4 p θ 1 2 π in case of animal movement especially if considered at a sufficiently small time scale i e for a sufficiently small δ t this is not realistic as it implies frequent abrupt turns and hence cannot approximate a smooth movement path a more realistic alternative to bm is the correlated random walk crw kareiva and shigesada 1983 where the turning angle distribution has the maximum at θ 0 and the standard deviation is significantly smaller than π so that small turning angles are more likely than large ones thus the crw takes into account the correlation between the turning angle in any two consequent steps for simulations we use the truncated normal distribution 5 p θ c p 0 2 π exp θ 2 2 p 0 2 π θ π where c is the normalising coefficient to ensure that the total probability is 1 and p 0 is a parameter called persistence the smaller p 0 the more likely the movement direction in the next step along the path is close to the direction in the previous step and hence the more directed the movement is note that both bm and the crw assume that the space is isotropic i e there is no any particular direction that would be favoured by the animals in their movement although this assumption is feasible in many cases it is hardly realistic in the presence of a baited trap indeed the main idea of the baited trap is to ensure that the movement towards the trap is more likely than in any other direction in order to account for this movement type we consider the biased random walk brw codling et al 2008 where the turning angle is distributed as follows 6 p θ κ c p 0 2 π exp θ κ 2 2 p 0 2 π θ π where κ is the bearing of the baited trap taken at the current animal s position x i y i let x t r a p y t r a p be the trap position then obviously κ arctan y i y t r a p x i x t r a p π when x i x t r a p and κ arctan y i y t r a p x i x t r a p when x i x t r a p using distributions s and p the animal s movement path can be generated for each of the movement type examples are shown in figs 1 2 we readily observe that the complexity of the movement path depends on the timescale a longer time span generates a path of a more complicated less regular shape in the below we consider the simultaneous movement of n identical non interacting animals so that the movement path of each of them is generated in the same way we consider animal movement in a computational domain of a square shape i e l x i k l and l y i k l k 1 2 n i 0 1 2 l being the domain size for the initial condition we use a random distribution for each animal both x 0 k and y 0 k are random numbers uniformly distributed on l l the domain is closed so that animals cannot leave it through the external boundary when an animal hits the boundary in its random movement it is returned back to the domain 2 3 modelling trap counts in simulations a trap is defined as a sub domain of a certain shape with a characteristic size much smaller than the size of the whole computational domain as soon as animal in its movement hits the trap boundary it is regarded as trapped its movement path terminates the animal is removed from the system and the trap count the number of caught animals increases by one consider a circular trap of radius r with the coordinates of its centre as x t r a p y t r a p the mathematical conditions describing the capture of the k th animal at moment t j are as follows 7 x i k x t r a p 2 y i k y t r a p 2 r 2 i 0 1 j 1 8 x j k x t r a p 2 y j k y t r a p 2 r 2 obviously at the same moment of discrete time more than one animal can be caught let m t j be the daily count i e the number of animals caught at moment t j and let t t j 1 be the total cumulative number of animals caught over the preceding time then t t j is calculated as 9 t t j t t j 1 m t j k 1 j m t k thus the cumulative trap count t is an increasing more generally non decreasing function of time 2 4 mean field approach diffusion equation in case the number of insects in the area is sufficiently large their distribution can be described by the population density while the movement of an individual animal is often almost entirely random but see turchin 1998 pyke 2015 changes in the population density are usually more regular and more predictable in models the population density is a solution of a mean field equation as each of these two modelling approaches has its own drawbacks see section 2 1 they work best when used in combination in particular in modelling trap counts by considering a relevant mean field solution against the ibm simulations one can reveal the pattern and estimate the underlying population density petrovskii et al 2012 2014 as we have discussed it above even in the baseline case of diffusion equation respectively for individual insects performing bm an explicit exact solution is only available for a very special unrealistic choice of system s geometry however for a more general and more realistic case such as a circular trap installed in a domain of an arbitrary shape but sufficiently far away from the domain boundary the following approximate expression was shown to provide a sufficiently accurate description of the cumulative trap counts petrovskii et al 2012 10 s m f 2 u p π d t 1 α π p d t where p is the trap perimeter p 2 π r for a circular trap u is the initial population density assuming that initially the population is distributed uniformly and α is a numerical coefficient on the order of one the diffusion coefficient d can be related to the properties of individual animal movement as 11 d δ 2 2 δ t where δ 2 is the variance of the step size distribution we emphasise that eq 10 was obtained in the case of diffusive movement and it is not necessary valid for a more general case of the crw however since the crw is known to converge to bm after a sufficiently large number of steps depending on the persistence one can expect that eq 10 may on a certain time scale provide a reasonably good description of the trap counts arising in the population where individuals perform the crw that will be investigated below 3 simulation results trap counts by a single trap in our ibm simulations unless stated differently we consider the insect population consisting of n 1 0 4 individuals moving in a square l l domain centered at the origin with size l 100 except for section 3 2 where l 200 a circular trap of a certain radius r is placed at the origin i e at the centre of the domain the distribution of step size is always considered as in eq 3 with δ 1 our goal is to reveal how the cumulative trap counts see eq 9 depend on the distribution of turning angle i e on the movement type see eqs 5 and 6 3 1 effect of persistence in this section insect movements are assumed to perform the crw so that their movement is described by eqs 3 and 5 our goal here is to reveal how the trap count dependence on time may be altered by the movement persistence as quantified by parameter p 0 fig 3 shows the cumulative trap counts over time obtained for different values of p 0 we readily observe that the trap efficiency the total number of insects caught over a given interval strongly depends on the movement type in case of a low persistence large values of p 0 see the green and purple curves i e when the distribution of turning angle is almost uniform over the circle and hence animal movement is approximately brownian the trap efficiency is much smaller than in case of a high persistence the highest efficiency is achieved when p 0 0 1 when an individual insect path becomes close to a straight line cf fig 1 left we also observe that in all cases the graph of the trap count dependence on time is a concave curve apparently the trap efficiency decreases with time the reason for this can be understood if one looks into the spatial distribution of animals around the trap snapshots of such distribution obtained at a certain moment of time for two values of p 0 are shown in fig 4 the presence of trap introduces heterogeneity into the population distribution so that the insect density is smaller in a small vicinity of the trap this effect of the trap being more distinct for low persistence a heuristic explanation of this is that since animal displacement in case of a low persistent movement effectively brownian motion is slow the animals caught by the trap in its immediate vicinity are not compensated sufficiently fast by the arrival of new ones from a larger distance 3 2 is a small baited trap equivalent to a large non baited trap in some studies attempts were made to interpret a baited trap as a non baited trap of a much larger size i e with the radius equal to the attraction radius of the catchment area of the baited trap cf byers et al 1989 byers 1999 such catchment area can be thought of as a large circle with the radius determined by the animals perception distance that is in the case of a light baited trap the maximum distance at which the intensity of light is still strong enough to be perceived by the insects and hence to alter their movement behaviour in this section our goal is to check this hypothesis a baited trap of radius r b 5 is installed at the centre of the field the effect of bait e g the light intensity for light baited traps decreases with the distance from the trap eventually falling to a very small value so that the insects located at sufficiently large distance do not perceive it and hence move as if there is no trap e g performing the crw we therefore introduce the attraction radius say r a t t so that the k th insect performs the crw at the moment t i if 12 x i k x t r a p 2 y i k y t r a p 2 r a t t 2 but changes its movement pattern to the brw if 13 x i k x t r a p 2 y i k y t r a p 2 r a t t 2 thus when insects enter the attraction area they move towards the trap in a much more directed manner since insects performing the brw will almost never go away from the baited trap the attraction area plays the role of the catchment area and its radius plays the role similar to that of the radius of a non baited trap fig 5 compares the cumulative trap count see eq 9 obtained for the baited trap with that obtained for the large equivalent non baited trap with radius r r a t t for which we use a hypothetical value r a t t 35 note that since the radius of the non baited trap is rather large in order to exclude the effect of domain boundaries here we consider a larger domain with l 200 that is 100 x y 100 since trap counts depend on the population density in order to make the obtained trap counts comparable with other results in this paper we also consider a larger population size namely n 4 1 0 4 the blue curve in fig 5 shows the cumulative trap count obtained for the baited trap and the red curve shows the cumulative trap count obtained for the large non baited trap we observe that the two traps are not equivalent as the curves have different shapes concave for the non baited trap and sigmoid for the baited trap in particular at a small time approximately over the first 250 time steps the cumulative trap count for the baited trap grows at an accelerating rate as this part of the curve is convex thus in real life applications interpreting it as trap counts by a non baited trap can give a wrong misleading message as it can be regarded as a sign that the population density in the domain field is increasing and hence may lead to unjustified decisions about pest control measures interestingly the relative efficiency of the traps changes with time at a small time the non baited trap appears to be more efficient as its cumulative trap count is larger than that of the baited trap however the situation changes to the opposite at a large time in order to provide a more detailed comparison between the two traps fig 6 shows the corresponding simulated insect spatial distribution we readily observe that in the case of the large non baited trap the distribution is qualitatively the same as in section 3 1 see also petrovskii et al 2012 i e the population density in the immediate vicinity of the trap falls to a small value interestingly for the baited trap it is qualitatively different in this case the minimum population density is reached at an intermediate distance from the trap while close to the trap the density is large see fig 6 right as it was shown in section 3 1 in the case of the crw the trap efficiency depends significantly on the movement persistence i e on parameter p 0 the question therefore arise whether similar effect of the movement persistence takes place in the case of the brw in order to make an insight into this we performed simulations with the baited trap for different values of p 0 in eq 6 the results are shown in fig 7 we observe that a decrease in p 0 not only leads to a significant increase in the cumulative trap count hence increasing the trap efficiency but has a somewhat more subtle effect by altering the shape of the curve the convex part of the curve shrinks towards small time and the transition between the convex and concave parts becomes more abrupt 3 3 baited trap may lead to formation of transient patterns in this section we will have a more systematic look into the effect of the attraction produced by a baited trap we first consider a trap of radius r b 5 installed at the origin of a square domain l l l l with l 50 we assume that the attraction radius is large r a t t l so that insects perform the brw across the whole domain the results are shown in fig 8 we observe that in case of a large p 0 the spatial population distribution is similar to the case of a non baited trap i e where insects perform the crw apart from the emergence of an area along the domain border with a somewhat lower population density fig 8 left however in case of a sufficiently small value of p 0 high persistence of the individual movement the trap introduces a distinct heterogeneity into the population distribution a cross shaped spatial pattern emerges the pattern is transient the cross shaped distribution is eventually shrinking with time not shown here as insects continue moving towards the trap we hypothesise that the curious shape of the population distribution emerging in case of a small p 0 is an effect of the domain shape indeed it is readily seen that the minimum distance from the trap to the domain border i e along the coordinate axes is about 1 4 times shorter than the maximum distance i e to the domain corners correspondingly after a given time interval the insects that started their approach to the trap from locations at or close to l 0 and 0 l will be significantly close to the trap than the insects that started from the corners in order to check this hypothesis we repeat the same simulations as above but now considering the domain of a circular shape with the radius r d l 50 since the circular domain of this size has the area somewhat smaller than the square one in order to maintain the same initial population density we use a smaller population size namely n 8 1 0 3 the results are shown in fig 9 we readily observe that in this case the population distribution keeps the circular symmetry for any value of p 0 no pattern emerges in conclusion of this section fig 10 shows the cumulative trap count obtained for the two fields we observe that in spite of the pattern formation in the case of the square field there is no difference in the shape of the curves in fact they are practically the same until approximately t 500 at a later time the efficiency of the trap in the square field appears to be slightly higher e g by time t 1000 it catches a somewhat larger number of insects compared to its counterpart in the circular field that however can be the effect of saturation in the trap count curve if considered as the percentage of the total initial population size this number is higher in the circular field than in the square one 95 against 80 respectively 3 4 effect of a mixed type trap we now consider trap counts by a trap of a different design namely we assume that the light baited trap is shadowed on one side it can still catch insects that cross the trap boundary but it only has an attractive power on one side by not on the other side thus such hybrid trap is effectively a combination of a baited trap if approached from one side from the positive direction of coordinate y or in polar coordinates from the range of polar angle 0 ϕ π and non baited trap if approached from the other side negative y polar angle π ϕ 2 π thus insects perform the brw as long as their position is in the upper part of the plane i e for y 0 but perform the crw in the lower semi plane for y 0 in order to describe the effect of bait in the upper semi plane we similarly to section 3 2 consider the attraction area where we consider r a t t to be large r a t t l so that insect perform the brw in the whole upper semi plane for simulations of this type as above we consider the circular trap of radius 5 but in order to exclude any possible effect of domain s corners we consider the domain of a circular shape instead of square of radius 50 fig 11 shows snapshots of the population distribution obtained at different moments we observe that the population distribution over space is effectively a combination of two different distribution types the distribution in the lower semi plane is qualitatively similar to that previously observed in case of the crw with a sufficiently large value of parameter p 0 cf fig 4 left with somewhat lower population density in a close vicinity of the trap compared to the rest of the domain however the spatial distribution in the upper semi plane is quite different with the population density reaching its maximum in the vicinity of the trap fig 12 shows the cumulative trap count obtained for different values of p 0 it is readily seen that for a sufficiently large value of p 0 the results are almost indistinguishable from those obtained in case of a baited non shadowed trap indeed the purple curve in fig 12 is practically the same as the green curve in fig 7 both curves being obtained for the same value p 0 2 this can be easily explained as for large values of p 0 the brw becomes similar to the crw because in both cases the turning angle is distributed almost uniformly over the circle however for a smaller value of p 0 some similarity only occurs at small times for instance the left hand side part of the blue curve in fig 12 for 0 t 60 has a shape similar to the corresponding part of the red curve in fig 7 both being obtained for p 0 0 5 although the latter is considerably steeper for a later time the shape of the curves becomes rather different an increase in the trap count being much slower in the case of the mixed type trap 4 simulation results trap counts with multiple traps in this section we consider how trap efficiency may be changed if another trap or traps are installed in the same domain each of the trap is described by its radius and the coordinates of its centre for instance in case of two traps by r 1 x t r a p 1 y t r a p 1 and r 2 x t r a p 2 y t r a p 2 for the first and second trap respectively all simulation settings are similar to the above with the only difference that conditions 7 8 and eq 9 are now applied to each of the trap separately 4 1 combination of baited and non baited traps we begin with the case where there are two traps of different types placed in the domain one of them say trap 1 is non baited so its presence does not modify insect individual movement trap 2 is baited correspondingly in order to model the effect of bait as well as above we introduce the attraction radius r a t t moreover we consider the case where the attraction radius is large r a t t 2 l so that insects perform the brw with the bearings taken at trap 2 cf κ in eq 6 everywhere in the domain each trap has the same radius r 1 r 2 5 fig 13 shows snapshots of the population distribution obtained at a few moments of time in the case of the trap position as x t r a p 1 y t r a p 1 10 10 and x t r a p 2 y t r a p 2 25 25 for non baited and baited trap respectively we observe that the population distribution is strongly asymmetric with the maximum density reached in the close vicinity of the baited trap the non baited trap creates a shadow see the area of low population density at top right of the trap the origin of the shadow is intuitively clear insects walking towards baited trap 2 from the bottom left part of the domain will never reach it because they will be trapped by non baited trap 1 that they will meet on their way fig 14 shows the cumulative trap count for each of the traps as it may be expected except for an early time the trap count by the baited trap blue line is much higher than the trap count by the non baited trap red line interestingly the trap count by the non baited trap appears to be somewhat larger compared to what it is in the absence of the baited trap cf fig 3 although trap 1 is by itself non baited because of its position inside the attraction catchment area of trap 2 it gains extra catch by intercepting the insects travelling to trap 2 from the bottom left corner of the domain 4 2 competition between two non baited traps in the above we have observed that a non baited trap introduces heterogeneity to the population spatial distribution by creating a circular shaped area in the vicinity of the trap with a significantly lower population density this phenomenon is being the more explicit the lower the persistence is i e for higher values of p 0 see fig 4 this is a generic effect of a non baited trap and is seen in the mean field model as well petrovskii et al 2014 2012 moreover the radius of the low density area increases with time see petrovskii et al 2012 for details therefore if more than one trap is placed in the domain in the course of time their low density areas can start overlapping apparently it can affect the trap counts for each individual trap here we call this competition between the taps the goal of this section is to look into this issue in order to make the effect of competition more explicit we consider two different configurations in the first configuration we consider two non baited traps each of radius r 5 installed far away from each other more specifically x t r a p 1 y t r a p 1 25 0 and x t r a p 2 y t r a p 2 25 0 i e the distance between the traps is d 12 50 since the growth of the low density area is known to be slow petrovskii et al 2014 2012 one can expect that any interaction between the traps in this case is negligible until after a very long time in the second configuration we consider the non baited traps placed much closer to each other namely x t r a p 1 y t r a p 1 0 10 and x t r a p 2 y t r a p 2 0 10 so that d 12 20 fig 15 shows the population spatial distribution obtained at different time in simulations with the first configuration we observe that in this case there is no any apparent overlap between the two low density areas on the contrary in the second configuration fig 16 the emergence of such overlap is obvious already at a relatively small time see fig 16 left obtained at t 1000 the corresponding trap counts are shown in fig 17 in order to reveal any possible effects of persistence simulations were repeated for a few values of p 0 so that p 0 3 2 1 in fig 17 top to bottom respectively we readily observe that expect for some early time the cumulative trap count obtained by two traps taken together is considerably larger in the case of distant traps the first configuration cf fig 15 than in the case of close traps the second configuration cf fig 16 this occurs for all considered values of p 0 however the difference between the trap counts becomes larger with a decrease in p 0 i e when the individual animal movement becomes more directed the dashed line in fig 17 shows an estimate of the cumulative trap count obtained from the mf model diffusion equation as given by eq 10 see petrovskii et al 2012 for all technical details we therefore observe that the mf model provides a good overall description of the cumulative trap count just slightly overestimating it for an intermediate time e g approximately for t 300 1000 for the parameters of fig 17 top in case p 0 is sufficiently large but fails when p 0 becomes small p 0 1 or smaller this is not surprising in fact expected as the individual movement is approximately diffusive brownian for large values of p 0 but becomes distinctly different for a small p 0 the latter being more adequately described by the telegrapher equation rather than the diffusion equation 4 3 three non baited traps in this section we briefly consider a somewhat more general configuration with three non baited traps installed in the domain all traps are of the same radius r 5 but placed at different relative position to each other so that trap 1 and trap 2 are close to each other but trap 3 is far away namely the position of the traps is x t r a p 1 y t r a p 1 20 10 x t r a p 2 y t r a p 2 20 10 and x t r a p 3 y t r a p 3 20 0 since all traps are non baited insects perform the crw across the whole domain in order to calculate the trap count conditions 7 8 and eq 9 are applied to each of the traps based on the results of section 4 2 one can expect that the perturbation areas induced by each individual trap into the population distribution will start overlapping after a relatively short interval leaving the more distant trap 3 unaffected for a much longer time this is indeed what is observed in simulations fig 18 shows the population distribution obtained for three moments of time we readily observe that the low density areas around traps 1 and 2 start overlapping already at time t 1000 while there is still no any obvious overlap with trap 3 until much later time t 3000 since an overlap between traps tend to decrease the trap count by each of the trap correspondingly we expect that except for an early time trap counts by traps 1 and 2 will be smaller than that by trap 3 this is confirmed by simulations fig 19 shows the cumulative trap count for each trap at an early time the cumulative trap count by each trap is approximately the same for all three traps however starting from approximately t 100 trap 3 has a higher cumulative trap count note that the trap counts by traps 1 and 2 coincide at all time as these two traps are perfectly identical 5 discussion and conclusions traps are commonly used in insect ecology and pest control epsky et al 2008 pedigo 1999 for at least two different reasons firstly trap counts provide information about the presence and sometimes abundance of a given species in the vicinity of the trap baars 1979 raworth and choi 2001 johnson 1969 secondly traps especially baited traps such as depending on the species traits pheromone baited light baited colour baited etc are used for mass trapping i e to catch and kill remove insects in large numbers as a part of pest management el sayed et al 2006 in spite of this neither the factors affecting the trap count nor the extent of the disturbance that the trap can introduce into the population distribution are well understood this is particularly true in case of baited traps because their effect changes the movement behaviour e g by turning isotropic random movement into more directed movement towards the trap and hence is much more complicated than that of non baited traps in this paper by using numerical simulations of individual insect movement of different type cf crw and brw see section 2 2 we have provided a systematic investigation into the dynamics of animal trapping by traps of various design such as non baited baited and hybrid we considered both the issue of the trap efficiency i e how fast the cumulative trap count may increase over time and the effect that the trap may exert onto the spatial population distribution in the domain where the trap is installed our main findings are summarised below 1 both for a non baited and baited traps the cumulative trap count essentially depends on the persistence of animal individual movement i e on the variance of the turning angle distribution cf parameter p 0 in eqs 5 and 6 respectively the smaller the variance the larger the trap count is see figs 3 and 10 this is in agreement with intuitive expectations indeed in case of a small p 0 high persistence the movement path becomes close to a straight line and the movement pattern becomes close to ballistic correspondingly over a given time interval the number of animals that can be trapped is higher as they may travel to the trap from locations further away hence the catchment area of the trap is larger than in the case of large p 0 low persistence essentially this is a result of the obvious observation that the ballistic movement is faster than the diffusive one codling et al 2008 turchin 1998 viswanathan et al 2011 2 a baited trap is not at any time equivalent to a large non baited trap where the radius for the latter is defined as the radius of the attraction area of the former see section 3 2 at an early time the large non baited trap has a higher cumulative trap count than the baited one but this change to the opposite in the course of time see fig 5 3 in case where there are more than one trap installed in the domain their efficiency tends to decrease with time as their growing catchment areas may start overlapping in the course of time the traps start competing between themselves this effect is seen clearer when traps are installed close to each other see fig 19 4 for a non baited trap the mean field approximation 10 derived from the diffusion equation see petrovskii et al 2012 for details provides reasonably good overall description of the cumulative trap count in case of low persistence individual movement p 0 2 but clearly fails in case of high persistence movement p 0 1 see fig 17 the failure is readily explained by the fact that the population dynamics in case of high persistence movement is more adequately described by a different mf model e g the telegrapher equation instead of the diffusion equation alharbi and petrovskii 2018 tilles and petrovskii 2019 holmes et al 1994 5 trap introduces heterogeneity in the spatial population distribution and can even lead to the pattern formation in case of a non baited trap such emerging heterogeneity is an area around the trap where the population density falls to a small value compared to the rest of the domain the effect of a baited trap can depending on the domain shape result in a stronger heterogeneity by creating a curiously shaped pattern of high population density cf fig 8 in the case where two traps of different types are installed their interaction can lead to the formation of a shadow in the vicinity of the non baited trap fig 13 we emphasise that all our results are essentially new although there is plenty of modelling studies addressing various aspects of individual animal movement e g turchin 1998 jopp and reuter 2005 viswanathan et al 2011 pyke 2015 this is usually done in the context of migration foraging and or search efficiency there is only a small number of papers where animal movement is modelled in relation to trapping current understanding of the factors affecting trap counts collected by a baited trap as well as trap s possible feedback onto the spatial distribution of the monitored controlled population is at its infancy and almost entirely lacking the required rigour here we have shown for the first time that the intuitive concept of the trap catchment area or the effective sampling area often used for the interpretation of the trap counts by a baited trap can be grossly misleading see item 2 above we have also shown for the first time that a baited trap can bring a significant disturbance to the spatial population distribution on the field scale cf item 5 this new result may have a variety of important implications for modelling agri ecological systems where trapping is often a standard part of the agricultural procedures since the ibm framework that we used in our study is inherently stochastic a question may arise as to what extent our results are representative and reproducible indeed in a generic stochastic system a single realisation e g a simulation run is hardly informative i e at best showing what may happen but not telling anything how likely that happens in the context of animal movement that applies to animal s movement path as every new simulation run produces a different trajectory however the averaging of the results over multiple realisations gives an estimate of the mean which is a stable and reproducible quantity moreover by the virtue of the central limit theorem the variance of the deviations from the mean is known to decrease with the number of realisations in our study the trap count emerges as a contribution from many individual animals with identical properties although trapping of each individual animals is an entirely random event the contribution from many such events acts as averaging it was shown in earlier studies petrovskii et al 2014 2012 that deviations from the cumulative trap count becomes negligibly small when the number of animals is sufficiently large in a system with a small number of animals similar regularisation is achieved by averaging over several stochastic realisations petrovskii et al 2014 2012 our study leaves a few open questions perhaps the main one is the possible effect of the heterogeneity of animal movement behaviour such heterogeneity may arise through a variety of reasons one reason is the individual differences that are inherent in any species in terms of our approach the presence of individual differences means that the parameters of individual movement cf p 0 and δ can be different for different animals the population as a whole is then described not by a given parameter value but by a distribution of different value s frequency depending on the properties of the distribution the resulting effect on the trap counts can be considerable petrovskii et al 2014 another source of heterogeneity is the differential animal response to the trap s attracting agent i e the bait in the present study we assumed that the agent acts on the animal movement behaviour uniformly in space as soon as animal s position is within the attraction radius its movement becomes more ordered i e more directed towards the trap however this is of course a caricature of reality it is more likely that the strength of the attracting agent decreases continuously with the distance from the trap and hence any possible change in the animal movement behaviour occurs gradually rather than abruptly understanding of the effects of this additional spatial heterogeneity lies beyond the scope of this paper but will become the focus of future work declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements this work was supported by epsrc uk through project

24422,traps are routinely used in insect ecology conservation and pest control but the understanding of trap counts remains limited a well developed theory only exists for non baited traps e g pitfall traps and the simplest animal movement modes such as brownian motion but not for more complex or realistic situations in particular important questions as to how the trap counts may differ in case of a baited trap and what its effect can be on the population distribution in the domain where the trap is installed are largely open in order to bridge this gap in our knowledge here we use straightforward yet powerful simulation framework of individual based modelling a baited trap has a strong effect on the animal movement pattern changing it from the correlated random walk to the biased random walk this in turn is shown to have a dramatic effect on the trap counts we show that a baited trap can introduce strong heterogeneity into the spatial population distribution hence resulting in spatiotemporal pattern formation we also consider a system of multiple traps and show that the trap efficiency can decrease if the traps are installed close to each other keywords baited trap trap counts pattern formation individual based modelling 1 introduction evaluation of population abundance is a task frequently arising in ecology and agro ecology seber 1982 for instance in the context of nature conservation or pest control binns et al 2000 pedigo 1999 depending on the species traits the overall goal of a study and the available resources there is a variety of means to do it e g by direct counting of the individuals mcdonald and hodgson 2021 one of the common approaches in particular for small arthropods such as insects and gastropods is the use of the traps pedigo 1999 baars 1979 epsky et al 2008 jonason et al 2014 raworth and choi 2001 one or several traps are installed in a study area to which we will refer as a field after a certain time interval their content is checked and the number of individuals of a given species is counted based on the trap count a conclusion is then made about the corresponding population abundance in the field often the traps remain in the field over a considerable stretch of time so that the above procedure is repeated several or many times hence resulting in a series of trap counts straightforward as it may seem at the first sight interpretation of the trap count s often poses a significant challenge jonason et al 2014 engel et al 2017 boetzl et al 2018 ahmed and petrovskii 2019 in fact there is only one conclusion that can be made unambiguously if the trap count contains individuals of a given species then this species is indeed present in the field however the opposite is not true the absence of individuals of a given species in the trap count does not necessarily mean that the species is absent from the field because animal movement often can be regarded as a random process codling et al 2008 turchin 1998 their absence in the trap count may as well happen simply by chance e g if the population density is low and the time of trap exposure was not long enough it can also result from an inefficient or inadequate trap design that does not fully take into account species traits thus even the interpretation of presence absence data may bring some difficulties and the estimation of the population density based on trap counts is a much more difficult problem petrovskii et al 2014 in fact due to the inherent randomness of the processes resulting in trapping to work out a sensible estimate based on a single trap count is impossible in the case where several trap counts are available the estimation in principle becomes possible but strongly depends on the trap type or design brown and matthews 2016 a consistent theory only exists in the case of passive non baited traps 1 1 for instance for ground walking insects such non baited trap can be just a hole in the ground to which they occasionally fall the so called pitfall traps pedigo 1999 ahmed and petrovskii 2019 bearup et al 2016 petrovskii et al 2012 i e in the case where the presence of the trap does not change the animals movement pattern until they fall into the trap an alternative trap type is refereed to as active or baited traps the general idea of a baited trap is that they contain a bait or a lure something that animals can perceive from a considerable distance and that attracts them to its source i e to the trap the nature of the lure depends on the species traits for instance there are pheromone baited light baited and colour baited traps epsky et al 2008 whichever is the case the generic effect of a baited trap is to change the inherent animal movement pattern by making their movement towards the trap more likely baited traps are frequently used due to their proven efficiency in catching animals not only for monitoring purposes but also for pest control as they are capable to catch individuals of a harmful species in large numbers the corresponding control strategy being known as mass trapping el sayed et al 2006 in spite of that somewhat paradoxically any consistent theory allowing for the baited trap counts analysis is largely missing but see byers et al 1989 byers 1999 their interpretation is usually relative rather than absolute i e a larger trap count is assumed to correspond to a larger population density and is often based on heuristic semi intuitive concepts and quantities such as for instance the attraction radius and the trap catchment area also known as the effective sampling area e g turchin and odendaal 1996 perhaps even more importantly the effect of the baited traps on the distribution of the monitored population is hardly known at all meanwhile such effect can be significant as even non baited traps are known to disturb the animal distribution considerably petrovskii et al 2012 2014 we mention here that good understanding of the effect of baited traps on monitored species is also needed in a broader framework of ecosystem scale processes indeed animal movement e g in the context of animal dispersal is regarded as a major factor that brings different aspects of ecosystem s functioning together clobert et al 2001 bullock et al 2002 turchin 2013 disruption or alternation of natural animal movement patterns can cause significant disruption in the ecosystem level processes and functions therefore mathematical models of the whole system processes in particular in agricultural systems must take the effect of traps on the population distribution of targeted species into account guichard et al 2012 tonnanga et al 2017 yamanaka et al 2003 in this paper we endeavour to partially bridge this gap in our knowledge by looking into the effect of baited traps on the spatial distribution of an animal population to which we for convenience will refer as insects and the variety of situations and factors affecting the trap counts the paper is organised as follows in section 2 we describe our mathematical model and the details of simulation procedure in section 3 we present the simulation results obtained in the case of a single trap in particular to reveal the effect of persistence in the individual animal movement the strength of attraction by a baited trap the effect of the trap design and the domain shape in section 4 we extend our investigation onto the case where a few traps e g two or three are installed in particular we will show that depending on the distance between the traps they can start interacting and that can have a significant effect both on the trap counts and the spatial population distribution in section 5 we discuss our main findings and their implications 2 mathematical model 2 1 individual based vs mean field models there exists a variety of modelling techniques to simulate the evolution of population distribution in the presence of trap s they can roughly be sorted into two qualitatively different types such as individual based models ibm and mean field mf models the latter describes the population as a whole in terms of the population density usually models of this type consist of either partial differential equations e g the diffusion equation bearup et al 2015 2016 or the telegrapher equation alharbi and petrovskii 2018 tilles and petrovskii 2019 or integral equations petrovskii et al 2014 the former describes the movement of every individual in a given population jopp and reuter 2005 this information can be summarised to reveal the corresponding changes in the population distribution petrovskii et al 2022 each of these approaches has its strengths and weaknesses the power of the ibm is that it allows to account for details of individual behaviour at the microscale related to a single individual also it is usually straightforward to implement which makes it accessible to a broad variety of researchers with different background its main drawback is that it is essentially simulation based every particular simulation run uses a particular parameter set and hence by itself gives only very little information about the system properties more generally in order to obtain such information e g the structure of the parameter space one has to perform many simulation runs for different parameter values which can be expensive and time consuming the main power of the mf models is that they can in principle be solved or analysed analytically at least sometimes which can provide a general and reliable information about the system properties as a whole in practice however a comprehensive mathematical analysis is rarely possible even for the standard model such as the diffusion equation its explicit solution is only available for spatial domains with a simple idealised geometry any more realistic problem has to be solved numerically often using elaborate numerical methods so that in practical terms there is little difference between the ibm and the mf models as simulations have to be used anyway moreover for mf models more complicated and arguably more realistic than the diffusion equation there may arise more fundamental problems related to the adequate choice of the boundary conditions for instance in the case of the telegrapher equation which is the mf counterpart for the correlated individual random walk the solution is only positively defined only for a specific choice of the boundary and or initial conditions alharbi and petrovskii 2018 tilles and petrovskii 2019 given the above in this paper we use the ibm approach as it seems to be better fit for the goals of the study details of our model are described in the next section 2 2 the baseline ibm model in its movement an animal usually follows a curvilinear path however curves are difficult to analyse a common approach kareiva and shigesada 1983 jopp and reuter 2005 edelhoff et al 2016 approximates the continuous time by a discrete time with a certain time step δ t i e t i 1 t i δ t where i 0 1 2 generally speaking δ t can also be a function of i here we consider it constant in terms of empirical studies on animal movement moments t i correspond to the moments when the animal position is recorded correspondingly 1 r i r t i i 0 1 2 where r i x i y i is the animal s position at time t i hence considering the movement in a 2d space e g on the surface of the ground r 0 being its initial position correspondingly a given continuous curve movement path is replaced with a broken line a given broken line is fully determined by the corresponding sequence of step sizes l i where l i is the length of the link connecting two subsequent positions l i δ r i r i 1 r i and the sequence of the turning angles θ i between the two adjacent links since δ r i δ x i δ y i obviously 2 l i 2 δ x i 2 δ y i 2 and θ i arctan δ y i δ x i note that eqs 2 effectively describe the change in the path description between the cartesian and polar coordinates if animal movement can be regarded as random which is often the case but see turchin 1998 for a discussion of the bugbear of randomness both l i and θ i become random values defined by their probability distribution functions say s l and p θ respectively different movement patterns correspond to s and p with different properties and vice versa for instance the rate of decay in s at large l is a property that differentiates between brownian and non brownian random walks while the exponential or faster than exponential rates are characteristic for the brownian motion bm a slower rate e g a power law with a sufficiently small exponent correspond to a levy walk klafter et al 1996 viswanathan et al 1996 2011 in this study we mostly focus on the effect of the turning angle see below and hence stick to the case where s l decays sufficiently fast specifically we consider s to be the half normal distribution 3 s l δ 2 δ π exp l 2 2 δ 2 l 0 where δ is the distribution parameter the probability distribution of the turning angle is a factor that help to further differentiate between different random walk types in case of bm the angle is distributed uniformly over the circle 4 p θ 1 2 π in case of animal movement especially if considered at a sufficiently small time scale i e for a sufficiently small δ t this is not realistic as it implies frequent abrupt turns and hence cannot approximate a smooth movement path a more realistic alternative to bm is the correlated random walk crw kareiva and shigesada 1983 where the turning angle distribution has the maximum at θ 0 and the standard deviation is significantly smaller than π so that small turning angles are more likely than large ones thus the crw takes into account the correlation between the turning angle in any two consequent steps for simulations we use the truncated normal distribution 5 p θ c p 0 2 π exp θ 2 2 p 0 2 π θ π where c is the normalising coefficient to ensure that the total probability is 1 and p 0 is a parameter called persistence the smaller p 0 the more likely the movement direction in the next step along the path is close to the direction in the previous step and hence the more directed the movement is note that both bm and the crw assume that the space is isotropic i e there is no any particular direction that would be favoured by the animals in their movement although this assumption is feasible in many cases it is hardly realistic in the presence of a baited trap indeed the main idea of the baited trap is to ensure that the movement towards the trap is more likely than in any other direction in order to account for this movement type we consider the biased random walk brw codling et al 2008 where the turning angle is distributed as follows 6 p θ κ c p 0 2 π exp θ κ 2 2 p 0 2 π θ π where κ is the bearing of the baited trap taken at the current animal s position x i y i let x t r a p y t r a p be the trap position then obviously κ arctan y i y t r a p x i x t r a p π when x i x t r a p and κ arctan y i y t r a p x i x t r a p when x i x t r a p using distributions s and p the animal s movement path can be generated for each of the movement type examples are shown in figs 1 2 we readily observe that the complexity of the movement path depends on the timescale a longer time span generates a path of a more complicated less regular shape in the below we consider the simultaneous movement of n identical non interacting animals so that the movement path of each of them is generated in the same way we consider animal movement in a computational domain of a square shape i e l x i k l and l y i k l k 1 2 n i 0 1 2 l being the domain size for the initial condition we use a random distribution for each animal both x 0 k and y 0 k are random numbers uniformly distributed on l l the domain is closed so that animals cannot leave it through the external boundary when an animal hits the boundary in its random movement it is returned back to the domain 2 3 modelling trap counts in simulations a trap is defined as a sub domain of a certain shape with a characteristic size much smaller than the size of the whole computational domain as soon as animal in its movement hits the trap boundary it is regarded as trapped its movement path terminates the animal is removed from the system and the trap count the number of caught animals increases by one consider a circular trap of radius r with the coordinates of its centre as x t r a p y t r a p the mathematical conditions describing the capture of the k th animal at moment t j are as follows 7 x i k x t r a p 2 y i k y t r a p 2 r 2 i 0 1 j 1 8 x j k x t r a p 2 y j k y t r a p 2 r 2 obviously at the same moment of discrete time more than one animal can be caught let m t j be the daily count i e the number of animals caught at moment t j and let t t j 1 be the total cumulative number of animals caught over the preceding time then t t j is calculated as 9 t t j t t j 1 m t j k 1 j m t k thus the cumulative trap count t is an increasing more generally non decreasing function of time 2 4 mean field approach diffusion equation in case the number of insects in the area is sufficiently large their distribution can be described by the population density while the movement of an individual animal is often almost entirely random but see turchin 1998 pyke 2015 changes in the population density are usually more regular and more predictable in models the population density is a solution of a mean field equation as each of these two modelling approaches has its own drawbacks see section 2 1 they work best when used in combination in particular in modelling trap counts by considering a relevant mean field solution against the ibm simulations one can reveal the pattern and estimate the underlying population density petrovskii et al 2012 2014 as we have discussed it above even in the baseline case of diffusion equation respectively for individual insects performing bm an explicit exact solution is only available for a very special unrealistic choice of system s geometry however for a more general and more realistic case such as a circular trap installed in a domain of an arbitrary shape but sufficiently far away from the domain boundary the following approximate expression was shown to provide a sufficiently accurate description of the cumulative trap counts petrovskii et al 2012 10 s m f 2 u p π d t 1 α π p d t where p is the trap perimeter p 2 π r for a circular trap u is the initial population density assuming that initially the population is distributed uniformly and α is a numerical coefficient on the order of one the diffusion coefficient d can be related to the properties of individual animal movement as 11 d δ 2 2 δ t where δ 2 is the variance of the step size distribution we emphasise that eq 10 was obtained in the case of diffusive movement and it is not necessary valid for a more general case of the crw however since the crw is known to converge to bm after a sufficiently large number of steps depending on the persistence one can expect that eq 10 may on a certain time scale provide a reasonably good description of the trap counts arising in the population where individuals perform the crw that will be investigated below 3 simulation results trap counts by a single trap in our ibm simulations unless stated differently we consider the insect population consisting of n 1 0 4 individuals moving in a square l l domain centered at the origin with size l 100 except for section 3 2 where l 200 a circular trap of a certain radius r is placed at the origin i e at the centre of the domain the distribution of step size is always considered as in eq 3 with δ 1 our goal is to reveal how the cumulative trap counts see eq 9 depend on the distribution of turning angle i e on the movement type see eqs 5 and 6 3 1 effect of persistence in this section insect movements are assumed to perform the crw so that their movement is described by eqs 3 and 5 our goal here is to reveal how the trap count dependence on time may be altered by the movement persistence as quantified by parameter p 0 fig 3 shows the cumulative trap counts over time obtained for different values of p 0 we readily observe that the trap efficiency the total number of insects caught over a given interval strongly depends on the movement type in case of a low persistence large values of p 0 see the green and purple curves i e when the distribution of turning angle is almost uniform over the circle and hence animal movement is approximately brownian the trap efficiency is much smaller than in case of a high persistence the highest efficiency is achieved when p 0 0 1 when an individual insect path becomes close to a straight line cf fig 1 left we also observe that in all cases the graph of the trap count dependence on time is a concave curve apparently the trap efficiency decreases with time the reason for this can be understood if one looks into the spatial distribution of animals around the trap snapshots of such distribution obtained at a certain moment of time for two values of p 0 are shown in fig 4 the presence of trap introduces heterogeneity into the population distribution so that the insect density is smaller in a small vicinity of the trap this effect of the trap being more distinct for low persistence a heuristic explanation of this is that since animal displacement in case of a low persistent movement effectively brownian motion is slow the animals caught by the trap in its immediate vicinity are not compensated sufficiently fast by the arrival of new ones from a larger distance 3 2 is a small baited trap equivalent to a large non baited trap in some studies attempts were made to interpret a baited trap as a non baited trap of a much larger size i e with the radius equal to the attraction radius of the catchment area of the baited trap cf byers et al 1989 byers 1999 such catchment area can be thought of as a large circle with the radius determined by the animals perception distance that is in the case of a light baited trap the maximum distance at which the intensity of light is still strong enough to be perceived by the insects and hence to alter their movement behaviour in this section our goal is to check this hypothesis a baited trap of radius r b 5 is installed at the centre of the field the effect of bait e g the light intensity for light baited traps decreases with the distance from the trap eventually falling to a very small value so that the insects located at sufficiently large distance do not perceive it and hence move as if there is no trap e g performing the crw we therefore introduce the attraction radius say r a t t so that the k th insect performs the crw at the moment t i if 12 x i k x t r a p 2 y i k y t r a p 2 r a t t 2 but changes its movement pattern to the brw if 13 x i k x t r a p 2 y i k y t r a p 2 r a t t 2 thus when insects enter the attraction area they move towards the trap in a much more directed manner since insects performing the brw will almost never go away from the baited trap the attraction area plays the role of the catchment area and its radius plays the role similar to that of the radius of a non baited trap fig 5 compares the cumulative trap count see eq 9 obtained for the baited trap with that obtained for the large equivalent non baited trap with radius r r a t t for which we use a hypothetical value r a t t 35 note that since the radius of the non baited trap is rather large in order to exclude the effect of domain boundaries here we consider a larger domain with l 200 that is 100 x y 100 since trap counts depend on the population density in order to make the obtained trap counts comparable with other results in this paper we also consider a larger population size namely n 4 1 0 4 the blue curve in fig 5 shows the cumulative trap count obtained for the baited trap and the red curve shows the cumulative trap count obtained for the large non baited trap we observe that the two traps are not equivalent as the curves have different shapes concave for the non baited trap and sigmoid for the baited trap in particular at a small time approximately over the first 250 time steps the cumulative trap count for the baited trap grows at an accelerating rate as this part of the curve is convex thus in real life applications interpreting it as trap counts by a non baited trap can give a wrong misleading message as it can be regarded as a sign that the population density in the domain field is increasing and hence may lead to unjustified decisions about pest control measures interestingly the relative efficiency of the traps changes with time at a small time the non baited trap appears to be more efficient as its cumulative trap count is larger than that of the baited trap however the situation changes to the opposite at a large time in order to provide a more detailed comparison between the two traps fig 6 shows the corresponding simulated insect spatial distribution we readily observe that in the case of the large non baited trap the distribution is qualitatively the same as in section 3 1 see also petrovskii et al 2012 i e the population density in the immediate vicinity of the trap falls to a small value interestingly for the baited trap it is qualitatively different in this case the minimum population density is reached at an intermediate distance from the trap while close to the trap the density is large see fig 6 right as it was shown in section 3 1 in the case of the crw the trap efficiency depends significantly on the movement persistence i e on parameter p 0 the question therefore arise whether similar effect of the movement persistence takes place in the case of the brw in order to make an insight into this we performed simulations with the baited trap for different values of p 0 in eq 6 the results are shown in fig 7 we observe that a decrease in p 0 not only leads to a significant increase in the cumulative trap count hence increasing the trap efficiency but has a somewhat more subtle effect by altering the shape of the curve the convex part of the curve shrinks towards small time and the transition between the convex and concave parts becomes more abrupt 3 3 baited trap may lead to formation of transient patterns in this section we will have a more systematic look into the effect of the attraction produced by a baited trap we first consider a trap of radius r b 5 installed at the origin of a square domain l l l l with l 50 we assume that the attraction radius is large r a t t l so that insects perform the brw across the whole domain the results are shown in fig 8 we observe that in case of a large p 0 the spatial population distribution is similar to the case of a non baited trap i e where insects perform the crw apart from the emergence of an area along the domain border with a somewhat lower population density fig 8 left however in case of a sufficiently small value of p 0 high persistence of the individual movement the trap introduces a distinct heterogeneity into the population distribution a cross shaped spatial pattern emerges the pattern is transient the cross shaped distribution is eventually shrinking with time not shown here as insects continue moving towards the trap we hypothesise that the curious shape of the population distribution emerging in case of a small p 0 is an effect of the domain shape indeed it is readily seen that the minimum distance from the trap to the domain border i e along the coordinate axes is about 1 4 times shorter than the maximum distance i e to the domain corners correspondingly after a given time interval the insects that started their approach to the trap from locations at or close to l 0 and 0 l will be significantly close to the trap than the insects that started from the corners in order to check this hypothesis we repeat the same simulations as above but now considering the domain of a circular shape with the radius r d l 50 since the circular domain of this size has the area somewhat smaller than the square one in order to maintain the same initial population density we use a smaller population size namely n 8 1 0 3 the results are shown in fig 9 we readily observe that in this case the population distribution keeps the circular symmetry for any value of p 0 no pattern emerges in conclusion of this section fig 10 shows the cumulative trap count obtained for the two fields we observe that in spite of the pattern formation in the case of the square field there is no difference in the shape of the curves in fact they are practically the same until approximately t 500 at a later time the efficiency of the trap in the square field appears to be slightly higher e g by time t 1000 it catches a somewhat larger number of insects compared to its counterpart in the circular field that however can be the effect of saturation in the trap count curve if considered as the percentage of the total initial population size this number is higher in the circular field than in the square one 95 against 80 respectively 3 4 effect of a mixed type trap we now consider trap counts by a trap of a different design namely we assume that the light baited trap is shadowed on one side it can still catch insects that cross the trap boundary but it only has an attractive power on one side by not on the other side thus such hybrid trap is effectively a combination of a baited trap if approached from one side from the positive direction of coordinate y or in polar coordinates from the range of polar angle 0 ϕ π and non baited trap if approached from the other side negative y polar angle π ϕ 2 π thus insects perform the brw as long as their position is in the upper part of the plane i e for y 0 but perform the crw in the lower semi plane for y 0 in order to describe the effect of bait in the upper semi plane we similarly to section 3 2 consider the attraction area where we consider r a t t to be large r a t t l so that insect perform the brw in the whole upper semi plane for simulations of this type as above we consider the circular trap of radius 5 but in order to exclude any possible effect of domain s corners we consider the domain of a circular shape instead of square of radius 50 fig 11 shows snapshots of the population distribution obtained at different moments we observe that the population distribution over space is effectively a combination of two different distribution types the distribution in the lower semi plane is qualitatively similar to that previously observed in case of the crw with a sufficiently large value of parameter p 0 cf fig 4 left with somewhat lower population density in a close vicinity of the trap compared to the rest of the domain however the spatial distribution in the upper semi plane is quite different with the population density reaching its maximum in the vicinity of the trap fig 12 shows the cumulative trap count obtained for different values of p 0 it is readily seen that for a sufficiently large value of p 0 the results are almost indistinguishable from those obtained in case of a baited non shadowed trap indeed the purple curve in fig 12 is practically the same as the green curve in fig 7 both curves being obtained for the same value p 0 2 this can be easily explained as for large values of p 0 the brw becomes similar to the crw because in both cases the turning angle is distributed almost uniformly over the circle however for a smaller value of p 0 some similarity only occurs at small times for instance the left hand side part of the blue curve in fig 12 for 0 t 60 has a shape similar to the corresponding part of the red curve in fig 7 both being obtained for p 0 0 5 although the latter is considerably steeper for a later time the shape of the curves becomes rather different an increase in the trap count being much slower in the case of the mixed type trap 4 simulation results trap counts with multiple traps in this section we consider how trap efficiency may be changed if another trap or traps are installed in the same domain each of the trap is described by its radius and the coordinates of its centre for instance in case of two traps by r 1 x t r a p 1 y t r a p 1 and r 2 x t r a p 2 y t r a p 2 for the first and second trap respectively all simulation settings are similar to the above with the only difference that conditions 7 8 and eq 9 are now applied to each of the trap separately 4 1 combination of baited and non baited traps we begin with the case where there are two traps of different types placed in the domain one of them say trap 1 is non baited so its presence does not modify insect individual movement trap 2 is baited correspondingly in order to model the effect of bait as well as above we introduce the attraction radius r a t t moreover we consider the case where the attraction radius is large r a t t 2 l so that insects perform the brw with the bearings taken at trap 2 cf κ in eq 6 everywhere in the domain each trap has the same radius r 1 r 2 5 fig 13 shows snapshots of the population distribution obtained at a few moments of time in the case of the trap position as x t r a p 1 y t r a p 1 10 10 and x t r a p 2 y t r a p 2 25 25 for non baited and baited trap respectively we observe that the population distribution is strongly asymmetric with the maximum density reached in the close vicinity of the baited trap the non baited trap creates a shadow see the area of low population density at top right of the trap the origin of the shadow is intuitively clear insects walking towards baited trap 2 from the bottom left part of the domain will never reach it because they will be trapped by non baited trap 1 that they will meet on their way fig 14 shows the cumulative trap count for each of the traps as it may be expected except for an early time the trap count by the baited trap blue line is much higher than the trap count by the non baited trap red line interestingly the trap count by the non baited trap appears to be somewhat larger compared to what it is in the absence of the baited trap cf fig 3 although trap 1 is by itself non baited because of its position inside the attraction catchment area of trap 2 it gains extra catch by intercepting the insects travelling to trap 2 from the bottom left corner of the domain 4 2 competition between two non baited traps in the above we have observed that a non baited trap introduces heterogeneity to the population spatial distribution by creating a circular shaped area in the vicinity of the trap with a significantly lower population density this phenomenon is being the more explicit the lower the persistence is i e for higher values of p 0 see fig 4 this is a generic effect of a non baited trap and is seen in the mean field model as well petrovskii et al 2014 2012 moreover the radius of the low density area increases with time see petrovskii et al 2012 for details therefore if more than one trap is placed in the domain in the course of time their low density areas can start overlapping apparently it can affect the trap counts for each individual trap here we call this competition between the taps the goal of this section is to look into this issue in order to make the effect of competition more explicit we consider two different configurations in the first configuration we consider two non baited traps each of radius r 5 installed far away from each other more specifically x t r a p 1 y t r a p 1 25 0 and x t r a p 2 y t r a p 2 25 0 i e the distance between the traps is d 12 50 since the growth of the low density area is known to be slow petrovskii et al 2014 2012 one can expect that any interaction between the traps in this case is negligible until after a very long time in the second configuration we consider the non baited traps placed much closer to each other namely x t r a p 1 y t r a p 1 0 10 and x t r a p 2 y t r a p 2 0 10 so that d 12 20 fig 15 shows the population spatial distribution obtained at different time in simulations with the first configuration we observe that in this case there is no any apparent overlap between the two low density areas on the contrary in the second configuration fig 16 the emergence of such overlap is obvious already at a relatively small time see fig 16 left obtained at t 1000 the corresponding trap counts are shown in fig 17 in order to reveal any possible effects of persistence simulations were repeated for a few values of p 0 so that p 0 3 2 1 in fig 17 top to bottom respectively we readily observe that expect for some early time the cumulative trap count obtained by two traps taken together is considerably larger in the case of distant traps the first configuration cf fig 15 than in the case of close traps the second configuration cf fig 16 this occurs for all considered values of p 0 however the difference between the trap counts becomes larger with a decrease in p 0 i e when the individual animal movement becomes more directed the dashed line in fig 17 shows an estimate of the cumulative trap count obtained from the mf model diffusion equation as given by eq 10 see petrovskii et al 2012 for all technical details we therefore observe that the mf model provides a good overall description of the cumulative trap count just slightly overestimating it for an intermediate time e g approximately for t 300 1000 for the parameters of fig 17 top in case p 0 is sufficiently large but fails when p 0 becomes small p 0 1 or smaller this is not surprising in fact expected as the individual movement is approximately diffusive brownian for large values of p 0 but becomes distinctly different for a small p 0 the latter being more adequately described by the telegrapher equation rather than the diffusion equation 4 3 three non baited traps in this section we briefly consider a somewhat more general configuration with three non baited traps installed in the domain all traps are of the same radius r 5 but placed at different relative position to each other so that trap 1 and trap 2 are close to each other but trap 3 is far away namely the position of the traps is x t r a p 1 y t r a p 1 20 10 x t r a p 2 y t r a p 2 20 10 and x t r a p 3 y t r a p 3 20 0 since all traps are non baited insects perform the crw across the whole domain in order to calculate the trap count conditions 7 8 and eq 9 are applied to each of the traps based on the results of section 4 2 one can expect that the perturbation areas induced by each individual trap into the population distribution will start overlapping after a relatively short interval leaving the more distant trap 3 unaffected for a much longer time this is indeed what is observed in simulations fig 18 shows the population distribution obtained for three moments of time we readily observe that the low density areas around traps 1 and 2 start overlapping already at time t 1000 while there is still no any obvious overlap with trap 3 until much later time t 3000 since an overlap between traps tend to decrease the trap count by each of the trap correspondingly we expect that except for an early time trap counts by traps 1 and 2 will be smaller than that by trap 3 this is confirmed by simulations fig 19 shows the cumulative trap count for each trap at an early time the cumulative trap count by each trap is approximately the same for all three traps however starting from approximately t 100 trap 3 has a higher cumulative trap count note that the trap counts by traps 1 and 2 coincide at all time as these two traps are perfectly identical 5 discussion and conclusions traps are commonly used in insect ecology and pest control epsky et al 2008 pedigo 1999 for at least two different reasons firstly trap counts provide information about the presence and sometimes abundance of a given species in the vicinity of the trap baars 1979 raworth and choi 2001 johnson 1969 secondly traps especially baited traps such as depending on the species traits pheromone baited light baited colour baited etc are used for mass trapping i e to catch and kill remove insects in large numbers as a part of pest management el sayed et al 2006 in spite of this neither the factors affecting the trap count nor the extent of the disturbance that the trap can introduce into the population distribution are well understood this is particularly true in case of baited traps because their effect changes the movement behaviour e g by turning isotropic random movement into more directed movement towards the trap and hence is much more complicated than that of non baited traps in this paper by using numerical simulations of individual insect movement of different type cf crw and brw see section 2 2 we have provided a systematic investigation into the dynamics of animal trapping by traps of various design such as non baited baited and hybrid we considered both the issue of the trap efficiency i e how fast the cumulative trap count may increase over time and the effect that the trap may exert onto the spatial population distribution in the domain where the trap is installed our main findings are summarised below 1 both for a non baited and baited traps the cumulative trap count essentially depends on the persistence of animal individual movement i e on the variance of the turning angle distribution cf parameter p 0 in eqs 5 and 6 respectively the smaller the variance the larger the trap count is see figs 3 and 10 this is in agreement with intuitive expectations indeed in case of a small p 0 high persistence the movement path becomes close to a straight line and the movement pattern becomes close to ballistic correspondingly over a given time interval the number of animals that can be trapped is higher as they may travel to the trap from locations further away hence the catchment area of the trap is larger than in the case of large p 0 low persistence essentially this is a result of the obvious observation that the ballistic movement is faster than the diffusive one codling et al 2008 turchin 1998 viswanathan et al 2011 2 a baited trap is not at any time equivalent to a large non baited trap where the radius for the latter is defined as the radius of the attraction area of the former see section 3 2 at an early time the large non baited trap has a higher cumulative trap count than the baited one but this change to the opposite in the course of time see fig 5 3 in case where there are more than one trap installed in the domain their efficiency tends to decrease with time as their growing catchment areas may start overlapping in the course of time the traps start competing between themselves this effect is seen clearer when traps are installed close to each other see fig 19 4 for a non baited trap the mean field approximation 10 derived from the diffusion equation see petrovskii et al 2012 for details provides reasonably good overall description of the cumulative trap count in case of low persistence individual movement p 0 2 but clearly fails in case of high persistence movement p 0 1 see fig 17 the failure is readily explained by the fact that the population dynamics in case of high persistence movement is more adequately described by a different mf model e g the telegrapher equation instead of the diffusion equation alharbi and petrovskii 2018 tilles and petrovskii 2019 holmes et al 1994 5 trap introduces heterogeneity in the spatial population distribution and can even lead to the pattern formation in case of a non baited trap such emerging heterogeneity is an area around the trap where the population density falls to a small value compared to the rest of the domain the effect of a baited trap can depending on the domain shape result in a stronger heterogeneity by creating a curiously shaped pattern of high population density cf fig 8 in the case where two traps of different types are installed their interaction can lead to the formation of a shadow in the vicinity of the non baited trap fig 13 we emphasise that all our results are essentially new although there is plenty of modelling studies addressing various aspects of individual animal movement e g turchin 1998 jopp and reuter 2005 viswanathan et al 2011 pyke 2015 this is usually done in the context of migration foraging and or search efficiency there is only a small number of papers where animal movement is modelled in relation to trapping current understanding of the factors affecting trap counts collected by a baited trap as well as trap s possible feedback onto the spatial distribution of the monitored controlled population is at its infancy and almost entirely lacking the required rigour here we have shown for the first time that the intuitive concept of the trap catchment area or the effective sampling area often used for the interpretation of the trap counts by a baited trap can be grossly misleading see item 2 above we have also shown for the first time that a baited trap can bring a significant disturbance to the spatial population distribution on the field scale cf item 5 this new result may have a variety of important implications for modelling agri ecological systems where trapping is often a standard part of the agricultural procedures since the ibm framework that we used in our study is inherently stochastic a question may arise as to what extent our results are representative and reproducible indeed in a generic stochastic system a single realisation e g a simulation run is hardly informative i e at best showing what may happen but not telling anything how likely that happens in the context of animal movement that applies to animal s movement path as every new simulation run produces a different trajectory however the averaging of the results over multiple realisations gives an estimate of the mean which is a stable and reproducible quantity moreover by the virtue of the central limit theorem the variance of the deviations from the mean is known to decrease with the number of realisations in our study the trap count emerges as a contribution from many individual animals with identical properties although trapping of each individual animals is an entirely random event the contribution from many such events acts as averaging it was shown in earlier studies petrovskii et al 2014 2012 that deviations from the cumulative trap count becomes negligibly small when the number of animals is sufficiently large in a system with a small number of animals similar regularisation is achieved by averaging over several stochastic realisations petrovskii et al 2014 2012 our study leaves a few open questions perhaps the main one is the possible effect of the heterogeneity of animal movement behaviour such heterogeneity may arise through a variety of reasons one reason is the individual differences that are inherent in any species in terms of our approach the presence of individual differences means that the parameters of individual movement cf p 0 and δ can be different for different animals the population as a whole is then described not by a given parameter value but by a distribution of different value s frequency depending on the properties of the distribution the resulting effect on the trap counts can be considerable petrovskii et al 2014 another source of heterogeneity is the differential animal response to the trap s attracting agent i e the bait in the present study we assumed that the agent acts on the animal movement behaviour uniformly in space as soon as animal s position is within the attraction radius its movement becomes more ordered i e more directed towards the trap however this is of course a caricature of reality it is more likely that the strength of the attracting agent decreases continuously with the distance from the trap and hence any possible change in the animal movement behaviour occurs gradually rather than abruptly understanding of the effects of this additional spatial heterogeneity lies beyond the scope of this paper but will become the focus of future work declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

missouri usa corresponding with increasing abundance and distribution as effective management benefits from sound information on wildlife demographics and spatial distribution we used a spatially explicit metapopulation model built from local data to inform a stage matrix which was used in conjunction with a previously created habitat suitability model to quantify and predict the growth and expansion of the black bear population we collected demographic data during 2011 2021 from 162 female bears with 159 young from 70 litters average litter size was 1 95 42 of cubs were female and cub survival to yearling was on average 95 for females and 70 for males the habitat suitability model identified 53 core areas most suitable for bears in missouri increasing from previous local estimates of bear population size 280 bears in 2012 the model estimated the total bear population inhabiting core habitat patches in year 10 as 732 individuals 598 873 5th 95th percentiles with an average annual growth rate of 1 11 the estimated carrying capacity of the core habitat patches excluding cubs of the year was 2700 bears but adding marginal and highly marginal habitat patches increased the carrying capacity to 5500 bears population estimates were most sensitive to variations in stage matrix parameters though overall patch colonization estimates were relatively stable our work is an important step toward understanding the recolonization potential of black bears in missouri and can aid future studies projecting large carnivore density in other areas as well as values and attitudes

fires land use change and climate change e g akçakaya et al 2005 lawson et al 2010 and to inform conservation planning early and thomas 2007 hinrichsen 2009 for large carnivore species it has been used to model population dynamics and viability of cougars puma concolor larue and nielsen 2015 gray wolves canis lupus maletzke et al 2015 and amur tigers panthera tigris tian et al 2011 within this framework we required three types of information 1 a model of bear habitat suitability which could be delineated into core habitat patches 2 demographic parameters including estimates of patch level carrying capacity dispersal and age based reproduction and survival and 3 parameters necessary to simulate environmental stochasticity this information is then incorporated into ramas gis which simulates population trajectories and when paired with habitat suitability information depicts colonization of core patches over time 2 3 habitat suitability and core habitat patches habitat patches were delineated by ramas gis using the spatial data subprogram which requires several model inputs habitat suitability layer threshold value to delineate patches and neighborhood distance we used a previously developed black bear habitat suitability layer data from 2010 2018 gantchoff et al 2022 and resampled cell size to 1 km2 originally 250 m due to software limitations to define patches we first transformed the continuous suitability layer to a binary layer yes no using a suitability threshold that maximized model sensitivity and specificity number of correctly predicted presence and absence locations respectively see thuiller et al 2009 using this binary layer we then considered two patches as separate when 1 5 km apart i e neighborhood distance based on mean daily movement data from gps collared black bears 1 km for females 2 km for males e g gantchoff et al 2020 we used a dynamic minimum area threshold based on habitat quality 35 km2 at the lowest quality and 15 km2 at the highest quality based on seasonal and annual space use for females gantchoff et al 2018 2 4 demographic parameters to estimate carrying capacity we used as reference bear density estimates from adjacent arkansas which were 7 10 males 100 km2 and 16 17 females 100 km2 with and overall density of about 26 black bears 100 km2 in 2019 kristensen et al 2019 consequently we chose a maximum carrying capacity for our study area of 0 26 bears km2 and assigned that value to the maximum suitability value i e value of 1000 on our continuous suitability map carrying capacity per km2 decreased linearly with decreasing suitability values until reaching zero in the lowest suitability areas we then calculated how many individual bears could inhabit each core habitat patch to quantify how many bears could be sustained outside core habitat patches we repeated the delineation of patches see methods 2 3 by including marginal and very marginal habitat we defined marginal habitat by lowering the binary threshold by 50 relative to core habitat patches and highly marginal areas by lowering the threshold by 70 we based these percentages based upon minimal available empirical evidence we calculated how many individual bears could inhabit these newly defined habitat patches and compared the results to the core patches alone to model dispersal between patches ramas uses a function with several input parameters akcakaya 2005 based on known dispersal distances moore et al 2014 we set the maximum dispersal distance as 200 km for both sexes combined supplementary material fig s1 and set the maximum proportion of bears that disperse between patches as 0 15 moore et al 2014 we conservatively allowed dispersal only for yearlings and 2 year olds of both sexes vs all age stages and allowed for random dispersal between patches in any direction we built a 2 sex female male stage matrix that incorporated age based fecundity and survival we defined 5 stages cubs yearlings 2 year olds 3 year olds and 4 year olds we set the first stage to reproduce as 3 year olds and the first to disperse as yearlings we calculated fecundities based on litter sizes sex ratios and proportion of females that reproduce each year using 10 years of local reproductive data table 1 we based reproduction probability for 3 year old females on expert opinion j belant pers comm we calculated cub survival using survival data from yearly reproductive checks yearling survival based on literature values beston 2011 bled and belant 2019 and 2 year old survival based on a cox proportional hazards model of collared bears 2020 2019 in the study area gantchoff et al 2020 table 2 2 5 initial population we set our initial bear population at 280 black bears 1 year old in 2012 wilton et al 2014 we conservatively set an equal sex ratio of 140 males and 140 females vs more females than males wilton et al 2014 equally distributed among age classes excluding cubs and added an estimation of cubs based on our quantified litter sizes and reproduction probability values total bears 333 we estimated the spatial distribution of the initial population supplementary material fig s2 conservatively by overlapping with bear capture locations from 2012 l conlee unpublished data rather than assuming all patches with a reported bear sighting during 2012 were occupied given the potential for bias or misidentification 2 6 model simulation we modeled 5000 replications over 10 years with an annual time step a short time period to reduce error propagation akçakaya et al 2005 larue and nielsen 2015 we included environmental stochasticity as random variation in fecundities survivals and dispersal rates within 10 i e our quantified standard deviation of the respective mean parameter values ramas gis incorporates demographic stochasticity by sampling the number of survivors from a binomial distribution parameters survival rate and n sample size and the number of offspring from a poisson distribution mean fecundity n sample size akçakaya et al 2005 this use of binomial and poisson deviates to model demographic stochasticity follows akçakaya 1991 we assumed density independent growth due to black bears in the region being part of a small low density recolonizing population as well as the short time period being modeled using of all the previous model inputs ramas gis assigned to each habitat patch 1 a stage matrix i e the leslie matrix with the age sex specific survivals and fecundities 2 carrying capacity and 3 dispersal probabilities to all other patches ramas outputs included proportion of available habitat mean patch size population trajectories local patch occupancy i e number of years that a particular patch was occupied and total patch occupancy i e total number of patches occupied at least once in the study region during the 10 year simulation moreover ramas calculated two matrix statistics parameter elasticities and reproductive values parameter elasticities also called proportional sensitivities indicate the proportional contribution of each element of the matrix to the growth rate because they measure influence as a proportional increase elasticity values can be compared between fecundity and survival on the other hand reproductive values represent the number of offspring an individual in an age class will produce including all descendants relative to the reproductive value of an individual in the first age class always 1 0 finally we tested model sensitivity by altering dispersal parameters by 50 the stage matrix i e survival and reproduction mean parameters by 5 and the stage matrix standard deviations by 50 to estimate their influence on the black bear population trajectory and patch occupancy each separate sensitivity test was performed using 5000 replicates equal to the original model using the sensitivity analysis and comparison of results sub programs within ramas gis 3 results we collected reproductive data from 162 female bears 80 litters and 159 cubs average litter size was 1 95 and 42 of cubs were female table 1 with average cub survival being 95 for females and 70 for males table 2 the bear population both sexes at year 10 within core habitat patches was estimated at 732 individuals 598 873 5th 95th percentiles the finite growth rate lambda for the population was estimated at 1 11 and the stable population structure was projected to be 29 cubs 20 yearlings 11 2 year olds 8 3 year olds and 34 4 year olds the reproductive value for 4 year old females was 3 2 times larger than for cubs of the year and the elasticity matrix indicated that 4 year old female survival was the most important stage for population growth contributing over 5 times more than other female age classes table 3 because elasticity values can be compared between fecundity and survival for 4 year old females survival was 5 7 times more important than fecundity in relation to the growth rate table 3 we delineated 53 bear core habitat patches fig 1 which comprised 13 918 km2 7 7 of missouri total area 180 432 km2 with an estimated carrying capacity excluding cubs of the year of 2707 bears 1183 females 1524 males combined core and marginal patches comprised 30 908 km2 17 1 of the state fig 3 with carrying capacity estimated at 4409 bears the combined core marginal and highly marginal patches comprised 52 970 km2 29 35 of the state fig 3 with carrying capacity estimated at 5527 bears at year 10 the bear population was estimated to have colonized 36 27 43 min max of 53 available core habitat patches though occupied 64 of patches were estimated to be at 50 of total carrying capacity those above 50 were located in the southernmost portion of the state fig 2 specifically 16 patches had a projected population of 0 bears 12 patches were at 0 30 carrying capacity 6 at 30 60 12 at 60 100 and 7 small southern patches are estimated to be above the projected carrying capacity fig 2 local occupancy indicated that the occupancy rate the number of years patches were occupied varied between 0 and 10 years while the metapopulation occupancy indicated that the number of patches occupied increased from 10 initial population to 35 patches 27 43 of 53 total core patches at year 10 our sensitivity analysis for the population level model showed that population trajectories were unaffected by variations 50 in dispersal parameters or stage matrix standard deviations supplementary material fig s3 variation of the stage matrix parameters by 5 did affect the population trajectory of core areas with an increase of 5 leading to a mean projected population of 1212 1031 1410 bears at year 10 while a 5 decrease resulted in 429 339 526 bears supplementary material figure s3 metapopulation occupancy number of patches occupied at year 10 was unaffected by standard deviations in the stage matrix but we quantified a small effect for dispersal with on average 3 additional patches occupied with a 50 increased dispersal and 4 fewer patches occupied with 50 lower dispersal likewise 5 greater state matrix mean parameters resulted in 4 additional patches occupied whereas 5 lower parameters resulted in 4 fewer patches occupied on average 4 discussion bears are currently recolonizing missouri mcfadden hiller and belant 2018 missouri department of conservation 2020 using 10 years of site specific field data we modeled state wide population growth core habitat patches and patch colonization and estimated the potential carrying capacity using multiple thresholds of habitat quality for bears our results follow similar patterns to a previous non spatial bear population trajectory model missouri department of conservation 2020 as well as observed increase in numbers of bear public reports sightings by the state agency l conlee pers comm our modeled population trajectory was most sensitive to variations in survival percentages but largely unaffected by variations in dispersal parameters likely because of the large influence of adult female survival to the finite growth rate however it is possible that ramas gis could be oversimplifying the dispersal process and therefore underestimating its overall importance nonetheless the estimated overall patch colonization was relatively stable the finite population growth rate we estimated 1 11 is greater than growth rates for black bear populations in other areas in the eastern us typically 0 95 1 05 beston 2011 but similar to estimated growth rates for the adjacent arkansas population during earlier stages of recovery 1 05 1 26 clark and smith 1994 and the previously quantified lambda for missouri in a non spatial modeling framework 1 09 missouri department of conservation 2020 moreover it is lower than rapidly recovering black bear populations in the western us e g 1 77 keech et al 2014 and within the range reported for some eastern us populations in years of high resource abundance e g 1 10 1 30 azad et al 2017 when growth rates are close to 1 0 small inaccuracies in demographic estimates could lead to incorrect conclusions about whether the target population is increasing or declining however the high growth rate we quantified coupled with previous population growth estimates public bear reports and local expertise strongly suggest that the population is increasing and expanding as the population continues to approach carrying capacity the density independent assumption we used will need to modified to account for future limitations in resource and space availability average litters sizes in eastern north america black bear populations usually range between 2 and 3 yet show considerable variation mcdonald and fuller 2001 our quantified average of 1 95 cubs per litter is slightly lower but similar to documented litter sizes of the nearby recolonizing population in mississippi 1 80 average cubs per litter 2007 2017 j belant unpublished data in contrast adult survival rates for bears in missouri gantchoff et al 2020 were greater than those reported for other eastern us bear population beston 2011 but similar to the recovering arkansas population clark and smith 1994 a trade off between reproduction and survival has been demonstrated for black bears beston 2011 which matches our observation of greater adult survival and lower litter sizes because the key factor related to population growth in our model was adult female survival being several times more influential than fecundity the observed smaller litters sizes are congruent with our high estimated finite growth rate as recolonizing populations are likely free from density dependent mortality such as starvation the survival and fecundity patterns observed in arkansas 20 30 years ago and in missouri in the past decade may be characteristic of expanding bear populations that are exploiting previously unoccupied habitat clark and smith 1994 our carrying capacity analyses estimated over 5000 bears could potentially inhabit missouri with about two thirds of those individuals occupying core patches and a third inhabiting marginal or very marginal patches many large carnivores including bears are capable of using human modified landscapes which increases the potential for negative interactions and can decrease public acceptance gehrt et al 2010 könig et al 2020 as a result human acceptance capacity could likely fall below 5000 bears particularly in marginal and very marginal habitat patches where human density is higher decker and purdy 1988 perceived bear population size can have a large positive influence on human acceptance of bears suggesting that informing local residents already living together with black bears with minimal conflict can facilitate coexistence cleary et al 2021 in our study area reported human bear conflicts are generally related to anthropogenic foods access and conflicts increased with greater amounts of suitable habitat landscape connectivity and community size boudreau et al 2021 focusing outreach efforts on the benefits of bears decreasing risk perception and encouraging responsible behaviors in communities at greater risk of conflict especially those near denser bear populations can promote positive human bear interactions and facilitate long term coexistence cleary et al 2021 black bears are ecologically flexible and adaptable clark et al 2020 and their demographics vary considerably across their geographical range beston 2011 therefore the best option to accurately model their population growth and expansion in our study area was to use local data including movement reproduction and mortality as the black bear population continues to increase it will be important to evaluate spatial variation in density predicted by our model specifically implementing a spatial capture recapture density model to be conducted in the near future in this area l conlee pers comm is being informed by the results of this study as well as previous modeling results missouri department of conservation 2020 and will help confirm and inform future population estimates we acknowledge several model based and ecological based limitations and assumptions of our spatially explicit population model data limitations include for example lack of biological information regarding specific dispersal ages and distances for this bear population or information about local carrying capacity values as well as how they vary in relation to habitat quality we assumed linear as examples of model limitations we were not able to incorporate landscape resistance to inform dispersal routes and distances despite possessing that data or develop higher resolution maps due to software restrictions in addition our model contained several assumptions was intentionally conservative and relatively simple we chose a short time frame to 1 be able to assume density independence and 2 limit error propagation haines et al 2006 larue and nielsen 2015 especially since black bears have life spans over 10 years clark et al 2021 we were conservative in selecting initially occupied patches using bear capture locations at the start of the modeling period yet other patches could have been occupied we also assumed a closed population i e without further colonization from arkansas which would otherwise result in greater population numbers a probable occurrence given the short distance among populations finally we intentionally omitted harvest scenarios since bears were not legally hunted during the period modeled yet models that account for this change in mortality sources to accurately estimate bear population growth have been developed e g bled and belant 2019 5 conclusions our work is an important step toward understanding the recolonization potential of bears in missouri and can inform future studies projecting large carnivore density in other areas as well as values and attitudes toward these wide ranging species davenport et al 2010 smith et al 2014 though data intensive this modeling approach is flexible can use published literature for data deficient parameters and provides comprehensive quantification of matrix statistics and sensitivity analyses to evaluate model results therefore this modeling approach can be easily modified to other areas where other large carnivore or terrestrial wildlife species populations are increasing and expanding however successful conservation of large wide ranging taxa will depend not only on land management that maintains high quality habitat but because of the potential for strong socioeconomic impacts also on effective outreach and conflict mitigation boudreau et al 2021 cleary et al 2021 developing such holistic frameworks will be critical

24423,despite extensive range contractions several large carnivore species have recently recolonized portions of their former range since the 1990s american black bear reports have increased in missouri usa corresponding with increasing abundance and distribution as effective management benefits from sound information on wildlife demographics and spatial distribution we used a spatially explicit metapopulation model built from local data to inform a stage matrix which was used in conjunction with a previously created habitat suitability model to quantify and predict the growth and expansion of the black bear population we collected demographic data during 2011 2021 from 162 female bears with 159 young from 70 litters average litter size was 1 95 42 of cubs were female and cub survival to yearling was on average 95 for females and 70 for males the habitat suitability model identified 53 core areas most suitable for bears in missouri increasing from previous local estimates of bear population size 280 bears in 2012 the model estimated the total bear population inhabiting core habitat patches in year 10 as 732 individuals 598 873 5th 95th percentiles with an average annual growth rate of 1 11 the estimated carrying capacity of the core habitat patches excluding cubs of the year was 2700 bears but adding marginal and highly marginal habitat patches increased the carrying capacity to 5500 bears population estimates were most sensitive to variations in stage matrix parameters though overall patch colonization estimates were relatively stable our work is an important step toward understanding the recolonization potential of black bears in missouri and can aid future studies projecting large carnivore density in other areas as well as values and attitudes toward these wide ranging species developing holistic conservation frameworks will be critical if human acceptance toward large carnivores continues increasing and carnivore recolonization of historical range continues keywords american black bear distribution metapopulation ramas gis range recolonization restoration 1 introduction around the world large carnivores have experienced extensive range contractions driven largely by habitat and prey loss persecution by humans and overharvest laliberte and ripple 2004 ripple et al 2014 chapron et al 2014 however the recent implementation of policies for large carnivore conservation has demonstrated that these declines are reversible e g chapron et al 2014 and the status of several populations particularly in the northern hemisphere is improving for example in many areas of eastern north america cougars puma concolor larue et al 2012 and american black bears hereafter black bear ursus americanus onorato et al 2004 bales et al 2005 are recovering and in europe wolves canis lupus valiere et al 2003 and brown bears u arctos swenson et al 1998 are expanding their ranges black bears are currently the most abundant and spatially expansive large carnivore species in north america even after extirpation from almost 40 of their historic distribution laliberte and ripple 2004 scheick and mccown 2014 despite numerous sources of human induced mortality gantchoff et al 2020 black bears have persisted and recolonized portions of their former range e g frary et al 2011 simek et al 2012 and are currently the only large carnivore generally established across the eastern us with stable or increasing populations garshelis and hristienko 2006 this is a result of successful conservation and management plans including reintroduction and recolonization efforts e g clark et al 2002 simek et al 2012 specifically in missouri usa black bears were historically abundant but numbers declined due to unregulated harvest mckinley 1962 and habitat loss caused by timber harvesting korte and fredrickson 1977 by 1940 the species was considered functionally extirpated from the state missouri department of conservation 2008 from 1959 to 1968 arkansas conducted a successful black bear restoration program where 254 bears were released in the ozarks and ouachita mountains smith and clark 1994 concurrently black bear habitat in missouri improved following discontinuation of unregulated timber harvesting during the early 1900s missouri department of conservation 2008 since the 1990s the number of bear sightings bear vehicle collisions and nuisance complaints have increased in missouri suggesting black bear abundance and distribution is increasing missouri department of conservation 2020 at least 7 000 black bears are estimated to occur in the interior highlands region of arkansas oklahoma and missouri missouri department of conservation 2020 bears and other large carnivores are important ecologically socially and economically therefore during recolonization it is important to conduct proactive research and management given that the public are unfamiliar with or not regularly exposed to these species davenport et al 2010 black bears in missouri are considered important for their contributions to regional biodiversity and ecosystem health as well as their value as a game species but may also be regarded as a nuisance by some members of the public missouri department of conservation 2008 as the bear population increases and expands geographically human bear conflicts will likely increase given the generalist nature of bears and their attraction to human food sources hristienko and mcdonald 2007 spencer et al 2007 boudreau et al 2021 it is therefore necessary to have management strategies in place to ensure sustainable population levels while maximizing successful coexistence with humans and assuring public safety to maintain a viable black bear population compatible with available habitat ecological carrying capacity and human tolerance wildlife acceptance capacity hristienko and mcdonald 2007 missouri department of conservation 2008 2020 science based management decisions grounded in knowledge of wildlife demographics and distribution are essential our objective was to estimate black bear population growth and expansion in missouri specifically to quantify 1 how available habitat patches are recolonized over time and 2 how the estimated black bear carrying capacity varies relative to areas of core and marginal habitat patches to address these questions we conducted a spatially explicit population analysis using habitat suitability data along with a 2 sex stage based matrix population model our model was informed by 10 years 2011 2020 of field collected demographic and movement data as well as published literature on black bears to quantify and predict the growth and expansion of the black bear population in missouri 2 methods 2 1 study area our study area was the state of missouri usa 180 532 km2 fig 1 where black bear recolonization is occurring primarily in the southern ozark highlands the bear population was estimated at about 280 adults in 2012 wilton et al 2014 and 540 840 bears in 2019 missouri department of conservation 2020 southern missouri is characterized by karst topography with elevation ranging from about 75 to 270 m karstensen 2010 forested areas represented 38 of the state and located mostly in central and southern missouri hay fields and pastures represented 29 of the landscape mostly in the west while cultivated crops in northern or extreme southeastern missouri represented 21 yang et al 2018 the climate is humid temperate with a mean daily minimum temperature january of 8 to 4 c mean daily

software package v 6 akçakaya et al 2005 a flexible modeling framework that links a demographic age stage matrix metapopulation model with a geographic information system gis that accommodates spatial habitat information we selected ramas gis as the suitable modelling platform because we i had demographic data available ii needed to simulate population dynamics iii possessed population level demographic data iv needed a platform suitable for modeling vertebrate species v required incorporation of gis type data and vi needed to simulate an intermediate level of life cycle complexity i e matrix based see luigi et al 2015 in addition ramas gis software is well established and has been used to quantify population trajectories and extinction risk of species affected by factors such as

used to model population dynamics and viability of cougars puma concolor larue and nielsen 2015 gray wolves canis lupus maletzke et al 2015 and amur tigers panthera tigris tian et al 2011 within this framework we required three types of information 1 a model of bear habitat suitability which could be delineated into core habitat patches 2 demographic parameters including estimates of patch level carrying capacity dispersal and age based reproduction and survival and 3 parameters necessary to simulate environmental stochasticity this information is then incorporated into ramas gis which simulates population trajectories and when paired with habitat suitability information depicts colonization of core patches over time 2 3 habitat suitability and core habitat patches habitat patches were delineated by ramas gis using the spatial data subprogram which requires several model inputs habitat suitability layer threshold value to delineate patches and neighborhood distance we used a previously developed black bear habitat suitability layer data from 2010 2018 gantchoff et al 2022 and resampled cell size to 1 km2 originally 250 m due to software limitations to define patches we first transformed the continuous suitability layer to a binary layer yes no using a suitability threshold that maximized model sensitivity and specificity number of correctly predicted presence and

from gps collared black bears 1 km for females 2 km for males e g gantchoff et al 2020 we used a dynamic minimum area threshold based on habitat quality 35 km2 at the lowest quality and 15 km2 at the highest quality based on seasonal and annual space use for females gantchoff et al 2018 2 4 demographic parameters to estimate carrying capacity we used as reference bear density estimates from adjacent arkansas which were 7 10 males 100 km2 and 16 17 females 100 km2 with and overall density of about 26 black bears 100 km2 in 2019 kristensen et al 2019 consequently we chose a maximum carrying capacity for our study area of 0 26 bears km2 and assigned that value to the maximum suitability value i e value of 1000 on our continuous suitability map carrying capacity per km2 decreased linearly with decreasing suitability values until reaching zero in the lowest suitability areas we then calculated how many individual bears could inhabit each core habitat patch to quantify how many bears could be sustained outside core habitat patches we repeated the delineation of patches see methods 2 3 by including marginal and very marginal habitat we defined marginal habitat by lowering the binary threshold by 50 relative to core habitat patches and highly marginal areas by lowering the threshold by 70 we based these percentages based upon minimal available empirical evidence we

for cubs of the year and the elasticity matrix indicated that 4 year old female survival was the most important stage for population growth contributing over 5 times more than other female age classes table 3 because elasticity values can be compared between fecundity and survival for 4 year old females survival was 5 7 times more important than fecundity in relation to the growth rate table 3 we delineated 53 bear core habitat patches fig 1 which comprised 13 918 km2 7 7 of missouri total area 180 432 km2 with an estimated carrying capacity excluding cubs of the year of 2707 bears 1183 females 1524 males combined core and marginal patches comprised 30 908 km2 17 1 of the state fig 3 with carrying capacity estimated at 4409 bears the combined core marginal and highly marginal patches comprised 52 970 km2 29 35 of the state fig 3 with carrying capacity estimated at 5527 bears at year 10 the bear population was estimated to have colonized 36 27 43 min max of 53 available core habitat patches though occupied 64 of patches were estimated to be at 50 of total carrying capacity those above 50 were located in the southernmost portion of the state fig 2 specifically 16 patches had a projected population of 0 bears 12 patches were at 0 30 carrying capacity 6 at 30 60 12 at 60 100 and 7 small southern patches are estimated to be above the projected carrying capacity fig 2 local occupancy indicated that the occupancy rate the number of years patches were occupied varied between 0 and 10 years while the metapopulation occupancy indicated that the number of patches occupied increased from 10 initial population to 35 patches 27 43 of 53 total core patches at year 10 our sensitivity analysis for the population level model showed that population trajectories were unaffected by variations 50 in dispersal parameters or stage matrix standard deviations supplementary material fig s3 variation of the stage matrix parameters by 5 did affect the population trajectory of core areas with an increase of 5 leading to a mean projected population of 1212 1031 1410 bears at year 10 while a 5 decrease resulted in 429 339 526 bears supplementary material figure s3 metapopulation occupancy number of patches occupied at year 10 was unaffected by standard deviations in the stage matrix but we quantified a small effect for dispersal with on average 3 additional patches occupied with a 50 increased dispersal and 4 fewer patches occupied with 50 lower dispersal likewise 5 greater state matrix mean parameters resulted in 4 additional patches occupied whereas 5 lower parameters resulted in 4 fewer patches occupied on average 4 discussion bears are currently recolonizing missouri mcfadden hiller and belant 2018 missouri department of conservation 2020 using 10 years of site specific field data we modeled state wide population growth core habitat patches and patch colonization and estimated the potential carrying capacity using multiple thresholds of habitat quality for bears our results follow similar patterns to a previous non spatial bear population trajectory model missouri department of conservation 2020 as well as observed increase in numbers of bear public reports sightings by the state agency l conlee pers comm our modeled population trajectory was most sensitive to variations in survival percentages but largely unaffected by variations in dispersal parameters likely because of the large influence of adult female survival to the finite growth rate however it is possible that ramas gis could be oversimplifying the dispersal process and therefore underestimating its overall importance nonetheless the estimated overall patch colonization was relatively stable the finite population growth rate we estimated 1 11 is greater than growth rates for black bear populations in other areas in the eastern us typically 0 95 1 05 beston 2011 but similar to estimated growth rates for the adjacent arkansas population during earlier stages of recovery 1 05 1 26 clark and smith 1994 and the previously quantified lambda for missouri in a non spatial modeling framework 1 09 missouri department of conservation 2020 moreover it is lower than rapidly recovering black bear populations in the western us e g 1 77 keech et al 2014 and within the range reported for some eastern us populations in years of high resource abundance e g 1 10 1 30 azad et al 2017 when growth rates are close to 1 0 small inaccuracies in demographic estimates could lead to incorrect conclusions about whether the target population is increasing or declining however the high growth rate we quantified coupled with previous population growth estimates public bear reports and local expertise strongly suggest that the population is increasing and expanding as the population continues to approach carrying capacity the density independent assumption we used will need to modified to account for future limitations in resource and space availability average litters sizes in eastern north america black bear populations usually range between 2 and 3 yet show considerable variation mcdonald and fuller 2001 our quantified average of 1 95 cubs per litter is slightly lower but similar to documented litter sizes of the nearby recolonizing population in mississippi 1 80 average cubs per litter 2007 2017 j belant unpublished data in contrast adult survival rates for bears in missouri gantchoff et al 2020 were greater than those reported for other eastern us bear population beston 2011 but similar to the recovering arkansas population clark and smith 1994 a trade off between reproduction and survival has been demonstrated for black bears beston 2011 which matches our observation of greater adult survival and lower litter sizes because the key factor related to population growth in our model was adult female survival being several times more influential than fecundity the observed smaller litters sizes are congruent with our high estimated finite growth rate as recolonizing populations are likely free from density dependent mortality such as starvation the survival and fecundity patterns observed in arkansas 20 30 years ago and in missouri in the past decade may be characteristic of expanding bear populations that are exploiting previously unoccupied habitat clark and smith 1994 our carrying capacity analyses estimated over 5000 bears could potentially inhabit missouri with about two thirds of those individuals occupying core patches and a third inhabiting marginal or very marginal patches many large carnivores including bears are capable of using human modified landscapes which increases the potential for negative interactions and can decrease public acceptance gehrt et al 2010 könig et al 2020 as a result human acceptance capacity could likely fall below 5000 bears particularly in marginal and very marginal habitat patches where human density is higher decker and purdy 1988 perceived bear population size can have a large positive influence on human acceptance of bears suggesting that informing local residents already living together with black bears with minimal conflict can facilitate coexistence cleary et al 2021 in our study area reported human bear conflicts are generally related to anthropogenic foods access and conflicts increased with greater amounts of suitable habitat landscape connectivity and community size boudreau et al 2021 focusing outreach efforts on the benefits of bears decreasing risk perception and encouraging responsible behaviors in communities at greater risk of conflict especially those near denser bear populations can promote positive human bear interactions and facilitate long term coexistence cleary et al 2021 black bears are ecologically flexible and adaptable clark et al 2020 and their demographics vary considerably across their geographical range beston 2011 therefore the best option to accurately model their population growth and expansion in our study area was to use local data including movement reproduction and mortality as the black bear population continues to increase it will be important to evaluate spatial variation in density predicted by our model specifically implementing a spatial capture recapture density model to be conducted in the near future in this area l conlee pers comm is being informed by the results of this study as well as previous modeling results missouri department of conservation 2020 and will help confirm and inform future population estimates we acknowledge several model based and ecological based limitations and assumptions of our spatially explicit population model data limitations include for example lack of biological information regarding specific dispersal ages and distances for this bear population or information about local carrying capacity values as well as how they vary in relation to habitat quality we assumed linear as examples of model limitations we were not able to incorporate landscape resistance to inform dispersal routes and distances despite possessing that data or develop higher resolution maps due to software restrictions in addition our model contained several assumptions was intentionally conservative and relatively simple we chose a short time frame to 1 be able to assume density independence and 2 limit error propagation haines et al 2006 larue and nielsen 2015 especially since black bears have life spans over 10 years clark et al 2021 we were conservative in selecting initially occupied patches using bear capture locations at the start of the modeling period yet other patches could have been occupied we also assumed a closed population i e without further colonization from arkansas which would otherwise result in greater population numbers a probable occurrence given the short distance among populations finally we intentionally omitted harvest scenarios since bears were not legally hunted during the period modeled yet models that account for this change in mortality sources to accurately estimate bear population growth have been developed e g bled and belant 2019 5 conclusions our work is an important step toward understanding the recolonization potential of bears in missouri and can inform future studies projecting large carnivore density in other areas as well as values and attitudes toward these wide ranging species davenport et al 2010 smith et al 2014 though data intensive this modeling approach is flexible can use published literature for data deficient parameters and provides comprehensive quantification of matrix statistics and sensitivity analyses to evaluate model results therefore this modeling approach can be easily modified to other areas where other large carnivore or terrestrial wildlife species populations are increasing and expanding however successful conservation of large wide ranging taxa will depend not only on land management that maintains high quality habitat but because of the potential for strong socioeconomic impacts also on effective outreach and conflict mitigation boudreau et al 2021 cleary et al 2021 developing such holistic frameworks will be critical if human acceptance toward large carnivores continues to improve and carnivore recolonization of historical range continues author contributions m g gantchoff conceptualization methodology data

24424,in recent years frequent outbreaks of bee colony collapse have seriously threatened food production and ecological balance many scholars have studied different factors and formed a consensus that multiple factors jointly cause the colony collapse however it is still a challenge to understand the effects of multiple factors on bee colony development due to the complex microcosmic mechanism of each factor based on the principle of system equilibrium this paper models the macroscopic dynamics of bee colony with three core states the stocks of food the population of adult bees and the population of larval bees and the internal and external factors have been abstracted as the model parameters the mathematical criteria for the benign development of bee colonies are presented from the idea of system stability and the effects of multiple factors are studied by critical parameter perturbation and monte carlo simulation the results show that the population of adults is most likely to be influenced by multiple factors that is to say the observations related to adults such as the total number of adults and the number frequency of adults entering and leaving the nest can more quickly reflect the health status of bee colony which provides a theoretical basis for experimental studies meanwhile this study reveals the effects of multiple factors on the development of bee colonies from the level of system equilibrium which is of great significance for understanding the collapse of bee colonies in recent years further according to monitoring the three core states the trend changes of them could be used to diagnose the healthy problems of actual bee colonies keywords bee colony development colony collapse disorder multiple factor effects macroscopic dynamics critical parameter perturbation monte carlo simulation 1 introduction bees are one of the most important pollinators on the earth which affects about 35 of the world s food production winfree et al 2011 however bee colony collapses are being more and more extensive problems in recent decades bacandritsos et al 2010 van der zee et al 2012 vanengelsdorp et al 2009a 2009b which would have seriously threatened crop yields and ecological balance according to the data of national agricultural statistics service a study found that the number of managed honey bee colonies in the usa steadily decreased since the late 1940 s ellis et al 2010 a more convincing survey which involved 5937 valid participants and 414 267 managed colonies kulhanek et al 2017 reported that the average loss of the bee colonies in the usa was 49 in 2014 2015 and the similar results encountered during 2007 2014 the phenomena could be caused by many factors such as honey bee parasites pathogens use of pesticide and antibiotics climate change nutritional stress and so on watanabe 2008 watson and stallins 2016 but the effects of the factors to the development of bee colony are still unclear with the development of electronic technology more and more advanced observation methods have enhanced people s understanding to the behaviors of bee colonies cecchi et al 2020 hong et al 2020 however the factors acting on bee colonies are complex and they would change with time it is difficult to evaluate their influences on the development of bee colonies directly through experiments bird et al 2021 in order to study the growth regularity of bee colony many scholars have tried to model and simulate the experimental data rowland and mclellan 1982 rowland and mclellan used two piecewise linear functions to model brood production in honey bee colonies harris et al built a population model by using empirical data to describe the dynamic of eggs larvae pupae and adults in a colony harris 1985 omholt et al developed a simple model based on ordinary differential equation ode for taking into account the intracolonial mechanics of honey bee colony omholt 1986 degrandi hoffman et al introduced a simulation model beepop for studying the influence of model parameters on colony population dynamics degrandi hoffman et al 1989 with the frequent outbreak of colony collapse events in recent decades the interaction mechanism between colony development and various factors has become a research hotspot khoury et al focused on the relationship between hivebees and foragers and developed a quantitative model for the dynamics of honey bee colony khoury et al 2011 after that they extended the model to include brood dynamics and explicit food to further investigate potential reasons for colony collapse disorder khoury et al 2013 ratti et al introduced a four dimensional model based on ordinary differential equations to investigates the long term behaviors of the bee colony accompanied with varroa mites and varroacides ratti et al 2015 2017 betti et al extended the model of khoury by increasing the effects of infection betti et al 2014 and the age structure of honey bee colonies betti et al 2016 to study the collapse of bee colony after that they also studied the effects of diploid male production on the evolution and survival of honey bee colony betti and lee 2020 paiva et al studied the effects of artificial feeding on the dynamics of honey bee colony by expanding the model of khoury paiva et al 2016 dennis et al constructed a mathematical model to quantify the loss of resilience in collapsing honey bee colonies due to the presence of a strong allee effect dennis and kemp 2016 in order to accurately study the influence of internal and external factors on bee colony development becher et al proposed an integrated model beehave to study the influence of comprehensive factors on bee colony dynamics which combines many different stressors within and outside the hive and the interactions between them becher et al 2014 2013 bulson et al 2020 betti et al also built a comprehensive agent based simulator for honey bee colonies attempting to accurately simulate bee colony behaviors and dynamics under the action of multiple factors betti et al 2017 almost all of these studies were trying to build precise models to reflect the real process of bee colony dynamics however in order to match the actual observation data the models became increasingly complex and difficult to understand especially it is difficult to give reasonable ranges for the model parameters to analyze the influences of multiple factors on bee colony dynamics therefore it is necessary to abstract the effects of multiple factors and model the interactions of core states from a more fundamental perspective based on the perspective of energy dissipation theory it can be considered that stored food adult worker bee and larvae are three main energy forms of bee colony system and the benign development of bee colony means the orderly transformation between the three energy forms therefore this paper will model the bee colony s dynamics between the stock of food the population of adults and the population of larvae and abstract the multiple factors as the model parameters and then the mathematical criteria for the benign development of bee colonies will be given from the system stability of the model and the effects of single factors on colony development will be analyzed by perturbating each model parameter around a critical condition further monte carlo method will be used to simulate the long term development of different bee colonies within reasonable ranges of the model parameters so as to understand the effects of multiple factors on colony development 2 methodology 2 1 biological behavior of bee colonies the bee colony is a highly social group with three types of members queens drones and workers there is usually only one queen in each colony and her main job is to lay eggs most of the eggs are fertilized and grow into worker bees or virgin queens depending on how many royal jellies are fed actually ninety nine percent of the bee colony is made up of worker bees and they need about 20 days to grow from egg to adult adult work bees have a clear division of labor according to their age to maintain the normal operation of the colony they are mainly responsible for cleaning the nest at 1 2 days of age feeding the larvae and the queen at 3 11 days of age building and guarding the nest after 12 days of age and they could be recruited to collect food outside normally after 22 days of age the life span of adult worker bees is about 1 6 months depending on their physique and collecting intensity the birth of virgin queen bees usually occurs in the spring breeding season which means the swarming would happen to alleviate the conflict between colony population and resource capacity during the breeding season the queen also lay some unfertilized eggs that eventually grow into drones drones do not participate in any productive activities but they are only responsible for mating with virgin queens outside of the hive obviously adult worker bees are the main force for the colony operation they collect food to feed the queen and larvae and the elderly workers will be taken over by the newborn workers emerging from larvae to continue the operation of the colony when the external food is abundant and the colony is functioning properly the stored food and the population will both increase conversely when the external food is scarce for a long time or there are some endogenous problems in the colony the population will decline or even die out therefore the colony operation can be considered as the interactions among the stored food adult worker bees and larvae as shown in fig 1 it is obvious that these three states must be orderly converted in a healthy colony and any abnormality of the converted pathway may cause colony collapse 2 2 dynamic model of bee colonies in order to analyze the influence of multiple factors to the development of bee colony this study tries to model the dynamics of the core states according to the relationship shown in fig 1 in the model the weight of food stock is marked as f the total population of adult workers is marked as a and the total population of larval workers is marked as l here we do not distinguish the types of food and the period from the egg to the moment before emergence is collectively called larva it should be noted that the mutation processes such as the death caused by the depletion of food stock and the population decline caused by swarming are not considered in the model the changes of food stock in real colonies are related to many factors such as the food collection of adults the food consumption of larvae the drying effect and the theft this model focuses on the transformation among the three core states so the daily increase of food stock in a colony is described as the difference between the net food collection of adults and the food consumption of larvae as shown in eq 1 although the adults eat the food and then feed the larvae in fact the food consumption of larvae depend on the population of larvae so here we build the food consumption of larvae is a proportional to the population of larvae 1 d f d t a a b l where a is the average net food collection of each adult per day and it mainly depends on the abundance of food outside b is the average food consumption of each larva per day which is related to both the larval inherent food consumption and the maintaining cost for a suitable breeding environment e g more stock of food would be consumed to maintain the internal temperature of the hive in the cold weather as adults are emerging from larvae the increase of adults is reasonably considered as a stable proportion of larvae in every day for the decrease of adults there are two reasons one is natural death due to accumulated food collection over the capacity of adult so the amount of natural death is the daily collection of the whole colony divided to the total collection capability of an adult the other one is unnatural death due to diseases pesticides weather natural enemies and other dangerous factors so a certain proportion of adults will unnaturally die every day therefore the daily increment of adults can be described as 2 d a d t c l a d a e a where c is the emergence ratio of larvae per day which is close to the reciprocal of the growing period of larva d is the life coefficient of adults which represents the robustness of the adults and is defined by the reciprocal of the total food collection capability of an adult e is the unnatural death ratio of adults per day which is related to colony diseases pesticides weather and colony location larvae are actually hatching from eggs and the population of eggs is constrained by both food collection and the queen s fertility which ensures the larvae have enough food to grow into adults therefore it can be considered that the queen is based on the collected food to produce the newborn larvae every day correspondingly a part of larvae is emerging to adults every day that results in a decrease of larvae in addition a certain proportion of larvae died by environmental hazards and diseases also reduce the population of larvae the daily increment of the larva can therefore be described as 3 d l d t a f a c l g l where f is the birth coefficient of larvae which represent the queen s ability to lay eggs and mainly related to the queen s age and the season the upper limit of f can be determined by the reciprocal of the larval inherent food consumption because food balance is as a law written into the colony s genes during evolution g is the death ratio of larvae per day which reflects the probability of death due to hazards and diseases finally the system model of bee colony can be described by rewriting eq 1 2 and 3 into a matrix 4 d f d t d a d t d l d t 0 a b 0 a d e c 0 a f c g f a l it s important to note that the values of the model parameters a g are non negative because of their physical definitions 2 3 critical condition of development tends based on the principle of system dynamics it can be considered that the system divergence indicates the growing of colony while the system convergence indicates the declining of colony therefore the critical condition of colony development can be obtained by solving the characteristic roots of the model and then the influence of multiple factors on colony development can be analyzed due to the state transition matrix φ 0 a b 0 a d e c 0 a f c g the characteristic equation of the system is 5 s i φ s a b 0 s a d e c 0 a f s c g s s a d e s c g a c f 0 the characteristic root of the system can be solved as 6 s 0 s p p 2 4 k 2 where p a d e c g k a c f a d e c g according to the criterion of system stability it is known that the system is convergent i e the colony is declining when the system has no more than one zero characteristic root and the real parts of other characteristic roots are all less than zero if not the system is divergent i e the colony is growing so the growing condition is p 2 4 k p and the equivalent form by substituting the expression of p and k is shown below 7 f d e a 1 g c obviously eq 7 will be reinforced by increasing of a c and f which means that the increasing of external food larval emergence rate and larval birth coefficient will promote the colony growing however eq 7 will be weakened by increasing of d e and g which means that the increasing of adult life coefficient adult unnatural mortality and larval death rate will cause the colony declining although these findings are consistent with the common sense it is important that eq 7 provides the quantitative relationship of multiple factors to further solve eq 1 2 and 3 the results are shown in eq 8 9 and 10 8 f t f 0 a 0 a c g b f 2 k exp p 2 4 k p t 2 exp p 2 4 k p t 2 2 a 0 a 2 k p 2 4 k f a c b p c g q exp p 2 4 k p t 2 exp p 2 4 k p t 2 9 a t a 0 2 1 q p 2 4 k exp p 2 4 k p t 2 1 q p 2 4 k exp p 2 4 k p t 2 10 l t l 0 a 0 a f p 2 4 k exp p 2 4 k p t 2 exp p 2 4 k p t 2 where q a d e g c and f 0 a 0 and l 0 are the initial value of the three states to analyze eq 9 and 10 it is easy to find that if p 2 4 k p can be satisfied the population of adults and larvae will be growing i e a t and l t when t obviously the condition is consistent with the result of characteristic root however for the increasing of the stock of food i e f t an additional condition needs to be satisfied that the coefficient of the positive exponential terms in eq 8 is greater than zero i e eq 11 11 a 0 a 2 k c g b f f a c b p c g q p 2 4 k 0 as a 0 a and k are all greater than zero eq 11 is equivalent to eq 12 12 c g b f f a c b p c g q p 2 4 k 0 in order to understand the implications of the additional condition more clearly it is necessary to further simplify eq 12 when the critical condition p 2 4 k p is satisfied i e a c f a d e c g the left side of eq 12 can be simplified as shown in eq 13 13 c g b f f a c b p c g q p 2 4 k c g p c g 2 f p to consider the actual values of the model parameters p is close to c g so the approximate condition for the stock growing of food is shown in eq 14 14 c g f b eq 14 reveals that the increasing of c and g i e the increasing of larval emergence rate and larval death rate is beneficial to the stock of food the increased larval death rate means less food consumption which is good for the stock of food in the short term but bad for population development meanwhile the increasing of b and f i e the increasing of larval consumption rate and larval birth factor is not conducive to the stock of food which further indicates that overbreeding may lead to the risk of food shortage in the colony 2 4 realistic range of model parameters as simulation results are related to the model s structure and parameters it is necessary to carry out simulations within the realistic range of parameters to obtain some meaningful results the range of parameters in the proposed model can be reasonably obtained by investigating relevant literatures as shown in table 1 3 result 3 1 critical parameter perturbation in order to study the effect of each factor to the development of bee colony it is necessary to let the colony on a same critical condition and then successively perturb each parameter around the critical value therefore a set of critical parameters in the range of table 1 can be determined by satisfying eq 7 and 14 a 0 04 b 0 12 c 0 045 d 0 25 e 0 001 f 0 4 and g 0 02 to analyze the influence of each parameter here we select the timespan of the simulation to be 90 days as long as a season and set a common group of bee colony states f 10000 a 10000 and l 2000 as the initial state of model the simulation results are shown in fig 2 8 where the curves with different colors represent the development processes of bee colony with different values of the perturbed parameter and the specific value of each color can be found in the color bar each curve has two stars with different colors to mark the beginning green and the end red of simulation it is noticed that the simulation will be terminated if any of the three core states f a and l reaches zero because the proposed model focuses on the stable evolution of bee colony fig 2 is the simulation result of only changing the adult collection rate a the simulation result shows that when a is large i e when the external food is abundant the population and food stock will increase significantly however the development processes of bee colonies reflect the allee effect the sudden abundance of external food will result in a decline of adult population due to heavy collection work as the pink curve in fig 2 c and then the adult population will recover because larval population increases and more and more adults are emerging conversely a sudden lack of external food will cause a decrease in collecting activity as the cyan curve indicated in fig 2 c which in turn leads to a decrease in the natural death of adults thus causing an increase in the population of adults however long term food scarcity will lead to a decrease in food stocks larval population and eventually adult population as the cyan curves in fig 2 the findings indicate that the food richness in the environment determines the size of the colony and the adult larva ratio furthermore it can be speculated that abnormal changes in the adult collection rate caused by climate change in recent years may cause breeding disorder even colony collapse fig 3 is the simulation result of changing the larval consumption rate b where the variation of this parameter is mainly due to the variable cost for maintaining breeding environment e g temperature and humidity control in different weathers the simulation result shows that the larval consumption rate would fundamentally change the trend of food stock as shown in fig 3 b while the overlap of simulation tracks in fig 3 c and d show that the larval consumption rate would not change the growing process of colony these findings indicate that the harsh environment will lead to excessive consumption of food and the population of bee colonies will not decline before the stock of food is exhausted nevertheless the excessive consumption of food stock will reduce the ability of bee colonies to resist suddenly bad weathers fig 4 is the simulation result of changing the larval emergence rate c in a stable growing process the population of newborn larvae in each day are similar so the larval emergence rate is close to the reciprocal of the growing period of larva the simulation result shows that the larval emergence rate would not directly change the development trend of colony but the larger emergence rate as the pink curves of fig 4 can support more adult population that results in dramatical increases of food stock while the small emergence rate as the cyan curves of fig 4 will cause the accumulation of larvae and the decline of adults that result in slow increases of food stock fig 5 is the simulation result of changing the adult life coefficient d a small life coefficient means that each adult can collect more food in its lifetime otherwise less food can be collected in its lifetime the simulation result shows that large life coefficient as the pink curves of fig 5 would lead to a direct reduction in the population of adults but the population of larvae increases first until the adults cannot support it and the stock of food is always increasing because the food collected by adults is always greater than the total food consumption of the colony in this condition in a word the impact of adult life coefficient on adult population is earlier and bigger than that on larval population fig 6 is the simulation result of changing the adult unnatural mortality e the simulation result shows that different adult unnatural mortalities will directly cause different development trends of adults and the population of larvae will also decrease when the adults decrease to a critical point nevertheless the stock of food still keeps increasing the trends of the three core states are very similar to the result of changing the adult life coefficient d but it is obvious that the loss of bee colony caused by adult unnatural death is more serious so a small change in the adult unnatural mortality will have a huge impact fig 7 is the simulation result of changing the larval birth coefficient f the simulation result shows that the larval birth rate has a significant influence on the development trend of adults and larvae and the population of adults and larvae will both decrease when it is lower than the critical value however a smaller larval birth rate in turn leads to more stock of food because less population of larvae will consume less food meanwhile the increase of larval birth rate has not caused stock depletion of food because the upper limit of larval birth rate is set to follow the cost of larval breeding in this simulation fig 8 is the simulation result of changing the larval death rate g the simulation result shows that the increase of larval death rate would directly decrease the population of larvae and adults although the stock of food keeps increasing the increased amplitude will decrease with the increasing of larval death rate compared with the adult unnatural mortality the larval death rate has a weaker effect on the population development the reason is probably that an adult has consumed more resources of the colony for its growing than a larva so the unnatural death of an adult will cause more losses of the whole colony than that of a larva 3 2 monte carlo simulation in order to study the combined effects of multiple factors to the development of bee colony here uses the models with different parameters to represent different bee colonies and then simulate their evolutions from the same initial states to analyze the destinies of the bee colonies as the adult collection rate a represents the richness of external food and has a periodic characteristic with the days of year here set a a m 1 c o s 4 π t 365 where a m 0 04 is the maximum of collection rate and t is the simulated day of year this setting is consistent with the law of nature that flowers bloom in spring and autumn while wither in summer and winter since the other parameters reflect different internal factors of bee colony here uses monte carlo method to randomly generate 10 000 groups of parameters b g in the range of table 1 to represent different bee colonies the initial states f 10000 a 10000 and l 2000 are set for these colonies and the evolution process is carried out for 2 years it is noticed that the simulation will be terminated when the stock of food reaches zero or the population of adults is less than 500 because the population could not be maintained in reality for a better display of the simulation results according to the changes of the three core states between the begin and the end the bee colonies are classified into four types as shown in table 2 the development processes of 100 bee colonies during two years are shown in fig 9 the stock of food the population of adults and the population of larvae all periodically fluctuate with the fluctuation of external food abundance in these 100 bee colonies the numbers of types 3 cyan and 4 black is larger than that of types 1 pink and 2 orange which indicates that only a few bee colonies can reproduce continuously when all the factors of themselves are completely random and most of bee colonies will decline or even die due to some unfavorable factors most of the bee colonies of type 4 will consume all the stock of food before the first autumn about 200 days due to irrational breeding for the simulation results it is noticed that the size of some bee colonies may exceeded the common sense because this study focuses on the influence of multiple factors and dose not add the swarming mechanism into the model nevertheless the simulation results can still explain the effect of multiple factors on the development trend of bee colonies further based on the simulation of 10 000 bee colonies the effects of multiple factors are shown in fig 10 fig 10 a is the ratios of the four development types defined in table 2 27 of the bee colonies have eaten out the stock of food or be lower than their initial stock 66 of the bee colonies have a decline in the population of adults over the two years 4 of the bee colonies have an increase in the population of adults and food stocks but a decrease in the population of larvae only 3 of the bee colonies have positive growth in all of food stocks adults and larvae this result indicates that a benign development of bee colony requires the most of factors in the favorable ranges fig 10 b c and d show the relationship between the development types and model parameters the most apparent phenomenon is that larval birth rates above a threshold 0 25bees g will significantly reduce the risk of adult decline as shown in fig 10 d which indicates that the queen with a strong breeding ability can significantly increase the population of adults secondly the larval consumption rate is the most important factor to the stock of food i e reducing the larval consumption rate can effectively increase the stock of food as shown in fig 10 b in reality the main reason for the increase of larval consumption rate is the energy cost for maintaining the internal environment of the colony such as heating and cooling in other words the favorable nest characteristics of temperature and humidity can promote the stock of food and enhance the ability to resist environmental fluctuations in addition the influence of other parameters does not show obvious threshold effect on the colony development but the influence direction of each parameter is certain i e improving the adult collection rate reducing the adult life coefficient and the adult unnatural mortality and reducing the larval death rate can promote the benign development of bee colony 4 discussion and conclusion based on the system equilibrium principle this paper has modelled the bee colony s dynamics between the stock of food the population of adults and the population of larvae and the mainly internal and external factors have been abstracted as the model parameters the model presented here is not an attempt to simulate reality instead it is used to systematically and macroscopically study the effects of multiple factors on the development of bee colonies in this study the mathematical criteria for the benign development of bee colonies have been given from the point of view of system stability the effects of each factor on colony development have been analyzed by perturbating each model parameter around a critical condition furthermore monte carlo method has been used to simulate the long term development of different bee colonies within reasonable ranges of the model parameters so as to determine the effects of multiple factors on colony development the effects of the seven parameters involved in the proposed model are respectively studied based on the method of critical perturbation as shown in fig 2 8 the simulation results show that the parameters have different influences on the development of bee colonies overall the parameter a and b will directly change the development trend of food stocks the parameter a d e f and g will directly change the developmental trend of adult population the parameter a f and g will directly change the development trend of larval population to further link the realistic factors with the model parameters the abundance of external food abstracted in the parameter a is the most important factor which can dominate the development trend of the three core states russell et al 2013 secondly the growth period of larva abstracted in the parameter c will not affect the development trend because the growth period is strictly controlled by genes and it only has a little variation thirdly the laying ability of queen abstracted in the parameter f will promote both the population of adult and larvae which supports the correctness of replacing old queens in the beekeeping practice for the three core states of bee colony the population of adults is most likely to be influenced by multiple factors that is to say the observations related to adults such as the total number of adults and the number frequency of adults entering and leaving the nest can more quickly reflect the health status of bee colony which provides a theoretical basis for previous studies dussaubat et al 2013 souza cunha et al 2020 according to these findings the trend changes of the three core states could be used to diagnose the healthy problems of actual bee colony monte carlo method has been used to randomly simulate the effects of multiple factors on the development trend of bee colony as shown in fig 9 10 the results show that food stocks adult population and scale of larval population will all periodically fluctuate with the fluctuation of external food abundance and only a few colonies type 1 are able to gain all of the three core states in the fluctuation this is because most of the internal factors must be favorable for such advantage colonies resulting in the low probability it is reasonable therefore to believe that the weather anomalies in recent years resulting in abnormal fluctuations of external food abundance will further erode the ratio of the advantage colonies flores et al 2019 giannini et al 2012 nurnberger et al 2019 vercelli et al 2021 to consider the combined effects of multiple factors the larval birth coefficient f presents a clear threshold effect in fig 10 d which reveals the importance of queen fertility on colony development kuan et al 2018 secondly reducing the larval consumption rate b can effectively reduce the consumption of food stocks and improve the ability of bee colonies to resist environmental fluctuations which means that the nest characteristics of temperature and humidity are very important for the stock of food thirdly although the effects of other parameters on colony development are not so significant as f and b they still have determined directions e g increasing larval emergence rate reducing adult life coefficient and unnatural mortality and reducing larval death rate can promote the benign development of bee colony these findings reveal the effects of multiple factors on the development trend of bee colonies from the level of system equilibrium which is of great significance for understanding the collapse of bee colonies in recent years credit author statement w h c l and s l conceived the

24424,in recent years frequent outbreaks of bee colony collapse have seriously threatened food production and ecological balance many scholars have studied different factors and formed a consensus that multiple factors jointly cause the colony collapse however it is still a challenge to understand the effects of multiple factors on bee colony development due to the complex microcosmic mechanism of each factor based on the principle of system equilibrium this paper models the macroscopic dynamics of bee colony with three core states the stocks of food the population of adult bees and the population of larval bees and the internal and external factors have been abstracted as the model parameters the mathematical criteria for the benign development of bee colonies are presented from the idea of system stability and the effects of multiple factors are studied by critical parameter perturbation and monte carlo simulation the results show that the population of adults is most likely to be influenced by multiple factors that is to say the observations related to adults such as the total number of adults and the number frequency of adults entering and leaving the nest can more quickly reflect the health status of bee colony which provides a theoretical basis for experimental studies meanwhile this study reveals the effects of multiple factors on the development of bee colonies from the level of system equilibrium which is of great significance for understanding the collapse of bee colonies in recent years further according to monitoring the three core states the trend changes of them could be used to diagnose the healthy problems of actual bee colonies keywords bee colony development colony collapse disorder multiple factor effects macroscopic dynamics critical parameter perturbation monte carlo simulation 1 introduction bees are one of the most important pollinators on the earth which affects about 35 of the world s food production winfree et al 2011 however bee colony collapses are being more and more extensive problems in recent decades bacandritsos et al 2010 van der zee et al 2012 vanengelsdorp et al 2009a 2009b which would have seriously threatened crop yields and ecological balance according to the data of national agricultural statistics service a study found that the number of managed honey bee colonies in the usa steadily decreased since the late 1940 s ellis et al 2010 a more convincing survey which involved 5937 valid participants and 414 267 managed colonies kulhanek et al 2017 reported that the average loss of the bee colonies in the usa was 49 in 2014 2015 and the similar results encountered during 2007 2014 the phenomena could be caused by many factors such as honey bee parasites pathogens use of pesticide and antibiotics climate change nutritional stress and so on watanabe 2008 watson and stallins 2016 but the effects of the factors to the development of bee colony are still unclear with the development of electronic technology more and more advanced observation methods have enhanced people s understanding to the behaviors of bee colonies cecchi et al 2020 hong et al 2020 however the factors acting on bee colonies are complex and they would change with time it is difficult to evaluate their influences on the development of bee colonies directly through experiments bird et al 2021 in order to study the growth regularity of bee colony many scholars have tried to model and simulate the experimental data rowland and mclellan 1982 rowland and mclellan used two piecewise linear functions to model brood production in honey bee colonies harris et al built a population model by using empirical data to describe the dynamic of eggs larvae pupae and adults in a colony harris 1985 omholt et al developed a

for studying the influence of model parameters on colony population dynamics degrandi hoffman et al 1989 with the frequent outbreak of colony collapse events in recent decades the interaction mechanism between colony development and various factors has become a research hotspot khoury et al focused on the relationship between hivebees and foragers and developed a quantitative model for the dynamics of honey bee colony khoury et al 2011 after that they extended the model to include brood dynamics and explicit food to further investigate potential reasons for colony collapse disorder khoury et al 2013 ratti et al introduced a four dimensional model based on ordinary differential equations to investigates the long term behaviors of the bee colony accompanied with varroa mites and varroacides ratti et al 2015 2017 betti et al extended the model of khoury by increasing the effects of infection betti et al 2014 and the age structure of honey bee colonies betti et al 2016 to study the collapse of bee colony after that they also studied the effects of diploid male production on the evolution and survival of honey bee colony betti and lee 2020 paiva et al studied the effects of artificial feeding on the dynamics of honey bee colony by expanding the model of khoury paiva et al 2016 dennis et al constructed a mathematical model to quantify the loss of resilience in collapsing honey bee colonies due to the presence of a strong allee effect dennis and kemp 2016 in order to accurately study the influence of internal and external factors on bee colony development becher et al proposed an integrated model beehave to study the influence of comprehensive factors on bee colony dynamics which combines many different stressors within and outside the hive and the interactions between them becher et al 2014 2013 bulson et al 2020 betti et al also built a comprehensive agent based simulator for honey bee colonies attempting to accurately simulate bee colony behaviors and dynamics under the action of multiple factors betti et al 2017 almost all of these studies were trying to build precise models to reflect the real process of bee colony dynamics however in order to match the actual observation data the models became increasingly complex and difficult to understand especially it is difficult to give reasonable ranges for the model parameters to analyze the influences of multiple factors on bee colony dynamics therefore it is necessary to abstract the effects of multiple factors and model the interactions of core states from a more fundamental perspective based on the perspective of energy dissipation theory it can be considered that stored food adult worker bee and larvae are three main energy forms of bee colony system and the benign development of bee colony means the orderly transformation between the three energy forms therefore this paper will model the bee colony s dynamics between the stock of food the population of adults and the population of larvae and abstract the multiple factors as the model parameters and then the mathematical criteria for the benign development of bee colonies will be given from the system stability of the model and the effects of single factors on colony development will be analyzed by perturbating each model parameter around a critical condition further monte carlo method will be used to simulate the long term development of different bee colonies within reasonable ranges of the model parameters so as to understand the effects of multiple factors on colony development 2 methodology 2 1 biological behavior of bee colonies the bee colony is a highly social group with three types of members queens drones and workers there is usually only one queen in each colony and her main job is to lay eggs most of the eggs are fertilized and grow into worker bees or virgin queens depending on how many royal jellies are fed actually ninety nine percent of the bee colony is made up of worker bees and they need about 20 days to grow from egg to adult adult work bees have a clear division of labor according to their age to maintain the normal operation of the colony they are mainly responsible for cleaning the nest at 1 2 days of age feeding the larvae and the queen at 3 11 days of age building and guarding the nest after 12 days of age and they could be recruited to collect food outside normally after 22 days of age the life span of adult worker bees is about 1 6 months depending on their physique and collecting intensity the birth of virgin queen bees usually occurs in the spring breeding season which means the swarming would happen to alleviate the conflict between colony population and resource capacity during the breeding season the queen also lay some unfertilized eggs that eventually grow into drones drones do not participate in any productive activities but they are only responsible for mating with virgin queens outside of the hive obviously adult worker bees are the main force for the colony operation they collect food to feed the queen and larvae and the elderly workers will be taken over by the newborn workers emerging from larvae to continue the operation of the colony when the external food is abundant and the colony is functioning properly the stored food and the population will both increase conversely when the external food is scarce for a long time or there are some endogenous problems in the colony the population will decline or even die out therefore the colony operation can be considered as the interactions among the stored food adult worker bees and larvae as shown in fig 1 it is obvious that these three states must be orderly converted in a healthy colony and any abnormality of the converted pathway may cause colony collapse 2 2 dynamic model of bee colonies in order to analyze the influence of multiple factors to the development of bee colony this study tries to model the dynamics of the core states according to the relationship shown in fig 1 in the model the weight of food stock is marked as f the total population of adult workers is marked as a and the total population of larval workers is marked as l here we do not distinguish the types of food and the period from the egg to the moment before emergence is collectively called larva it should be noted that the mutation processes such as the death caused by the depletion of food stock and the population decline caused by swarming are not considered in the model the changes of food stock in real colonies are related to many factors such as the food collection of adults the food consumption of larvae the drying effect and the theft this model focuses on the transformation among the three core states so the daily increase of food stock in a colony is described as the difference between the net food collection of adults and the food consumption of larvae as shown in eq 1 although the adults eat the food and then feed the larvae in fact the food consumption of larvae depend on the population of larvae so here we build the food consumption of larvae is a proportional to the population of larvae 1 d f d t a a b l where a is the average net food collection of each adult per day and it mainly depends on the abundance of food outside b is the average food consumption of each larva per day which is related to both the larval inherent food consumption and the maintaining cost for a suitable breeding environment e g more stock of food would be consumed to maintain the internal temperature of the hive in the cold weather as adults are emerging from larvae the increase of adults is reasonably considered as a stable proportion of larvae in every day for the decrease of adults there are two reasons one is natural death due to accumulated food collection over the capacity of adult so the amount of natural death is the daily collection of the whole colony divided to the total collection capability of an adult the other one is unnatural death due to diseases pesticides weather natural enemies and other dangerous factors so a certain proportion of adults will unnaturally die every day therefore the daily increment of adults can be described as 2 d a d t c l a d a e a where c is the emergence ratio of larvae per day which is close to the reciprocal of the growing period of larva d is the life coefficient of adults which represents the robustness of the adults and is defined by the reciprocal of the total food collection capability of an adult e is the unnatural death ratio of adults per day which is related to colony diseases pesticides weather and colony location larvae are actually hatching from eggs and the population of eggs is constrained by both food collection and the queen s fertility which ensures the larvae have enough food to grow into adults therefore it can be considered that the queen is based on the collected food to produce the newborn larvae every day correspondingly a part of larvae is emerging to adults every day that results in a decrease of larvae in addition a certain proportion of larvae died by environmental hazards and diseases also reduce the population of larvae the daily increment of the larva can therefore be described as 3 d l d t a f a c l g l where f is the birth coefficient of larvae which represent the queen s ability to lay eggs and mainly related to the queen s age and the season the upper limit of f can be determined by the reciprocal of the larval inherent food consumption because food balance is as a law written into the colony s genes during evolution g is the death ratio of larvae per day which reflects the probability of death due to hazards and diseases finally the system model of bee colony can be described by rewriting eq 1 2 and 3 into a matrix 4 d f d t d a d t d l d t 0 a b 0 a d e c 0 a f c g f a l it s important to note that the values of the model parameters a g are non negative because of their physical definitions 2 3 critical condition of development tends based on the principle of system dynamics it can be considered that the system divergence indicates the growing of colony while the system convergence indicates the declining of colony therefore the critical condition of colony development can be obtained by solving the characteristic roots of the model and then the influence of multiple factors on colony development can be analyzed due to the state transition matrix φ 0 a b 0 a d e c 0 a f c g the characteristic equation of the system is 5 s i φ s a b 0 s a d e c 0 a f s c g s s a d e s c g a c f 0 the characteristic root of the system can be solved as 6 s 0 s p p 2 4 k 2 where p a d e c g k a c f a d e c g according to the criterion of system stability it is known that the system is convergent i e the colony is declining when the system has no more than one zero characteristic root and the real parts of other characteristic roots are all less than zero if not the system is divergent i e the colony is growing so the growing condition is p 2 4 k p and the equivalent form by substituting the expression of p and k is shown below 7 f d e a 1 g c obviously eq 7 will be reinforced by increasing of a c and f which means that the increasing of external food larval emergence rate and larval birth coefficient will promote the colony growing however eq 7 will be weakened by increasing of d e and g which means that the increasing of adult life coefficient adult unnatural mortality and larval death rate will cause the colony declining although these findings are consistent with the common sense it is important that eq 7 provides the quantitative relationship of multiple factors to further solve eq 1 2 and 3 the results are shown in eq 8 9 and 10 8 f t f 0 a 0 a c g b f 2 k exp p 2 4 k p t 2 exp p 2 4 k p t 2 2 a 0 a 2 k p 2 4 k f a c b p c g q exp p 2 4 k p t 2 exp p 2 4 k p t 2 9 a t a 0 2 1 q p 2 4 k exp p 2 4 k p t 2 1 q p 2 4 k exp p 2 4 k p t 2 10 l t l 0 a 0 a f p 2 4 k exp p 2 4 k p t 2 exp p 2 4 k p t 2 where q a d e g c and f 0 a 0 and l 0 are the initial value of the three states to analyze eq 9 and 10 it is easy to find that if p 2 4 k p can be satisfied the population of adults and larvae will be growing i e a t and l t when t obviously the condition is consistent with the result of characteristic root however for the increasing of the stock of food i e f t an additional condition needs to be satisfied that the coefficient of the positive exponential terms in eq 8 is greater than zero i e eq 11 11 a 0 a 2 k c g b f f a c b p c g q p 2 4 k 0 as a 0 a and k are all greater than zero eq 11 is equivalent to eq 12 12 c g b f f a c b p c g q p 2 4 k 0 in order to understand the implications of the additional condition more clearly it is necessary to further simplify eq 12 when the critical condition p 2 4 k p is satisfied i e a c f a d e c g the left side of eq 12 can be simplified as shown in eq 13 13 c g b f f a c b p c g q p 2 4 k c g p c g 2 f p to consider the actual values of the model parameters p is close to c g so the approximate condition for the stock growing of food is shown in eq 14 14 c g f b eq 14 reveals that the increasing of c and g i e the increasing of larval emergence rate and larval death rate is beneficial to the stock of food the increased larval death rate means less food consumption which is good for the stock of food in the short term but bad for population development meanwhile the increasing of b and f i e the increasing of larval consumption rate and larval birth factor is not conducive to the stock of food which further indicates that overbreeding may lead to the risk of food shortage in the colony 2 4 realistic range of model parameters as simulation results are related to the model s structure and parameters it is necessary to carry out simulations within the realistic range of parameters to obtain some meaningful results the range of parameters in the proposed model can be reasonably obtained by investigating relevant literatures as shown in table 1 3 result 3 1 critical parameter perturbation in order to study the effect of each factor to the development of bee colony it is necessary to let the colony on a same critical condition and then successively perturb each parameter around the critical value therefore a set of critical parameters in the range of table 1 can be determined by satisfying eq 7 and 14 a 0 04 b 0 12 c 0 045 d 0 25 e 0 001 f 0 4 and g 0 02 to analyze the influence of each parameter here we select the timespan of the simulation to be 90 days as long as a season and set a common group of bee colony states f 10000 a 10000 and l 2000 as the initial state of model the simulation results are shown in fig 2 8 where the curves with different colors represent the development processes of bee colony with different values of the perturbed parameter and the specific value of each color can be found in the color bar each curve has two stars with different colors to mark the beginning green and the end red of simulation it is noticed that the simulation will be terminated if any of the three core states f a and l reaches zero because the proposed model focuses on the stable evolution of bee colony fig 2 is the simulation result of only changing the adult collection rate a the simulation result shows that when a is large i e when the external food is abundant the population and food stock will increase significantly however the development processes of bee colonies reflect the allee effect the sudden abundance of external food will result in a decline of adult population due to heavy collection work as the pink curve in fig 2 c and then the adult population will recover because larval population increases and more and more adults are emerging conversely a sudden lack of external food will cause a decrease in collecting activity as the cyan curve indicated in fig 2 c which in turn leads to a decrease in the natural death of adults thus causing an increase in the population of adults however long term food scarcity will lead to a decrease in food stocks larval population and eventually adult population as the cyan curves in fig 2 the findings indicate that the food richness in the environment determines the size of the colony and the adult larva ratio furthermore it can be speculated that abnormal changes in the adult collection rate caused by climate change in recent years may cause breeding disorder even colony collapse fig 3 is the simulation result of changing the larval consumption rate b where the variation of this parameter is mainly due to the variable cost for maintaining breeding environment e g temperature and humidity control in different weathers the simulation result shows that the larval consumption rate would fundamentally change the trend of food stock as shown in fig 3 b while the overlap of simulation tracks in fig 3 c and d show that the larval consumption rate would not change the growing process of colony these findings indicate that the harsh environment will lead to excessive consumption of food and the population of bee colonies will not decline before the stock of food is exhausted nevertheless the excessive consumption of food stock will reduce the ability of bee colonies to resist suddenly bad weathers fig 4 is the simulation result of changing the larval emergence rate c in a stable growing process the population of newborn larvae in each day are similar so the larval emergence rate is close to the reciprocal of the growing period of larva the simulation result shows that the larval emergence rate would not directly change the development trend of colony but the larger emergence rate as the pink curves of fig 4 can support more adult population that results in dramatical increases of food stock while the small emergence rate as the cyan curves of fig 4 will cause the accumulation of larvae and the decline of adults that result in slow increases of food stock fig 5 is the simulation result of changing the adult life coefficient d a small life coefficient means that each adult can collect more food in its lifetime otherwise less food can be collected in its lifetime the simulation result shows that large life coefficient as the pink curves of fig 5 would lead to a direct reduction in the population of adults but the population of larvae increases first until the adults cannot support it and the stock of food is always increasing because the food collected by adults is always greater than the total food consumption of the colony in this condition in a word the impact of adult life coefficient on adult population is earlier and bigger than that on larval population fig 6 is the simulation result of changing the adult unnatural mortality e the simulation result shows that different adult unnatural mortalities will directly cause different development trends of adults and the population of larvae will also decrease when the adults decrease to a critical point nevertheless the stock of food still keeps increasing the trends of the three core states are very similar to the result of changing the adult life coefficient d but it is obvious that the loss of bee colony caused by adult unnatural death is more serious so a small change in the adult unnatural mortality will have a huge impact fig 7 is the simulation result of changing the larval birth coefficient f the simulation result shows that the larval birth rate has a significant influence on the development trend of adults and larvae and the population of adults and larvae will both decrease when it is lower than the critical value however a smaller larval birth rate in turn leads to more stock of food because less population of larvae will consume less food meanwhile the increase of larval birth rate has not caused stock depletion of food because the upper limit of larval birth rate is set to follow the cost of larval breeding in this simulation fig 8 is the simulation result of changing the larval death rate g the simulation result shows that the increase of larval death rate would directly decrease the population of larvae and adults although the stock of food keeps increasing the increased amplitude will decrease with the increasing of larval death rate compared with the adult unnatural mortality the larval death rate has a weaker effect on the population development the reason is probably that an adult has consumed more resources of the colony for its growing than a larva so the unnatural death of an adult will cause more losses of the whole colony than that of a larva 3 2 monte carlo simulation in order to study the combined effects of multiple factors to the development of bee colony here uses the models with different parameters to represent different bee colonies and then simulate their evolutions from the same initial states to analyze the destinies of the bee colonies as the adult collection rate a represents the richness of external food and has a periodic characteristic with the days of year here set a a m 1 c o s 4 π t 365 where a m 0 04 is the maximum of collection rate and t is the simulated day of year this setting is consistent with the law of nature that flowers bloom in spring and autumn while wither in summer and winter since the other parameters reflect different internal factors of bee colony here uses monte carlo method to randomly generate 10 000 groups of parameters b g in the range of table 1 to represent different bee colonies the initial states f 10000 a 10000 and l 2000 are set for these colonies and the evolution process is carried out for 2 years it is noticed that the simulation will be terminated when the stock of food reaches zero or the population of adults is less than 500 because the population could not be maintained in reality for a better display of the simulation results according to the changes of the three core states between the begin and the end the bee colonies are classified into four types as shown in table 2 the development processes of 100 bee colonies during two years are shown in fig 9 the stock of food the population of adults and the population of larvae all periodically fluctuate with the fluctuation of external food abundance in these 100 bee colonies the numbers of types 3 cyan and 4 black is larger than that of types 1 pink and 2 orange which indicates that only a few bee colonies can reproduce continuously when all the factors of themselves are completely random and most of bee colonies will decline or even die due to some unfavorable factors most of the bee colonies of type 4 will consume all the stock of food before the first autumn about 200 days due to irrational breeding for the simulation results it is noticed that the size of some bee colonies may exceeded the common sense because this study focuses on the influence of multiple factors and dose not add the swarming mechanism into the model nevertheless the simulation results can still explain the effect of multiple factors on the development trend of bee colonies further based on the simulation of 10 000 bee colonies the effects of multiple factors are shown in fig 10 fig 10 a is the ratios of the four development types defined in table 2 27 of the bee colonies have eaten out the stock of food or be lower than their initial stock 66 of the bee colonies have a decline in the population of adults over the two years 4 of the bee colonies have an increase in the population of adults and food stocks but a decrease in the population of larvae only 3 of the bee colonies have positive growth in all of food stocks adults and larvae this result indicates that a benign development of bee colony requires the most of factors in the favorable ranges fig 10 b c and d show the relationship between the development types and model parameters the most apparent phenomenon is that larval birth rates above a threshold 0 25bees g will significantly reduce the risk of adult decline as shown in fig 10 d which indicates that the queen with a strong breeding ability can significantly increase the population of adults secondly the larval consumption rate is the most important factor to the stock of food i e reducing the larval consumption rate can effectively increase the stock of food as shown in fig 10 b in reality the main reason for the increase of larval consumption rate is the energy cost for maintaining the internal environment of the colony such as heating and cooling in other words the favorable nest characteristics of temperature and humidity can promote the stock of food and enhance the ability to resist environmental fluctuations in addition the influence of other parameters does not show obvious threshold effect on the colony development but the influence direction of each parameter is certain i e improving the adult collection rate reducing the adult life coefficient and the adult unnatural mortality and reducing the larval death rate can promote the benign development of bee colony 4 discussion and conclusion based on the system equilibrium principle this paper has modelled the bee colony s dynamics between the stock of food the population of adults and the population of larvae and the mainly internal and external factors have been abstracted as the model parameters the model presented here is not an attempt to simulate reality instead it is used to systematically and macroscopically study the effects of multiple factors on the development of bee colonies in this study the mathematical criteria for the benign development of bee colonies have been given from the point of view of system stability the effects of each factor on colony development have been analyzed by perturbating each model parameter around a critical condition furthermore monte carlo method has been used to simulate the long term development of different bee colonies within reasonable ranges of the model parameters so as to determine the effects of multiple factors on colony development the effects of the seven parameters involved in the proposed model are respectively studied based on the method of critical perturbation as shown in fig 2 8 the simulation results show that the parameters have different influences on the development of bee colonies overall the parameter a and b will directly change the development trend of food stocks the parameter a d e f and g will directly change the developmental trend of adult population the parameter a f and g will directly change the development trend of larval population to further link the realistic factors with the model parameters the abundance of external food abstracted in the parameter a is the most important factor which can dominate the development trend of the three core states russell et al 2013 secondly the growth period of larva abstracted in the parameter c will not affect the development trend because the growth period is strictly controlled by genes and it only has a little variation thirdly the laying ability of queen abstracted in the parameter f will promote both the population of adult and larvae which supports the correctness of replacing old queens in the beekeeping practice for the three core states of bee colony the population of adults is most likely to be influenced by multiple factors that is to say the observations related to adults such as the total number of adults and the number frequency of adults entering and leaving the nest can more quickly reflect the health status of bee colony which provides a theoretical basis for previous studies dussaubat et al 2013 souza cunha et al 2020 according to these findings the trend changes of the three core states could be used to diagnose the healthy problems of actual bee colony monte carlo method has been used to randomly simulate the effects of multiple factors on the development trend of bee colony as shown in fig 9 10 the results show that food stocks adult population and scale of larval population will all periodically fluctuate with the fluctuation of external food abundance and only a few colonies type 1 are able to gain all of the three core states in the fluctuation this is because most of the internal factors must be favorable for such advantage colonies resulting in the low probability it is reasonable therefore to believe that the weather anomalies in recent years resulting in abnormal fluctuations of external food abundance will further erode the ratio of the advantage colonies flores et al 2019 giannini et al 2012 nurnberger et al 2019 vercelli et al 2021 to consider the combined effects of multiple factors the larval birth coefficient f presents a clear threshold effect in fig 10 d which reveals the importance of queen fertility on colony development kuan et al 2018 secondly reducing the larval consumption rate b can effectively reduce the consumption of food stocks and improve the ability of bee colonies to resist environmental fluctuations which means that the nest characteristics of temperature and humidity are very important for the stock of food thirdly although the effects of other parameters on colony development are not so significant as f and b they still have determined directions e g increasing larval emergence rate reducing adult life coefficient and unnatural mortality and reducing larval death rate can promote the benign development of bee colony these findings reveal the effects of multiple factors on the development trend of bee colonies from the level of system equilibrium which is of great significance for understanding the collapse of bee colonies in recent years credit author statement w h c l and s l conceived the
