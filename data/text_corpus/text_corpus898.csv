4490,climate change driven retreat of glaciers is producing thousands of glacial lakes across mountain regions these lakes generally grow coalesce into larger lakes that may produce increased downstream hazards and risks due to glacial lake outburst floods glofs this study assesses such hazards of lower barun lake located near mount everest nepal we model a series of scenarios including two potential avalanches that enter the lake from the surrounding slope and eight potential glofs from the lake to evaluate the susceptibility of the frontal moraine to overtopping we characterize the initial avalanche induced surge of water over the moraine caused by the kinetic energy of arriving masses and possible tsunami like events further we present physical hydrodynamic models that reveal the hazard from the potential overtopping and glof events along the barun arun river valley special attention is given to analyze the flow hydraulics at six downstream settlements to estimate potential impacts at each location two extreme magnitude two high magnitude two moderate magnitude and two low magnitude glofs were hydraulically evaluated for the present lake dimension and the modeled future growth of the lake as with most hydrological processes the magnitude and frequency of glofs from lower barun lake have an inverse albeit uncertain relationship but the potential impacts on people and infrastructure are extremely sensitive to the events magnitude the flow dynamics results indicate that an overtopping flood without erosion of the damming moraine causes minimal impact in the valley the extreme magnitude and high magnitude glof cases where the moraine is incised have a larger impact but differ greatly in magnitude at each of the downstream settlements the moderate magnitude and low magnitude glofs while the most frequent type have limited volume and peak discharge causing less impact downstream our calculations only portray the part of the hydrograph representing lake overfill due to a volume of ice or rock entering the lake and the volume of the lake that could drain from a breach of the damming moraine down to specified depths over specified time periods keywords glacial lake glof hazard himalaya hec ras 1 introduction rising global temperatures have increased glacier melting during this century at rates more rapid than in the previous century bolch et al 2012 kraaijenbrink et al 2017 roe et al 2017 as meltwater becomes more voluminous runoff can accumulate in depressions on thinning and sagging glacier surfaces or in front of receding glaciers and form moraine dammed lakes such as lower barun in nepal linsbauer et al 2016 haeberli et al 2016 sattar et al 2019b moraine dammed glacial lakes are the most common sources of glacial lake outburst floods glofs watanbe and rothacher 1996 westoby et al 2014 glofs have been observed many times since the end of the little ice age vuichard and zimmermann 1987 kargel et al 2011 carey et al 2012 clague and o connor 2015 vilímek et al 2015 anacona et al 2015a paul and bolch 2019 however glofs emanating from moraine dammed lakes worldwide became far more common in the 1930s an increase believed to be due to lagging responses to the end of the little ice age since then the incidence of glofs has fluctuated first rising sharply and then falling somewhat since the 1980s harrison et al 2018 yet it is expected to increase within parts of the himalaya in the coming decades veh et al 2020 moraine dammed lakes are confined by end moraines or lateral moraines with ice forming the up valley lake margin until the glacier retreats farther and detaches these moraines however usually consist of unconsolidated sediment thereby making dam structures unstable compared with bedrock dams many of the moraines especially in the himalaya initially contain ice richardson and reynolds 2000 which provides greater structural strength but eventually melts leaving unconsolidated sediment and poor structural support to the dam as the dams degrade due to erosion or melting of the ice the lakes may gradually lower or become infilled with sediment and slowly disappear sudden glofs from moraine dammed or any other types of naturally dammed glacial lakes supraglacial or ice marginal sometimes occur and pose risks to downstream infrastructure and communities osti and egashira 2009 kropáček et al 2015 allen et al 2016 as lakes continue to grow in number and size globally shugar et al 2020 so does the cause for concern glofs from moraine dammed lakes may be triggered by 1 overtopping and erosion of the moraine dam caused by waves generated from ice avalanches rockfalls or calving 2 meteorological conditions especially extreme rain events which may partly melt ice in the moraine dam and weaken the moraine or cause overfill and thermal and physical erosion of the moraine or induce a mass movement into the lake 3 degradation from within the moraine dam melt through due to seepage from the lake and physical erosion piping or flotation of the moraine s buried ice by the hydrostatic gradient imposed by the lake 4 a small glof perhaps from a supraglacial pond may overfill a moraine dammed lake or 5 seismic activity when strong ground motion destabilizes the damming structure richardson and reynolds 2000 westoby et al 2014 these potential triggers each involves a stochastic chain reaction sequence which cannot be explicitly predicted but may be understood either statistically for a population of similar lakes or individually through scenario modeling here because we are investigating one lake we take the latter approach all trigger mechanisms associated with glofs can range in magnitude and severity depending on the lake s and terrain s individual details including 1 the lake s total drainable volume 2 the internal sedimentological structure of the moraine dam which can have low internal friction and high propensity to break up suddenly and cause high peaked outbursts or alternatively can have high internal friction and produce robust boulder armoring of drainage conduits and thus limit erosion and reduce peak discharge 3 the amount distribution and structure of buried ice in the end moraine which can control the likelihood and rate of melt through piping and can cause large changes in the moraine s structural integrity 4 the width to height ratio of the moraine dam for instance a dam that is sharply peaked can readily and quickly break up whereas a broad dam is more robust 5 the height of the moraine dam both the freeboard which controls the damage and amount of overtopping for a given size of the wave and the down valley slope that partly controls the hydraulic pressure 6 the lake s position with respect to its surrounding topography which can either allow large mass movements to enter the lake rapidly and with large and sudden kinetic energy input or not 7 the mass of unstable hanging glaciers snow or perched fractured bedrock on adjacent mountain slopes or 8 the lake bed and shore structure that can either cause tsunami waves to ramp up sharply or undergo constructive wave interferences or cause tsunami waves to diffuse harmlessly we note that one recent example of a mass movement induced displacement wave caused overtopping of a moraine dam having 80 m of freeboard so these waves can be rather extreme hubbard et al 2005 emmer 2017 more modest impulse wave overtopping by about 5 m caused for example by a large ice avalanche into lake 513 in peru worni et al 2014 and similar to the smallest avalanche triggered events modeled in this paper can nonetheless generate damaging debris flows the rapid growth in the size and number of glacial lakes along with rapid increases in infrastructure development e g hydropower plants roads and bridges and population in mountainous regions have catalyzed the need for comprehensive regional and global mapping of glacial

economic development opportunities at glacial lakes regmi et al 2017 emmer 2018 in disaster risk assessment and management risk conventionally involves the confluence of hazard vulnerability and exposure e g lavell et al 2012 or if these are quantified then the risk is the product of these components the relative risk a glof may present to the downstream region depends on the hazard components consisting of peak discharge and cumulative discharge which are functions of the drainable volume of the lake condition of the damming moraine potential glof triggers listed above and overtopping due to external impact which together determines the hazard and the exposure and vulnerability of elements downstream of the lake infrastructure human life and ecological values including the resilience of these at risk components the risk that a potentially dangerous lake may present to the low lying areas may be unrecognized unless a detailed hazard and risk assessment are undertaken glof hazard assessments often contain inherent uncertainties as outburst events are hypothesized to occur in the future due to a variety of potential triggering processes however applying variable assumptions and conditions within hydrodynamic modeling based on the spatial and geological characteristics of a lake and its surroundings allows us to understand how a valley will behave in a lake failure event furthermore developing detailed assessments and models addressing extreme magnitude scenarios are needed for responsive disaster preparedness and mitigation the purpose of this study is to evaluate the glof hazard associated with lower barun lake located in the nepal himalaya by performing a series of modeling and downstream flood routing given the complexity of the possible glof triggers in the mountainous basin our first objective includes identifying and modeling potential avalanche around the lake to evaluate the susceptibility of the damming moraine to overtopping and downstream propagation of the overtopping flow although we do not model the erosion of the frontal moraine some points about this erosion are considered in supplementary section 1 the second objective is focused on glof hazard assessment by assuming that an overtopping wave can initiate erosion irrespective of the trigger and lead to complete breaching of the moraine thus this objective can be broadly categorized into two parts i potential glofs originating from lower barun lake at its current state present lake under the following scenarios extreme magnitude high magnitude moderate magnitude and low magnitude glofs ii consider the same scenarios for the maximum future extent and estimated volume of the lake the latter builds on the first but considers the future volume and extent of the lake for all four scenarios the magnitude in each scenario relates to modeled flood volume which integrates the breach parameters as flood volume tracks with both breach values on table 1 to achieve the first objective we used remotely sensed data field collected information of potential avalanches that could trigger a glof and two dimensional dynamic physical models including ramms rapid mass movement simulation and hec ras for the second objective we used remotely sensed data field collected lake bathymetry haritashya et al 2018 and hec ras hydrodynamic modeling we do not consider the instances of cascading hazards e g kirschbaum et al 2019 such as glof spilling from nearby upper barun lake into lower barun lake because our focus is on the direct inputs of solid mass into lower barun lake and downstream glof hazard assessment the series of outburst flood events modeled in this study are used to evaluate the downstream impact of the different magnitude of floods originating from the lake in the present and the future irrespective of the trigger mechanism 2 study area background and importance glof studies in the hindu kush karakoram himalaya hkkh previously ranged from regional scale assessments quincey et al 2007 worni et al 2013 nie et al 2017 veh et al 2018 to site specific hazard assessments osti and egashira 2009 bajracharya and mool 2009 fujita et al 2009 shrestha et al 2010 sattar et al 2019a 2019c in the nepal himalaya glacial lake studies include comprehensive glacial lake inventories reynolds and taylor 2004 bajracharya and mool 2009 khadka et al 2018 identification of hazardous glacial lakes rounce et al 2017 glof return period cook et al 2018 and glof reconstruction byers et al 2018 among the largest glacial lakes in nepal imja lake imja tsho has been the most widely studied including detailed glof modeling somos valenzuela et al 2015 lala et al 2018 field based geophysical investigation of the frontal moraine dahal et al 2018 investigations of its evolution over the past few decades e g fujita et al 2009 haritashya et al 2018 and flood risk and management cuellar and mckinney 2017 in the last two decades however nearby lower barun glacial lake 27 47 51 n 87 05 26 e in the makalu region of nepal has been growing rapidly nearly doubling in area since the 1960s to 2 2 km2 in 2019 fig s4 the lake is oriented east west within the upper barun drainage basin fig 1 and it sits at an elevation of about 4550 m the barun river a tributary of the arun river sankhuwasabha district eastern nepal drains from lower barun lake and barun glacier which feeds the lake the barun river also derives flow from upper barun lake and other smaller lakes in the basin which drains down alongside lower barun lake but is separated by a lateral moraine as upper barun lake itself poses a significant glof hazard small future changes in drainage could produce a formidable cascading hazard situation for now we only evaluate lower barun s hazard without involvement of upper barun lake lower barun glacier is characterized by numerous supraglacial lakes ice cliffs and thick debris cover in the lower ablation zone fig 2 a b lower barun lake is dammed by an ice cored moraine dahal et al 2018 haritashya et al 2018 on the east and the barun glacier s terminus to the west the damming moraine has a set of ponds through which the lake drains into and feeds the barun river in this regard it is similar to nepal s imja lake and unlike thulagi and rolpa lakes both of which drain directly over narrow end moraines without intervening ponds direct drainage over narrow steep end moraines makes thulagi and rolpa lakes more hazardous or more likely to drain in a shorter period of time than lower barun and imja lakes however of all these lakes lower barun is by far the deepest known lake with the largest drainable volume is the fastest growing and has the most rapid acceleration of growth haritashya et al 2018 see fig s4 and the adjacent mountain relief is immense furthermore lower barun s end moraine is undergoing thermokarstic evolution as is imja lake s such that one of two things will happen either the melting of ice within the end moraine will gradually lower the lake or else the end moraine will evolve to a structure like that of rolpa and thulagi lakes with a precarious narrow end moraine dam while the final state of lower barun s end moraine cannot be predicted with certainty the hazard associated with moraine failure is increased if the moraine evolves into a narrow structure hazards are reduced if interior moraine ice melts and lake levels fall the barun valley has witnessed at least two known glof events meon and schwarz 1993 usaid 2014 byers et al 2018 the first event flooded the arun river in 1964 and was witnessed by the local people but no other information about the source of the flood exists yamada and sharma 1993 the second outburst event occurred on april 17 2017 and involved a rockfall and avalanche into langmale glacial lake located 3 km east of lower barun lake byers et al 2018 the resulting flood deposited a huge volume of debris along the barun river flow channel and impacted the settlements of langmale and yangla kharke 6 5 km downstream fig 1 containing buddhist gompas and a few teahouses this event blocked the confluence of arun and the barun rivers 29 km downstream from lower barun lake and formed a short lived landslide dammed lake yamada and sharma 1993 identified lower barun lake as potentially dangerous based upon the examination of aerial photographs however kattelmann 2003 deemed lower barun lake to be less threatening than other lakes in the broader region such as imja lake primarily due to the sparsely populated downstream regions in any case lower barun lake has grown considerably since 2003 haritashya et al 2018 exposing it to large mountain sides and the langmale event indicate that some rock units and mountain peaks in the valley exhibit large masses of unstable rock byers et al 2018 posing a far greater threat than nearly two decades ago of particular concern today are potential impacts of outburst floods on existing and proposed regional hydroelectric projects downstream of lower barun lake for example the powerhouse of the proposed 1 4b 1061 megawatt mw upper arun hydroelectric project is located 2 km downstream from the confluence of barun and arun rivers immediately above site 1 in fig 1 https kathmandupost com money moreover the 900 mw arun iii hydropower project also on the arun river has its starting tunnel located 49 km downstream of lower barun lake immediately west of site 4 in fig 1 both of these projects would be completely exposed to a glof from lower barun lake therefore it is important to investigate the range of potential glof hazards as a precursor to the kind of detailed physical field science studies that preceded the engineered partial mitigation lake lowering and stabilization of drainage outlet of imja lake s glof hazard in 2014 undp imja report 2013 http cfgorrp dhm gov np recently several small settlements have formed along the lower barun and arun valleys identified using multi temporal high resolution google earth imagery and new hydropower projects could further spur growth in this valley potentially exposing them to large glof risks in the future our study includes the potential impact of various glof scenarios on several downstream sites barun bazaar and site 1 to site 5 as shown in fig 1 apart from these settlements numerous bridges and other small infrastructure exist along the channel downstream from lower barun lake to site 5 3 data bathymetric data were acquired during field investigation in october 2015 using an inflatable kayak mounted syqwest hydrobox sonar echo sounding sensor and modeled within arcgis using natural neighbor interpolation more details about the methodology related to bathymetric observations modeling and uncertainty can be found in haritashya et al 2018 lake bathymetric maps permitted an accurate simulation of the time varying drawdown of lower barun lake bathymetric information was also necessary to develop relatively accurate moraine breach models and determine the potential flood volume pfv released in different breach scenarios in avalanche simulations and hydrodynamic modeling terrain properties such as surface elevation and surface roughness are often extracted using digital elevation model dem and landuse and land cover lulc composites respectively here we used an advanced land observing satellite alos phased array type l band synthetic aperture radar palsar dem with a spatial resolution of 12 5 m the alos palsar dem is a radiometrically terrain corrected elevation product released globally in october 2014 by the alaska satellite facility https asf alaska edu data sets derived data sets alos palsar rtc alos palsar radiometric terrain correction it has been successfully used for dynamic glof routing previously in the himalaya dhote et al 2019 sattar et al 2019a maskey et al 2020 most models either use a constant value of manning s roughness coefficient or separate values for upstream and downstream routing we used landsat 8 derived lulc product 30 m uddin et al 2015 to extract pixel based manning s roughness coefficients along the flow channel this enables us to define ground channel friction in a spatially distributed pattern for accurate hydraulics for glacier bed mapping and future lake volume estimation we used the alos palsar dem glacier outlines rgi 6 0 and manually digitized glacier flowlines as inputs to generate an ice thickness model linsbauer et al 2012 we also employed the ensemble ice thickness farinotti et al 2019 and dem for a comparative analysis of the glacier bed here the glacier ice thickness distribution rgi160 15 03366 farinotti et al 2019 was used to derive the glacier bed and the frontal overdeepening extent 4 methodology the entire methodology of this study is summarized in fig 3 and details of each component are presented below 4 1 future lake extent and volume to calculate the lake s future volume we estimate the maximum extent of lower barun lake by mapping the glacier bed using a spatially distributed glacier ice thickness product and dem fig 3 and fig 5a lacking ice thickness soundings and subglacial bed topography we instead used the glacier bed topography glabtop method linsbauer et al 2012 and the ensembled ice thickness farinotti et al 2019 see section 3 for data used to calculate the glacier bed of lower barun glacier glabtop is a shear stress based model used to calculate ice thickness h for alpine glaciers described by h τ f ρg sin α where f is the shape factor ρ is the ice density g is the gravitational acceleration and sin α is the slope of the glacier the ensembled ice thickness is an average product derived using four different ice thickness models farinotti et al 2019 we used three different shape factors for glacier bed calculation using glabtop f 0 6 0 7 and 0 8 we also completed a raster based calculation of ice thickness to derive the distributed glacier bed for all three values of f an overdeepening site is extracted using raster based operations in a gis platform arcmap 10 7 1 by overdeepened we mean that the glacier bed extends to a lower elevation than the areas immediately downvalley from the lake the future lake extent and volume are obtained by interpolating between the current lake bathymetry resampled to 25 m and the modeled overdeepened bathymetry of the glacier bed e g fig 5b we compare the four different modeled glacier bed outputs glabtop 0 6 0 7 0 8 and ensemble output with the glacial lake extent and field measured depths the validated glacier bed is further used to calculate the volume of the frontal overdeepening site of the glacier the future lake volume for our hazard assessment analysis is calculated by combining the current lake volume from bathymetry data and the volume of frontal overdeepening both spatially resolved at 25 m this method to identify and map glacier bed overdeepening has been successfully used both at the global scale as well as locally in the himalaya linsbauer et al 2016 frey et al 2010 haeberli and linsbauer 2013 sattar et al 2019b the growth model also provides a good indication of how closely the west end of the lake will approach the high and steep adjacent mountain relief shown in fig 2e 4 2 potential glof triggers and overtopping we identify two potential weak zones around the lake from where ice avalanches could trigger any of the glofs considered in this study fig 2e hence we have modeled the avalanche impacts to determine if their impact waves overtop the frontal moraine the avalanche locations were not picked arbitrarily but are based on our field observation fig s5 and hazard assessment of rounce et al 2016 that identified slopes between 45 and 60 as being avalanche prone and where glacier ice masses appear to hang precariously most of these slopes host snow ice perched atop a steep bed which can be a potential trigger for any of the modeled glofs in this study a significant avalanche emanated from one of these slopes during fieldwork and a time series of the avalanche has been captured fig s5 the average speed of the avalanche as it crossed the lake was 100 km h 1 27 7 m s 1 calculated from the time it took to cross the width of the lake that is both measured and partly inferred by knowing approximately when it first reached the lake as the camera location and the route down the mountain is known and the vectors from the camera to the lake shore can be closely estimated the avalanche did not lead to the overtopping of the lake therefore we model a higher magnitude potential avalanche originating from the same location avalanche 1 for the second trigger avalanche 2 that can potentially have an impact on the future lake we recognize another major slope with hanging snow ice that occurs adjacent to the site described above as a potential avalanche source zone as discussed above and highlighted by haritashya et al 2018 the lake could grow up to this point towards its western end rendering it vulnerable from large scale avalanching from the surrounding slopes another important potential glof trigger is upper barun lake which could drain suddenly into lower barun lake however that is a unique trigger mechanism that we are not evaluating in this paper the severity of these ice snow mass movement triggering events has a relation to the volume of water displaced and the condition of the moraine thus impulsive expulsion of water by the kinetic energy of a mass input is considered we use ramms to model two potential avalanches ramms is based on voellmy salm finite volume method that solves the mass flow equations in two dimension christen et al 2010 the flow rheology of a mass movement is governed by the release area volume density of the material friction parameters and the underlying topography here we define the release area for two potential avalanches by selecting the contiguous pixels with high slope angles 45 60 we define ice snow thickness as 4 7 m and 4 9 m for avalanche 1 and avalanche 2 respectively releasing a total volume of 11 2 105 m3 of ice snow rounce et al 2016 in each case the density ρ of flow material is considered as 1000 kg m 3 ice with some rock debris and liquid water friction parameters include the coulomb friction μ and turbulent friction ξ bartelt et al 2013 which were set as 0 12 and 1000 m s 2 for μ and ξ respectively these input values are widely used to model avalanches in snow covered and glaciated terrain schneider et al 2014 somos valenzuela et al 2016 frey et al 2018 the outputs were obtained as avalanche runout distances m flow depths m and flow velocity m s 1 the avalanche induced impact waves generated by the potential avalanches were modeled empirically using the evers et al 2019 model a previous approach of heller and hager 2010 has been used for avalanche induced impulse wave characterization in glacial lakes in the himalaya lala et al 2018 byers et al 2018 2020 based on the same principles as heller and hager 2010 the approach of evers et al 2019 computes the overtopping wave height overtopping velocity and volume due to impulse waves based on updated studies the inputs to the model such as impact velocity impact volume slide thickness and slide width are derived from the ramms outputs we calculated the impact volume as the volume entering the lake at the end of an avalanche the impact wave run up angle and freeboard were calculated using dem and high resolution planet data based on the overtopping characteristics of the impact wave the overtopping volume in m3 and duration in sec from lower barun lake is determined for each impact avalanche 1 and avalanche 2 further the overtopping hydrographs were calculated based on the total overtopping volume and duration were used as an input for downstream flood routing we use hec ras v 5 0 7 https www hec usace army mil software hec ras a two dimensional hydrodynamic model to evaluate the downstream propagation of the overtopping wave the hydrodynamic module solves the depth averaged two dimensional shallow water equations saint venant equations in an unsteady flow the time series of flow depth df and flow velocity vf obtained as output in a spatially distributed manner are used to evaluate the glof hydraulics downstream of the lake the detailed model settings for 2d flood routing are given in the supplementary section 2 4 3 present and future glof hazard assessment and scenario modeling since overtopping flows can induce dam erosion forming an initial breach followed by progressive breach enlargement singh 1996 we assume the same in the case of lower barun lake therefore overtopping modeling is followed by dam breach flood glof modeling here we evaluate a series of potential glofs that can originate from lower barun lake assuming moraine breaching of different magnitudes potentially triggered by the overtopping wave and some scenarios implying that a dam breaching erosion event has occurred whereas we include a plausible functional form of the developing breach a sine function the function we select is not an actual erosional model therefore our glof modeling is based on the hypothetical magnitude of the water released pfv and the release duration not the sedimentological erosion modeling associated with the overtopping we use hec ras v 5 0 7 one dimensional and two dimensional hydrodynamic model to study eight potential glof events based on the varied breach parameters that represent current lake conditions scenarios 1 4 and maximum future lake extent scenarios 5 8 while keeping moraine dam geometry downstream valley geomorphology and river hydrological conditions the same in every simulation table 1 fig 4 hec ras has been used successfully in one and two dimensional hydrodynamic modeling of outburst floods in steep terrain like the himalaya klimeš et al 2014 anacona et al 2015b wang et al 2018 sattar et al 2019a 2019c 2020 our modeling assumes the continuation of the lake s rapid observed growth but by including a wide range of potential glof scenarios the effects of changing moraine breach properties are indirectly included each scenario has a unique set of parameters including the height of the breach hb time of moraine failure tf breach width bw all of which constrain the flood volume vw released in a potential outburst event and are calculated using froehlich 1995b 1 b w 0 1803 k o v w 0 32 h b 0 19 2 t f 0 00254 v w 0 53 h b 0 9 the high accuracy and low prediction error of these sets of equations make it the most widely used empirical approach for modeling earthen dam failures wahl 2004 all the scenarios were modeled as a sine wave progression breach model where the initial breach forms slowly and speeds up with time as outflow velocities and shear stress increases through the breach the output is obtained in the form of a breach hydrograph with a peak discharge qmax for each modeled event considered for downstream routing along the flow channel each output hydrograph was evaluated by comparing it with empirically calculated peak outflow discharge froehlich 1995a 3 q p 0 607 v w 0 295 h w 1 24 here we set up dam break models for two extreme magnitude events scenario 1 and scenario 5 two high magnitude events scenario 2 and scenario 6 two moderate magnitude events scenario 3 and scenario 7 and two low magnitude events scenario 4 and scenario 8 all originating from lower barun lake our field investigation and analysis of remotely sensed data suggest that the frontal moraine has a hummocky surface signifying the presence of buried ice since no geophysical investigation of the frontal moraine is available it is unclear how deep this buried ice is supplementary section 1 shows that in one sector the debris cover is very thin but it certainly is not thin everywhere as a result and relying on our field knowledge of the lake s frontal moraine the breach height in an extreme magnitude case is considered till the point where the hummocky terrain ends where the height appears to be 104 m this moraine height is consistent with the findings of reynolds and richardson 2000 who found that the terminal moraines from the neoglacial maxima often exceed 100 m in height where the resulting lakes can contain 1 20 million m3 of water presenting a serious hazard threat to the downstream regions furthermore the more widely studied thulagi lake located in the upper marsyangdi catchment northern nepal is dammed by a debris covered stagnant ice body 100 m thick that dates back to the last glacial advance hanisch et al 1998 1999 pant and reynolds 1999 therefore for modeling the extreme magnitude glofs of lower barun lake it is assumed that breach incision occurs until it reaches the base of the moraine i e hb 104 m table 1 further in the case of high magnitude events hb is considered to be the mean depth of the lake fujita et al 2013 and the corresponding vw is calculated based on the lake bathymetry in the moderate magnitude scenarios hb is assumed to be half of the high magnitude breach depths and in the low magnitude glofs hb is half of the moderate magnitude breach the pfv from the lake in any of the above glofs depends on the bed topography bathymetry and breach dimensions of the frontal moraine we calculate the drainable flood volume based on the height of the breach hb as the present bed topography of lower barun lake does not allow its entire volume to drain even in an extreme magnitude breach i e volume below 104 m hb does not drain fig 6 a the assumed floods are of water only and do not include ingested sediment in the total emitted flood volumes the dynamical behavior of the flood such as impulsive ejection of water from below hb or downstream deposited sediment the hydraulic flood modeling also does not include bank erosional or depositional changes in channel valley geometry during the events 4 4 dynamic routing and hydraulic assessment along the flow channel two dimensional hydrodynamic routing of the breach hydrographs for each breach scenario scenarios 1 8 was performed using hec ras along the flow channel from lower barun lake to site 5 located 70 km downstream the hydraulic behavior of the glof wave was analyzed at six different sites barun bazaar and site 1 to site 5 fig 1 along the flow channel based on flood discharge q flow depths df and flow velocities vf the manning s roughness coefficient associated with the channel is extracted for the flow area using a landsat 8 derived lulc 30 m of nepal uddin et al 2015 our pixel based manning s roughness distribution n for the given flow regime ranged from 0 035 to 0 17 based on the different lulc classes present along the flow area our approach using landsat imagery can capture the large scale roughness but not 1 to 30 m scale roughness elements so it is merely an approximation to what might be encountered by an outburst it may apply strictly only to the largest modeled outburst events but could also apply to the smaller events if there is a scale independent fractal roughness over the range of scales of the modeled floods the detailed model settings are given in the supplementary section 2 the model outputs were analyzed to evaluate the flow hydraulics of the glof wave along the channel the result metrics are represented in the form of flood inundation limits if km2 discharge q m3 s 1 flow velocity vf m s 1 and depth df m at which the evacuated lake water travels down the barun valley 5 results 5 1 future lake extent and volume the lower barun future lake extent and volume were calculated using an ice thickness approach where the present bathymetry of the lake was combined to the frontal overdeepening extent of the lower barun glacier of the four different outputs of modeled overdeepening glaptop f 0 6 f 0 7 f 0 8 and ensembled output the ensemble model results farinotti et al 2019 correlated most accurately to the present lake extent with a difference of 5 fig s6 the ensembled ice thickness of lower barun glacier has a maximum thickness of 258 m with surface elevation ranging between 4551 and 6669 m a s l the depths of the frontal overdeepening range up to 197 m fig 5b the spatially distributed bathymetry of the overdeepening site calculated using ice thickness and surface elevation data farinotti et al 2019 occupies a total area of 1 62 km2 extending approximately 2 km upstream from the present glacier terminus fig 5b and fig 6b c the overdeepening zone terminates where the bed elevation abruptly rises into an ice cliff fig 5c and fig 6b the field based lake bathymetry reveals a maximum depth of 205 m with the deepest point located near the current terminus fig 5b the deepest point of the overdeepening ensemble occurs at about the same location as that of the lake bathymetry i e if the ice were removed the new lake bed would be about 197 m deep the depth at the deepest point of the overdeepening 197 m has a difference of 5 compared to the bathymetric lake depth at that given point the average difference in the depths overdeepening bathymetry minus lake bathymetry of the overlapping area fig 5b and s6 is calculated to be less than 3 the maximum depth of the future lake derived after combining the spatially distributed current lake bathymetry and overdeepening bathymetry is 205 m which shows that the lake has already reached its deepest point the future volume of lower barun lake calculated by combining the bathymetries of the modeled frontal overdeepening zone plus the field based lake bathymetry is 193 5 106 m3 covering a total area of 2 69 km2 this volume was used for future lake glof hazard modeling as discussed in the next section 5 2 avalanche modeling and overtopping we modeled two potential avalanches with their sources from the surrounding south slope of the lake one of which has witnessed a previous avalanche recorded by the field team avalanche 1 fig s5 and fig 7 e in avalanche 1 a total of 9 2 105 m3 volume enters into the lake with a maximum velocity of 34 m s 1 fig 7a and 7b the maximum flow velocity is 59 m s 1 212 km h 1 the flow speed is double to that of the flow speeds of the avalanche witnessed during fieldwork the modeled impulse wave generated at the site of impact approaches the frontal moraine at a speed of 13 m s 1 fig 7c the wave overtops the frontal moraine with a flow height of 6 2 m draining a total volume of 9 3 104 m3 the second avalanche avalanche 2 with its source from another weak zone adjacent to the source of avalanche 1 carries 9 1 105 m3 of the total avalanche at a speed of 32 9 m s 1 to the lake the resultant impulse wave overtops the frontal moraine with a flow height of 5 7 m and an overtopping velocity of 12 4 m s 1 fig 7c draining 8 4 104 m3 of the lake volume although the model accounts for the water depth at the impact site the calculation does not include the tsunami type ramping up of wave amplitude and wave slow down due to lake shallowing toward the moraine but overall the modeling highlights the potential for large avalanches to generate powerful waves it is clear from the avalanche simulations that the frontal moraine of lower barun lake is susceptible to potential impact waves that can lead to the overtopping and subsequent breaching following which we evaluated the potential glofs of different magnitudes originating from the lake we note that the higher magnitude events can also originate from these slopes and that the overtopping heights of our modeled waves are very small compared to some historic ones such as that of a glof in peru hubbard et al 2005 emmer 2017 the overtopping hydrograph calculated for avalanche 1 impact wave has a peak of 9298 m3s 1 with a total overtopping duration of 21 s fig 8 for avalanche 2 impact the peak of 8300 m3s 1 is calculated where the overtopping duration is 20 s the overtopping hydrographs were routed downstream revealing df reaching up to 8 m and vf reaching up to 25 ms 1 both the flood waves avalanche 1 and avalanche 2 travel 18 km downstream of the lake with overtopping from avalanche 1being slightly of higher magnitude the overtopping flood does not affect barun bazaar at yangle kharke df and vf reaches up to 1 6 m and 1 4 ms 1 respectively these modeled events are thus likely to be a relatively high frequency low magnitude type 5 3 moraine breach and inter comparison of glof discharge glof hazard assessments of lower barun lake were conducted based on eight potential moraine breach events that vary dimensionally as a function of hb vw tf and bw the physics and dynamics of the breach s erosional process are not modeled each of the potential breach events produced a different outflow peak discharge qmax based on the given breach parameters fig 9 in general the future glofs resulted in higher discharges than the present lake glofs due to increased lake water volume here we assume that breach depths can reach a maximum of 104 m in any present and future extreme magnitude glof if breach incision completely propagates down to the base of the moraine fig 4 and fig 6a such events are rare in nature and depend on the moraine conditions and trigger magnitude in the case of lower barun lake it potentially drains the volume in the water column above 104 m i e the lake s maximum drainable flood volume for example the potential extreme magnitude glof event scenario 1 present and scenario 5 future produced a qmax of 44 240 m3 s 1 and 52 344 m3 s 1 respectively immediately downstream of the lake fig 9 a sharp rise is seen in the outflow hydrograph where qmax is reached within 20 min after the initiation of the breach in both present and future cases releasing a total flood volume of 101 29 106 m3 and 179 106 m3 respectively table 1 for other present scenarios 2 4 flood volume varies between 16 and 78 8 106 m3 while qmax is reached 28 64 min after the initiation of the breach in the present case similarly for future scenarios 6 8 the peak is reached 26 58 min after the breach event initiation as it releases a flood volume of 26 9 to 139 5 106 m3 5 4 hydraulic characterization of glofs along the flow channel glof inundations were calculated for eight different dam breach scenarios with variations in their breach formation time tf breach height hb and breach width bw we also evaluated q m3 s 1 vf m s 1 and df m by flood routing of the individual breach hydrographs obtained for each of the scenarios section 5 3 fig 9 this enabled us to characterize and compare the effects of flood water progression from the various breach scenarios down the barun and arun valley here we present the results of an inter comparison of the flow hydraulics at six different sites downstream of the lake barun bazaar and site 1 to site 5 fig 1 due to the large magnitude of the glof flows any additional flow added by existing stream flows in the barun and arun rivers were considered negligible 5 4 1 inter comparison of routed hydraulics of potential current glofs in scenario 1 present extreme magnitude scenario the glof wave first reaches barun bazaar 1 h 5 min after the initiation of the breach event for scenarios 2 4 the arrival time at this site ranges between 1 h 12 min to 6 h 30 min here df reaches up to 26 m with a maximum vf of 9 m s 1 table 2 figs 10 11 and 12 the glofs could potentially inundate a cluster of small houses located along the river left bank of the arun river fig 13 the low magnitude glof scenario 4 terminates before it reaches site 2 and moderate magnitude glof scenario 3 terminates before reaching site 5 at site 1 the glofs potentially inundates a small settlement consisting of 10 15 houses and a bridge with df and vf reaching up to 22 m and 6 m s 1 farther downstream site 2 and site 3 located 1 km apart reveal similar flow behavior where df ranges from 20 m to 27 m and vf between 1 m s 1 to 3 m s 1 here three small settlements one bridge and 0 04 km2 of agricultural land become inundated fig 13 among all the potential current glofs and the studied sites downstream site 1 to site 5 including barun bazaar a maximum df of 36 m scenario 1 is reached in site 4 where the 900 mw arun iii hydropower project has its starting tunnel this is due to the sharp turn of the river channel towards the west here the potential glofs have a major impact inundating a moderate sized settlement two bridges and several roads fig 13 as the potential glofs propagate downstream they reach site 5 70 km downstream with arrival timing of 4 h 48 min scenario 1 and 7 h 8 min scenario 2 where df reaches up to 19 m here the glof wave has a maximum vf of 3 m s 1 though its flow energy attenuates as it propagates farther downstream 5 4 2 routed hydraulics of potential future glofs the hydrodynamic routing and flow assessments of the future glofs were evaluated for scenarios 5 6 7 and 8 table 2 the routed hydrographs were calculated based on the lake s future extent and volume 193 5 106 m3 see section 4 1 in a potential extreme magnitude future glof event scenario 5 the drainable volume vw from the lake is calculated to be 179 0 106 m3 considering hb 104 m as a maximum breach depth table 1 fig 9 the flood wave arrives at barun bazaar a few minutes 5 min earlier relative to that of scenario 1 present extreme magnitude glof here the df and vf reach up to 29 m and 11 m s 1 respectively table 2 fig 12 this accounts for an increase of 11 and 20 respectively when compared to a present extreme magnitude event the at risk infrastructure remains the same at site 1 2 and 3 however the flow hydraulics are variable figs 10 12 at site 4 df reaches a maximum of 37 m with a peak vf of 7 m s 1 this is the highest velocity calculated at this site compared to all the other modeled glof events in this study here the inundation limits extend further southward engulfing the maximum area containing infrastructure and settlements the flood wave travels further down the valley for about 3 km but has no impact due to the absence of infrastructure or settlement in scenario 6 which represents a future high magnitude glof the flood wave encounters barun bazaar 1 h 22 min after the breach event table 2 flow hydraulics indicate peak df and vf are decreased by 4 m and 2 m s 1 respectively and its arrival time at site 1 is delayed by 20 min compared to scenario 5 fig 12 at site 2 and site 3 the flow hydraulics show a reduction of df and vf by an average of 9 5 m and 2 m s 1 at these sites compared to the extreme magnitude future lake glof the flood wave arrives at site 4 40 min later compared to an extreme magnitude glof scenario 5 event and indicates a decrease in df and vf by 7 m and 5 4 m s 1 respectively at site 5 the flood wave is delayed by 1 h 24 min when compared to scenario 5 the overall attenuation of q from barun bazaar to site 5 is 11 965 m3 s 1 in the case of a moderate magnitude future glof scenario 7 the arrival of the flood wave to barun bazaar is slower by approximately an hour compared to the extreme magnitude scenario 5 the flood wave does not reach site 5 as it loses its flow energy downstream the at risk infrastructure upstream of site 4 remains similar to the above scenarios at site 4 vf reduces to 1 2 m s 1 with a discharge of 1130 m3 s 1 here however df rises to 25 m as the flow is obstructed due to the sharp bend in the channel the if decreases by 50 and 33 when compared to scenario 5 and scenario 6 respectively the hydraulic evaluation of scenario 8 a low magnitude glof event reveals a similar glof wave to that of scenario 4 though with a comparable reduction in the peak flood by 592 m3 s 1 it releases 9 of the total volume of the lake the flood attenuates 42 km downstream of the lake before it reaches site 4 the total if along the channel is 6 6 km2 with mean df and vf values of 6 m and 5 6 m s 1 respectively of the eight glof scenarios described above section 5 3 only four scenarios including the potential extreme magnitude glofs scenarios 1 and 5 high magnitude glofs scenarios 2 and 6 impact all the studied sites barun bazaar site 1 to 5 figs 10 13 the moderate magnitude glofs has an impact up to site 4 as it loses momentum further downstream before reaching site 5 the low magnitude present lake event impacts only until site 1 whereas in the future lake scenario impacts down to site 3 6 discussion 6 1 overtopping hazard overtopping flows occur when there is a sudden influx of mass into the lake that displaces the water forming displacement waves clague and evans 2000 westoby et al 2014 at lower barun lake the potential overtopping waves that resulted due to avalanche impacts are very short lived fig 8 the hydrographs reached higher peaks draining a small volume of the lake than that of the breach events table 1 based on the downstream flow hydraulics of the overtopping waves originating from the lake it is seen that the hazard is minimal for downstream sites as the flood waves attenuate 18 km from the lake the valley is currently devoid of any settlement until barun bazaar located 29 7 km downstream of the lake however at yangle kharka flood waves could potentially affect a couple of existing structures though minimally since flow depth and flow velocity reach up to only 1 6 m and 1 4 ms 1 fig 8 the bathymetry of the lake deepest in the west and shoaling to the east and emptying into a funnel like outlet would promote the role of tsunami ramp ups whose energetic waves could be focused down into the area of ponds and the outlet channel potentially incising the outlet and allowing a greater outflow our calculations show that relatively small avalanches can lead to the ovetopping of the lake 6 2 plausibility of slow glof and fast glof scenarios the field collected bathymetric data allows realistic and robust modeling of glacial lake outburst flood events in the himalaya we modeled eight potential scenarios though we recognize that glofs could occur in several other ways for example the glof that occurred from peruvian lake palcacocha in 1941 was a to the bottom breach leading to almost 95 lake water released however this is uncommon and only associated with specific topographical settings emmer 2017 not all glofs are similar even if they occur from the same lake westoby et al 2014 rounce et al 2016 for example in some circumstances a large fraction of a large glacial lake s volume could drain out in a matter of hours or days and still not cause extreme damage downstream except to very low lying infrastructure we thus define in our discussion fast glofs whose proximal hydrographs peak within minutes of initiation of an outburst event and slow glofs whose hydrographs peaks hours after an event starts and may take much longer to complete a slow glof may be generated when the drainable volume is constrained by smaller breach dimensions or a large but slowly hours long eroding breach on the contrary fast glofs have much higher peak volume discharge and potential flow energy per unit time as larger and fast formed breach dimensions allow for an enormous and rapid outlet discharge additionally a glof might initiate slowly but then enter a speedier phase as some critical failure occurs hence fast and slow glofs are not immutable it is a concept that we introduce here to propel focused discussion so stated fast glofs appear to pose a relatively larger threat to downstream settlements and infrastructures as demonstrated by our modeling the rapidity of a moraine dam s breakup depends on the magnitude of the trigger and the initial disturbance that starts a self accelerating outflow it also depends on the amount and distribution of buried ice the shape of the moraine the hydraulic pressure at the base of the moraine hence the depth of impounded water and height of the moraine and an important factor that is rarely considered the slope and roughness of the bedrock beneath the moraine the lower barun moraine dam is high and the lake is deep while a shoaling near the moraine could allow large tsunami runups ice and large boulders are present in the moraine supplementary 1 but how much of these and their internal arrangements are unknown as is the shape and slope of the bedrock base beneath the moraine an assessment of the stability or metastability of the moraine dam or a numerical study of the dynamics of a moraine erosional event would require geophysical knowledge of the moraine s properties lacking knowledge of these we have focused on what is known the lake volume from the 2015 field survey was used to model potential glofs in the current state with the accelerating retreat of connected lower barun glacier the lake area grew by 0 25 km2 in the last 5 years 2015 2019 fig s4 this implies that the glof hazard will likely change as the melting and retreating glacier fills the enlarging moraine dammed proglacial lake clague and evans 1994 the seismically active regime of the nepal himalaya has witnessed numerous mass movement events like landslides avalanches and rockfalls of various magnitudes kargel et al 2016 these primary events as witnessed and identified in this study may act as potential glof triggers in the region especially in the case of lower barun lake which is surrounded by steep slopes with hanging ice masses the langmale glof in 2017 byers et al 2018 is an example of such an event that occurred near lower barun lake fig 1 in fact a landslide maybe a small moraine collapse placed directly into the outlet channel potentially raising the lake by several meters over a several day period could prove to create a hazardous glof if that dam breaks up suddenly a low magnitude avalanche event was witnessed and captured during our fieldwork at the lake site in 2015 fig s5 but it did not result in any known unusual discharge event however our modeling of relatively higher magnitude avalanches shows that the frontal moraine of lower barun lake is susceptible to overtopping the glof hazard magnitudes due to avalanches and rockfalls may extend across the full range of the potential glof scenarios modeled in this study the smaller ones being more frequent than the larger the peak discharge from lower barun glofs at the current state can reach as high as 20 810 m3 s 1 and can increase by 5224 m3 s 1 in the future flow depths and velocities reaching up to 29 m and 11 m s 1 can present the valley with great risk possibly the typical risk would be to downstream populations along the channel the breach depths of the moraine in the two low magnitude events categorized as slow glofs account for only 15 of the total moraine height of the lake thereby restricting the lake release volume and discharge rate such flow events pose no severe threat to the barun valley as the flow energy is significantly reduced as it propagates downstream and largely attenuates into a steady flow these events may be common in the himalaya although likely remain unreported as these floods typically have little or no significant impact on human settlements or infrastructure veh et al 2018 in a dam breach the opening forms at the top of the embankment barrier and as the failure continues it gradually grows a breach may also develop as a piping failure including openings or holes that propagate internal erosion within an embankment and grow outwardly until the opening reaches the top of the embankment westoby et al 2015 regardless if a breach forms due to embankment overtopping or piping the size of the opening will increase over time as more and more water passes over or through the opening once initiated a glof may progress to an extreme magnitude event huggel et al 2004 such as scenarios 1 and 4 in this study if the overtopping wave or the ensuing outflow continues to erode the dam progressively therefore the hazard assessment in the case of a potential extreme magnitude glof cannot be neglected by contrast our evaluation of flood wave behavior for extreme magnitude glofs high magnitude glofs and moderate magnitude glofs both present and the future scenarios ties them to the production of fast glofs these hazard events have much higher flow energy compared to the slow glofs this is because the glof peak is reached more rapidly during a progressive breaching event with breach depths sometimes propagating down to the base of the frontal moraine 104 m in case of lower barun moreover the breach widths bw are also significantly higher 3 to 4 times than that of the slow glofs allowing higher outflow discharge from the lake the flow velocities vf along the routed channel are comparatively much higher and therefore travel downstream for longer distances both values an order of magnitude greater when compared to the slow events glof triggers and breach formation mechanisms remain uncertain in most cases however detailed engineering field investigations can reduce them this is most often very challenging in harsh terrain such as the himalaya however for disaster preparedness and mitigation hydraulic modeling of these events provides valuable initial insights and motivations for the needed geophysical field studies and engineering work in the aforementioned case of peru s palcacocha glof the transport and deposition of giant boulders and finer sediment caused thousands of deaths casualties would likely have been far smaller if the event only involved water the amount of ingested transported and deposited sediment from possible glofs from lower barun lake will be tightly connected to the duration of the peak discharge part of the flood emission the eroded volume of the moraine dam and the amount of erodible sediments along the channel hence the sediment component is also tied to whether it is a fast or a slow glof 6 3 shifting lower barun hazard in the future the barun arun valley geographically located at the base of mt makalu has been a favorable region for hydropower generation and currently hosts several infrastructure and hydropower plants that are either fully functional under construction or planned these new developments are opening ways for the communities to expand in the valley in addition to the enormous hydropower potential the valley possesses it also hosts several glacial lakes in the high altitude glacierized regions of which upper barun and lower barun lakes are the prominent ones fig 1 but as the langmale flood shows are not the only dangerous lakes these high altitude lakes and potential glofs present enough downstream threat to impact or destroy the at risk infrastructure these potential impacts are intensifying both due to increases in the frequency of hazards and vulnerabilities with increased development currently the valley is not equipped with any mitigation measures to counter these threats and development planning proceeds as though the risk is nil this study provides the basis for glof preparedness based on the present and future anticipated glofs in the valley the modeled glofs were compared for flow hydraulics along the flow channel to evaluate the shift in hazard potential from the current state to future state of the eight potential glof events we have modeled the slow low magnitude glof events scenario 4 and scenario 8 show similar behavior in both present and future states due to their limited breach and drainable flood volumes however the extreme magnitude cases scenario 1 and scenario 5 reveals a change in flow dynamics and glof hazards along the lower barun valley an overall rise in the total inundation modeled in a potential future lake glof event scenario 5 6 and 7 is observed when compared to the current scenario scenario 1 2 and 3 figs 10 11 and 13 the flow hydraulics q vf and df comparison for the present and future scenarios shows that the q and vf shift is more profound than df fig 12 this can be attributed to the higher flow energy and discharge which tends to reduce the frictional resistance compared to a relatively lower discharge event an increase in q and vf by 33 and 36 respectively are observed in the future extreme magnitude event compared to a present extreme magnitude glof further the arrival timings of the glof wave at the selected sites decrease in a potential future event due to higher pfv which results in a higher momentum the attenuation of the flood wave is seen to be prominent more towards the downstream part of the valley after the flood crosses site 3 where the difference in flood wave arrival timing increases fig s7 this is due to higher channel friction and lower flow volume as the glof propagates downstream this information becomes vital in designing and implementing any adaptation measures along the barun and arun rivers flow path as part of disaster preparedness furthermore a comparison of the flow hydraulics revealed that the glof arrival at the first site of interest barun bazaar decreases by 4 16 min in the fast glofs this is due to the comparatively more rapid peaking of vf in future glofs which is governed by the breach parameters and pfv this difference in glof arrival timing is observed more prominently in the downstream part of the valley after site 3 this may be attributed to the loss of flow volume and channel resistance as the flood propagates down the valley the decreased time carries with it a greater challenge for potential glof warning systems and evacuation scenarios in addition the total if along the flow channel increases by 15 in case of future glofs compared to potential present events this is due to the rise of df resulting in higher water surface elevation in potential future glofs fig 13 although the glof hazard in both present and future scenarios are very high a future event coupled with increasing development intensifies the risk that lower barun lake will pose to the low lying areas downvalley 6 4 future directions we do not model the erosion dynamics of the breach in the moraine dam yager et al 2012 modeled grain transport in steeply sloping mountain channels and emphasized the important hydrodynamic role of large immobile protruding obstacles like large boulders in reducing the transport of smaller mobile grains in the case of lower barun lake s end moraine dam there is a ubiquitous presence within a fine grained matrix of large boulders many are 1 to 6 m across supplementary section 1 and some are several tens of meters whereas 1 m boulders are normal bedload material and can be readily transported in mountain streams along with finer particles over time they could be transported rapidly during high discharge glofs the larger boulders could remain immobile and retard erosional downcutting such that peak glof discharge will be limited or alternatively an incredible outflow may rapidly mobilize the large boulders and prevent them from armoring the channel a question for lower barun lake is whether there are enough large boulders in the dam to create an armoring lag deposit in principle but not modeled here a large initial outflow could move large boulders and induce runaway erosion and outflow future work should link the overtopping and erosion dynamics including the critical roles of large boulders and the erosional susceptibility of heterogeneously composed moraine dams to understand the full process chain which we have not done currently in this paper to undertake this work we would need detailed in situ geophysical and sedimentological data on the moraine more detailed bathymetry of the lakes and then theoretical modeling analytical or numerical to understand the processes and threshold flows under which the moraine could undergo runaway erosion also needed is a better knowledge of the geotechnical properties of potentially unstable masses of rock and ice on the mountain slopes their potential failure mechanisms and mass flow behavior overall an obvious future direction is to include sediment explicitly in the hydraulic modeling because the sediment will affect the flow depth arrival time at various points and deposition at downstream locations it may thus become useful in the next step of the investigation to distinguish and model dirty glofs debris rich and clean glofs mainly water with an emphasis on viscous flows 7 conclusions detailed hydrodynamic scenario modeling reveals the hazard potential of moraine dammed lower barun lake the deepest and one of the largest known glacial lakes in nepal the lake has shown substantial area growth from 0 04 km2 in 1975 to 2 09 km2 in 2019 the present 2015 volume of the lake was measured as 112 3 106 m3 and the future volume is calculated as 193 5 106 m3 the flow hydraulics of the overtopping waves caused due to impact from potential avalanches show that the barun valley is minimally impacted as the upstream part of the valley is devoid of infrastructure in the case of glofs the maximum drainable volumes in an extreme magnitude flood originating from the lake in the present and future are calculated to be 101 2 106 m3 and 179 106 m3 respectively additionally we evaluated hydrodynamic flow metrics for sites along the river valley for potential glofs originating from both present and the estimated future lake volume the at risk infrastructure remains similar in the case of present and future fast glofs however the impact changes in the future as flow hydraulics vf if and df increases in potential future events this is due to larger lake volume resulting in rapid breaching and higher outflow peak and total discharge numerous small settlements and infrastructure including agricultural fields and hydroelectric power projects under construction or planned are under potential flood risk the possible impact of slow glofs in the valley is significantly less than that of fast events as both the lower barun lake and the barun valley evolve the potential threat from this upstream lake increases the magnitude of fast glof events can significantly affect the downstream infrastructure both in the current state and in the future affecting up to 70 km downstream of the lake based on the present study regular monitoring of lower barun lake is highly recommended further the results presented here can serve as base information for disaster and flood mitigation particularly needed are in situ geophysical studies that may provide constraints on the potential for fast versus slow glofs credit authorship contribution statement

4490,climate change driven retreat of glaciers is producing thousands of glacial lakes across mountain regions these lakes generally grow coalesce into larger lakes that may produce increased downstream hazards and risks due to glacial lake outburst floods glofs this study assesses such hazards of lower barun lake located near mount everest nepal we model a series of scenarios including two potential avalanches that enter the lake from the surrounding slope and eight potential glofs from the lake to evaluate the susceptibility of the frontal moraine to overtopping we characterize the initial avalanche induced surge of water over the moraine caused by the kinetic energy of arriving masses and possible tsunami like events further we present physical hydrodynamic models that reveal the hazard from the potential overtopping and glof events along the barun arun river valley special attention is given to analyze the flow hydraulics at six downstream settlements to estimate potential impacts at each location two extreme magnitude two high magnitude two moderate magnitude and two low magnitude glofs were hydraulically evaluated for the present lake dimension and the modeled future growth of the lake as with most hydrological processes the magnitude and frequency of glofs from lower barun lake have an inverse albeit uncertain relationship but the potential impacts on people and infrastructure are extremely sensitive to the events magnitude the flow dynamics results indicate that an overtopping flood without erosion of the damming moraine causes minimal impact in the valley the extreme magnitude and high magnitude glof cases where the moraine is incised have a larger impact but differ greatly in magnitude at each of the downstream settlements the moderate magnitude and low magnitude glofs while the most frequent type have limited volume and peak discharge causing less impact downstream our calculations only portray the part of the hydrograph representing lake overfill due to a volume of ice or rock entering the lake and the volume of the lake that could drain from a breach of the damming moraine down to specified depths over specified time periods keywords glacial lake glof hazard himalaya hec ras 1 introduction rising global temperatures have increased glacier melting during this century at rates more rapid than in the previous century bolch et al 2012 kraaijenbrink et al 2017 roe et al 2017 as meltwater becomes more voluminous runoff can accumulate in depressions on thinning and sagging glacier surfaces or in front of receding glaciers and form moraine dammed lakes such as lower barun in nepal linsbauer et al 2016 haeberli et al 2016 sattar et al 2019b moraine dammed glacial lakes are the most common sources of glacial lake outburst floods glofs watanbe and rothacher 1996 westoby et al 2014 glofs have been observed many times since the end of the little ice age vuichard and zimmermann 1987 kargel et al 2011 carey et al 2012 clague and o connor 2015 vilímek et al 2015 anacona et al 2015a paul and bolch 2019 however glofs emanating from moraine dammed lakes worldwide became far more common in the 1930s an increase believed to be due to lagging responses to the end of the little ice age since then the incidence of glofs has fluctuated first rising sharply and then falling somewhat since the 1980s harrison et al 2018 yet it is expected to increase within parts of the himalaya in the coming decades veh et al 2020 moraine dammed lakes are confined by end moraines or lateral moraines with ice forming the up valley lake margin until the glacier retreats farther and detaches these moraines however usually consist of unconsolidated sediment thereby making dam structures unstable compared with bedrock dams many of the moraines especially in the himalaya initially contain ice richardson and reynolds 2000 which provides greater structural strength but eventually melts leaving unconsolidated sediment and poor structural support to the dam as the dams degrade due to erosion or melting of the ice the lakes may gradually lower or become infilled with sediment and slowly disappear sudden glofs from moraine dammed or any other types of naturally dammed glacial lakes supraglacial or ice marginal sometimes occur and pose risks to downstream infrastructure and communities osti and egashira 2009 kropáček et al 2015 allen et al 2016 as lakes continue to grow in number and size globally shugar et al 2020 so does the cause for concern glofs from moraine dammed lakes may be triggered by 1 overtopping and erosion of the moraine dam caused by waves generated from ice avalanches rockfalls or calving 2 meteorological conditions especially extreme rain events which may partly melt ice in the moraine dam and weaken the moraine or cause overfill and thermal and physical erosion of the moraine or induce a mass movement into the lake 3 degradation from within the moraine dam melt through due to seepage from the lake and physical erosion piping or flotation of the moraine s buried ice by the hydrostatic gradient imposed by the lake 4 a small glof perhaps from a supraglacial pond may overfill a moraine dammed lake or 5 seismic activity when strong ground motion destabilizes the damming structure richardson and reynolds 2000 westoby et al 2014 these potential triggers each involves a stochastic chain reaction sequence which cannot be explicitly predicted but may be understood either statistically for a population of similar lakes or individually through scenario modeling here because we are investigating one lake we take the latter approach all trigger mechanisms associated with glofs can range in magnitude and severity depending on the lake s and terrain s individual details including 1 the lake s total drainable volume 2 the internal sedimentological structure of the moraine dam which can have low internal friction and high propensity to break up suddenly and cause high peaked outbursts or alternatively can have high internal friction and produce robust boulder armoring of drainage conduits and thus limit erosion and reduce peak discharge 3 the amount distribution and structure of buried ice in the end moraine which can control the likelihood and rate of melt through piping and can cause large changes in the moraine s structural integrity 4 the width to height ratio of the moraine dam for instance a dam that is sharply peaked can readily and quickly break up whereas a broad dam is more robust 5 the height of the moraine dam both the freeboard which controls the damage and amount of overtopping for a given size of the wave and the down valley slope that partly controls the hydraulic pressure 6 the lake s position with respect to its surrounding topography which can either allow large mass movements to enter the lake rapidly and with large and sudden kinetic energy input or not 7 the mass of unstable hanging glaciers snow or perched fractured bedrock on adjacent mountain slopes or 8 the lake bed and shore structure that can either cause tsunami waves to ramp up sharply or undergo constructive wave interferences or cause tsunami waves to diffuse harmlessly we note that one recent example of a mass movement induced displacement wave caused overtopping of a moraine dam having 80 m of freeboard so these waves can be rather extreme hubbard et al 2005 emmer 2017 more modest impulse wave overtopping by about 5 m caused for example by a large ice avalanche into lake 513 in peru worni et al 2014 and similar to the smallest avalanche triggered events modeled in this paper can nonetheless generate damaging debris flows the rapid growth in the size and number of glacial lakes along with rapid increases in infrastructure development e g hydropower plants roads and bridges and population in mountainous regions have catalyzed the need for comprehensive regional and global mapping of glacial

economic development opportunities at glacial lakes regmi et al 2017 emmer 2018 in disaster risk assessment and management risk conventionally involves the confluence of hazard vulnerability and exposure e g lavell et al 2012 or if these are quantified then the risk is the product of these components the relative risk a glof may present to the downstream region depends on the hazard components consisting of peak discharge and cumulative discharge which are functions of the drainable volume of the lake condition of the damming moraine potential glof triggers listed above and overtopping due to external impact which together determines the hazard and the exposure and vulnerability of elements downstream of the lake infrastructure human life and ecological values including the resilience of these at risk components the risk that a potentially dangerous lake may present to the low lying areas may be unrecognized unless a detailed hazard and risk assessment are undertaken glof hazard assessments often contain inherent uncertainties as outburst events are hypothesized to occur in the future due to a variety of potential triggering processes however applying variable assumptions and conditions within hydrodynamic modeling based on the spatial and geological characteristics of a lake and its surroundings allows us to understand how a valley will behave in a lake failure event furthermore developing detailed assessments and models addressing extreme magnitude scenarios are needed for responsive disaster preparedness and mitigation the purpose of this study is to evaluate the glof hazard associated with lower barun lake located in the nepal himalaya by performing a series of modeling and downstream flood routing given the complexity of the possible glof triggers in the mountainous basin our first objective includes identifying and modeling potential avalanche around the lake to evaluate the susceptibility of the damming moraine to overtopping and downstream propagation of the overtopping flow although we do not model the erosion of the frontal moraine some points about this erosion are considered in supplementary section 1 the second objective is focused on glof hazard assessment by assuming that an overtopping wave can initiate erosion irrespective of the trigger and lead to complete breaching of the moraine thus this objective can be broadly categorized into two parts i potential glofs originating from lower barun lake at its current state present lake under the following scenarios extreme magnitude high magnitude moderate magnitude and low magnitude glofs ii consider the same scenarios for the maximum future extent and estimated volume of the lake the latter builds on the first but considers the future volume and extent of the lake for all four scenarios the magnitude in each scenario relates to modeled flood volume which integrates the breach parameters as flood volume tracks with both breach values on table 1 to achieve the first objective we used remotely sensed data field collected information of potential avalanches that could trigger a glof and two dimensional dynamic physical models including ramms rapid mass movement simulation and hec ras for the second objective we used remotely sensed data field collected lake bathymetry haritashya et al 2018 and hec ras hydrodynamic modeling we do not consider the instances of cascading hazards e g kirschbaum et al 2019 such as glof spilling from nearby upper barun lake into lower barun lake because our focus is on the direct inputs of solid mass into lower barun lake and downstream glof hazard assessment the series of outburst flood events modeled in this study are used to evaluate the downstream impact of the different magnitude of floods originating from the lake in the present and the future irrespective of the trigger mechanism 2 study area background and importance glof studies in the hindu kush karakoram himalaya hkkh previously ranged from regional scale assessments quincey et al 2007 worni et al 2013 nie et al 2017 veh et al 2018 to site specific hazard assessments osti and egashira 2009 bajracharya and mool 2009 fujita et al 2009 shrestha et al 2010 sattar et al 2019a 2019c in the nepal himalaya glacial lake studies include comprehensive glacial lake inventories reynolds and taylor 2004 bajracharya and mool 2009 khadka et al 2018 identification of hazardous glacial lakes rounce et al 2017 glof return period cook et al 2018 and glof reconstruction byers et al 2018 among the largest glacial lakes in nepal imja lake imja tsho has been the most widely studied including detailed glof modeling somos valenzuela et al 2015 lala et al 2018 field based geophysical investigation of the frontal moraine dahal et al 2018 investigations of its evolution over the past few decades e g fujita et al 2009 haritashya et al 2018 and flood risk and management cuellar and mckinney 2017 in the last two decades however nearby lower barun glacial lake 27 47 51 n 87 05 26 e in the makalu region of nepal has been growing rapidly nearly doubling in area since the 1960s to 2 2 km2 in 2019 fig s4 the lake is oriented east west within the upper barun drainage basin fig 1 and it sits at an elevation of about 4550 m the barun river a tributary of the arun river sankhuwasabha district eastern nepal drains from lower barun lake and barun glacier which feeds the lake the barun river also derives flow from upper barun lake and other smaller lakes in the basin which drains down alongside lower barun lake but is separated by a lateral moraine as upper barun lake itself poses a significant glof hazard small future changes in drainage could produce a formidable cascading hazard situation for now we only evaluate lower barun s hazard without involvement of upper barun lake lower barun glacier is characterized by numerous supraglacial lakes ice cliffs and thick debris cover in the lower ablation zone fig 2 a b lower barun lake is dammed by an ice cored moraine dahal et al 2018 haritashya et al 2018 on the east and the barun glacier s terminus to the west the damming moraine has a set of ponds through which the lake drains into and feeds the barun river in this regard it is similar to nepal s imja lake and unlike thulagi and rolpa lakes both of which drain directly over narrow end moraines without intervening ponds direct drainage over narrow steep end moraines makes thulagi and rolpa lakes more hazardous or more likely to drain in a shorter period of time than lower barun and imja lakes however of all these lakes lower barun is by far the deepest known lake with the largest drainable volume is the fastest growing and has the most rapid acceleration of growth haritashya et al 2018 see fig s4 and the adjacent mountain relief is immense furthermore lower barun s end moraine is undergoing thermokarstic evolution as is imja lake s such that one of two things will happen either the melting of ice within the end moraine will gradually lower the lake or else the end moraine will evolve to a structure like that of rolpa and thulagi lakes with a precarious narrow end moraine dam while the final state of lower barun s end moraine cannot be predicted with certainty the hazard associated with moraine failure is increased if the moraine evolves into a narrow structure hazards are reduced if interior moraine ice melts and lake levels fall the barun valley has witnessed at least two known glof events meon and schwarz 1993 usaid 2014 byers et al 2018 the first event flooded the arun river in 1964 and was witnessed by the local people but no other information about the source of the flood exists yamada and sharma 1993 the second outburst event occurred on april 17 2017 and involved a rockfall and avalanche into langmale glacial lake located 3 km east of lower barun lake byers et al 2018 the resulting flood deposited a huge volume of debris along the barun river flow channel and impacted the settlements of langmale and yangla kharke 6 5 km downstream fig 1 containing buddhist gompas and a few teahouses this event blocked the confluence of arun and the barun rivers 29 km downstream from lower barun lake and formed a short lived landslide dammed lake yamada and sharma 1993 identified lower barun lake as potentially dangerous based upon the examination of aerial photographs however kattelmann 2003 deemed lower barun lake to be less threatening than other lakes in the broader region such as imja lake primarily due to the sparsely populated downstream regions in any case lower barun lake has grown considerably since 2003 haritashya et al 2018 exposing it to large mountain sides and the langmale event indicate that some rock units and mountain peaks in the valley exhibit large masses of unstable rock byers et al 2018 posing a far greater threat than nearly two decades ago of particular concern today are potential impacts of outburst floods on existing and proposed regional hydroelectric projects downstream of lower barun lake for example the powerhouse of the proposed 1 4b 1061 megawatt mw upper arun hydroelectric project is located 2 km downstream from the confluence of barun and arun rivers immediately above site 1 in fig 1 https kathmandupost com money moreover the 900 mw arun iii hydropower project also on the arun river has its starting tunnel located 49 km downstream of lower barun lake immediately west of site 4 in fig 1 both of these projects would be completely exposed to a glof from lower barun lake therefore it is important to investigate the range of potential glof hazards as a precursor to the kind of detailed physical field science studies that preceded the engineered partial mitigation lake lowering and stabilization of drainage outlet of imja lake s glof hazard in 2014 undp imja report 2013 http cfgorrp dhm gov np recently several small settlements have formed along the lower barun and arun valleys identified using multi temporal high resolution google earth imagery and new hydropower projects could further spur growth in this valley potentially exposing them to large glof risks in the future our study includes the potential impact of various glof scenarios on several downstream sites barun bazaar and site 1 to site 5 as shown in fig 1 apart from these settlements numerous bridges and other small infrastructure exist along the channel downstream from lower barun lake to site 5 3 data bathymetric data were acquired during field investigation in october 2015 using an inflatable kayak mounted syqwest hydrobox sonar echo sounding sensor and modeled within arcgis using natural neighbor interpolation more details about the methodology related to bathymetric observations modeling and uncertainty can be found in haritashya et al 2018 lake bathymetric maps permitted an accurate simulation of the time varying drawdown of lower barun lake bathymetric information was also necessary to develop relatively accurate moraine breach models and determine the potential flood volume pfv released in different breach scenarios in avalanche simulations and hydrodynamic modeling terrain properties such as surface elevation and surface roughness are often extracted using digital elevation model dem and landuse and land cover lulc composites respectively here we used an advanced land observing satellite alos phased array type l band synthetic aperture radar palsar dem with a spatial resolution of 12 5 m the alos palsar dem is a radiometrically terrain corrected elevation product released globally in october 2014 by the alaska satellite facility https asf alaska edu data sets derived data sets alos palsar rtc alos palsar radiometric terrain correction it has been successfully used for dynamic glof routing previously in the himalaya dhote et al 2019 sattar et al 2019a maskey et al 2020 most models either use a constant value of manning s roughness coefficient or separate values for upstream and downstream routing we used landsat 8 derived lulc product 30 m uddin et al 2015 to extract pixel based manning s roughness coefficients along the flow channel this enables us to define ground channel friction in a spatially distributed pattern for accurate hydraulics for glacier bed mapping and future lake volume estimation we used the alos palsar dem glacier outlines rgi 6 0 and manually digitized glacier flowlines as inputs to generate an ice thickness model linsbauer et al 2012 we also employed the ensemble ice thickness farinotti et al 2019 and dem for a comparative analysis of the glacier bed here the glacier ice thickness distribution rgi160 15 03366 farinotti et al 2019 was used to derive the glacier bed and the frontal overdeepening extent 4 methodology the entire methodology of this study is summarized in fig 3 and details of each component are presented below 4 1 future lake extent and volume to calculate the lake s future volume we estimate the maximum extent of lower barun lake by mapping the glacier bed using a spatially distributed glacier ice thickness product and dem fig 3 and fig 5a lacking ice thickness soundings and subglacial bed topography we instead used the glacier bed topography glabtop method linsbauer et al 2012 and the ensembled ice thickness farinotti et al 2019 see section 3 for data used to calculate the glacier bed of lower barun glacier glabtop is a shear stress based model used to calculate ice thickness h for alpine glaciers described by h τ f ρg sin α where f is the shape factor ρ is the ice density g is the gravitational acceleration and sin α is the slope of the glacier the ensembled ice thickness is an average product derived using four different ice thickness models farinotti et al 2019 we used three different shape factors for glacier bed calculation using glabtop f 0 6 0 7 and 0 8 we also completed a raster based calculation of ice thickness to derive the distributed glacier bed for all three values of f an overdeepening site is extracted using raster based operations in a gis platform arcmap 10 7 1 by overdeepened we mean that the glacier bed extends to a lower elevation than the areas immediately downvalley from the lake the future lake extent and volume are obtained by interpolating between the current lake bathymetry resampled to 25 m and the modeled overdeepened bathymetry of the glacier bed e g fig 5b we compare the four different modeled glacier bed outputs glabtop 0 6 0 7 0 8 and ensemble output with the glacial lake extent and field measured depths the validated glacier bed is further used to calculate the volume of the frontal overdeepening site of the glacier the future lake volume for our hazard assessment analysis is calculated by combining the current lake volume from bathymetry data and the volume of frontal overdeepening both spatially resolved at 25 m this method to identify and map glacier bed overdeepening has been successfully used both at the global scale as well as locally in the himalaya linsbauer et al 2016 frey et al 2010 haeberli and linsbauer 2013 sattar et al 2019b the growth model also provides a good indication of how closely the west end of the lake will approach the high and steep adjacent mountain relief shown in fig 2e 4 2 potential glof triggers and overtopping we identify two potential weak zones around the lake from where ice avalanches could trigger any of the glofs considered in this study fig 2e hence we have modeled the avalanche impacts to determine if their impact waves overtop the frontal moraine the avalanche locations were not picked arbitrarily but are based on our field observation fig s5 and hazard assessment of rounce et al 2016 that identified slopes between 45 and 60 as being avalanche prone and where glacier ice masses appear to hang precariously most of these slopes host snow ice perched atop a steep bed which can be a potential trigger for any of the modeled glofs in this study a significant avalanche emanated from one of these slopes during fieldwork and a time series of the avalanche has been captured fig s5 the average speed of the avalanche as it crossed the lake was 100 km h 1 27 7 m s 1 calculated from the time it took to cross the width of the lake that is both measured and partly inferred by knowing approximately when it first reached the lake as the camera location and the route down the mountain is known and the vectors from the camera to the lake shore can be closely estimated the avalanche did not lead to the overtopping of the lake therefore we model a higher magnitude potential avalanche originating from the same location avalanche 1 for the second trigger avalanche 2 that can potentially have an impact on the future lake we recognize another major slope with hanging snow ice that occurs adjacent to the site described above as a potential avalanche source zone as discussed above and highlighted by haritashya et al 2018 the lake could grow up to this point towards its western end rendering it vulnerable from large scale avalanching from the surrounding slopes another important potential glof trigger is upper barun lake which could drain suddenly into lower barun lake however that is a unique trigger mechanism that we are not evaluating in this paper the severity of these ice snow mass movement triggering events has a relation to the volume of water displaced and the condition of the moraine thus impulsive expulsion of water by the kinetic energy of a mass input is considered we use ramms to model two potential avalanches ramms is based on voellmy salm finite volume method that solves the mass flow equations in two dimension christen et al 2010 the flow rheology of a mass movement is governed by the release area volume density of the material friction parameters and the underlying topography here we define the release area for two potential avalanches by selecting the contiguous pixels with high slope angles 45 60 we define ice snow thickness as 4 7 m and 4 9 m for avalanche 1 and avalanche 2 respectively releasing a total volume of 11 2 105 m3 of ice snow rounce et al 2016 in each case the density ρ of flow material is considered as 1000 kg m 3 ice with some rock debris and liquid water friction parameters include the coulomb friction μ and turbulent friction ξ bartelt et al 2013 which were set as 0 12 and 1000 m s 2 for μ and ξ respectively these input values are widely used to model avalanches in snow covered and glaciated terrain schneider et al 2014 somos valenzuela et al 2016 frey et al 2018 the outputs were obtained as avalanche runout distances m flow depths m and flow velocity m s 1 the avalanche induced impact waves generated by the potential avalanches were modeled empirically using the evers et al 2019 model a previous approach of heller and hager 2010 has been used for avalanche induced impulse wave characterization in glacial lakes in the himalaya lala et al 2018 byers et al 2018 2020 based on the same principles as heller and hager 2010 the approach of evers et al 2019 computes the overtopping wave height overtopping velocity and volume due to impulse waves based on updated studies the inputs to the model such as impact velocity impact volume slide thickness and slide width are derived from the ramms outputs we calculated the impact volume as the volume entering the lake at the end of an avalanche the impact wave run up angle and freeboard were calculated using dem and high resolution planet data based on the overtopping characteristics of the impact wave the overtopping volume in m3 and duration in sec from lower barun lake is determined for each impact avalanche 1 and avalanche 2 further the overtopping hydrographs were calculated based on the total overtopping volume and duration were used as an input for downstream flood routing we use hec ras v 5 0 7 https www hec usace army mil software hec ras a two dimensional hydrodynamic model to evaluate the downstream propagation of the overtopping wave the hydrodynamic module solves the depth averaged two dimensional shallow water equations saint venant equations in an unsteady flow the time series of flow depth df and flow velocity vf obtained as output in a spatially distributed manner are used to evaluate the glof hydraulics downstream of the lake the detailed model settings for 2d flood routing are given in the supplementary section 2 4 3 present and future glof hazard assessment and scenario modeling since overtopping flows can induce dam erosion forming an initial breach followed by progressive breach enlargement singh 1996 we assume the same in the case of lower barun lake therefore overtopping modeling is followed by dam breach flood glof modeling here we evaluate a series of potential glofs that can originate from lower barun lake assuming moraine breaching of different magnitudes potentially triggered by the overtopping wave and some scenarios implying that a dam breaching erosion event has occurred whereas we include a plausible functional form of the developing breach a sine function the function we select is not an actual erosional model therefore our glof modeling is based on the hypothetical magnitude of the water released pfv and the release duration not the sedimentological erosion modeling associated with the overtopping we use hec ras v 5 0 7 one dimensional and two dimensional hydrodynamic model to study eight potential glof events based on the varied breach parameters that represent current lake conditions scenarios 1 4 and maximum future lake extent scenarios 5 8 while keeping moraine dam geometry downstream valley geomorphology and river hydrological conditions the same in every simulation table 1 fig 4 hec ras has been used successfully in one and two dimensional hydrodynamic modeling of outburst floods in steep terrain like the himalaya klimeš et al 2014 anacona et al 2015b wang et al 2018 sattar et al 2019a 2019c 2020 our modeling assumes the continuation of the lake s rapid observed growth but by including a wide range of potential glof scenarios the effects of changing moraine breach properties are indirectly included each scenario has a unique set of parameters including the height of the breach hb time of moraine failure tf breach width bw all of which constrain the flood volume vw released in a potential outburst event and are calculated using froehlich 1995b 1 b w 0 1803 k o v w 0 32 h b 0 19 2 t f 0 00254 v w 0 53 h b 0 9 the high accuracy and low prediction error of these sets of equations make it the most widely used empirical approach for modeling earthen dam failures wahl 2004 all the scenarios were modeled as a sine wave progression breach model where the initial breach forms slowly and speeds up with time as outflow velocities and shear stress increases through the breach the output is obtained in the form of a breach hydrograph with a peak discharge qmax for each modeled event considered for downstream routing along the flow channel each output hydrograph was evaluated by comparing it with empirically calculated peak outflow discharge froehlich 1995a 3 q p 0 607 v w 0 295 h w 1 24 here we set up dam break models for two extreme magnitude events scenario 1 and scenario 5 two high magnitude events scenario 2 and scenario 6 two moderate magnitude events scenario 3 and scenario 7 and two low magnitude events scenario 4 and scenario 8 all originating from lower barun lake our field investigation and analysis of remotely sensed data suggest that the frontal moraine has a hummocky surface signifying the presence of buried ice since no geophysical investigation of the frontal moraine is available it is unclear how deep this buried ice is supplementary section 1 shows that in one sector the debris cover is very thin but it certainly is not thin everywhere as a result and relying on our field knowledge of the lake s frontal moraine the breach height in an extreme magnitude case is considered till the point where the hummocky terrain ends where the height appears to be 104 m this moraine height is consistent with the findings of reynolds and richardson 2000 who found that the terminal moraines from the neoglacial maxima often exceed 100 m in height where the resulting lakes can contain 1 20 million m3 of water presenting a serious hazard threat to the downstream regions furthermore the more widely studied thulagi lake located in the upper marsyangdi catchment northern nepal is dammed by a debris covered stagnant ice body 100 m thick that dates back to the last glacial advance hanisch et al 1998 1999 pant and reynolds 1999 therefore for modeling the extreme magnitude glofs of lower barun lake it is assumed that breach incision occurs until it reaches the base of the moraine i e hb 104 m table 1 further in the case of high magnitude events hb is considered to be the mean depth of the lake fujita et al 2013 and the corresponding vw is calculated based on the lake bathymetry in the moderate magnitude scenarios hb is assumed to be half of the high magnitude breach depths and in the low magnitude glofs hb is half of the moderate magnitude breach the pfv from the lake in any of the above glofs depends on the bed topography bathymetry and breach dimensions of the frontal moraine we calculate the drainable flood volume based on the height of the breach hb as the present bed topography of lower barun lake does not allow its entire volume to drain even in an extreme magnitude breach i e volume below 104 m hb does not drain fig 6 a the assumed floods are of water only and do not include ingested sediment in the total emitted flood volumes the dynamical behavior of the flood such as impulsive ejection of water from below hb or downstream deposited sediment the hydraulic flood modeling also does not include bank erosional or depositional changes in channel valley geometry during the events 4 4 dynamic routing and hydraulic assessment along the flow channel two dimensional hydrodynamic routing of the breach hydrographs for each breach scenario scenarios 1 8 was performed using hec ras along the flow channel from lower barun lake to site 5 located 70 km downstream the hydraulic behavior of the glof wave was analyzed at six different sites barun bazaar and site 1 to site 5 fig 1 along the flow channel based on flood discharge q flow depths df and flow velocities vf the manning s roughness coefficient associated with the channel is extracted for the flow area using a landsat 8 derived lulc 30 m of nepal uddin et al 2015 our pixel based manning s roughness distribution n for the given flow regime ranged from 0 035 to 0 17 based on the different lulc classes present along the flow area our approach using landsat imagery can capture the large scale roughness but not 1 to 30 m scale roughness elements so it is merely an approximation to what might be encountered by an outburst it may apply strictly only to the largest modeled outburst events but could also apply to the smaller events if there is a scale independent fractal roughness over the range of scales of the modeled floods the detailed model settings are given in the supplementary section 2 the model outputs were analyzed to evaluate the flow hydraulics of the glof wave along the channel the result metrics are represented in the form of flood inundation limits if km2 discharge q m3 s 1 flow velocity vf m s 1 and depth df m at which the evacuated lake water travels down the barun valley 5 results 5 1 future lake extent and volume the lower barun future lake extent and volume were calculated using an ice thickness approach where the present bathymetry of the lake was combined to the frontal overdeepening extent of the lower barun glacier of the four different outputs of modeled overdeepening glaptop f 0 6 f 0 7 f 0 8 and ensembled output the ensemble model results farinotti et al 2019 correlated most accurately to the present lake extent with a difference of 5 fig s6 the ensembled ice thickness of lower barun glacier has a maximum thickness of 258 m with surface elevation ranging between 4551 and 6669 m a s l the depths of the frontal overdeepening range up to 197 m fig 5b the spatially distributed bathymetry of the overdeepening site calculated using ice thickness and surface elevation data farinotti et al 2019 occupies a total area of 1 62 km2 extending approximately 2 km upstream from the present glacier terminus fig 5b and fig 6b c the overdeepening zone terminates where the bed elevation abruptly rises into an ice cliff fig 5c and fig 6b the field based lake bathymetry reveals a maximum depth of 205 m with the deepest point located near the current terminus fig 5b the deepest point of the overdeepening ensemble occurs at about the same location as that of the lake bathymetry i e if the ice were removed the new lake bed would be about 197 m deep the depth at the deepest point of the overdeepening 197 m has a difference of 5 compared to the bathymetric lake depth at that given point the average difference in the depths overdeepening bathymetry minus lake bathymetry of the overlapping area fig 5b and s6 is calculated to be less than 3 the maximum depth of the future lake derived after combining the spatially distributed current lake bathymetry and overdeepening bathymetry is 205 m which shows that the lake has already reached its deepest point the future volume of lower barun lake calculated by combining the bathymetries of the modeled frontal overdeepening zone plus the field based lake bathymetry is 193 5 106 m3 covering a total area of 2 69 km2 this volume was used for future lake glof hazard modeling as discussed in the next section 5 2 avalanche modeling and overtopping we modeled two potential avalanches with their sources from the surrounding south slope of the lake one of which has witnessed a previous avalanche recorded by the field team avalanche 1 fig s5 and fig 7 e in avalanche 1 a total of 9 2 105 m3 volume enters into the lake with a maximum velocity of 34 m s 1 fig 7a and 7b the maximum flow velocity is 59 m s 1 212 km h 1 the flow speed is double to that of the flow speeds of the avalanche witnessed during fieldwork the modeled impulse wave generated at the site of impact approaches the frontal moraine at a speed of 13 m s 1 fig 7c the wave overtops the frontal moraine with a flow height of 6 2 m draining a total volume of 9 3 104 m3 the second avalanche avalanche 2 with its source from another weak zone adjacent to the source of avalanche 1 carries 9 1 105 m3 of the total avalanche at a speed of 32 9 m s 1 to the lake the resultant impulse wave overtops the frontal moraine with a flow height of 5 7 m and an overtopping velocity of 12 4 m s 1 fig 7c draining 8 4 104 m3 of the lake volume although the model accounts for the water depth at the impact site the calculation does not include the tsunami type ramping up of wave amplitude and wave slow down due to lake shallowing toward the moraine but overall the modeling highlights the potential for large avalanches to generate powerful waves it is clear from the avalanche simulations that the frontal moraine of lower barun lake is susceptible to potential impact waves that can lead to the overtopping and subsequent breaching following which we evaluated the potential glofs of different magnitudes originating from the lake we note that the higher magnitude events can also originate from these slopes and that the overtopping heights of our modeled waves are very small compared to some historic ones such as that of a glof in peru hubbard et al 2005 emmer 2017 the overtopping hydrograph calculated for avalanche 1 impact wave has a peak of 9298 m3s 1 with a total overtopping duration of 21 s fig 8 for avalanche 2 impact the peak of 8300 m3s 1 is calculated where the overtopping duration is 20 s the overtopping hydrographs were routed downstream revealing df reaching up to 8 m and vf reaching up to 25 ms 1 both the flood waves avalanche 1 and avalanche 2 travel 18 km downstream of the lake with overtopping from avalanche 1being slightly of higher magnitude the overtopping flood does not affect barun bazaar at yangle kharke df and vf reaches up to 1 6 m and 1 4 ms 1 respectively these modeled events are thus likely to be a relatively high frequency low magnitude type 5 3 moraine breach and inter comparison of glof discharge glof hazard assessments of lower barun lake were conducted based on eight potential moraine breach events that vary dimensionally as a function of hb vw tf and bw the physics and dynamics of the breach s erosional process are not modeled each of the potential breach events produced a different outflow peak discharge qmax based on the given breach parameters fig 9 in general the future glofs resulted in higher discharges than the present lake glofs due to increased lake water volume here we assume that breach depths can reach a maximum of 104 m in any present and future extreme magnitude glof if breach incision completely propagates down to the base of the moraine fig 4 and fig 6a such events are rare in nature and depend on the moraine conditions and trigger magnitude in the case of lower barun lake it potentially drains the volume in the water column above 104 m i e the lake s maximum drainable flood volume for example the potential extreme magnitude glof event scenario 1 present and scenario 5 future produced a qmax of 44 240 m3 s 1 and 52 344 m3 s 1 respectively immediately downstream of the lake fig 9 a sharp rise is seen in the outflow hydrograph where qmax is reached within 20 min after the initiation of the breach in both present and future cases releasing a total flood volume of 101 29 106 m3 and 179 106 m3 respectively table 1 for other present scenarios 2 4 flood volume varies between 16 and 78 8 106 m3 while qmax is reached 28 64 min after the initiation of the breach in the present case similarly for future scenarios 6 8 the peak is reached 26 58 min after the breach event initiation as it releases a flood volume of 26 9 to 139 5 106 m3 5 4 hydraulic characterization of glofs along the flow channel glof inundations were calculated for eight different dam breach scenarios with variations in their breach formation time tf breach height hb and breach width bw we also evaluated q m3 s 1 vf m s 1 and df m by flood routing of the individual breach hydrographs obtained for each of the scenarios section 5 3 fig 9 this enabled us to characterize and compare the effects of flood water progression from the various breach scenarios down the barun and arun valley here we present the results of an inter comparison of the flow hydraulics at six different sites downstream of the lake barun bazaar and site 1 to site 5 fig 1 due to the large magnitude of the glof flows any additional flow added by existing stream flows in the barun and arun rivers were considered negligible 5 4 1 inter comparison of routed hydraulics of potential current glofs in scenario 1 present extreme magnitude scenario the glof wave first reaches barun bazaar 1 h 5 min after the initiation of the breach event for scenarios 2 4 the arrival time at this site ranges between 1 h 12 min to 6 h 30 min here df reaches up to 26 m with a maximum vf of 9 m s 1 table 2 figs 10 11 and 12 the glofs could potentially inundate a cluster of small houses located along the river left bank of the arun river fig 13 the low magnitude glof scenario 4 terminates before it reaches site 2 and moderate magnitude glof scenario 3 terminates before reaching site 5 at site 1 the glofs potentially inundates a small settlement consisting of 10 15 houses and a bridge with df and vf reaching up to 22 m and 6 m s 1 farther downstream site 2 and site 3 located 1 km apart reveal similar flow behavior where df ranges from 20 m to 27 m and vf between 1 m s 1 to 3 m s 1 here three small settlements one bridge and 0 04 km2 of agricultural land become inundated fig 13 among all the potential current glofs and the studied sites downstream site 1 to site 5 including barun bazaar a maximum df of 36 m scenario 1 is reached in site 4 where the 900 mw arun iii hydropower project has its starting tunnel this is due to the sharp turn of the river channel towards the west here the potential glofs have a major impact inundating a moderate sized settlement two bridges and several roads fig 13 as the potential glofs propagate downstream they reach site 5 70 km downstream with arrival timing of 4 h 48 min scenario 1 and 7 h 8 min scenario 2 where df reaches up to 19 m here the glof wave has a maximum vf of 3 m s 1 though its flow energy attenuates as it propagates farther downstream 5 4 2 routed hydraulics of potential future glofs the hydrodynamic routing and flow assessments of the future glofs were evaluated for scenarios 5 6 7 and 8 table 2 the routed hydrographs were calculated based on the lake s future extent and volume 193 5 106 m3 see section 4 1 in a potential extreme magnitude future glof event scenario 5 the drainable volume vw from the lake is calculated to be 179 0 106 m3 considering hb 104 m as a maximum breach depth table 1 fig 9 the flood wave arrives at barun bazaar a few minutes 5 min earlier relative to that of scenario 1 present extreme magnitude glof here the df and vf reach up to 29 m and 11 m s 1 respectively table 2 fig 12 this accounts for an increase of 11 and 20 respectively when compared to a present extreme magnitude event the at risk infrastructure remains the same at site 1 2 and 3 however the flow hydraulics are variable figs 10 12 at site 4 df reaches a maximum of 37 m with a peak vf of 7 m s 1 this is the highest velocity calculated at this site compared to all the other modeled glof events in this study here the inundation limits extend further southward engulfing the maximum area containing infrastructure and settlements the flood wave travels further down the valley for about 3 km but has no impact due to the absence of infrastructure or settlement in scenario 6 which represents a future high magnitude glof the flood wave encounters barun bazaar 1 h 22 min after the breach event table 2 flow hydraulics indicate peak df and vf are decreased by 4 m and 2 m s 1 respectively and its arrival time at site 1 is delayed by 20 min compared to scenario 5 fig 12 at site 2 and site 3 the flow hydraulics show a reduction of df and vf by an average of 9 5 m and 2 m s 1 at these sites compared to the extreme magnitude future lake glof the flood wave arrives at site 4 40 min later compared to an extreme magnitude glof scenario 5 event and indicates a decrease in df and vf by 7 m and 5 4 m s 1 respectively at site 5 the flood wave is delayed by 1 h 24 min when compared to scenario 5 the overall attenuation of q from barun bazaar to site 5 is 11 965 m3 s 1 in the case of a moderate magnitude future glof scenario 7 the arrival of the flood wave to barun bazaar is slower by approximately an hour compared to the extreme magnitude scenario 5 the flood wave does not reach site 5 as it loses its flow energy downstream the at risk infrastructure upstream of site 4 remains similar to the above scenarios at site 4 vf reduces to 1 2 m s 1 with a discharge of 1130 m3 s 1 here however df rises to 25 m as the flow is obstructed due to the sharp bend in the channel the if decreases by 50 and 33 when compared to scenario 5 and scenario 6 respectively the hydraulic evaluation of scenario 8 a low magnitude glof event reveals a similar glof wave to that of scenario 4 though with a comparable reduction in the peak flood by 592 m3 s 1 it releases 9 of the total volume of the lake the flood attenuates 42 km downstream of the lake before it reaches site 4 the total if along the channel is 6 6 km2 with mean df and vf values of 6 m and 5 6 m s 1 respectively of the eight glof scenarios described above section 5 3 only four scenarios including the potential extreme magnitude glofs scenarios 1 and 5 high magnitude glofs scenarios 2 and 6 impact all the studied sites barun bazaar site 1 to 5 figs 10 13 the moderate magnitude glofs has an impact up to site 4 as it loses momentum further downstream before reaching site 5 the low magnitude present lake event impacts only until site 1 whereas in the future lake scenario impacts down to site 3 6 discussion 6 1 overtopping hazard overtopping flows occur when there is a sudden influx of mass into the lake that displaces the water forming displacement waves clague and evans 2000 westoby et al 2014 at lower barun lake the potential overtopping waves that resulted due to avalanche impacts are very short lived fig 8 the hydrographs reached higher peaks draining a small volume of the lake than that of the breach events table 1 based on the downstream flow hydraulics of the overtopping waves originating from the lake it is seen that the hazard is minimal for downstream sites as the flood waves attenuate 18 km from the lake the valley is currently devoid of any settlement until barun bazaar located 29 7 km downstream of the lake however at yangle kharka flood waves could potentially affect a couple of existing structures though minimally since flow depth and flow velocity reach up to only 1 6 m and 1 4 ms 1 fig 8 the bathymetry of the lake deepest in the west and shoaling to the east and emptying into a funnel like outlet would promote the role of tsunami ramp ups whose energetic waves could be focused down into the area of ponds and the outlet channel potentially incising the outlet and allowing a greater outflow our calculations show that relatively small avalanches can lead to the ovetopping of the lake 6 2 plausibility of slow glof and fast glof scenarios the field collected bathymetric data allows realistic and robust modeling of glacial lake outburst flood events in the himalaya we modeled eight potential scenarios though we recognize that glofs could occur in several other ways for example the glof that occurred from peruvian lake palcacocha in 1941 was a to the bottom breach leading to almost 95 lake water released however this is uncommon and only associated with specific topographical settings emmer 2017 not all glofs are similar even if they occur from the same lake westoby et al 2014 rounce et al 2016 for example in some circumstances a large fraction of a large glacial lake s volume could drain out in a matter of hours or days and still not cause extreme damage downstream except to very low lying infrastructure we thus define in our discussion fast glofs whose proximal hydrographs peak within minutes of initiation of an outburst event and slow glofs whose hydrographs peaks hours after an event starts and may take much longer to complete a slow glof may be generated when the drainable volume is constrained by smaller breach dimensions or a large but slowly hours long eroding breach on the contrary fast glofs have much higher peak volume discharge and potential flow energy per unit time as larger and fast formed breach dimensions allow for an enormous and rapid outlet discharge additionally a glof might initiate slowly but then enter a speedier phase as some critical failure occurs hence fast and slow glofs are not immutable it is a concept that we introduce here to propel focused discussion so stated fast glofs appear to pose a relatively larger threat to downstream settlements and infrastructures as demonstrated by our modeling the rapidity of a moraine dam s breakup depends on the magnitude of the trigger and the initial disturbance that starts a self accelerating outflow it also depends on the amount and distribution of buried ice the shape of the moraine the hydraulic pressure at the base of the moraine hence the depth of impounded water and height of the moraine and an important factor that is rarely considered the slope and roughness of the bedrock beneath the moraine the lower barun moraine dam is high and the lake is deep while a shoaling near the moraine could allow large tsunami runups ice and large boulders are present in the moraine supplementary 1 but how much of these and their internal arrangements are unknown as is the shape and slope of the bedrock base beneath the moraine an assessment of the stability or metastability of the moraine dam or a numerical study of the dynamics of a moraine erosional event would require geophysical knowledge of the moraine s properties lacking knowledge of these we have focused on what is known the lake volume from the 2015 field survey was used to model potential glofs in the current state with the accelerating retreat of connected lower barun glacier the lake area grew by 0 25 km2 in the last 5 years 2015 2019 fig s4 this implies that the glof hazard will likely change as the melting and retreating glacier fills the enlarging moraine dammed proglacial lake clague and evans 1994 the seismically active regime of the nepal himalaya has witnessed numerous mass movement events like landslides avalanches and rockfalls of various magnitudes kargel et al 2016 these primary events as witnessed and identified in this study may act as potential glof triggers in the region especially in the case of lower barun lake which is surrounded by steep slopes with hanging ice masses the langmale glof in 2017 byers et al 2018 is an example of such an event that occurred near lower barun lake fig 1 in fact a landslide maybe a small moraine collapse placed directly into the outlet channel potentially raising the lake by several meters over a several day period could prove to create a hazardous glof if that dam breaks up suddenly a low magnitude avalanche event was witnessed and captured during our fieldwork at the lake site in 2015 fig s5 but it did not result in any known unusual discharge event however our modeling of relatively higher magnitude avalanches shows that the frontal moraine of lower barun lake is susceptible to overtopping the glof hazard magnitudes due to avalanches and rockfalls may extend across the full range of the potential glof scenarios modeled in this study the smaller ones being more frequent than the larger the peak discharge from lower barun glofs at the current state can reach as high as 20 810 m3 s 1 and can increase by 5224 m3 s 1 in the future flow depths and velocities reaching up to 29 m and 11 m s 1 can present the valley with great risk possibly the typical risk would be to downstream populations along the channel the breach depths of the moraine in the two low magnitude events categorized as slow glofs account for only 15 of the total moraine height of the lake thereby restricting the lake release volume and discharge rate such flow events pose no severe threat to the barun valley as the flow energy is significantly reduced as it propagates downstream and largely attenuates into a steady flow these events may be common in the himalaya although likely remain unreported as these floods typically have little or no significant impact on human settlements or infrastructure veh et al 2018 in a dam breach the opening forms at the top of the embankment barrier and as the failure continues it gradually grows a breach may also develop as a piping failure including openings or holes that propagate internal erosion within an embankment and grow outwardly until the opening reaches the top of the embankment westoby et al 2015 regardless if a breach forms due to embankment overtopping or piping the size of the opening will increase over time as more and more water passes over or through the opening once initiated a glof may progress to an extreme magnitude event huggel et al 2004 such as scenarios 1 and 4 in this study if the overtopping wave or the ensuing outflow continues to erode the dam progressively therefore the hazard assessment in the case of a potential extreme magnitude glof cannot be neglected by contrast our evaluation of flood wave behavior for extreme magnitude glofs high magnitude glofs and moderate magnitude glofs both present and the future scenarios ties them to the production of fast glofs these hazard events have much higher flow energy compared to the slow glofs this is because the glof peak is reached more rapidly during a progressive breaching event with breach depths sometimes propagating down to the base of the frontal moraine 104 m in case of lower barun moreover the breach widths bw are also significantly higher 3 to 4 times than that of the slow glofs allowing higher outflow discharge from the lake the flow velocities vf along the routed channel are comparatively much higher and therefore travel downstream for longer distances both values an order of magnitude greater when compared to the slow events glof triggers and breach formation mechanisms remain uncertain in most cases however detailed engineering field investigations can reduce them this is most often very challenging in harsh terrain such as the himalaya however for disaster preparedness and mitigation hydraulic modeling of these events provides valuable initial insights and motivations for the needed geophysical field studies and engineering work in the aforementioned case of peru s palcacocha glof the transport and deposition of giant boulders and finer sediment caused thousands of deaths casualties would likely have been far smaller if the event only involved water the amount of ingested transported and deposited sediment from possible glofs from lower barun lake will be tightly connected to the duration of the peak discharge part of the flood emission the eroded volume of the moraine dam and the amount of erodible sediments along the channel hence the sediment component is also tied to whether it is a fast or a slow glof 6 3 shifting lower barun hazard in the future the barun arun valley geographically located at the base of mt makalu has been a favorable region for hydropower generation and currently hosts several infrastructure and hydropower plants that are either fully functional under construction or planned these new developments are opening ways for the communities to expand in the valley in addition to the enormous hydropower potential the valley possesses it also hosts several glacial lakes in the high altitude glacierized regions of which upper barun and lower barun lakes are the prominent ones fig 1 but as the langmale flood shows are not the only dangerous lakes these high altitude lakes and potential glofs present enough downstream threat to impact or destroy the at risk infrastructure these potential impacts are intensifying both due to increases in the frequency of hazards and vulnerabilities with increased development currently the valley is not equipped with any mitigation measures to counter these threats and development planning proceeds as though the risk is nil this study provides the basis for glof preparedness based on the present and future anticipated glofs in the valley the modeled glofs were compared for flow hydraulics along the flow channel to evaluate the shift in hazard potential from the current state to future state of the eight potential glof events we have modeled the slow low magnitude glof events scenario 4 and scenario 8 show similar behavior in both present and future states due to their limited breach and drainable flood volumes however the extreme magnitude cases scenario 1 and scenario 5 reveals a change in flow dynamics and glof hazards along the lower barun valley an overall rise in the total inundation modeled in a potential future lake glof event scenario 5 6 and 7 is observed when compared to the current scenario scenario 1 2 and 3 figs 10 11 and 13 the flow hydraulics q vf and df comparison for the present and future scenarios shows that the q and vf shift is more profound than df fig 12 this can be attributed to the higher flow energy and discharge which tends to reduce the frictional resistance compared to a relatively lower discharge event an increase in q and vf by 33 and 36 respectively are observed in the future extreme magnitude event compared to a present extreme magnitude glof further the arrival timings of the glof wave at the selected sites decrease in a potential future event due to higher pfv which results in a higher momentum the attenuation of the flood wave is seen to be prominent more towards the downstream part of the valley after the flood crosses site 3 where the difference in flood wave arrival timing increases fig s7 this is due to higher channel friction and lower flow volume as the glof propagates downstream this information becomes vital in designing and implementing any adaptation measures along the barun and arun rivers flow path as part of disaster preparedness furthermore a comparison of the flow hydraulics revealed that the glof arrival at the first site of interest barun bazaar decreases by 4 16 min in the fast glofs this is due to the comparatively more rapid peaking of vf in future glofs which is governed by the breach parameters and pfv this difference in glof arrival timing is observed more prominently in the downstream part of the valley after site 3 this may be attributed to the loss of flow volume and channel resistance as the flood propagates down the valley the decreased time carries with it a greater challenge for potential glof warning systems and evacuation scenarios in addition the total if along the flow channel increases by 15 in case of future glofs compared to potential present events this is due to the rise of df resulting in higher water surface elevation in potential future glofs fig 13 although the glof hazard in both present and future scenarios are very high a future event coupled with increasing development intensifies the risk that lower barun lake will pose to the low lying areas downvalley 6 4 future directions we do not model the erosion dynamics of the breach in the moraine dam yager et al 2012 modeled grain transport in steeply sloping mountain channels and emphasized the important hydrodynamic role of large immobile protruding obstacles like large boulders in reducing the transport of smaller mobile grains in the case of lower barun lake s end moraine dam there is a ubiquitous presence within a fine grained matrix of large boulders many are 1 to 6 m across supplementary section 1 and some are several tens of meters whereas 1 m boulders are normal bedload material and can be readily transported in mountain streams along with finer particles over time they could be transported rapidly during high discharge glofs the larger boulders could remain immobile and retard erosional downcutting such that peak glof discharge will be limited or alternatively an incredible outflow may rapidly mobilize the large boulders and prevent them from armoring the channel a question for lower barun lake is whether there are enough large boulders in the dam to create an armoring lag deposit in principle but not modeled here a large initial outflow could move large boulders and induce runaway erosion and outflow future work should link the overtopping and erosion dynamics including the critical roles of large boulders and the erosional susceptibility of heterogeneously composed moraine dams to understand the full process chain which we have not done currently in this paper to undertake this work we would need detailed in situ geophysical and sedimentological data on the moraine more detailed bathymetry of the lakes and then theoretical modeling analytical or numerical to understand the processes and threshold flows under which the moraine could undergo runaway erosion also needed is a better knowledge of the geotechnical properties of potentially unstable masses of rock and ice on the mountain slopes their potential failure mechanisms and mass flow behavior overall an obvious future direction is to include sediment explicitly in the hydraulic modeling because the sediment will affect the flow depth arrival time at various points and deposition at downstream locations it may thus become useful in the next step of the investigation to distinguish and model dirty glofs debris rich and clean glofs mainly water with an emphasis on viscous flows 7 conclusions detailed hydrodynamic scenario modeling reveals the hazard potential of moraine dammed lower barun lake the deepest and one of the largest known glacial lakes in nepal the lake has shown substantial area growth from 0 04 km2 in 1975 to 2 09 km2 in 2019 the present 2015 volume of the lake was measured as 112 3 106 m3 and the future volume is calculated as 193 5 106 m3 the flow hydraulics of the overtopping waves caused due to impact from potential avalanches show that the barun valley is minimally impacted as the upstream part of the valley is devoid of infrastructure in the case of glofs the maximum drainable volumes in an extreme magnitude flood originating from the lake in the present and future are calculated to be 101 2 106 m3 and 179 106 m3 respectively additionally we evaluated hydrodynamic flow metrics for sites along the river valley for potential glofs originating from both present and the estimated future lake volume the at risk infrastructure remains similar in the case of present and future fast glofs however the impact changes in the future as flow hydraulics vf if and df increases in potential future events this is due to larger lake volume resulting in rapid breaching and higher outflow peak and total discharge numerous small settlements and infrastructure including agricultural fields and hydroelectric power projects under construction or planned are under potential flood risk the possible impact of slow glofs in the valley is significantly less than that of fast events as both the lower barun lake and the barun valley evolve the potential threat from this upstream lake increases the magnitude of fast glof events can significantly affect the downstream infrastructure both in the current state and in the future affecting up to 70 km downstream of the lake based on the present study regular monitoring of lower barun lake is highly recommended further the results presented here can serve as base information for disaster and flood mitigation particularly needed are in situ geophysical studies that may provide constraints on the potential for fast versus slow glofs credit authorship contribution statement

4491,the research presents a multisite annual streamflow generation model that combines the generalized linear model glm for determining the temporal structure with copulas for modelling the spatial dependence joint distributions the performance of the glm copula model was verified by comparing its ability to preserve historical features and simulate drought events with the multivariate auto regressive moving average arma model and the copula autoregressive copar model the statistical measures adopted for the models performance evaluation include summary statistics mean standard deviation maximum minimum and skewness coefficient temporal and spatial correlation simulation of drought conditions maximum number of years under drought condition and copula entropy as a nonlinear measure of total association the combined glm copula model s main advantages are that i it does not require data normalization ii it allows the modelling of the dependence structures with different probability functions and iii it is capable of representing non conventional parsimonious autocorrelation functions the ability of the glm copula approach to preserve the summary statistics from the historical data was similar to both benchmark models however the glm copula was considerably better in reproducing the longest drought duration that was underestimated by the arma model and was better in reproducing the copula entropy than both benchmark models the approach is proposed in its simplest form but can be easily upgraded by combining glms with numerical data or extended to predict future streamflow with the incorporation of exogenous climate variables that affect streamflow the proposed model may be useful in future studies applications where data normalization jeopardizes the replication of data or and in drought dependent stochastic applications like the definition of optimal operation rules of a perennial reservoir system or long term hydropower dispatch keywords generalized linear models copula multi site stochastic streamflow simulation 1 introduction synthetic streamflow time series generation has an important role in water resources planning and management it is applied to the design of reservoir systems and to the definition of their optimal operation rules to drought evaluation and to several other studies with a stochastic nature mcmahon et al 2006 rajagopalan et al 2010 salas and lee 2010 for a correct application the generated synthetic series must preserve key historical data characteristics such as statistical moments and dependence structure e g auto and cross correlation zachariah and reddy 2013 the classical methods for streamflow simulation such as the arma models box and jenkins 1976 are based on rigid assumptions about the variables dependence and require them to follow a gaussian distribution sharma and o neill 2002 prairie et al 2006 however some hydrological variables are significantly skewed which requires their normalization i e their transformation into alternatives variables that satisfy those models assumptions salas et al 1980 salas 1993 most of those models drawbacks arise from their rigid assumptions e g the gaussian and from the limitations of the data transformation techniques resulting in a lack of flexibility that may influence the preservation of the historical characteristics sharma et al 1997 prairie et al 2006 rajagopalan et al 2010 hao and singh 2011 lee and salas 2011 pereira et al 2017 the stochastic streamflow simulation literature presents several non gaussian modeling alternatives the most famous are the lag 1 gamma autoregressive model gar 1 fernandez and salas 1990 and the nonparametric approaches such as the k nearest neighbor method knn lall and sharma 1996 and the kernel density estimators kde sharma et al 1997 sharma and o neill 2002 however these alternative models have their own limitations the gar 1 also lacks flexibility and cannot model long term persistency furthermore resampling methods like the knn reproduce only the observed values and the kde may not be applied to higher dimensions rajagopalan et al 2010 lee and salas 2011 recently copula based approaches have been applied to hydrologic time series generation lee and salas 2011 zachariah and reddy 2013 chen et al 2015 pereira et al 2017 the copula methods are parametric approaches that model the dependence structure apart from the marginal distributions which provides high flexibility by allowing the use of any marginal distributions lee and salas 2011 compared the performance of a copula and an arma model applied to single site annual streamflow generation and showed the former had some benefits if small generalized linear models glms introduced by nelder and wedderburn 1972 as an extension of the classical linear regression model are parsimonious parametric methods that allow the modelling of non gaussian variables mccullagh and nelder 1989 as stated by rajagopalan et al 2010 glm approaches may be reasonable alternatives to the traditional parametric methods due to their flexibility and capability to preserve different features of the historical series the use of glms is recognized in hydrology for stochastic generation of daily weather variables like precipitation temperature and potential evapotranspiration chandler and wheater 2002 chandler 2005 yang et al 2005 wheater et al 2005 furrer and katz 2007 kleiber et al 2012 verdin et al 2014 however to the knowledge of the authors glms have not yet been applied for streamflow stochastic generation thus the first part of this research addresses the applicability of glm to generate single site annual streamflow and compares its ability to model temporal dependence and preserve historical statistics against a traditional univariate autoregressive ar method for multisite time series generation glm approaches require the specification of the joint probability distributions of the time series which is obtained from a spatial dependence modelling that respects the marginal distributions yang et al 2005 however modelling the spatial structure is a complex process that is often done in the glm based weather generators by multivariate gaussian assumptions that may need data normalization reducing the approach s flexibility yang et al 2005 kleiber et al 2012 verdin et al 2014 meanwhile high dimensional copulas d 3 lose their flexibility to represent the dependence structures as there is a limited set of higher dimensional copula families kao and govindaraju 2008 aas et al 2009 hao and singh 2013 to overcome this limitation recent copula times series models are mostly built from two approaches i vine copulas that decomposes the multidimensional problem into a sequence of bidimensional copulas brechmann and czado 2015 pereira et al 2017 wang et al 2019 or ii maximum entropy copula that based on the concept of maximum entropy distribution from the information theory can fit a flexible high dimensional copula hao and singh 2013 2015 singh and zhang 2018 however the complexity and the computational burden grows quickly with the dimension for both entropy and vine copula models hao and singh 2015 pereira et al 2017 the second part of this research presents a multisite annual streamflow generation model that couples glm and copula the first to represent the temporal structure and the second to model the spatial dependence i e the joint distributions its performance to reproduce historical statistics and dependence structures is compared with the traditional multivariate arma model and the copula autoregressive copar model brechmann and czado 2015 a state of art copula time series model that extends the vine copula concept to model both spatial and temporal dependence the proposed model exploits both methods flexibility and synergy the copula provides a flexible way for estimating the joint distribution that glm needs for multisite generation while the glm lowers the problem s dimension and allows copula models to be applied without the need for normalized data despite the existence of several stochastic multisite streamflow time series generation methods none is universally accepted srinivas and srinivasan 2005 chen et al 2015 hao and singh 2016 in contrast the proposed model allows us to model both spatial and temporal dependencies without normalization is computationally efficient and can be used as a dimensional reduction for vine and maximum entropy copula practitioners which we suggest justifies its addition to the time series generation toolbox 2 case study data and preliminary analysis in this paper the jaguaribe metropolitano reservoir system in ceará state brazil represented in fig 1 was selected as the multi site synthetic flow series generation case study since the annual inflows at its seven reservoirs are highly variable and skewed souza filho and lall 2003 the annual inflow data to those reservoirs are available for the 1912 2012 period 101 years from barros et al 2013 the jaguaribe metropolitano is the state s greatest water impounding system and the most important water supply source it comprises two different basins the jaguaribe and the metropolitano basins with 72 000 and 15 200 km2 respectively that were artificially connected by channels allowing the latter to receive water from the former most of the system is located in a semiarid region with a highly variable annual streamflow due to the temporal variability of the precipitation and the predominance of shallow soils da silva et al 2017 the jaguaribe basin covers approximately 48 of the state of ceará and its main water use is irrigation which accounts for about 90 of the state agricultural production although the metropolitano basin is smaller comprising approximately 10 of the state area it has a larger population and supplies water to the capital city fortaleza and to its metropolitan region for domestic supply industry and tourism the water demand in the metropolitano basin is almost uniform throughout the year while the one in jaguaribe basin is concentrated in the second semester due to the crop irrigation period i e the dry station souza filho and lall 2003 da silva et al 2017 the system is composed of seven major reservoirs from upstream to downstream orós castanhão banabuiú aracoiaba pacajus pacoti and gavião the first three are in the jaguaribe basin and the last four are in the metropolitano basin total storage capacity of 10 240 and 871 hm3 respectively fig 1 for water resources planning and management purposes the jaguaribe metropolitano system can be represented as two equivalent reservoirs one for each basin located at the most downstream sections of the main rivers of jaguaribe and the metropolitano basins as illustrated in fig 1 in this research the annual inflows to the jaguaribe jag and metropolitano met equivalent reservoirs were obtained by summing the annual inflows to each of their major component reservoirs the temporal correlation and the spatial cross correlation of the annual inflows series thus obtained for jag and met are characterized in fig 2 for lags 0 until 17 in spatial terms there is a high lag 0 correlation 0 8 as shown by the cross correlation function because the rainfall regime in both basins mainly relies on the same climatic process the intertropical convergence zone itcz displacement moura and shukla 1981 andreoli and kayano 2004 wang et al 2004 in temporal terms both series present a short term persistency pattern with a fast correlogram decay after the first lag there is also a long term dependence pattern with significant positive correlation coefficients for lags 10 and 11 the short memory pattern may be a result of low groundwater flow since both basins are situated in a crystalline precambrian basement with shallow soils and poor vegetation cover frischkorn et al 2003 alexandre et al 2005 barros et al 2013 the long term persistency may be related to a decadal sea surface temperature variability in the tropical atlantic that influences the itcz location andreoli and kayano 2004 andreoli and kayano 2006 the empirical and fitted cumulative distribution functions cdf and probability density functions pdf of the annual flows at each equivalent reservoir are shown in fig 3 showing convincing similarity both series are non gaussian and right skewed the inflows to jag are close to a lognormal distribution and those to met to a gamma distribution the selection of the best fit distribution was based in the anderson darling test for the maximum likelihood estimated parameters and the fit of the cdfs is remarkably good throughout the range of data 3 background and methodology 3 1 generalized linear models the classical linear regression model is defined as 1 y i α β x i ε i ε i n 0 σ 2 i 1 n where yi is each value of the response variable α is the intercept β is a vector of parameters xi is the vector of predictors and ε is a normally distributed error salas et al 1980 equation 1 can be rewritten in the following form fahrmeir and tutz 2001 2 y i n μ i σ 2 η i α β x i η i g μ i i 1 n where μi is the expectation of yi ηi is a linear predictor g is the function that links the expectation of the response variable with the predictors i e a link function the link function is equal to the identity in the model described by eq 1 the model described by eq 2 can be extended to a more general case glms with the assumption that each yi has a distribution in the exponential family with expectation e yi xi μi a common dispersion parameter ϕ independent of i and function of the response variable variance fahrmeir and tutz 2001 the density function of these distributions is 3 f y i θ i ϕ e x p y i θ i b θ i a ϕ c y i ϕ where θi is the natural parameter dependent on μi a b and c are specific functions related to the type of exponential family the exponential family comprises some famous continuous e g normal lognormal and gamma and discrete e g poisson and bernoulli distributions and the link between its expectation and the linear predictors may be represented by any monotonic differentiable function mccullagh and nelder 1989 hence the flexibility of glms to model different types of data e g continuous discrete and categorical and gaussian and non gaussian patterns although the glms were proposed to model independent variables they can be extended to time series with lags as covariates fahrmeir and tutz 2001 chandler 2005 a more detailed description of the glms theory is in mccullagh and nelder 1989 and fahrmeir and tutz 2001 3 2 bivariate copulas copulas are parametric functions that are able to combine marginal distributions into a multivariate distribution function the copula concept allows flexibility to choose the univariate marginal distributions due to its dependence structure that sits within alternative variables that are uniform in the unit square and correspond to the values of the univariate cumulative distributions nelsen 2006 according to sklar s theorem sklar 1959 a bivariate distribution function f x y of two correlated random variables x and y with respective marginal cumulative distributions f x and f y can be defined as a copula c 4 f x y c f x f y c u v where u and v are uniform and defined in the 0 1 interval and refer to the values of f x and f y respectively besides their marginal distribution flexibility copulas can capture non linear dependence features their parameters can be estimated by maximum likelihood and there is a wide range of copula families e g normal frank gumbel clayton which allows versatility in the dependence structure modelling as well some copula families descriptions their formulation and parameter estimation methods can be found in joe 1997 nelsen 2006 and joe 2014 there are copulas defined for more than two variables however higher dimension copulas are simply one parameter constructs and result in loss of flexibility and rigid dependence assumptions it is better to model the joint distributions as a sequence of bivariate copulas i e the vine copula method some are applied to pairs of univariate margins and others applied to pairs of univariate conditional distributions aas et al 2009 joe 2014 still the number of parameters grows exponentially with the number of variables in the vine copula approach fortunately we are only dealing with a pair of time series 3 3 glm single site streamflow simulation the annual streamflow time series for each site is modelled as a univariate glm with constant variance and the annual streamflow lags with significant correlations 1st 10th 11th as covariates fig 2 the inflows to jag were sampled from a lognormal distribution with identity link and those to met from a gamma with log link fig 3 these models can be described as 5 f jag t l o g n o r m a l μ 1 t σ 1 2 g μ 1 t β 1 0 β 1 1 jag t 1 β 1 2 jag t 10 β 1 3 jag t 11 6 f met t g a m m a μ 2 t σ 2 2 h μ 2 t β 2 0 β 2 1 met t 1 β 2 2 met t 10 β 2 3 met t 11 where jagt and mett are each equivalent reservoir time series t is the time μ1 t and μ2 t are each series expected values for time t g and h are the link functions identity and log respectively σ1 2 and σ2 2 are the series variance and β1 i and β2 i i 1 2 number of covariates 1 are each series glm parameters maximum likelihood glm parameter estimates are obtained using iterative weighted least squares mccullagh and nelder 1989 this procedure was carried out using the base stats package from the r programming language r core team 2013 3 4 copula glm multisite streamflow simulation the joint distribution of both sites times series is modelled as a bivariate copula 7 f jag t jag t met t met t c f jag t f met t c u v this model assumes that the spatial relation between inflows to jag and met is temporally stationary also u and v the marginal s cdfs values are random variables uniformly distributed between zero and one to obtain the random values u v one of the variables may be sampled from the uniform distribution while the other from the conditional bivariate copula distribution that can be defined as a function of the joint distribution 8 f v u c v u c u v u the selection of the copula family and parameters estimation was done with the vinecopula r package schepsmeier et al 2018 the package estimates the parameters for different copula families using the maximum likelihood method and then selects the family with the lowest akaike information criterion aic it also verifies the performance of the fit by the reproduction of the kendall τ correlation coefficient also a verification of the copula s tail asymmetry is carried out with the lower ϱl and upper ϱu tail weighted bivariate measures of dependence proposed by krupskii and joe 2015 the two measures are defined as 9 ϱ l a p c o r a 1 u p a 1 v p u p v p 10 ϱ u a p c o r a 1 1 u p a 1 1 v p 1 u p 1 v p where a is a monotonic increasing function in the 0 1 domain and p is the truncation level with values in the 0 0 5 interval the monotonic increasing function and truncation level used were respectively a x x 6 and p 0 5 as recommended by krupskii and joe 2015 equations 7 and 8 provide only the spatial correlation structure the temporal dependence is modelled within each series marginal distribution as the single site glms described by eqs 5 and 6 thus after ut and vt spatially correlated variables are sampled jag t and met t temporally and spatially correlated variables can be determined by the inverse of the respective glm s cdf 3 5 generation algorithm the proposed multivariate annual streamflow simulation procedure is detailed in fig 4 it can be described as an eight step process i the probability distributions of the annual inflow series at the equivalent reservoirs are evaluated to select the respective best fit exponential functions and the lags with relevant correlation coefficients that should compose the covariates ii the temporal dependence is modelled as described by eqs 5 and 6 by fitting univariate glms with the covariates and exponential distributions selected for each series marginal distributions in step i iii the uniform u v variables are calculated from the estimated expectations and the glms cdfs at each time position iv the spatial correlation structure is established by fitting a copula distribution between the observed u v uniform variables v after modelling both dependence structures the random simulation starts with the generation of n the length of the synthetic time series random u from the uniform 0 1 distribution and then n random v are drawn from the bivariate copula conditional distribution eq 8 vi the first t 1 synthetic generated ut vt pair spatially correlated is transformed into the jag t and met t synthetic streamflow pair temporally and spatially correlated by the inverse of the marginals glms cdf with expectations determined from the set of covariates lags values the initial set may be a random sample from the historical series vii the set of covariates values is updated with the generated jag t and met t viii the time position is updated t t 1 and the steps vi and vii are repeated for the next ut vt pairs until all pairs are transformed into the synthetic generated streamflow series t n 3 6 performance assessment in order to demonstrate the performance of the single site glm and of the multisite glm copula annual streamflow time series stochastic simulation models their efficiency is compared respectively to univariate autoregressive ar and multivariate arma models described by salas et al 1980 the multisite glm copula is also compared to the state of art copula model copar the synthetic replicates from the stochastic models should preserve the statistical characteristics i e mean standard deviation and skewness and the dependence structures srivastav and simonovic 2014 the univariate ar and the multivariate arma models were fitted to the normalized jag and met inflow series the data normalization was done using the box cox power transformation the fitting and sampling procedures were carried out with the r marima package spliid 2017 the first order univariate ar and the 1 1 order multivariate arma were selected since they resulted in the lowest aic values the copar model brechmann and czado 2015 applies the vine copula theory aas et al 2009 to model both serial and cross sectional dependences vine copulas are based on the decomposition of the multivariate copula density into a product of bivariate copulas also called pair copula construction in this paper a first order copar 1 model is chosen as benchmark it was reproduced through the original algorithm described in brechmann and czado 2015 the application of the copar 1 to the case study time series required the sequential fitting of five bivariate copulas c jagt jagt 1 c jagt mett c jagt 1 mett jagt c mett 1 jagt jagt 1 and c mett 1 mett jagt 1 jagt the families and parameters of each of the bivariate copulas were estimated using the two stage maximum likelihood estimation method where the parameters of marginal distributions are initially estimated and then the parameters of the copula function are estimated using maximum likelihood with the marginals computed from the previously fitted marginal distributions singh and zhang 2018 the fitting and simulation procedures of the copar model were carried out with functions from the vinecopula r package one hundred synthetic annual streamflow series runs with the same length as the observed series n 101 years are generated by each model and their statistical characteristics and dependence structures are compared graphically based on boxplots against the historical data a historical series behavior is judged to be preserved by the synthetic series when its values lie within the box salas and lee 2010 lee and salas 2011 hao and singh 2013 the use of one hundred runs is in accordance with the streamflow simulation literature lee and salas 2011 hao and singh 2013 srivastav and simonovic 2014 as a nonlinear measure of performance the copula entropy ce of the observed variables jagt jagt 1 mett mett 1 was compared to the ce of the model s synthetic series based on the definition of shannon s entropy shannon 1948 ma and sun 2011 proposed the copula entropy as the entropy of the copula function and showed its relation with joint and marginal entropy they also proved the equivalence between the negative of ce and mutual information mi mi is a traditional non linear measure of the dependences association between random variables based on entropy theory cover and thomas 1991 however the estimation of mi for more than two variables is a hard task while ce just requires the variables copula joint distribution alpettiyil krishnankutty et al 2020 thus ce is a useful multivariate estimator of mi ce has been used to measure the association between stock market variables zhao and lin 2011 multiple degradation processes sun et al 2019 and river flows chen et al 2013 it was also used as a performance measure in feature selection for rainfall runoff modeling and drought prediction chen et al 2014 huang and zhang 2019 and in selecting vine copula structure for multisite streamflow simulation ni et al 2020 in this research the copula entropy of the observed data and the resulted from the synthetic time series were calculated through the copent r package ma 2020 which calculates ce through a nonparametric estimation of the copula function as a practical exercise we also analyzed the performance of the models to simulate drought conditions simply understood as being below average conditions for this purpose in each case study the years with annual flows below the respective historical mean were assigned to drought conditions the maximum number of consecutive years under drought conditions i e the longest drought period in each of the one hundred synthetic series of the glm copula arma and copar models were compared to the longest drought period of the historical series the longest period under drought conditions is a relevant constraint in the design and in the operation of the artificial reservoirs 4 results 4 1 glm single site streamflow simulation the ability of the single site glm and ar methods to preserve the historical statistics and temporal dependence structures is presented respectively in figs 5 and 6 for this purpose and like all the other figures boxplots were drawn of the generated values of the annual statistics and these were compared with the historical statistics for the boxplots the whiskers have maximum length of 1 5 iqr interquartile range and the values outside the whiskers are considered to be outliers robbins 2004 fig 5 shows that all the historical statistics are well reproduced by both methods except for the standard deviation of the inflows to met from the glm model and for the minimum of the inflows to jag from the ar model individually the glm reproduced better the minimum and the skewness coefficient the first since the ar model underestimated the minimum of both series and the latter may be due to not requiring data normalization also the methods were better in reproducing the maxima than the minima and overall presented the same performance in both jag and met regarding the replication of the sample statistics from the autocorrelation function acf analysis in fig 6 both methods were similarly efficient in representing the first lag autocorrelation the short term temporal dependence and also had similar dispersions the glm also depicted the long term dependence peak at the 10th and 11th lags however with better performance for the met inflow series gamma distribution an interesting advantage presented by the glm series is that their acf is not represented as an exponential decay like the autoregressive models but instead it is able to capture the lagged correlations used as covariates 1st 10th and 11th thus the glm can be applied to mimic some complex acf designs by considering a larger set of lags as covariates however the increase of the set of covariates increases the number of parameters and reduces the parsimony of the model which can be a drawback depending on the ratio between the length of the observed series and the number of parameters 4 2 glm copula multisite streamflow simulation 4 2 1 copula fitting and family selection table 1 presents the estimated parameters the tail weighted dependence metrics ϱl ϱu and the performance metrics of different copula families to model the joint distribution of the annual inflows at jag and met equivalent reservoirs the kendall τ is a nonlinear measure of correlation between two series the copula family defines how the joint distribution is modeled for instance the gaussian copula represents the joint distribution with the same association intensity despite the values while the gumbel copula has a higher association for large values and the clayton copula for lower values the frank copula has a high association for the middle values and low in the extremes lee and salas 2008 more details of the tested copula families can be found in nelsen 2006 and joe 2014 copula tail asymmetry can be inferred from the ϱl and ϱu values i if ϱl is stronger than ϱu then the joint probability distribution might have greater values in the joint lower tail i e there is tail asymmetry toward the joint lower tail ii if ϱl is weaker than ϱu then the joint probability distribution might have greater values in the joint upper tail i e there is tail asymmetry toward the joint upper tail iii if ϱl is about equal ϱu then the joint probability distribution values in both tails might be similar i e there is no tail asymmetry with these definitions it is possible to understand the tail asymmetry of the observed data and of each of the fitted copulas presented in the table 1 the gaussian and student copulas presented the minima aic values and the kendall τ values closest to the observed however as the observed data presented a small tail asymmetry towards the lower joint tail symmetrical copulas like the gaussian and student t copulas might not be the best suited to model the observed data therefore the bb1 copula which is the fitted copula with asymmetry towards the lower tail that presented the lowest aic value was the copula selected to model the spatial dependence for the case study fig 7 illustrates the scatterplot of 300 random uniform pairs f jag f met simulated from the bb1 copula versus the observed values it also depicts the contour plot of the bb1 copula joint probability distribution values fig 7 shows that dependence structure was well preserved by the bb1 copula 4 2 2 preservation of the dependency structure and historical statistics fig 8 presents as an illustration of the dependency structure the pair plot of the jagt jagt 1 mett mett 1 variables for the observed data and for the synthetic series generated by the glm copula model the glm copula model visually reproduced the dependency structure of the observed variables for both equivalent reservoirs figs 9 11 compare some statistical characteristics of the historical series with those related to the dependence structure of the synthetic annual flow series generated by the glm copula arma and copar multivariate models all three methods were able to reproduce the historical statistics with similar efficiency like the univariate case the glm based model carried out the skewness coefficient better than arma and the arma model underestimated the minimum values from the auto and cross correlation functions figs 10 12 for the glm copula arma and copar models respectively the methods represented the short term dependence structure i e the first lag autocorrelation temporal dependence and the lag 0 cross correlation spatial dependence with matched efficiency and spreads like the univariate glm model the glm copula model also has the ability to represent the long terms dependencies as its correlation function do not necessarily follow an exponential decay fig 10 which is not the case of the arma model regarding the long term dependencies fig 11 thus the proposed model showed the same performance in representing the short term dependencies than the arma and copar models while having the advantage over arma of being flexible and intuitive to depict isolated peaks in the auto and cross correlation functions by choosing the appropriate lags as covariates and being simpler than the copar model the relative errors eq 11 of the statistical characteristics between the synthetic and the historical series were computed as another performance measure silva and portela 2012 and are presented in table 2 11 relative e r r o r gen h i s t hist x 100 where gen denotes the mean of the 100 statistics estimated from the generated synthetic series and hist the same statistic estimated from the corresponding historical sample the results of table 2 corroborate those denoted by the previous boxplots and are not conclusive as to whether there is a better model for simulating annual streamflow when comparing the preservation of historical statistics however it can be noticed that glm copula was the best in reproducing the temporal dependence statistic for both series which is likely to be due to the glm s margin modeling in contrast the glm copula was the worst in reproducing the spatial dependence statistics in comparison to the arma model the glm copula reproduced the skewness better for both series while being worse reproducing the mean by comparing glm copula and copar it can be noticed that the former was better in reproducing jag statistics while the latter was better in reproducing met s which also happened in the comparison between arma and copar fig 13 presents the comparison of the copula entropy for the original data and the models synthetic series as a nonlinear measure of total association between the variables jagt jagt 1 mett mett 1 it shows that the three models resulted in higher association than the observed data and that the glm copula model was the closest to the observed total association and reasonable better than both benchmark models 4 2 3 drought conditions in fig 14 the longest drought period from each of the synthetic series are compared with the historical values although the methods applied matched performance in reproducing the historical statistics the glm copula model was significantly superior in simulating drought duration for the jag inflow series however with greater spreads the arma longest drought showed lower durations than the glm copula s and led to an underestimation in the jag series both copula models glm copula and copar were better than arma in this criterion for both series for met the glm copula and the copar presented matched performance while arma was slightly worse while the greater dispersion presented by the glm copula and copar time series models would not be a problem in the stochastic optimization of the reservoir system operation rules the use of the arma generated series would imply a false higher water availability for the jag series increasing the vulnerability of the system to longer droughts and the risk of water shortage due to the pluriannual characteristic of the reservoirs 5 summary and conclusions this paper presents the implementation of a new multisite stochastic annual streamflow simulation approach based on the combination of bivariate copulas spatial dependence and generalized linear models temporal dependence this research also brought a simple application of glm to generate univariate streamflow time series the authors believe this work is the first research to apply generalized linear models to stochastic streamflow simulation the glm copula time series model efficiently exploits synergies and the flexibility of both techniques and its main advantages are that they i do not require data normalization hence the glms flexibility to deal with any exponential family distribution ii have capacity to represent non conventional long term acf designs intuitively by just considering significant lags as covariates of the glms iii and have flexibility to model spatial dependence by defining the copula family the results showed that the glm copula approach ability to preserve summary statistics from the historical data was similar to the classical multivariate arma and the state of art copar models for the dependency structures the glm copula reproduced what was narrowly the best in reproducing the short term temporal dependence lag 1 autocorrelation narrowly the worst in reproducing the spatial dependence lag 0 cross correlation and reasonable the best in reproducing the total association copula entropy thus the proposed glm copula model can be an alternative with matched if not better performance when compared to the existing time series simulation methods in comparison with the arma model the glm copula was better in reproducing both the skewness coefficient and the maximum drought duration and the latter was underestimated by the arma model copar was also better reproducing the maximum drought duration than the arma model these results are similar to those obtained by other copula approach studies of skewness coefficient replication lee and salas 2011 chen et al 2019 and for drought representation lee and salas 2011 although lee and salas 2011 considered these results as marginal benefits we suggest that in both works it is clear that the arma models lead to an underestimation of drought conditions while the copula based models do not for an underdeveloped semiarid region like that considered in the case study water resources planning with misleading drought information could result in heavy economical losses thus the copula based glm copula and copar synthetic series are preferable to those resulting from the arma model in drought dependent stochastic applications in addition the better reproduction of the skewness coefficient might be related to the lack of data normalization thus glm or copula based methods like the glm copula are flexible parametric approaches that can be applied even when data normalization fails compared to the copar model the glm copula has the advantages of being simpler and reducing the computational burden for multisite and or greater than one lag applications while maintaining the flexibility of the marginal distributions modeling the main drawback is that it does not model the temporal dependence nonlinearly despite the existence of multiple time series simulation methods this research showed that there is still space for improvement the proposed method is intuitive robust requires low computational effort and can be easily replicated with open source r packages therefore the authors consider that the proposed model might be useful in future studies applications due to its flexibility and the solid results presented the model was created in its simplest form and due to its flexibility can be easily extended by combining generalized linear models with numerical data or by extending them to include exogenous climate variables that affect streamflow the extension of the glm copula to higher dimensions more than two spatially dependent time series is straightforward by combining glms for temporal dependence modeling with vine or maximum entropy copulas for spatial dependence modeling modeling temporal dependencies in combinationwith glms would soften the curse of dimensionality in vine and maximum entropy copulas applications funding the research was supported by grants from the conselho nacional de desenvolvimento científico e tecnológico brasil cnpq credit

4491,the research presents a multisite annual streamflow generation model that combines the generalized linear model glm for determining the temporal structure with copulas for modelling the spatial dependence joint distributions the performance of the glm copula model was verified by comparing its ability to preserve historical features and simulate drought events with the multivariate auto regressive moving average arma model and the copula autoregressive copar model the statistical measures adopted for the models performance evaluation include summary statistics mean standard deviation maximum minimum and skewness coefficient temporal and spatial correlation simulation of drought conditions maximum number of years under drought condition and copula entropy as a nonlinear measure of total association the combined glm copula model s main advantages are that i it does not require data normalization ii it allows the modelling of the dependence structures with different probability functions and iii it is capable of representing non conventional parsimonious autocorrelation functions the ability of the glm copula approach to preserve the summary statistics from the historical data was similar to both benchmark models however the glm copula was considerably better in reproducing the longest drought duration that was underestimated by the arma model and was better in reproducing the copula entropy than both benchmark models the approach is proposed in its simplest form but can be easily upgraded by combining glms with numerical data or extended to predict future streamflow with the incorporation of exogenous climate variables that affect streamflow the proposed model may be useful in future studies applications where data normalization jeopardizes the replication of data or and in drought dependent stochastic applications like the definition of optimal operation rules of a perennial reservoir system or long term hydropower dispatch keywords generalized linear models copula multi site stochastic streamflow simulation 1 introduction synthetic streamflow time series generation has an important role in water resources planning and management it is applied to the design of reservoir systems and to the definition of their optimal operation rules to drought evaluation and to several other studies with a stochastic nature mcmahon et al 2006 rajagopalan et al 2010 salas and lee 2010 for a correct application the generated synthetic series must preserve key historical data characteristics such as statistical moments and dependence structure e g auto and cross correlation zachariah and reddy 2013 the classical methods for streamflow simulation such as the arma models box and jenkins 1976 are based on rigid assumptions about the variables dependence and require them to follow a gaussian distribution sharma and o neill 2002 prairie et al 2006 however some hydrological variables are significantly skewed which requires their normalization i e their transformation into alternatives variables that satisfy those models assumptions salas et al 1980 salas 1993 most of those models drawbacks arise from their rigid assumptions e g the gaussian and from the limitations of the data transformation techniques resulting in a lack of flexibility that may influence the preservation of the historical characteristics sharma et al 1997 prairie et al 2006 rajagopalan et al 2010 hao and singh 2011 lee and salas 2011 pereira et al 2017 the stochastic streamflow simulation literature presents several non gaussian modeling alternatives the most famous are the lag 1 gamma autoregressive model gar 1 fernandez and salas 1990 and the nonparametric approaches such as the k nearest neighbor method knn lall and sharma 1996 and the kernel density estimators kde sharma et al 1997 sharma and o neill 2002 however these alternative models have their own limitations the gar 1 also lacks flexibility and cannot model long term persistency furthermore resampling methods like the knn reproduce only the observed values and the kde may not be applied to higher dimensions rajagopalan et al 2010 lee and salas 2011 recently copula based approaches have been applied to hydrologic time series generation lee and salas 2011 zachariah and reddy 2013 chen et al 2015 pereira et al 2017 the copula methods are parametric approaches that model the dependence structure apart from the marginal distributions which provides high flexibility by allowing the use of any marginal distributions lee and salas 2011 compared the performance of a copula and an arma model applied to single site annual streamflow generation and showed the former had some benefits if small generalized linear models glms introduced by nelder and wedderburn 1972 as an extension of the classical linear regression model are parsimonious parametric methods that allow the modelling of non gaussian variables mccullagh and nelder 1989 as stated by rajagopalan et al 2010 glm approaches may be reasonable alternatives to the traditional parametric methods due to their flexibility and capability to preserve different features of the historical series the use of glms is recognized in hydrology for stochastic generation of daily weather variables like precipitation temperature and potential evapotranspiration chandler and wheater 2002 chandler 2005 yang et al 2005 wheater et al 2005 furrer and katz 2007 kleiber et al 2012 verdin et al 2014 however to the knowledge of the authors glms have not yet been applied for streamflow stochastic generation thus the first part of this research addresses the applicability of glm to generate single site annual streamflow and compares its ability to model temporal dependence and preserve historical statistics against a traditional univariate autoregressive ar method for multisite time series generation glm approaches require the specification of the joint probability distributions of the time series which is obtained from a spatial dependence modelling that respects the marginal distributions yang et al 2005 however modelling the spatial structure is a complex process that is often done in the glm based weather generators by multivariate gaussian assumptions that may need data normalization reducing the approach s flexibility yang et al 2005 kleiber et al 2012 verdin et al 2014 meanwhile high dimensional copulas d 3 lose their flexibility to represent the dependence structures as there is a limited set of higher dimensional copula families kao and govindaraju 2008 aas et al 2009 hao and singh 2013 to overcome this limitation recent copula times series models are mostly built from two approaches i vine copulas that decomposes the multidimensional problem into a sequence of bidimensional copulas brechmann and czado 2015 pereira et al 2017 wang et al 2019 or ii maximum entropy copula that based on the concept of maximum entropy distribution from the information theory can fit a flexible high dimensional copula hao and singh 2013 2015 singh and zhang 2018 however the complexity and the computational burden grows quickly with the dimension for both entropy and vine copula models hao and singh 2015 pereira et al 2017 the second part of this research presents a multisite annual streamflow generation model that couples glm and copula the first to represent the temporal structure and the second to model the spatial dependence i e the joint distributions its performance to reproduce historical statistics and dependence structures is compared with the traditional multivariate arma model and the copula autoregressive copar model brechmann and czado 2015 a state of art copula time series model that extends the vine copula concept to model both spatial and temporal dependence the proposed model exploits both methods flexibility and synergy the copula provides a flexible way for estimating the joint distribution that glm needs for multisite generation while the glm lowers the problem s dimension and allows copula models to be applied without the need for normalized data despite the existence of several stochastic multisite streamflow time series generation methods none is universally accepted srinivas and srinivasan 2005 chen et al 2015 hao and singh 2016 in contrast the proposed model allows us to model both spatial and temporal dependencies without normalization is computationally efficient and can be used as a dimensional reduction for vine and maximum entropy copula practitioners which we suggest justifies its addition to the time series generation toolbox 2 case study data and preliminary analysis in this paper the jaguaribe metropolitano reservoir system in ceará state brazil represented in fig 1 was selected as the multi site synthetic flow series generation case study since the annual inflows at its seven reservoirs are highly variable and skewed souza filho and lall 2003 the annual inflow data to those reservoirs are available for the 1912 2012 period 101 years from barros et al 2013 the jaguaribe metropolitano is the state s greatest water impounding system and the most important water supply source it comprises two different basins the jaguaribe and the metropolitano basins with 72 000 and 15 200 km2 respectively that were artificially connected by channels allowing the latter to receive water from the former most of the system is located in a semiarid region with a highly variable annual streamflow due to the temporal variability of the precipitation and the predominance of shallow soils da silva et al 2017 the jaguaribe basin covers approximately 48 of the state of ceará and its main water use is irrigation which accounts for about 90 of the state agricultural production although the metropolitano basin is smaller comprising approximately 10 of the state area it has a larger population and supplies water to the capital city fortaleza and to its metropolitan region for domestic supply industry and tourism the water demand in the metropolitano basin is almost uniform throughout the year while the one in jaguaribe basin is concentrated in the second semester due to the crop irrigation period i e the dry station souza filho and lall 2003 da silva et al 2017 the system is composed of seven major reservoirs from upstream to downstream orós castanhão banabuiú aracoiaba pacajus pacoti and gavião the first three are in the jaguaribe basin and the last four are in the metropolitano basin total storage capacity of 10 240 and 871 hm3 respectively fig 1 for water resources planning and management purposes the jaguaribe metropolitano system can be represented as two equivalent reservoirs one for each basin located at the most downstream sections of the main rivers of jaguaribe and the metropolitano basins as illustrated in fig 1 in this research the annual inflows to the jaguaribe jag and metropolitano met equivalent reservoirs were obtained by summing the annual inflows to each of their major component reservoirs the temporal correlation and the spatial cross correlation of the annual inflows series thus obtained for jag and met are characterized in fig 2 for lags 0 until 17 in spatial terms there is a high lag 0 correlation 0 8 as shown by the cross correlation function because the rainfall regime in both basins mainly relies on the same climatic process the intertropical convergence zone itcz displacement moura and shukla 1981 andreoli and kayano 2004 wang et al 2004 in temporal terms both series present a short term persistency pattern with a fast correlogram decay after the first lag there is also a long term dependence pattern with significant positive correlation coefficients for lags 10 and 11 the short memory pattern may be a result of low groundwater flow since both basins are situated in a crystalline precambrian basement with shallow soils and poor vegetation cover frischkorn et al 2003 alexandre et al 2005 barros et al 2013 the long term persistency may be related to a decadal sea surface temperature variability in the tropical atlantic that influences the itcz location andreoli and kayano 2004 andreoli and kayano 2006 the empirical and fitted cumulative distribution functions cdf and probability density functions pdf of the annual flows at each equivalent reservoir are shown in fig 3 showing convincing similarity both series are non gaussian and right skewed the inflows to jag are close to a lognormal distribution and those to met to a gamma distribution the selection of the best fit distribution was based in the anderson darling test for the maximum likelihood estimated parameters and the fit of the cdfs is remarkably good throughout the range of data 3 background and methodology 3 1 generalized linear models the classical linear regression model is defined as 1 y i α β x i ε i ε i n 0 σ 2 i 1 n where yi is each value of the response variable α is the intercept β is a vector of parameters xi is the vector of predictors and ε is a normally distributed error salas et al 1980 equation 1 can be rewritten in the following form fahrmeir and tutz 2001 2 y i n μ i σ 2 η i α β x i η i g μ i i 1 n where μi is the expectation of yi ηi is a linear predictor g is the function that links the expectation of the response variable with the predictors i e a link function the link function is equal to the identity in the model described by eq 1 the model described by eq 2 can be extended to a more general case glms with the assumption that each yi has a distribution in the exponential family with expectation e yi xi μi a common dispersion parameter ϕ independent of i and function of the response variable variance fahrmeir and tutz 2001 the density function of these distributions is 3 f y i θ i ϕ e x p y i θ i b θ i a ϕ c y i ϕ where θi is the natural parameter dependent on μi a b and c are specific functions related to the type of exponential family the exponential family comprises some famous continuous e g normal lognormal and gamma and discrete e g poisson and bernoulli distributions and the link between its expectation and the linear predictors may be represented by any monotonic differentiable function mccullagh and nelder 1989 hence the flexibility of glms to model different types of data e g continuous discrete and categorical and gaussian and non gaussian patterns although the glms were proposed to model independent variables they can be extended to time series with lags as covariates fahrmeir and tutz 2001 chandler 2005 a more detailed description of the glms theory is in mccullagh and nelder 1989 and fahrmeir and tutz 2001 3 2 bivariate copulas copulas are parametric functions that are able to combine marginal distributions into a multivariate distribution function the copula concept allows flexibility to choose the univariate marginal distributions due to its dependence structure that sits within alternative variables that are uniform in the unit square and correspond to the values of the univariate cumulative distributions nelsen 2006 according to sklar s theorem sklar 1959 a bivariate distribution function f x y of two correlated random variables x and y with respective marginal cumulative distributions f x and f y can be defined as a copula c 4 f x y c f x f y c u v where u and v are uniform and defined in the 0 1 interval and refer to the values of f x and f y respectively besides their marginal distribution flexibility copulas can capture non linear dependence features their parameters can be estimated by maximum likelihood and there is a wide range of copula families e g normal frank gumbel clayton which allows versatility in the dependence structure modelling as well some copula families descriptions their formulation and parameter estimation methods can be found in joe 1997 nelsen 2006 and joe 2014 there are copulas defined for more than two variables however higher dimension copulas are simply one parameter constructs and result in loss of flexibility and rigid dependence assumptions it is better to model the joint distributions as a sequence of bivariate copulas i e the vine copula method some are applied to pairs of univariate margins and others applied to pairs of univariate conditional distributions aas et al 2009 joe 2014 still the number of parameters grows exponentially with the number of variables in the vine copula approach fortunately we are only dealing with a pair of time series 3 3 glm single site streamflow simulation the annual streamflow time series for each site is modelled as a univariate glm with constant variance and the annual streamflow lags with significant correlations 1st 10th 11th as covariates fig 2 the inflows to jag were sampled from a lognormal distribution with identity link and those to met from a gamma with log link fig 3 these models can be described as 5 f jag t l o g n o r m a l μ 1 t σ 1 2 g μ 1 t β 1 0 β 1 1 jag t 1 β 1 2 jag t 10 β 1 3 jag t 11 6 f met t g a m m a μ 2 t σ 2 2 h μ 2 t β 2 0 β 2 1 met t 1 β 2 2 met t 10 β 2 3 met t 11 where jagt and mett are each equivalent reservoir time series t is the time μ1 t and μ2 t are each series expected values for time t g and h are the link functions identity and log respectively σ1 2 and σ2 2 are the series variance and β1 i and β2 i i 1 2 number of covariates 1 are each series glm parameters maximum likelihood glm parameter estimates are obtained using iterative weighted least squares mccullagh and nelder 1989 this procedure was carried out using the base stats package from the r programming language r core team 2013 3 4 copula glm multisite streamflow simulation the joint distribution of both sites times series is modelled as a bivariate copula 7 f jag t jag t met t met t c f jag t f met t c u v this model assumes that the spatial relation between inflows to jag and met is temporally stationary also u and v the marginal s cdfs values are random variables uniformly distributed between zero and one to obtain the random values u v one of the variables may be sampled from the uniform distribution while the other from the conditional bivariate copula distribution that can be defined as a function of the joint distribution 8 f v u c v u c u v u the selection of the copula family and parameters estimation was done with the vinecopula r package schepsmeier et al 2018 the package estimates the parameters for different copula families using the maximum likelihood method and then selects the family with the lowest akaike information criterion aic it also verifies the performance of the fit by the reproduction of the kendall τ correlation coefficient also a verification of the copula s tail asymmetry is carried out with the lower ϱl and upper ϱu tail weighted bivariate measures of dependence proposed by krupskii and joe 2015 the two measures are defined as 9 ϱ l a p c o r a 1 u p a 1 v p u p v p 10 ϱ u a p c o r a 1 1 u p a 1 1 v p 1 u p 1 v p where a is a monotonic increasing function in the 0 1 domain and p is the truncation level with values in the 0 0 5 interval the monotonic increasing function and truncation level used were respectively a x x 6 and p 0 5 as recommended by krupskii and joe 2015 equations 7 and 8 provide only the spatial correlation structure the temporal dependence is modelled within each series marginal distribution as the single site glms described by eqs 5 and 6 thus after ut and vt spatially correlated variables are sampled jag t and met t temporally and spatially correlated variables can be determined by the inverse of the respective glm s cdf 3 5 generation algorithm the proposed multivariate annual streamflow simulation procedure is detailed in fig 4 it can be described as an eight step process i the probability distributions of the annual inflow series at the equivalent reservoirs are evaluated to select the respective best fit exponential functions and the lags with relevant correlation coefficients that should compose the covariates ii the temporal dependence is modelled as described by eqs 5 and 6 by fitting univariate glms with the covariates and exponential distributions selected for each series marginal distributions in step i iii the uniform u v variables are calculated from the estimated expectations and the glms cdfs at each time position iv the spatial correlation structure is established by fitting a copula distribution between the observed u v uniform variables v after modelling both dependence structures the random simulation starts with the generation of n the length of the synthetic time series random u from the uniform 0 1 distribution and then n random v are drawn from the bivariate copula conditional distribution eq 8 vi the first t 1 synthetic generated ut vt pair spatially correlated is transformed into the jag t and met t synthetic streamflow pair temporally and spatially correlated by the inverse of the marginals glms cdf with expectations determined from the set of covariates lags values the initial set may be a random sample from the historical series vii the set of covariates values is updated with the generated jag t and met t viii the time position is updated t t 1 and the steps vi and vii are repeated for the next ut vt pairs until all pairs are transformed into the synthetic generated streamflow series t n 3 6 performance assessment in order to demonstrate the performance of the single site glm and of the multisite glm copula annual streamflow time series stochastic simulation models their efficiency is compared respectively to univariate autoregressive ar and multivariate arma models described by salas et al 1980 the multisite glm copula is also compared to the state of art copula model copar the synthetic replicates from the stochastic models should preserve the statistical characteristics i e mean standard deviation and skewness and the dependence structures srivastav and simonovic 2014 the univariate ar and the multivariate arma models were fitted to the normalized jag and met inflow series the data normalization was done using the box cox power transformation the fitting and sampling procedures were carried out with the r marima package spliid 2017 the first order univariate ar and the 1 1 order multivariate arma were selected since they resulted in the lowest aic values the copar model brechmann and czado 2015 applies the vine copula theory aas et al 2009 to model both serial and cross sectional dependences vine copulas are based on the decomposition of the multivariate copula density into a product of bivariate copulas also called pair copula construction in this paper a first order copar 1 model is chosen as benchmark it was reproduced through the original algorithm described in brechmann and czado 2015 the application of the copar 1 to the case study time series required the sequential fitting of five bivariate copulas c jagt jagt 1 c jagt mett c jagt 1 mett jagt c mett 1 jagt jagt 1 and c mett 1 mett jagt 1 jagt the families and parameters of each of the bivariate copulas were estimated using the two stage maximum likelihood estimation method where the parameters of marginal distributions are initially estimated and then the parameters of the copula function are estimated using maximum likelihood with the marginals computed from the previously fitted marginal distributions singh and zhang 2018 the fitting and simulation procedures of the copar model were carried out with functions from the vinecopula r package one hundred synthetic annual streamflow series runs with the same length as the observed series n 101 years are generated by each model and their statistical characteristics and dependence structures are compared graphically based on boxplots against the historical data a historical series behavior is judged to be preserved by the synthetic series when its values lie within the box salas and lee 2010 lee and salas 2011 hao and singh 2013 the use of one hundred runs is in accordance with the streamflow simulation literature lee and salas 2011 hao and singh 2013 srivastav and simonovic 2014 as a nonlinear measure of performance the copula entropy ce of the observed variables jagt jagt 1 mett mett 1 was compared to the ce of the model s synthetic series based on the definition of shannon s entropy shannon 1948 ma and sun 2011 proposed the copula entropy as the entropy of the copula function and showed its relation with joint and marginal entropy they also proved the equivalence between the negative of ce and mutual information mi mi is a traditional non linear measure of the dependences association between random variables based on entropy theory cover and thomas 1991 however the estimation of mi for more than two variables is a hard task while ce just requires the variables copula joint distribution alpettiyil krishnankutty et al 2020 thus ce is a useful multivariate estimator of mi ce has been used to measure the association between stock market variables zhao and lin 2011 multiple degradation processes sun et al 2019 and river flows chen et al 2013 it was also used as a performance measure in feature selection for rainfall runoff modeling and drought prediction chen et al 2014 huang and zhang 2019 and in selecting vine copula structure for multisite streamflow simulation ni et al 2020 in this research the copula entropy of the observed data and the resulted from the synthetic time series were calculated through the copent r package ma 2020 which calculates ce through a nonparametric estimation of the copula function as a practical exercise we also analyzed the performance of the models to simulate drought conditions simply understood as being below average conditions for this purpose in each case study the years with annual flows below the respective historical mean were assigned to drought conditions the maximum number of consecutive years under drought conditions i e the longest drought period in each of the one hundred synthetic series of the glm copula arma and copar models were compared to the longest drought period of the historical series the longest period under drought conditions is a relevant constraint in the design and in the operation of the artificial reservoirs 4 results 4 1 glm single site streamflow simulation the ability of the single site glm and ar methods to preserve the historical statistics and temporal dependence structures is presented respectively in figs 5 and 6 for this purpose and like all the other figures boxplots were drawn of the generated values of the annual statistics and these were compared with the historical statistics for the boxplots the whiskers have maximum length of 1 5 iqr interquartile range and the values outside the whiskers are considered to be outliers robbins 2004 fig 5 shows that all the historical statistics are well reproduced by both methods except for the standard deviation of the inflows to met from the glm model and for the minimum of the inflows to jag from the ar model individually the glm reproduced better the minimum and the skewness coefficient the first since the ar model underestimated the minimum of both series and the latter may be due to not requiring data normalization also the methods were better in reproducing the maxima than the minima and overall presented the same performance in both jag and met regarding the replication of the sample statistics from the autocorrelation function acf analysis in fig 6 both methods were similarly efficient in representing the first lag autocorrelation the short term temporal dependence and also had similar dispersions the glm also depicted the long term dependence peak at the 10th and 11th lags however with better performance for the met inflow series gamma distribution an interesting advantage presented by the glm series is that their acf is not represented as an exponential decay like the autoregressive models but instead it is able to capture the lagged correlations used as covariates 1st 10th and 11th thus the glm can be applied to mimic some complex acf designs by considering a larger set of lags as covariates however the increase of the set of covariates increases the number of parameters and reduces the parsimony of the model which can be a drawback depending on the ratio between the length of the observed series and the number of parameters 4 2 glm copula multisite streamflow simulation 4 2 1 copula fitting and family selection table 1 presents the estimated parameters the tail weighted dependence metrics ϱl ϱu and the performance metrics of different copula families to model the joint distribution of the annual inflows at jag and met equivalent reservoirs the kendall τ is a nonlinear measure of correlation between two series the copula family defines how the joint distribution is modeled for instance the gaussian copula represents the joint distribution with the same association intensity despite the values while the gumbel copula has a higher association for large values and the clayton copula for lower values the frank copula has a high association for the middle values and low in the extremes lee and salas 2008 more details of the tested copula families can be found in nelsen 2006 and joe 2014 copula tail asymmetry can be inferred from the ϱl and ϱu values i if ϱl is stronger than ϱu then the joint probability distribution might have greater values in the joint lower tail i e there is tail asymmetry toward the joint lower tail ii if ϱl is weaker than ϱu then the joint probability distribution might have greater values in the joint upper tail i e there is tail asymmetry toward the joint upper tail iii if ϱl is about equal ϱu then the joint probability distribution values in both tails might be similar i e there is no tail asymmetry with these definitions it is possible to understand the tail asymmetry of the observed data and of each of the fitted copulas presented in the table 1 the gaussian and student copulas presented the minima aic values and the kendall τ values closest to the observed however as the observed data presented a small tail asymmetry towards the lower joint tail symmetrical copulas like the gaussian and student t copulas might not be the best suited to model the observed data therefore the bb1 copula which is the fitted copula with asymmetry towards the lower tail that presented the lowest aic value was the copula selected to model the spatial dependence for the case study fig 7 illustrates the scatterplot of 300 random uniform pairs f jag f met simulated from the bb1 copula versus the observed values it also depicts the contour plot of the bb1 copula joint probability distribution values fig 7 shows that dependence structure was well preserved by the bb1 copula 4 2 2 preservation of the dependency structure and historical statistics fig 8 presents as an illustration of the dependency structure the pair plot of the jagt jagt 1 mett mett 1 variables for the observed data and for the synthetic series generated by the glm copula model the glm copula model visually reproduced the dependency structure of the observed variables for both equivalent reservoirs figs 9 11 compare some statistical characteristics of the historical series with those related to the dependence structure of the synthetic annual flow series generated by the glm copula arma and copar multivariate models all three methods were able to reproduce the historical statistics with similar efficiency like the univariate case the glm based model carried out the skewness coefficient better than arma and the arma model underestimated the minimum values from the auto and cross correlation functions figs 10 12 for the glm copula arma and copar models respectively the methods represented the short term dependence structure i e the first lag autocorrelation temporal dependence and the lag 0 cross correlation spatial dependence with matched efficiency and spreads like the univariate glm model the glm copula model also has the ability to represent the long terms dependencies as its correlation function do not necessarily follow an exponential decay fig 10 which is not the case of the arma model regarding the long term dependencies fig 11 thus the proposed model showed the same performance in representing the short term dependencies than the arma and copar models while having the advantage over arma of being flexible and intuitive to depict isolated peaks in the auto and cross correlation functions by choosing the appropriate lags as covariates and being simpler than the copar model the relative errors eq 11 of the statistical characteristics between the synthetic and the historical series were computed as another performance measure silva and portela 2012 and are presented in table 2 11 relative e r r o r gen h i s t hist x 100 where gen denotes the mean of the 100 statistics estimated from the generated synthetic series and hist the same statistic estimated from the corresponding historical sample the results of table 2 corroborate those denoted by the previous boxplots and are not conclusive as to whether there is a better model for simulating annual streamflow when comparing the preservation of historical statistics however it can be noticed that glm copula was the best in reproducing the temporal dependence statistic for both series which is likely to be due to the glm s margin modeling in contrast the glm copula was the worst in reproducing the spatial dependence statistics in comparison to the arma model the glm copula reproduced the skewness better for both series while being worse reproducing the mean by comparing glm copula and copar it can be noticed that the former was better in reproducing jag statistics while the latter was better in reproducing met s which also happened in the comparison between arma and copar fig 13 presents the comparison of the copula entropy for the original data and the models synthetic series as a nonlinear measure of total association between the variables jagt jagt 1 mett mett 1 it shows that the three models resulted in higher association than the observed data and that the glm copula model was the closest to the observed total association and reasonable better than both benchmark models 4 2 3 drought conditions in fig 14 the longest drought period from each of the synthetic series are compared with the historical values although the methods applied matched performance in reproducing the historical statistics the glm copula model was significantly superior in simulating drought duration for the jag inflow series however with greater spreads the arma longest drought showed lower durations than the glm copula s and led to an underestimation in the jag series both copula models glm copula and copar were better than arma in this criterion for both series for met the glm copula and the copar presented matched performance while arma was slightly worse while the greater dispersion presented by the glm copula and copar time series models would not be a problem in the stochastic optimization of the reservoir system operation rules the use of the arma generated series would imply a false higher water availability for the jag series increasing the vulnerability of the system to longer droughts and the risk of water shortage due to the pluriannual characteristic of the reservoirs 5 summary and conclusions this paper presents the implementation of a new multisite stochastic annual streamflow simulation approach based on the combination of bivariate copulas spatial dependence and generalized linear models temporal dependence this research also brought a simple application of glm to generate univariate streamflow time series the authors believe this work is the first research to apply generalized linear models to stochastic streamflow simulation the glm copula time series model efficiently exploits synergies and the flexibility of both techniques and its main advantages are that they i do not require data normalization hence the glms flexibility to deal with any exponential family distribution ii have capacity to represent non conventional long term acf designs intuitively by just considering significant lags as covariates of the glms iii and have flexibility to model spatial dependence by defining the copula family the results showed that the glm copula approach ability to preserve summary statistics from the historical data was similar to the classical multivariate arma and the state of art copar models for the dependency structures the glm copula reproduced what was narrowly the best in reproducing the short term temporal dependence lag 1 autocorrelation narrowly the worst in reproducing the spatial dependence lag 0 cross correlation and reasonable the best in reproducing the total association copula entropy thus the proposed glm copula model can be an alternative with matched if not better performance when compared to the existing time series simulation methods in comparison with the arma model the glm copula was better in reproducing both the skewness coefficient and the maximum drought duration and the latter was underestimated by the arma model copar was also better reproducing the maximum drought duration than the arma model these results are similar to those obtained by other copula approach studies of skewness coefficient replication lee and salas 2011 chen et al 2019 and for drought representation lee and salas 2011 although lee and salas 2011 considered these results as marginal benefits we suggest that in both works it is clear that the arma models lead to an underestimation of drought conditions while the copula based models do not for an underdeveloped semiarid region like that considered in the case study water resources planning with misleading drought information could result in heavy economical losses thus the copula based glm copula and copar synthetic series are preferable to those resulting from the arma model in drought dependent stochastic applications in addition the better reproduction of the skewness coefficient might be related to the lack of data normalization thus glm or copula based methods like the glm copula are flexible parametric approaches that can be applied even when data normalization fails compared to the copar model the glm copula has the advantages of being simpler and reducing the computational burden for multisite and or greater than one lag applications while maintaining the flexibility of the marginal distributions modeling the main drawback is that it does not model the temporal dependence nonlinearly despite the existence of multiple time series simulation methods this research showed that there is still space for improvement the proposed method is intuitive robust requires low computational effort and can be easily replicated with open source r packages therefore the authors consider that the proposed model might be useful in future studies applications due to its flexibility and the solid results presented the model was created in its simplest form and due to its flexibility can be easily extended by combining generalized linear models with numerical data or by extending them to include exogenous climate variables that affect streamflow the extension of the glm copula to higher dimensions more than two spatially dependent time series is straightforward by combining glms for temporal dependence modeling with vine or maximum entropy copulas for spatial dependence modeling modeling temporal dependencies in combinationwith glms would soften the curse of dimensionality in vine and maximum entropy copulas applications funding the research was supported by grants from the conselho nacional de desenvolvimento científico e tecnológico brasil cnpq credit

4492,the estimation of groundwater driven lacustrine dissloved inorganic phosphorus dip loading is a challenging task associated with uncertainties related to simplifications used in the empirical and numerical methods a multi disciplinary approach can result in a better understanding of a system and therefore the improved estimate of external dip loading into lakes groundwater discharge and dip loading to a naturally eutrophic lake were estimated using three methods based on field measurements 1 the lake segment approach 2 three dimensional 3d flow and transport modelling and 3 integrating mapped water chemistry with the 3d flow model field measurements and 3d flow modelling show the groundwater contribution to the lake water budget 75 81 the in situ measured spatial distribution of the groundwater discharge rate based on seepage meters and a conservative tracer cl budget approach is well reproduced by the 3d flow model dip fluxes between the aquifer and the surface water vary between 220 and 351 kg yr 1 the integrated approach is associated with the lowest degree of uncertainty and therefore predicts the spatial distribution of the mass loading into the lake with the highest degree of accuracy 3d hydrological information is crucial to estimate the magnitude of dip transport despite the high measured and simulated dip concentration in groundwater beneath gyttja covering the lake bottom the actual contribution of this area into annual groundwater driven dip loading is low due to low groundwater discharge rates dip loading is concentrated instead in the narrow littoral high discharge zones low release rate of dip within the old lake bottom 0 14 µg l 1 predicted with the use of the zero order release term in mt3dms results in a high average dip concentration in the groundwater 60 µg l 1 and is one of the major factors responsible for the long term lake eutrophication keywords groundwater lake interactions phosphorus loading numerical modelling lake eutrophication 1 introduction lake eutrophication can be a result of phosphorus inputs with discharging groundwater brock et al 1982 kang et al 2005 kazmierczak et al 2020 nisbeth et al 2019a even low groundwater fluxes into a lake may transport significant amounts of nutrients labaugh et al 2000 shaw et al 1990 phosphorus often originates from external anthropogenic sources hagaard et al 2005 heathwaite and dils 2000 parkhurst et al 2003 albeit external geogenic phosphorus loading into lakes was also recently reported ala aho et al 2013 kazmierczak et al 2020 meinikmann et al 2015 while the lake restoration attempts aim only at the reduction of internal phosphorus recycling from lake sediments jeppesen et al 1990 thus an understanding of the groundwater lake interactions and associated sources of external dip inputs prior to lake restoration attempts is of major importance kazmierczak et al 2020 nisbeth et al 2019b the estimation of groundwater discharge to lakes and the related nutrient loading is however a challenging task and may require multiple inter disciplinary approaches lewandowski et al 2015 rosenberry et al 2015 water and nutrient fluxes between aquifer and lake can be quantified lewandowski et al 2015 1 directly as the product of discharge rates and nutrient concentrations measured with the use of seepage meters belanger et al 1985 2 by the application of the lake segment approach meinikmann et al 2013 rosenberry and labaugh 2008 using hydraulic head gradients and nutrient concentrations observed in a net of piezometers around the lake kang et al 2005 meinikmann et al 2015 3 with the use of numerical modelling based on empirical data kidmose et al 2014 parkhurst et al 2003 each of the methods is associated with some degree of uncertainty installation of seepage meters may lead to changes in the redox conditions at the sediment water interface and therefore to phosphorus mobilization due to the reduction of iron hydroxides belanger et al 1985 thus phosphorus loading estimated with the use of seepage meters may often be overestimated the phosphorus inputs calculated based on water samples taken from piezometers can also be over underestimated since phosphorus concentrations along the lake shoreline may differ significantly depending on the location of the well meinikmann et al 2015 vanek 1991 numerical modelling is based on data collected in the field but associated with uncertainties due to the simplifications or assumptions used in the flow and transport models as well as the uncertainties connected to the data collection kidmose et al 2014 phosphorus inputs to a lake depend on lewandowski et al 2015 1 the dip release rates from anthropogenic and natural sources hagaard et al 2005 2 redox conditions and groundwater chemistry within the aquifer kazmierczak et al 2020 3 the flow velocity regulating the time available for chemical reactions within the aquifer and at the sediment water interface buso et al 2009 kazmierczak et al 2020 therefore an approach integrating multiple techniques for a good understanding of the flow system and the hydrogeochemical processes taking place in the aquifer and at the sediment water interface is needed for a reliable prediction of the groundwater controlled nutrient loading into lakes kidmose et al 2014 the present study was conducted at the eutrophic lake væng denmark where two earlier attempts of biomanipulation in the periods 1986 1988 and 2007 2009 by reduction of the roach and bream population only brought short term positive effects jeppesen et al 1990 2012 søndergaard et al 1990 the increase of total phosphorus tp concentrations shortly after the restoration attempts is an effect of input of dissolved inorganic phosphorus dip of geogenic origin by the groundwater discharging into the lake kazmierczak et al 2020 the high seepage rates of anoxic groundwater going into the lake kazmierczak et al 2016 combined with a continuous release of dip from iron hydroxides and calcite in the aquifer prevent a retention of dip at the aquifer lake interface and at the adjacent wetlands and lead to the natural lake eutrophication kazmierczak et al 2020 the lake eutrophication is further enhanced by a seasonal release of geogenic dip annual in lake dip cycle stored at the aquifer lake interface in the areas with low seepage rates kazmierczak et al 2020 the objectives of this study were 1 to estimate groundwater controlled dip fluxes into the lake by integrating field observations with numerical modelling 2 to compare different methods for estimation of nutrient loading into the lake and address their uncertainties 3 to describe the influence of the external geogenic dip sources on lake eutrophication the study demonstrates that combining field studies with numerical modelling is needed to assess not only the total loading of dip into the lake but also its spatial distribution and geogenic sources of dip in the aquifer system lake væng with a groundwater contribution to the lake water budget exceeding 70 kazmierczak et al 2016 kidmose et al 2013 represents an end member setting for groundwater dominated lakes rosenberry et al 2015 however the release and transport of geogenic dip may have implications for groundwater lake systems in various settings ala aho et al 2013 heathwaite and dils 2000 kazmierczak et al 2020 mcginley et al 2016 meinikmann et al 2015 understanding the geogenic dip release patterns is crucial for post glacial environments where anoxic aquifers intersect the surface ala aho et al 2013 kazmierczak et al 2020 nisbeth et al 2019a 2 site hydrogeology and hydrochemistry lake væng is a eutrophic groundwater dominated lake kidmose et al 2013 located in the gudenå river catchment central jutland denmark fig 1 the lake has three minor inlets located in the northern area and one major outlet located in the southern end fig 2 the miocene pleistocene aquifer interacting with the lake consists of 1 sands and gravels of the pleistocene erosional valley unit 1 2 sands gravels unit 2 and clays unit 3 of the previous glacial interglacial periods 3 sand rich unit 4 coal bearing unit 5 deposits of the fluvial miocene environments 4 sands unit 4 and clays unit 5 of the marine miocene formations houmark nielsen 1999 2011 rasmussen et al 2010 fig 3 the western part of the lake bottom is covered with a holocene low permeable gyttja layer of thickness up to 11 5 m kazmierczak et al 2016 the hydrogeology and hydrochemistry of the aquifer near lake væng were described in detail in kazmierczak et al 2016 2020 and kidmose et al 2013 the aquifer interacting with the lake is at a steady state and unconfined except of local areas confined by the miocene clay layers the amplitude in the hydraulic heads in 93 of piezometers located near the lake was below 10 cm in the period from september 2011 to november 2013 the lake stage varied from 26 34 to 26 42 m above sea level m a s l groundwater in the lake catchment flows from west and south west towards east and north east a thick gyttja layer acts as a flow barrier at the lake bottom thus part of the groundwater flowing from the west and south passes beneath the lake and discharges at the sandy lake bottom at the opposite side of the lake where high discharge zones and groundwater springs with a discharge of up to 7 m d 1 were observed fig 4 during the study period of 2011 to 2013 the average precipitation in an area of 10 10 km surrounding the lake estimated using a climate model of the danish meteorological institute scharling 1999 was 785 mm yr 1 the estimated recharge of the aquifer equaled 378 mm yr 1 geus 2003 measured discharge from the lake averages 13 7 103 m3 d 1 an average water inflow from the three inlets going from west to east equaled 1 103 1 1 103 and 1 1 103 m3 d 1 based on the recharge value from the danish water resources model geus 2003 net precipitation contributes 165 m3 d 1 thus groundwater inflow to the lake is roughly 10 5 103 m3 d 1 the sediments of the pleistocene erosional valley were deposited within two terraces 1 older terrace ii with top at the elevation of approximately 40 m a s l and 2 younger terrace i with top at the elevation of approximately 30 m a s l fig 4 terrace i is a source of dip released from iron hydroxides in an anoxic zone and discharged into the lake the remaining geogenic dip sources are calcite in the oxic part of an aquifer miocene brown coal layers and miocene marine deposits fig 4 the thickness of the oxic zone in the aquifer varies between 1 to 7 m at the eastern and western lake shore respectively and decreases to 0 m at the groundwater discharge points wetlands seepage faces and the lakebed fig 4 high groundwater discharge rates into the lake prevent the oxygen diffusion into sediment water interface and consequently re bounding of dip onto iron hydroxides and result in the direct loading of an external geogenic dip into the lake kazmierczak et al 2020 the total phosphorus tp concentrations in the lake water estimated by anderson and odgaard 1994 based on diatom studies of the upper 0 5 m of the lakebed sediments representing approximately the last 250 years vary between 115 and 160 µg l 1 and indicate that the lake was already eutrophic in the 18th century the highest tp content in the lake water was after 1950 and was attributed to the common application of fertilizers in agriculture and to the discharge of sewage water into the lake in the period from 1964 to 1983 the lake catchment comprises mainly of arable land 67 and forests 20 the remaining 13 is covered with sand extraction sites 3 urban areas and roads 6 wetlands 2 and grasslands 2 fig 1 3 methods dip loading into lake væng was estimated with the use of 1 lake segment approach section 3 1 2 integrated approach combination of 3d flow model with measured dip concentrations section 3 2 and 3 numerical approach 3d flow and transport model section 3 3 the approaches employ the hydrogeological and hydrogeochemical data collected during the period 2011 2013 as presented in kazmierczak et al 2016 2020 the methods applied in the field are listed in section 3 4 3 1 lake segment approach flow between lake væng and the adjacent aquifer was estimated using the lake segment approach rosenberry and labaugh 2008 the approach assumes that groundwater discharging at the shoreline of each lake segment originates from the groundwater flow through the adjacent part of the catchment rosenberry and labaugh 2008 however groundwater that discharges at the eastern side of lake væng originates from the western and southern part of the catchment kazmierczak et al 2016 fig 4 according to two dimensional modelling studies by kidmose et al 2013 and kazmierczak et al 2016 the volume of groundwater discharge at the eastern lake side equaled 48 51 and 31 respectively of the groundwater recharged in the western part of the catchment therefore classification of flow paths originating from west and south west into one discharging at the western and eastern lake segments is associated with a high degree of uncertainty furthermore the distribution of the regional flow paths from the western part of the catchment is governed by the spatial variability in hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer and lakebed thus the flow conditions do not follow the assumptions behind the segment approach rosenberry and labaugh 2008 and the eastern lake shore being a convergence zone of groundwater flowing under the lake kazmierczak et al 2016 was omitted in the calculation all groundwater flow was assumed to discharge at the remaining part of the lake shoreline which was divided into three segments the location of the border between the flow convergence zone and the remaining segments is an additional source of the uncertainty in the segment approach groundwater in the northern segment discharges mostly through the inlets thus groundwater input in this area was assumed to be equal to the net flow in the inlets groundwater flow through the segments was calculated from the darcy s equation 1 q k l s t h piezometer h lake l where q is flow into the lake m3 d 1 k is horizontal hydraulic conductivity m d 1 ls is the length of the shoreline within the segment m t is an effective thickness of the aquifer m hpiezometer is hydraulic head in the piezometer m hlake is the lake stage m and l is a distance from the piezometer to the shoreline m an average hydraulic conductivity of 14 m d 1 estimated from the slug tests data kazmierczak et al 2016 was used in the discharge calculation principal component analysis pca can be used to identify underlying patterns in multivariate datasets karan et al 2017 tetzlaff et al 2009 in this study the distribution of the major ions alkalinity hco3 calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 sodium na potassium k chloride cl sulfate so4 2 and nitrate no3 in water samples collected at various depths and locations around the lake kazmierczak et al 2016 2020 was analyzed with the use of pca and visualized as a biplot to differentiate water samples thereby it was possible to outline areas of the aquifer where the chemical composition of groundwater was similar and therefore should be formed under similar hydrogeochemical processes described in kazmierczak et al 2016 2020 and have a uniform average dip concentration the aquifer interacting with the lake is hydrologically at steady state kazmierczak et al 2016 the dip concentrations excluding seasonal fluctuations at the sediment water interface and seepage faces at the wetlands were not subjected to annual or seasonal changes kazmierczak et al 2020 the groundwater controlled dip loading into the lake with discharging groundwater was estimated by multiplying water fluxes at each segment with an average dip concentration characteristic for that segment 3 2 integrated approach 3 2 1 groundwater catchment the exact borders of the groundwater catchment of lake væng were delineated based on the analysis of 1 the distribution of the hydraulic heads in the miocene pleistocene aquifer 2 geomorphological data 3 location of lakes and rivers and 4 results of the 2d regional modflow modelling kazmierczak et al 2016 fig 2 the data sets covering an area of 10 10 km were integrated and analyzed in arcgis esri iso potential lines in the miocene pleistocene aquifer were interpolated from the water levels measured from 2011 to 2013 in 11 catchment wells 5 lakes 5 streams and the net of piezometers installed near the lake kazmierczak et al 2016 2020 combined with archive data on hydraulic heads in 200 wells geus 2010 the archive data covered a period of up to approximately 100 years for each well the average hydraulic head was calculated excluding hydraulic heads measured during groundwater extraction at the waterworks the digital elevation model dem was used to delineate the topographic catchments of lakes and rivers a preliminary outline of the groundwater catchment of lake væng was based on the hydraulic head distribution and the results of the 2d regional flow model kazmierczak et al 2016 in the final step the catchment borders were defined based on the distribution of the pleistocene erosional valleys and the topographic catchments of the lakes and streams in the analyzed area 3 2 2 geological model a geological model of the aquifer interacting with lake væng was developed in gms aquaveo llc by combining 1 geological data from 61 boreholes geus 2010 2 geophysical data from six electrical resistivity tomography ert profiles and eight ground penetrating radar gpr lines kazmierczak et al 2016 kidmose et al 2013 3 geomorphological data and 4 three hand drilling profiles kazmierczak et al 2016 and profiling of the sand pit figs 1 and 2 gpr data were used to map the distribution of the organic sediments at the lake bottom and at the adjacent wetlands the borders of the pleistocene erosional valley were delineated based on the dem ert and borehole data 3 2 3 groundwater flow and age model a three dimensional 3d steady state flow model for the groundwater catchment of lake væng for the period from september 2011 to november 2013 was set up using modflow harbaugh et al 2000 fig 5 the bottom of the model corresponded to the top of the lowermost clay horizon horizon 1 in the geological model the bottom of the model and the vertical boundaries of the catchment were specified as a no flow boundary condition the top of the model was interpolated to the 5 5 m dem and the bathymetric map of the sandy lake bottom below the gyttja layer the aquifer lake interactions were simulated using the general head boundary ghb package the thickness of the gyttja layer considered as in lake sediments was incorporated into the conductance term in the ghb cells the drain package was used to represent the wetlands seepage faces adjacent to the lake the inlets of the lake were simulated in the stream package distribution of the hydrogeological units within the grid was mapped from the 3d geological model fig 3 according to højberg et al 2009 the anisotropy of pleistocene clays is higher than other geological formations thus vertical anisotropy in the hydraulic conductivity was set to 10 for the pleistocene clay unit and as 3 for the remaining units an anisotropy of 2 3 was used in similar pleistocene sandy aquifers by hinsby et al 2007 and kidmose et al 2011 horizontal discretization was 25 25 m near the lake and 50 50 m in the remaining part of the catchment the model consisted of 20 numerical layers a recharge of 9 10 4 m d 1 328 mm yr 1 equal to that used by kazmierczak et al 2016 was assigned to the uppermost active cells during the field work in 2011 to 2013 seasonal ponds which are indicators of perched aquifers were frequently observed in the catchment this was probably due to the common occurrence of clay layers in the uppermost part of the pleistocene deposits therefore the applied recharge was set 50 mm yr 1 lower than the estimate of the regional danish water resources model geus 2003 the model was calibrated by the trial and error method recharge and vertical anisotropy of hydraulic conductivity were kept constant during the calibration horizontal hydraulic conductivities in the hydrogeological units and conductance in the cells representing the lake seepage faces and inlets were adjusted to reach the best agreement between the simulated and observed 1 hydraulic heads in 32 points 2 flow in the inlets 3 flow in the outlet equal to total inflow to the lake and 4 measured seepage rates at the sandy eastern lake bottom kazmierczak et al 2016 horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the sand and gravel was tested within the range 0 01 176 m d 1 that covered the values measured by kazmierczak et al 2016 root mean square error rmse calculated after each model run was used for the calibration assessment 2 rmse 1 n h obs h sim 2 where hobs is observed hydraulic head hsim is simulated hydraulic head and n is number of data points the age of dip enriched groundwater discharging into the lake and indirectly the timing of the aquifer recharge pre or post introduction of fertilizers into farming were estimated by adding the 3d age distribution model to the 3d flow model the mean groundwater age in the aquifer time from when recharge reached the water table was simulated using mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 and following engesgaard and molson 1998 to directly simulate the groundwater age in a shallow sandy aquifer in denmark a zero order production term of 1 was assigned to all active cells to represent the aging of groundwater with one day per day longitudinal and transverse dispersivities were set to zero the age of water recharging the aquifer was 0 the model was run for 5000 years to reach steady state conditions 3 2 4 model validation the simulated percentage distribution of discharge into the lake was validated against the spatial distribution of discharge into the lake that was estimated with the use of the average cl concentrations in groundwater and surface water low amplitudes in hydraulic heads and small variations of chemical composition of groundwater sampled in the same area of the aquifer during different time periods kazmierczak et al 2016 2020 indicate that the aquifer interacting with lake væng is at the steady state additionally recharge to the aquifer by leakage of water from the lake is negligible kazmierczak et al 2016 thus the contribution of groundwater from the western and eastern side of the lake to the lake water budget was estimated from the following equations 3 q l q i p q 4 q l c l q i c i p c p q c 5 q c q w c w q e c e where ql is total measured outflow from the lake m3 d 1 cl is chloride concentration in the lake mg l 1 qi is total measured water inflow from the three inlets m3 d 1 ci is an average chloride concentration in the three inlets mg l 1 p is recharge from precipitation precipitation evaporation at the lake surface m3 d 1 pc is chloride concentration in recharge mg l 1 q is a total groundwater discharge m3 d 1 c is an average chloride concentration in the groundwater discharging into the lake mg l 1 qw is groundwater discharge at the western side of the lake m3 d 1 cw is chloride concentration at the western side of the lake mg l 1 qe is groundwater discharge at the eastern side of the lake m3 d 1 and ce is chloride concentration at the eastern side of the lake mg l 1 3 2 5 dip loading in the final step the groundwater controlled dip input into the lake was estimated by combining the results of the 3d flow modelling and the field observations the simulated groundwater discharge at each cell was multiplied with an average dip concentration characteristic for the respective area of the aquifer 3 3 numerical approach mobilization of dip from the old lake bottom terrace i and loading into the lake were simulated in mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 the transport model was based on the developed 3d flow model the anoxic groundwater sampled from the catchment wells and the piezometers located at terrace ii contains on average 18 to 61 µg dip l 1 figs 4 and 7 on the catchment scale the dip concentration varies distinctly fig 7 with no clear patterns in the concentration changes kazmierczak et al 2020 and the data on dip concentration in the deeper parts of the miocene marine aquifers 15 m a s l source 2 in fig 4 are scarce while a clear trend of dip release near the lake in the sediments of terrace i exists and is supported by extensive data kazmierczak et al 2020 thus for pragmatic reasons these local dip changes at the catchment scale were not represented in the regional transport model and a dip concentration of 0 mg l 1 was assigned to all active cells as an initial condition the simplification can be further justified by the use of the dip transport model to estimate an annual dip loading into the lake and not the detailed description of geogenic dip circulation in the catchment mobilization of dip within the terrace i dip release rate in mg per liter of water within the cell per day was simulated in the chemical reaction package as a zero order release term the release rate of dip was assigned to the cells representing pleistocene sand and gravel near the lake with the top located below 30 m a s l cells corresponding to terrace i figs 4 and 5 and adjusted to fit an average dip concentration measured in the anoxic groundwater discharging into the lake fig 4 longitudinal and transverse dispersivities were set to zero and kept constant during the calibration 3 4 field surveys 3 4 1 catchment hydrogeology in total 106 stainless steel piezometers were installed in the vicinity of lake væng kazmierczak et al 2016 fig 2 the screening depth of the piezometers varied between 2 and 28 m below the terrain surface 91 piezometers were aligned in transects w and e1 e4 perpendicular to the western and eastern lake shore respectively piezometer e2 1 was installed in the middle of the lake below an 11 m thick gyttja layer eight shallow near shore piezometers s1 s8 were installed on land around the lake kazmierczak et al 2016 2020 six additional piezometers not presented in previous studies were installed in the lake catchment of these two in the sand pit fig 2 nine push down wells p1 p9 used for multi level hydrogeochemical sampling were placed around the lake in the areas of high groundwater discharge kazmierczak et al 2016 2020 fig 2 data collected from already existing wells geus 2010 kidmose et al 2013 were also included in the analysis hydraulic heads were measured at each piezometer three to ten times after the installation and with at least monthly time step horizontal hydraulic conductivities kh were calculated with the hvorslev 1951 analytical solution for unconfined aquifers using data from the falling head slug tests conducted in all installed piezometers kazmierczak et al 2016 distribution and rates of groundwater discharge at the sandy lake bottom were measured using seepage meters temperature profiles distributed temperature sensing and ice holes mapping kazmierczak et al 2016 kidmose et al 2013 sebok et al 2013 the water stage at lake væng was measured 12 times in the period of september 2011 to november 2013 and at the inlets and outlet of the lake once in april 2012 discharge in the inlets and outlet was monitored monthly from february to november 2013 with the ott acoustic digital current meter kazmierczak et al 2016 ott hydromet gmbh 2013 3 4 2 groundwater chemistry water samples for chemical analysis were taken from selected catchment wells 11 all piezometers hydrogeochemical profiles and five seepage meters kazmierczak et al 2020 additional 10 groundwater samples not presented in the previous studies were taken in september 2012 from the off shore piezometers k4 k6 k8 k10 k11 k12 k13 k14 k17 k18 installed by kidmose et al 2013 fig 2 the three inlets and the outlet were sampled in november 2011 the lake water was sampled in november 2011 august 2012 and september 2013 detailed description of sampling and analysis methods is given in kazmierczak et al 2020 electrical conductivity ec ph dissolved oxygen do alkalinity hco3 and ferrous iron fe2 were measured in the field in the laboratory the water was analyzed for calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 sodium na potassium k total iron fe2 3 manganese mn2 ammonium nh4 chloride cl sulfate so4 2 nitrate no3 nitrite no2 and dissolved inorganic phosphorus dip concentrations kazmierczak et al 2020 4 results 4 1 catchment hydrogeology the groundwater catchment of lake væng is 13 km2 and its borders were defined by the groundwater divides of the streams and lakes located in the pleistocene erosional valleys a major part of the catchment was located west and south west from the lake where the unsaturated zone reached a thickness of up to approximately 80 m fig 2 the catchment consisted of 1 sand and gravel of the pleistocene erosional valley terraces i and ii in fig 4 unit 1 horizon 13 2 sand and gravel of pre weichselian glacial interglacial periods unit 2 horizons 12 10 and 8 3 clay layers of pre weichselian glacial interglacial periods unit 3 horizons 11 and 9 4 miocene fluvial lagoonal marine sand and gravel unit 4 horizons 2 4 and 6 5 miocene fluvial lagoonal marine clay and coal unit 5 horizons 1 3 5 and 7 fig 3 miocene sediments of the different depositional environments were interbedded rasmussen et al 2010 and thus combined within unit 4 high permeable deposits and 5 low permeable deposits the bottom of the model was represented by the clay layer horizon 1 detected in 5 deep boreholes and ert profiles at the elevation of 3 5 to 14 m a s l geus 2010 kidmose et al 2013 the miocene pleistocene sequence reached a thickness of up to 150 m in the south western part of the catchment fig 3 the clay horizons occurred only locally except of horizon 5 represented by clay and coal layers detected at an elevation of 29 5 to 56 m a s l in 15 boreholes in the north eastern part of the catchment older deposits horizons 3 12 were eroded during the weichselian glaciation and replaced by the upper pleistocene and holocene deposits the aquifer that interacted with the lake was mostly unconfined and only locally confined by the miocene clay and coal layers of horizon 5 hydraulic heads in the aquifer ranged between 49 8 and 26 4 m a s l in comparison the lake stage varied from 26 34 to 26 42 m a s l 4 2 hydrochemical zones and dip concentrations near the lake in the principal component analysis the first and second principal components explained 57 of the variability observed in the chemical dataset ca2 cl and na had the highest loadings 0 90 0 83 and 0 79 respectively along the first principal component while k mg2 and no3 had the highest loadings along the second principal component with loadings of 0 69 0 63 and 0 57 respectively fig 6 the biplot on fig 6 shows that groundwater samples on the eastern side of the lake are mostly located along the first principal component samples from transects e3 and e4 and piezometers p3 p7 are clearly delineated from the rest of the samples based on their ca2 cl and na composition other samples from the eastern part of the lake are also characterized by their hco3 mg2 and so4 2 concentration groundwater samples from the western part of the lake display a higher variability on the biplot fig 6 with low concentrations of ca2 cl and na principal component analysis showed that groundwater in the area of lake væng could be classified in general into three groups of the different chemical composition of groundwater fig 6 groundwater in the western part of the aquifer had low ec groundwater at the eastern side of the lake was enriched in na and cl and in the north eastern side of the lake additionally in ca2 and hco3 the chemical composition of the surface water lake three inlets and outlet fell between these three groups fig 6 the lowest dip concentrations were found in the shallow catchment wells with screen placed 15 m a s l on average 15 µg dip l 1 and piezometers located furthest upstream from the lake shore on average 22 µg dip l 1 fig 7 thus the background dip concentration in the uppermost anoxic pleistocene aquifer averaged 18 µg l 1 fig 4 wells with screens in the miocene marine deposits had an average groundwater dip concentration of 61 µg l 1 the average dip concentration in the oxic zone was 44 µg l 1 fig 4 anoxic groundwater that discharged into the lake was further enriched in dip along the flow lines after crossing the border between terrace ii and i that represented the interface between late pleistocene glacial post glacial sediments and early holocene lacustrine fluvial sediments kazmierczak et al 2016 2020 fig 4 the average dip concentration in the anoxic part of the aquifer was calculated separately for the near shore area of each of the three zones distinguished based on the differences in groundwater chemistry groundwater of the shallower circulation flow paths at the western side of the lake terrace i contained 54 30 µg dip l 1 groundwater of the deep circulation flow paths that discharged at the eastern shore contained 56 33 µg dip l 1 in the north eastern area and 68 17 µg dip l 1 in the south eastern area and at the offshore high discharge zone figs 4 and 7 4 3 groundwater flow and discharge distribution 4 3 1 lake segment approach groundwater discharge estimates based on the lake segment approach method equaled 16900 m3 d 1 with 3215 m3 d 1 19 flowing into the lake from the segment encompassing three inlets and 13685 m3 d 1 81 discharging directly through the aquifer lake interface fig 8 the fraction of the groundwater of the 13685 m3 d 1 that passed beneath the lake and discharged at the eastern lake shore could not be distinguished in the lake segment approach however based on the 2d models kazmierczak et al 2016 kidmose et al 2013 31 to 51 of groundwater originating from south and west that discharges at the eastern convergence zone amounted to 4242 to 6979 m3 d 1 the estimated inflow into the lake exceeded the measured outflow from the lake by only 24 the groundwater inflow into the lake would be further overestimated if the eastern lake segments were included in the calculation without subsequent deduction of the discharge fraction at the western and southern lake segments flow via the eastern shoreline estimated using the hydraulic gradients and conductivity in that area and equation 1 equaled 5842 m3 d 1 included in the calculation it would increase the total groundwater inflow into the lake to 22742 m3 d 1 4 3 2 numerical approach 3d flow model simulated daily discharge into the lake equaled 12595 m3 d 1 3098 m3 d 1 flowed into the lake through the three inlets 9496 m3 d 1 75 was discharging groundwater and 146 m3 d 1 was from precipitation the simulated inflow was 8 lower than the observed outflow from the lake flow in the inlets was simulated with an accuracy of 4 the model calibration resulted in the root mean square error rmse value of 0 4 m for head observations the relatively high rmse was due to difference between simulated and observed heads in the south western area of the catchment where simulated heads were underestimated by up to 7 m compared to the archive measurements from 1970 s while in the near lake area the simulated heads matched the heads measured in the period 2011 to 2013 fig 9 the offset in the south western part of the catchment could be a result of the occurrence of the local confining layers that were not included in the geological model horizontal hydraulic conductivity applied in the calibrated model ranged from 0 005 m d 1 in the miocene clay layers to 30 m d 1 in pleistocene sand fig 5 and was within the ranges used in the danish hydrogeological model for the middle jutland area højberg et al 2009 hydraulic conductivity used for the pleistocene sand is also close to the average horizontal hydraulic conductivity of 16 m d 1 measured near the lake kazmierczak et al 2016 groundwater entered the lake through three compartments 6312 m3 d 1 66 upwelled at the wetlands seepage faces at the western lake shore 632 m3 d 1 7 seeped through the gyttja layer and 2552 m3 d 1 27 discharged at the sandy lake bottom fig 10 the average seepage rate at the sandy lake bottom predicted by the model equaled 0 08 m d 1 simulated age of the groundwater discharging into the lake varied between approximately 5 to 200 years figs 11 and 12 the oldest groundwater predicted age 50 years discharged at three areas 1 western part of the lake through a thin gyttja layer 2 sandy lake bottom at the eastern side of the lake and 3 wetlands seepage faces in the area of the end points of the inlets the youngest groundwater age was predicted at the south western lake shore where most of the groundwater discharges fig 8 4 3 3 discharge distribution based on cl budget cl concentrations in the surface water were 25 mg cl l 1 in the lake water 25 mg cl l 1 in the three inlets and 23 mg cl l 1 at the outlet recharge from precipitation in jutland contained 15 mg cl l 1 hinsby and rasmussen 2008 cl concentrations in groundwater at the western and eastern lake shores averaged 18 and 37 mg l 1 respectively fig 12 to close the cl balance the average concentration of cl in the discharging groundwater must equal 24 8 mg l 1 which was achieved by mixing 65 of groundwater from the western side of the lake and 35 of groundwater from the eastern side 4 4 groundwater controlled dip loading 4 4 1 lake segment and integrated approach the yearly groundwater controlled dip loading into the lake estimated with the use of the lake segment approach method equaled 351 kg out of which 65 discharges from the southern side of the lake fig 8 if the eastern lake segments would be included in the calculation without deduction of the dip loading at the western and southern lake shores annual dip inputs into the lake would equal 475 kg yr 1 the yearly dip loading into the lake estimated by combining the simulated groundwater discharge section 4 3 2 fig 10 with the measured average dip concentrations in each of the zones of different chemical composition of groundwater fig 8 equaled 220 kg fig 13 a major part of the dip 2 5 to above 10 g d 1 m 2 discharged at the western wetlands seepage faces lake inlets and at the sandy lakebed groundwater controlled external dip loading in the central part of the lake covered by a thick gyttja layer was negligible although the dip concentration measured in the single well with a screen beneath the thick gyttja layer was 105 µg dip l 1 kazmierczak et al 2020 4 4 2 numerical approach 3d transport model the average dip concentrations measured in the aquifer near the lake were nearly uniform thus the dip release rate was calibrated against the average observed dip concentration of 60 µg l 1 the average simulated dip concentration in the groundwater was calculated for each tested release rate as simulated yearly mass output into the lake divided by the total simulated groundwater discharge the best fit between the simulated 58 1 µg l 1 and observed 60 µg l 1 average concentrations was achieved for the release rate of 0 14 µg dip l 1 d 1 the steady state conditions for the transport model were reached after simulation period of approximately 1000 years the simulated dip concentration in groundwater that discharged into the lake ranged between 5 and 330 µg l 1 fig 10 with the highest predicted dip concentrations below the thick gyttja layer in the northern part of the lake dip concentrations at the western seepage face ranged 5 to 25 µg l 1 and increased to 75 µg l 1 at the western near shore zone of the lake the concentration simulated at the location of the eastern piezometer transects was 25 to 100 µg l 1 and beneath the thick gyttja layer in the area of the single piezometer ranged 50 75 µg l 1 the yearly dip loading into the lake through the lake bottom inlets and the seepage faces equaled 267 kg the model simulated the highest dip inputs through the sandy lake bottom and the seepage faces fig 10 dip loading through a thick gyttja layer was 0 5 g d 1 despite of high dip concentrations 50 mg dip m 3 predicted in this part of an aquifer fig 10 5 discussion 5 1 groundwater controlled dip inputs estimation of nutrient inputs into lakes via groundwater is a challenging task lewandowski et al 2015 rosenberry et al 2015 lake væng is recharged approximately 75 3d flow model to 81 segment approach by groundwater thus a good understanding of the groundwater flow system adjacent to the lake was needed to estimate the groundwater driven geogenic dip loading into the lake groundwater discharge assessed by the lake segment approach would have been overestimated by 67 resulting in the increased annual dip loading if the method would not be adjusted to account for the identified groundwater flow beneath the lake and flow convergence zones kazmierczak et al 2016 kidmose et al 2013 the aquifer interacting with the lake is at a steady state the contribution of groundwater to the lake water balance and groundwater chemistry do not show significant temporary changes kazmierczak et al 2016 2020 these conditions allowed for simplifications and decreased uncertainty in the nutrient loading calculations as seasonal or annual fluctuations in dip concentrations were observed only at the sediment water interface and wetlands while dip concentration in the aquifer was stable kazmierczak et al 2020 flow conditions observed near the lake are simulated by a 3d flow model with a high degree of accuracy hydraulic heads near the lake match the measured values fig 9 simulated stream discharge agrees with observations 4 and water inflow to the lake varies only by 8 from the measured average discharge via the surface water outlet the average simulated seepage rate at the sandy lakebed of 0 08 m d 1 reflects the average measured seepage rates of approximately 0 02 to 0 25 m d 1 measured in this area with the use of seepage meters kazmierczak et al 2016 the differences may be explained by the fact that seepage meters measure discharge at a point 0 25 m2 while the simulated seepage is an average over a cell of 625 m2 the simulated high discharge zones are shifted north and south from the location of the offshore high discharge zone observed by kazmierczak et al 2016 kidmose et al 2013 and sebok et al 2013 figs 2 and 10 the offset may be explained by the following reasons 1 application of homogeneous hydraulic properties within the pleistocene erosional valley in the model eliminated the occurrence of the bodies of high hydraulic conductivity which often create preferential flow paths kishel and gerla 2002 2 the bottom of the gyttja was mapped based on eight gpr lines kidmose et al 2013 thus the exact geometry of this low permeable layer is not known while even small changes in the distribution of the clay bodies within the aquifer may significantly influence the flow system nield et al 1994 cl as a conservative tracer can be successfully used for the validation of flow models for shallow lakes turner and townley 2006 the simulated percentage distribution of groundwater discharge at the western 66 and eastern 37 side of lake væng was consistent with the distribution of groundwater discharge into the lake estimated based on the variation in the cl concentrations within the aquifer the average cl concentration of 25 mg l 1 measured in the water sampled at lake væng can be achieved by mixing 65 and 35 of groundwater with chemical composition characteristic for the western and eastern side of the lake respectively the 3d flow model for lake væng showed that 37 of groundwater flowing from west and south passes beneath the lake along the deep circulation flow paths and flows out at the eastern sandy lakebed figs 4 and 10 the estimate is close to the results of a 2d flow model presented by kazmierczak et al 2016 where 31 of groundwater flowing from the west passes beneath the lake and discharges at the eastern lake shore the complex flow system could not be represented in the lake segment approach which assumes that flow passing beneath the lake does not enter the surface water body rosenberry and labaugh 2008 the fraction of groundwater originating from the western and southern parts of the catchment and discharging at the flow convergence zone at the eastern lake shore kazmierczak et al 2016 could not be precisely estimated and deducted with the use of the lake segment approach the eastern segments were excluded from the calculation and all groundwater discharge accumulated at the western and southern lake shores thus the method can only be used for a rough estimation of water exchange between the aquifer and lake fig 8 the lake segment approach is also not suitable for the prediction of spatial variations in groundwater discharge rates which are important for the assessment of occurrence of the kinetic processes re bounding dip at the sediment water interface e g iron hydroxides vivianite and calcite precipitation or biogeochemical processes kazmierczak et al 2020 lewandowski et al 2015 the yearly dip loading into the lake with discharging groundwater estimated with the use of the three different methods is on the same order of magnitude and equals 351 220 and 267 kg dip yr 1 for the lake segment integrated and numerical approach respectively these values provide insight into the uncertainty of the estimated dip loading into the lake and may vary further by approximately 25 to 59 percent if the standard deviation from an average dip concentration at different hydrogeochemical zones is considered the dip inputs predicted with the use of the numerical modelling and the lake segment approach may be overestimated due to the simplifications used in both methods and the associated uncertainty in the lake segment approach groundwater inflow to the lake was overestimated by 24 and would have been overestimated by 67 if the eastern lake shoreline was included in the calculation the entire dip input is accumulated at the western and southern lake shore due to the method limitations bounding the groundwater recharge area to the discharge at the nearest lake shoreline rosenberry and labaugh 2008 while according to the results of 3d flow and transport modelling the dip loading is highest at the eastern sandy lakebed dip concentrations measured east of the lake are also slightly higher than at the western part in the lake segment approach the spatial variations in dip concentrations are included in the calculation except of the values measured at the eastern lake shore due to application of the field data within the corresponding segments while the estimated groundwater fluxes are only a rough approximation of the water exchange between aquifer and the lake fig 8 the 3d flow model predicts the total and spatial variations of groundwater discharge with high level of accuracy while the simulation of dip distribution within the aquifer is simplified due to the application of a homogeneous dip rate in the 3d transport model fig 10 the dip release rate is heterogeneous and depends on the hydrogeological and hydrochemical conditions in the aquifer kazmierczak et al 2020 lewandowski et al 2015 furthermore the exact extent of the terrace i where dip release takes place is not known precisely thus the simulated dip concentrations depend only on the groundwater flow rates while the influence of reaction kinetics and variations in the chemical composition of the sediments and groundwater are omitted the influence of the simplifications used in mt3dms model is visible in the simulated local distribution of dip concentrations solute transport models should be kept simple and cannot be expected to reproduce the observed concentrations with a high accuracy konikow 2011 compared to the measured values dip concentrations are underestimated at the western seepage face and in the area of a single piezometer installed below the thick gyttja layer overestimated at the northern part of the sandy lake bottom and match dip concentrations at the southern area of the sandy lake bottom thus the dip loading via the western seepage face and at the central part of the lake is likely underestimated and overestimated at the north eastern piezometer transects the difference is visible by comparing the distribution of the simulated dip loading fig 10 with that estimated using the integrated approach fig 13 no hydrochemical samples were taken from below the thick gyttja layer in the northern area of the lake where model predicts dip concentration up to 330 µg dip l 1 however the dip concentration was 105 µg dip l 1 below the thick gyttja layer at the central part of the lake kazmierczak et al 2020 and up to 424 µg dip l 1 at the eastern high discharge zone kidmose et al 2013 the approach integrating simulated water fluxes with the observed dip concentrations should therefore 1 result in an estimate of the groundwater controlled dip inputs into the lake associated with the lowest degree of uncertainty and 2 show the spatial distribution of dip loading with the highest accuracy fig 13 the integrated and numerical approaches contrary to the lake segment approach additionally allow for the prediction of the heterogeneities in the dip loading at the lakebed related to differences in distribution of the discharge rates and dip concentrations detailed 3d spatial hydrogeological information is important in the estimation of the loading of external geogenic dip into the lake since occurrence of hydrogeochemical processes re bounding dip at the sediment water interface depends on the groundwater discharge rate kazmierczak et al 2020 5 2 external dip inputs into lakes the integrated approach resulted in a loading of 220 kg dip yr 1 which equals 1 4 g dip m 2 yr 1 of the lake bottom this value compares well with the dip loading of 1 0 g dip m 2 yr 1 into the lake estimated in the 2d cross section by kazmierczak et al 2020 the difference may be a result of omitting the northern lake area in the 2d study where according to the numerical modelling and integrated approach high dip inputs may be expected figs 10 and 13 figs 10 and 13 a groundwater borne phosphorus loading at lake væng is at the higher end of the dip loading compiled from the literature that ranges 0 74 10 3 to 2 9 g m 2 yr 1 lewandowski et al 2015 for example external dip fluxes at lake eucha usa equal 0 047 g m 2 yr 1 with 24 originating from a wastewater treatment plant haggard et al 2005 likewise the 0 16 g dip m 2 yr 1 discharged with groundwater into lake arendsee germany is of both anthropogenic and geogenic origin meinikmann et al 2015 while groundwater delivered dip at lake væng is all of geogenic origin kazmierczak et al 2020 the dip discharge into lake væng is 1000 times higher than the input of 7 4 4 3 10 3 g dip m 2 yr 1 into the hypereutrophic shallow max depth of 4 m lake persimmon usa where phosphorus was the limiting nutrient kang et al 2005 and 10 times higher than the input of 0 1 g m 2 yr into eutrophic shallow max depth of 5 7 m nørresø denmark nisbeth et al 2019a 5 3 dip origin and its implications for lake eutrophication dip discharging into lake væng is of geogenic origin kazmierczak et al 2020 this is further confirmed by simulated age 70 years of the groundwater discharging into the lake which is prior to the common application of the n p k fertilizers on the arable lands cooke and williams 1973 the simulated distribution of the groundwater age compared well with variations in the cl concentrations within the aquifer concentration of cl in the uppermost 15 m of the aquifer at the western side of the lake is close to 15 mg cl l 1 a typical cl value in recharge water in jutland hinsby and rasmussen 2008 the simulated groundwater age in this area ranged between 5 and 25 years indicating shallow flow paths fig 12 groundwater sampled at the eastern side of the lake is enriched in cl due to the contact with the miocene marine clay deposits along the deep circulation flow paths hinsby and rasmussen 2008 kazmierczak et al 2016 it indicates that groundwater discharging at the eastern lake shore should be older than the groundwater flowing through the western seepage faces the simulated groundwater age reached up to 200 years below the gyttja sediments and at the eastern lake side figs 11 and 12 part of phosphorus present in the pleistocene aquifers including terrace i where further dip release occurred kazmierczak et al 2020 might have originated from marine miocene sediments the average dip concentration in the deep groundwater from marine miocene deposits 15 m a s l based on a few samples taken in the catchment is 61 µg l 1 figs 4 and 7 these deposits are effective reservoirs for phosphorus incorporated into the organic matter and mineral phases golterman 1973 föllmi 1996 and may be an additional source of geogenic dip the simulated dip release rate in the sediments of terrace i equals 0 14 µg dip per liter of water per day assuming a porosity of 0 3 and a sediment density of 1600 kg m 3 the dip release rate within the terrace i fig 4 equals 0 12 µg dip per kilogram of sediments per day the given release rate is overestimated since the groundwater discharging into the lake contains background dip from other geological sources in the catchment kazmierczak et al 2020 while the transport model does not include the external dip inflows into terrace i the background dip concentration was set to 0 mg l 1 the phosphorus sorption capacity of sandy sediments deposited in similar environments in sweden varies between 7 and 200 mg dip kg 1 carlsson and horkeby 1976 vanek 1993 thus the low dip release rate compared to the probable amount of phosphorus stored in the sediments of the terrace i can maintain the lake eutrophication for hundreds to thousands of years if the pool of the reductants in the aquifer kazmierczak et al 2020 is not exhausted the process of release and transport of geogenic dip towards the lake can be further extended due to re adsorption of part of dip onto iron hydroxides and or organic matter in the most recent sediments at the sediment water interface kazmierczak et al 2020 it would result in the movement of the contamination front towards the lake similar mechanisms controlling the transport of geogenic contaminants within the aquifer were described from the red river delta vietnam where the arsenic content in groundwater is correlated with the age of the sediments and volume of groundwater flushed through them over a time postma et al 2012 an average dip concentration in groundwater entering lake væng equals 60 µg l 1 figs 4 and 7 this concentration classifies the lake into the group of moderate ecological quality søndergaard et al 2005 in the period of 2007 2010 the tp concentration in the lake water ranged between 35 and 196 µg l 1 the seasonal deterioration and improvement of the lake water quality can be explained by temporally bounding of part of the groundwater delivered dip in the internal lake and wetland phosphorus cycles kazmierczak et al 2020 reddy et al 1999 the low phosphorus release rate in the aquifer resulting in the high dip concentrations in groundwater seems to be one of the factors responsible for the lake eutrophication over a scale of thousands of years this effect is additionally emphasized by dip inputs into the lake from anthropogenic sources until 1983 e g fertilizers sewage water and seasonal deterioration of the lake water quality due to the internal phosphorus cycling and explains the short lasting improvement of the lake water quality after the restoration attempts 6 conclusions lake water balance and groundwater controlled dip loading were estimated with the use of three methods based on data from the field surveys 1 lake segment 2 integrated and 3 numerical the calculated net mass loading is within the same order of magnitude for all methods however the integrated approach is associated with the lowest degree of uncertainty and therefore predicts the spatial distribution of the mass loading into the lake with the highest degree of accuracy the present study shows that cl can be successfully used to estimate the spatial distribution of groundwater discharge into the lake and to track flow paths even for the complex flow systems if a dense net of water sampling is applied low permeable gyttja layer acts as a barrier for the external geogenic dip loading despite high measured and simulated dip concentrations in groundwater beneath the lake actual contribution of these areas into annual groundwater driven dip loading is low this shows the importance of an integrated approach where 3d spatial hydrogeological information is used to understand the magnitude of transport pathways in the entire system such information can improve planning of the lake restoration attempts dip mobilization within the old lake bottom resulting in the high dip concentrations in groundwater seems to be the major factor responsible for continued lake eutrophication the low dip release rate in the aquifer and re adsorption of dip in the recent sediments combined nowadays with an additional dip inputs from the anthropogenic sources can lead to the lake eutrophication over a period of thousands of years credit authorship

4492,the estimation of groundwater driven lacustrine dissloved inorganic phosphorus dip loading is a challenging task associated with uncertainties related to simplifications used in the empirical and numerical methods a multi disciplinary approach can result in a better understanding of a system and therefore the improved estimate of external dip loading into lakes groundwater discharge and dip loading to a naturally eutrophic lake were estimated using three methods based on field measurements 1 the lake segment approach 2 three dimensional 3d flow and transport modelling and 3 integrating mapped water chemistry with the 3d flow model field measurements and 3d flow modelling show the groundwater contribution to the lake water budget 75 81 the in situ measured spatial distribution of the groundwater discharge rate based on seepage meters and a conservative tracer cl budget approach is well reproduced by the 3d flow model dip fluxes between the aquifer and the surface water vary between 220 and 351 kg yr 1 the integrated approach is associated with the lowest degree of uncertainty and therefore predicts the spatial distribution of the mass loading into the lake with the highest degree of accuracy 3d hydrological information is crucial to estimate the magnitude of dip transport despite the high measured and simulated dip concentration in groundwater beneath gyttja covering the lake bottom the actual contribution of this area into annual groundwater driven dip loading is low due to low groundwater discharge rates dip loading is concentrated instead in the narrow littoral high discharge zones low release rate of dip within the old lake bottom 0 14 µg l 1 predicted with the use of the zero order release term in mt3dms results in a high average dip concentration in the groundwater 60 µg l 1 and is one of the major factors responsible for the long term lake eutrophication keywords groundwater lake interactions phosphorus loading numerical modelling lake eutrophication 1 introduction lake eutrophication can be a result of phosphorus inputs with discharging groundwater brock et al 1982 kang et al 2005 kazmierczak et al 2020 nisbeth et al 2019a even low groundwater fluxes into a lake may transport significant amounts of nutrients labaugh et al 2000 shaw et al 1990 phosphorus often originates from external anthropogenic sources hagaard et al 2005 heathwaite and dils 2000 parkhurst et al 2003 albeit external geogenic phosphorus loading into lakes was also recently reported ala aho et al 2013 kazmierczak et al 2020 meinikmann et al 2015 while the lake restoration attempts aim only at the reduction of internal phosphorus recycling from lake sediments jeppesen et al 1990 thus an understanding of the groundwater lake interactions and associated sources of external dip inputs prior to lake restoration attempts is of major importance kazmierczak et al 2020 nisbeth et al 2019b the estimation of groundwater discharge to lakes and the related nutrient loading is however a challenging task and may require multiple inter disciplinary approaches lewandowski et al 2015 rosenberry et al 2015 water and nutrient fluxes between aquifer and lake can be quantified lewandowski et al 2015 1 directly as the product of discharge rates and nutrient concentrations measured with the use of seepage meters belanger et al 1985 2 by the application of the lake segment approach meinikmann et al 2013 rosenberry and labaugh 2008 using hydraulic head gradients and nutrient concentrations observed in a net of piezometers around the lake kang et al 2005 meinikmann et al 2015 3 with the use of numerical modelling based on empirical data kidmose et al 2014 parkhurst et al 2003 each of the methods is associated with some degree of uncertainty installation of seepage meters may lead to changes in the redox conditions at the sediment water interface and therefore to phosphorus mobilization due to the reduction of iron hydroxides belanger et al 1985 thus phosphorus loading estimated with the use of seepage meters may often be overestimated the phosphorus inputs calculated based on water samples taken from piezometers can also be over underestimated since phosphorus concentrations along the lake shoreline may differ significantly depending on the location of the well meinikmann et al 2015 vanek 1991 numerical modelling is based on data collected in the field but associated with uncertainties due to the simplifications or assumptions used in the flow and transport models as well as the uncertainties connected to the data collection kidmose et al 2014 phosphorus inputs to a lake depend on lewandowski et al 2015 1 the dip release rates from anthropogenic and natural sources hagaard et al 2005 2 redox conditions and groundwater chemistry within the aquifer kazmierczak et al 2020 3 the flow velocity regulating the time available for chemical reactions within the aquifer and at the sediment water interface buso et al 2009 kazmierczak et al 2020 therefore an approach integrating multiple techniques for a good understanding of the flow system and the hydrogeochemical processes taking place in the aquifer and at the sediment water interface is needed for a reliable prediction of the groundwater controlled nutrient loading into lakes kidmose et al 2014 the present study was conducted at the eutrophic lake væng denmark where two earlier attempts of biomanipulation in the periods 1986 1988 and 2007 2009 by reduction of the roach and bream population only brought short term positive effects jeppesen et al 1990 2012 søndergaard et al 1990 the increase of total phosphorus tp concentrations shortly after the restoration attempts is an effect of input of dissolved inorganic phosphorus dip of geogenic origin by the groundwater discharging into the lake kazmierczak et al 2020 the high seepage rates of anoxic groundwater going into the lake kazmierczak et al 2016 combined with a continuous release of dip from iron hydroxides and calcite in the aquifer prevent a retention of dip at the aquifer lake interface and at the adjacent wetlands and lead to the natural lake eutrophication kazmierczak et al 2020 the lake eutrophication is further enhanced by a seasonal release of geogenic dip annual in lake dip cycle stored at the aquifer lake interface in the areas with low seepage rates kazmierczak et al 2020 the objectives of this study were 1 to estimate groundwater controlled dip fluxes into the lake by integrating field observations with numerical modelling 2 to compare different methods for estimation of nutrient loading into the lake and address their uncertainties 3 to describe the influence of the external geogenic dip sources on lake eutrophication the study demonstrates that combining field studies with numerical modelling is needed to assess not only the total loading of dip into the lake but also its spatial distribution and geogenic sources of dip in the aquifer system lake væng with a groundwater contribution to the lake water budget exceeding 70 kazmierczak et al 2016 kidmose et al 2013 represents an end member setting for groundwater dominated lakes rosenberry et al 2015 however the release and transport of geogenic dip may have implications for groundwater lake systems in various settings ala aho et al 2013 heathwaite and dils 2000 kazmierczak et al 2020 mcginley et al 2016 meinikmann et al 2015 understanding the geogenic dip release patterns is crucial for post glacial environments where anoxic aquifers intersect the surface ala aho et al 2013 kazmierczak et al 2020 nisbeth et al 2019a 2 site hydrogeology and hydrochemistry lake væng is a eutrophic groundwater dominated lake kidmose et al 2013 located in the gudenå river catchment central jutland denmark fig 1 the lake has three minor inlets located in the northern area and one major outlet located in the southern end fig 2 the miocene pleistocene aquifer interacting with the lake consists of 1 sands and gravels of the pleistocene erosional valley unit 1 2 sands gravels unit 2 and clays unit 3 of the previous glacial interglacial periods 3 sand rich unit 4 coal bearing unit 5 deposits of the fluvial miocene environments 4 sands unit 4 and clays unit 5 of the marine miocene formations houmark nielsen 1999 2011 rasmussen et al 2010 fig 3 the western part of the lake bottom is covered with a holocene low permeable gyttja layer of thickness up to 11 5 m kazmierczak et al 2016 the hydrogeology and hydrochemistry of the aquifer near lake væng were described in detail in kazmierczak et al 2016 2020 and kidmose et al 2013 the aquifer interacting with the lake is at a steady state and unconfined except of local areas confined by the miocene clay layers the amplitude in the hydraulic heads in 93 of piezometers located near the lake was below 10 cm in the period from september 2011 to november 2013 the lake stage varied from 26 34 to 26 42 m above sea level m a s l groundwater in the lake catchment flows from west and south west towards east and north east a thick gyttja layer acts as a flow barrier at the lake bottom thus part of the groundwater flowing from the west and south passes beneath the lake and discharges at the sandy lake bottom at the opposite side of the lake where high discharge zones and groundwater springs with a discharge of up to 7 m d 1 were observed fig 4 during the study period of 2011 to 2013 the average precipitation in an area of 10 10 km surrounding the lake estimated using a climate model of the danish meteorological institute scharling 1999 was 785 mm yr 1 the estimated recharge of the aquifer equaled 378 mm yr 1 geus 2003 measured discharge from the lake averages 13 7 103 m3 d 1 an average water inflow from the three inlets going from west to east equaled 1 103 1 1 103 and 1 1 103 m3 d 1 based on the recharge value from the danish water resources model geus 2003 net precipitation contributes 165 m3 d 1 thus groundwater inflow to the lake is roughly 10 5 103 m3 d 1 the sediments of the pleistocene erosional valley were deposited within two terraces 1 older terrace ii with top at the elevation of approximately 40 m a s l and 2 younger terrace i with top at the elevation of approximately 30 m a s l fig 4 terrace i is a source of dip released from iron hydroxides in an anoxic zone and discharged into the lake the remaining geogenic dip sources are calcite in the oxic part of an aquifer miocene brown coal layers and miocene marine deposits fig 4 the thickness of the oxic zone in the aquifer varies between 1 to 7 m at the eastern and western lake shore respectively and decreases to 0 m at the groundwater discharge points wetlands seepage faces and the lakebed fig 4 high groundwater discharge rates into the lake prevent the oxygen diffusion into sediment water interface and consequently re bounding of dip onto iron hydroxides and result in the direct loading of an external geogenic dip into the lake kazmierczak et al 2020 the total phosphorus tp concentrations in the lake water estimated by anderson and odgaard 1994 based on diatom studies of the upper 0 5 m of the lakebed sediments representing approximately the last 250 years vary between 115 and 160 µg l 1 and indicate that the lake was already eutrophic in the 18th century the highest tp content in the lake water was after 1950 and was attributed to the common application of fertilizers in agriculture and to the discharge of sewage water into the lake in the period from 1964 to 1983 the lake catchment comprises mainly of arable land 67 and forests 20 the remaining 13 is covered with sand extraction sites 3 urban areas and roads 6 wetlands 2 and grasslands 2 fig 1 3 methods dip loading into lake væng was estimated with the use of 1 lake segment approach section 3 1 2 integrated approach combination of 3d flow model with measured dip concentrations section 3 2 and 3 numerical approach 3d flow and transport model section 3 3 the approaches employ the hydrogeological and hydrogeochemical data collected during the period 2011 2013 as presented in kazmierczak et al 2016 2020 the methods applied in the field are listed in section 3 4 3 1 lake segment approach flow between lake væng and the adjacent aquifer was estimated using the lake segment approach rosenberry and labaugh 2008 the approach assumes that groundwater discharging at the shoreline of each lake segment originates from the groundwater flow through the adjacent part of the catchment rosenberry and labaugh 2008 however groundwater that discharges at the eastern side of lake væng originates from the western and southern part of the catchment kazmierczak et al 2016 fig 4 according to two dimensional modelling studies by kidmose et al 2013 and kazmierczak et al 2016 the volume of groundwater discharge at the eastern lake side equaled 48 51 and 31 respectively of the groundwater recharged in the western part of the catchment therefore classification of flow paths originating from west and south west into one discharging at the western and eastern lake segments is associated with a high degree of uncertainty furthermore the distribution of the regional flow paths from the western part of the catchment is governed by the spatial variability in hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer and lakebed thus the flow conditions do not follow the assumptions behind the segment approach rosenberry and labaugh 2008 and the eastern lake shore being a convergence zone of groundwater flowing under the lake kazmierczak et al 2016 was omitted in the calculation all groundwater flow was assumed to discharge at the remaining part of the lake shoreline which was divided into three segments the location of the border between the flow convergence zone and the remaining segments is an additional source of the uncertainty in the segment approach groundwater in the northern segment discharges mostly through the inlets thus groundwater input in this area was assumed to be equal to the net flow in the inlets groundwater flow through the segments was calculated from the darcy s equation 1 q k l s t h piezometer h lake

kazmierczak et al 2016 was used in the discharge calculation principal component analysis pca can be used to identify underlying patterns in multivariate datasets karan et al 2017 tetzlaff et al 2009 in this study the distribution of the major ions alkalinity hco3 calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 sodium na potassium k chloride cl sulfate so4 2 and nitrate no3 in water samples collected at various depths and locations around the lake kazmierczak et al 2016 2020 was analyzed with the use of pca and visualized as a biplot to differentiate water samples thereby it was possible to outline areas of the aquifer where the chemical composition of groundwater was similar and therefore should be formed under similar hydrogeochemical processes described in kazmierczak et al 2016 2020 and have a uniform average dip concentration the aquifer interacting with the lake is hydrologically at steady state kazmierczak et al 2016 the dip concentrations excluding seasonal fluctuations at the sediment water interface and seepage faces at the wetlands were not subjected to annual or seasonal changes kazmierczak et al 2020 the groundwater controlled dip loading into the lake with discharging groundwater was estimated by multiplying water fluxes at each segment with an average dip concentration characteristic for that segment 3 2 integrated approach 3 2 1 groundwater catchment the exact borders of the groundwater catchment of lake væng were delineated based on the analysis of 1 the distribution of the hydraulic heads in the miocene pleistocene aquifer 2 geomorphological data 3 location of lakes and rivers and 4 results of the 2d regional modflow modelling kazmierczak et al 2016 fig 2 the data sets covering an area of 10 10 km were integrated and analyzed in arcgis esri iso potential lines in the miocene pleistocene aquifer were interpolated from the water levels measured from 2011 to 2013 in 11 catchment wells 5 lakes 5 streams and the net of piezometers installed near the lake kazmierczak et al 2016 2020 combined with archive data on hydraulic heads in 200 wells geus 2010 the archive data covered a period of up to approximately 100 years for each well the average hydraulic head was calculated excluding hydraulic heads measured during groundwater extraction at the waterworks the digital elevation model dem was used to delineate the topographic catchments of lakes and rivers a preliminary outline of the groundwater catchment of lake væng was based on the hydraulic head distribution and the results of the 2d regional flow model kazmierczak et al 2016 in the final step the catchment borders were defined based on the distribution of the pleistocene erosional valleys and the topographic catchments of the lakes and streams in the analyzed area 3 2 2 geological model a

2016 and profiling of the sand pit figs 1 and 2 gpr data were used to map the distribution of the organic sediments at the lake bottom and at the adjacent wetlands the borders of the pleistocene erosional valley were delineated based on the dem ert and borehole data 3 2 3 groundwater flow and age model a three dimensional 3d steady state flow model for the groundwater catchment of lake væng for the period from september 2011 to november 2013 was set up using modflow harbaugh et al 2000 fig 5 the bottom of the model corresponded to the top of the lowermost clay horizon horizon 1 in the geological model the bottom of the model and the vertical boundaries of the catchment were specified as a no flow boundary condition the top of the model was interpolated to the 5 5 m dem and the bathymetric map of the sandy lake bottom below the gyttja layer the aquifer lake interactions were simulated using the general head boundary ghb package the thickness of the gyttja layer considered as in lake sediments was incorporated into the conductance term in the ghb cells the drain package was used to represent the wetlands seepage faces adjacent to the lake the inlets of the lake were simulated in the stream package distribution of the hydrogeological units within the grid was mapped from the 3d geological model fig 3 according to højberg et al 2009 the anisotropy of pleistocene clays is higher than other geological formations thus vertical anisotropy in the hydraulic conductivity was set to 10 for the pleistocene clay unit and as 3 for the remaining units an anisotropy of 2 3 was used in similar pleistocene sandy aquifers by hinsby et al 2007 and kidmose et al 2011 horizontal discretization was 25 25 m near the lake and 50 50 m in the remaining part of the catchment the model consisted of 20 numerical layers a recharge of 9 10 4 m d 1 328 mm yr 1 equal to that used by kazmierczak et al 2016 was assigned to the uppermost active cells during the field work in 2011 to 2013 seasonal ponds which are indicators of perched aquifers were frequently observed in the catchment this was probably due to the common occurrence of clay layers in the uppermost part of the pleistocene deposits therefore the applied recharge was set 50 mm yr 1 lower than the estimate of the regional danish water resources model geus 2003 the model was calibrated by the trial and error method recharge and vertical anisotropy of hydraulic conductivity were kept constant during the calibration horizontal hydraulic conductivities in the hydrogeological units and conductance in the cells representing the lake seepage faces and inlets were adjusted to reach the best agreement between the simulated and observed 1 hydraulic heads in 32 points 2 flow in the inlets 3 flow in the outlet equal to total inflow to the lake and 4 measured seepage rates at the sandy eastern lake bottom kazmierczak et al 2016 horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the sand and gravel was tested within the range 0 01 176 m d 1 that covered the values measured by kazmierczak et al 2016 root mean square error rmse calculated after each model run was used for the calibration assessment 2 rmse 1 n h obs h sim 2 where hobs is observed hydraulic head hsim is simulated hydraulic head and n is number of data points the age of dip enriched groundwater discharging into the lake and indirectly the timing of the aquifer recharge pre or post introduction of fertilizers into farming were estimated by adding the 3d age distribution model to the 3d flow model the mean groundwater age in the aquifer time from when recharge reached the water table was simulated using mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 and following engesgaard and molson 1998 to directly simulate the groundwater age in a shallow sandy aquifer in denmark a zero order production term of 1 was assigned to all active cells to represent the aging of groundwater with one day per day longitudinal and transverse dispersivities were set to zero the age of water recharging the aquifer was 0 the model was run for 5000 years to reach steady state conditions 3 2 4 model validation the simulated percentage distribution of discharge into the lake was validated against the spatial distribution of discharge into the lake that was estimated with the use of the average cl concentrations in groundwater and surface water low amplitudes in hydraulic heads and small variations of chemical composition of groundwater sampled in the same area of the aquifer during different time periods kazmierczak et al 2016 2020 indicate that the aquifer interacting with lake væng is at the steady state additionally recharge to the aquifer by leakage of water from the lake is negligible kazmierczak et al 2016 thus the contribution of groundwater from the western and eastern side of the lake to the lake water budget was estimated from the following equations 3 q l q i p q 4 q l c l q i c i p c p q c 5 q c q w c w q e c e where ql is total measured outflow from the lake m3 d 1 cl is chloride concentration in the lake mg l 1 qi is total measured water inflow from the three inlets m3 d 1 ci is an average chloride concentration in the three inlets mg l 1 p is recharge from precipitation precipitation evaporation at the lake surface m3 d 1 pc is chloride concentration in recharge mg l 1 q is a total groundwater discharge m3 d 1 c is an average chloride concentration in the groundwater discharging into the lake mg l 1 qw is groundwater discharge at the western side of the lake m3 d 1 cw is chloride concentration at the western side of the lake mg l 1 qe is groundwater discharge at the eastern side of the lake m3 d 1 and ce is chloride concentration at the eastern side of the lake mg l 1 3 2 5 dip loading in the final step the groundwater controlled dip input into the lake was estimated by combining the results of the 3d flow modelling and the field observations the simulated groundwater discharge at each cell was multiplied with an average dip concentration characteristic for the respective area of the aquifer 3 3 numerical approach mobilization of dip from the old lake bottom terrace i and loading into the lake were simulated in mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 the transport model was based on the developed 3d flow model the anoxic groundwater sampled from the catchment wells and the piezometers located at terrace ii contains on average 18 to 61 µg dip l 1 figs 4 and 7 on the catchment scale the dip concentration varies distinctly fig 7 with no clear patterns in the concentration changes kazmierczak et al 2020 and the data on dip concentration in the deeper parts of the miocene marine aquifers 15 m a s l source 2 in fig 4 are scarce while a clear trend of dip release near the lake in the sediments of terrace i exists and is supported by extensive data kazmierczak et al 2020 thus for pragmatic reasons these local dip changes at the catchment scale were not represented in the regional transport model and a dip concentration of 0 mg l 1 was assigned to all active cells as an initial condition the simplification can be further justified by the use of the dip transport model to estimate an annual dip loading into the lake and not the detailed description of geogenic dip circulation in the catchment mobilization of dip within the terrace i dip release rate in mg per liter of water within the cell per day was simulated in the chemical reaction package as a zero order release term the release rate of dip was assigned to the cells representing pleistocene sand and gravel near the lake with the top located below 30 m a s l cells corresponding to terrace i figs 4 and 5 and adjusted to fit an average dip concentration measured in the anoxic groundwater discharging into the lake fig 4 longitudinal and transverse dispersivities were set to zero and kept constant during the calibration 3 4 field surveys 3 4 1 catchment hydrogeology in total 106 stainless steel piezometers were installed in the vicinity of lake væng kazmierczak et al 2016 fig 2 the screening depth of the piezometers varied between 2 and 28 m below the terrain surface 91 piezometers were aligned in transects w and e1 e4 perpendicular to the western and eastern lake shore respectively piezometer e2 1 was installed in the middle of the lake below an 11 m thick gyttja layer eight shallow near shore piezometers s1 s8 were installed on land around the lake kazmierczak et al 2016 2020 six additional piezometers not presented in previous studies were installed in the lake catchment of these two in the sand pit fig 2 nine push down wells p1 p9 used for multi level hydrogeochemical sampling were placed around the lake in the areas of high groundwater discharge kazmierczak et al 2016 2020 fig 2 data collected from already existing wells geus 2010 kidmose et al 2013 were also included in the analysis hydraulic heads were measured at each piezometer three to ten times after the installation and with at least monthly time step horizontal hydraulic conductivities kh were calculated with the hvorslev 1951 analytical solution for unconfined aquifers using data from the falling head slug tests conducted in all installed piezometers kazmierczak et al 2016 distribution and rates of groundwater discharge at the sandy lake bottom were measured using seepage meters temperature profiles distributed temperature sensing and ice holes mapping kazmierczak et al 2016 kidmose et al 2013 sebok et al 2013 the water stage at lake væng was measured 12 times in the period of september 2011 to november 2013 and at the inlets and outlet of the lake once in april 2012 discharge in the inlets and outlet was monitored monthly from february to november 2013 with the ott acoustic digital current meter kazmierczak et al 2016 ott hydromet gmbh 2013 3 4 2 groundwater chemistry water samples for chemical analysis were taken from selected catchment wells 11 all piezometers hydrogeochemical profiles and five seepage meters kazmierczak et al 2020 additional 10 groundwater samples not presented in the previous studies were taken in september 2012 from the off shore piezometers k4 k6 k8 k10 k11 k12 k13 k14 k17 k18 installed by kidmose et al 2013 fig 2 the three inlets and the outlet were sampled in november 2011 the lake water was sampled in november 2011 august 2012 and september 2013 detailed description of sampling and analysis methods is given in kazmierczak et al 2020 electrical conductivity ec ph dissolved oxygen do alkalinity hco3 and ferrous iron fe2 were measured in the field in the laboratory the water was analyzed for calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 sodium na potassium k total iron fe2 3 manganese mn2 ammonium nh4 chloride cl sulfate so4 2 nitrate no3 nitrite no2 and dissolved inorganic phosphorus dip concentrations kazmierczak et al 2020 4 results 4 1 catchment hydrogeology the groundwater catchment of lake væng is 13 km2 and its borders were defined by the groundwater divides of the streams and lakes located in the pleistocene erosional valleys a major part of the catchment was located west and south west from the lake where the unsaturated zone reached a thickness of up to approximately 80 m fig 2 the catchment consisted of 1 sand and gravel of the pleistocene erosional valley terraces i and ii in fig 4 unit 1 horizon 13 2 sand and gravel of pre weichselian glacial interglacial periods unit 2 horizons 12 10 and 8 3 clay layers of pre weichselian glacial interglacial periods unit 3 horizons 11 and 9 4 miocene fluvial lagoonal marine sand and gravel unit 4 horizons 2 4 and 6 5 miocene fluvial lagoonal marine clay and coal unit 5 horizons 1 3 5 and 7 fig 3 miocene sediments of the different depositional environments were interbedded rasmussen et al 2010 and thus combined within unit 4 high permeable deposits and 5 low permeable deposits the bottom of the model was represented by the clay layer horizon 1 detected in 5 deep boreholes and ert profiles at the elevation of 3 5 to 14 m a s l geus 2010 kidmose et al 2013 the miocene pleistocene sequence reached a thickness of up to 150 m in the south western part of the catchment fig 3 the clay horizons occurred only locally except of horizon 5 represented by clay and coal layers detected at an elevation of 29 5 to 56 m a s l in 15 boreholes in the north eastern part of the catchment older deposits horizons 3 12 were eroded during the weichselian glaciation and replaced by the upper pleistocene and holocene deposits the aquifer that interacted with the lake was mostly unconfined and only locally confined by the miocene clay and coal layers of horizon 5 hydraulic heads in the aquifer ranged between 49 8 and 26 4 m a s l in comparison the lake stage varied from 26 34 to 26 42 m a s l 4 2 hydrochemical zones and dip concentrations near the lake in the principal component analysis the first and second principal components explained 57 of the variability observed in the chemical dataset ca2 cl and na had the highest loadings 0 90 0 83 and 0 79 respectively along the first principal component while k mg2 and no3 had the highest loadings along the second principal component with loadings of 0 69 0 63 and 0 57 respectively fig 6 the biplot on fig 6 shows that groundwater samples on the eastern side of the lake are mostly located along the first principal component samples from transects e3 and e4 and piezometers p3 p7 are clearly delineated from the rest of the samples based on their ca2 cl and na composition other samples from the eastern part of the lake are also characterized by their hco3 mg2 and so4 2 concentration groundwater samples from the western part of the lake display a higher variability on the biplot fig 6 with low concentrations of ca2 cl and na principal component analysis showed that groundwater in the area of lake væng could be classified in general into three groups of the different chemical composition of groundwater fig 6 groundwater in the western part of the aquifer had low ec groundwater at the eastern side of the lake was enriched in na and cl and in the north eastern side of the lake additionally in ca2 and hco3 the chemical composition of the surface water lake three inlets and outlet fell between these three groups fig 6 the lowest dip concentrations were found in the shallow catchment wells with screen placed 15 m a s l on average 15 µg dip l 1 and piezometers located furthest upstream from the lake shore on average 22 µg dip l 1 fig 7 thus the background dip concentration in the uppermost anoxic pleistocene aquifer averaged 18 µg l 1 fig 4 wells with screens in the miocene marine deposits had an average groundwater dip concentration of 61 µg l 1 the average dip concentration in the oxic zone was 44 µg l 1 fig 4 anoxic groundwater that discharged into the lake was further enriched in dip along the flow lines after crossing the border between terrace ii and i that represented the interface between late pleistocene glacial post glacial sediments and early holocene lacustrine fluvial sediments kazmierczak et al 2016 2020 fig 4 the average dip concentration in the anoxic part of the aquifer was calculated separately for the near shore area of each of the three zones distinguished based on the differences in groundwater chemistry groundwater of the shallower circulation flow paths at the western side of the lake terrace i contained 54 30 µg dip l 1 groundwater of the deep circulation flow paths that discharged at the eastern shore contained 56 33 µg dip l 1 in the north eastern area and 68 17 µg dip l 1 in the south eastern area and at the offshore high discharge zone figs 4 and 7 4 3 groundwater flow and discharge distribution 4 3 1 lake segment approach groundwater discharge estimates based on the lake segment approach method equaled 16900 m3 d 1 with 3215 m3 d 1 19 flowing into the lake from the segment encompassing three inlets and 13685 m3 d 1 81 discharging directly through the aquifer lake interface fig 8 the fraction of the groundwater of the 13685 m3 d 1 that passed beneath the lake and discharged at the eastern lake shore could not be distinguished in the lake segment approach however based on the 2d models kazmierczak et al 2016 kidmose et al 2013 31 to 51 of groundwater originating from south and west that discharges at the eastern convergence zone amounted to 4242 to 6979 m3 d 1 the estimated inflow into the lake exceeded the measured outflow from the lake by only 24 the groundwater inflow into the lake would be further overestimated if the eastern lake segments were included in the calculation without subsequent deduction of the discharge fraction at the western and southern lake segments flow via the eastern shoreline estimated using the hydraulic gradients and conductivity in that area and equation 1 equaled 5842 m3 d 1 included in the calculation it would increase the total groundwater inflow into the lake to 22742 m3 d 1 4 3 2 numerical approach 3d flow model simulated daily discharge into the lake equaled 12595 m3 d 1 3098 m3 d 1 flowed into the lake through the three inlets 9496 m3 d 1 75 was discharging groundwater and 146 m3 d 1 was from precipitation the simulated inflow was 8 lower than the observed outflow from the lake flow in the inlets was simulated with an accuracy of 4 the model calibration resulted in the root mean square error rmse value of 0 4 m for head observations the relatively high rmse was due to difference between simulated and observed heads in the south western area of the catchment where simulated heads were underestimated by up to 7 m compared to the archive measurements from 1970 s while in the near lake area the simulated heads matched the heads measured in the period 2011 to 2013 fig 9 the offset in the south western part of the catchment could be a result of the occurrence of the local confining layers that were not included in the geological model horizontal hydraulic conductivity applied in the calibrated model ranged from 0 005 m d 1 in the miocene clay layers to 30 m d 1 in pleistocene sand fig 5 and was within the ranges used in the danish hydrogeological model for the middle jutland area højberg et al 2009 hydraulic conductivity used for the pleistocene sand is also close to the average horizontal hydraulic conductivity of 16 m d 1 measured near the lake kazmierczak et al 2016 groundwater entered the lake through three compartments 6312 m3 d 1 66 upwelled at the wetlands seepage faces at the western lake shore 632 m3 d 1 7 seeped through the gyttja layer and 2552 m3 d 1 27 discharged at the sandy lake bottom fig 10 the average seepage rate at the sandy lake bottom predicted by the model equaled 0 08 m d 1 simulated age of the groundwater discharging into the lake varied between approximately 5 to 200 years figs 11 and 12 the oldest groundwater predicted age 50 years discharged at three areas 1 western part of the lake through a thin gyttja layer 2 sandy lake bottom at the eastern side of the lake and 3 wetlands seepage faces in the area of the end points of the inlets the youngest groundwater age was predicted at the south western lake shore where most of the groundwater discharges fig 8 4 3 3 discharge distribution based on cl budget cl concentrations in the surface water were 25 mg cl l 1 in the lake water 25 mg cl l 1 in the three inlets and 23 mg cl l 1 at the outlet recharge from precipitation in jutland contained 15 mg cl l 1 hinsby and rasmussen 2008 cl concentrations in groundwater at the western and eastern lake shores averaged 18 and 37 mg l 1 respectively fig 12 to close the cl balance the average concentration of cl in the discharging groundwater must equal 24 8 mg l 1 which was achieved by mixing 65 of groundwater from the western side of the lake and 35 of groundwater from the eastern side 4 4 groundwater controlled dip loading 4 4 1 lake segment and integrated approach the yearly groundwater controlled dip loading into the lake estimated with the use of the lake segment approach method equaled 351 kg out of which 65 discharges from the southern side of the lake fig 8 if the eastern lake segments would be included in the calculation without deduction of the dip loading at the western and southern lake shores annual dip inputs into the lake would equal 475 kg yr 1 the yearly dip loading into the lake estimated by combining the simulated groundwater discharge section 4 3 2 fig 10 with the measured average dip concentrations in each of the zones of different chemical composition of groundwater fig 8 equaled 220 kg fig 13 a major part of the dip 2 5 to above 10 g d 1 m 2 discharged at the western wetlands seepage faces lake inlets and at the sandy lakebed groundwater controlled external dip loading in the central part of the lake covered by a thick gyttja layer was negligible although the dip concentration measured in the single well with a screen beneath the thick gyttja layer was 105 µg dip l 1 kazmierczak et al 2020 4 4 2 numerical approach 3d transport model the average dip concentrations measured in the aquifer near the lake were nearly uniform thus the dip release rate was calibrated against the average observed dip concentration of 60 µg l 1 the average simulated dip concentration in the groundwater was calculated for each tested release rate as simulated yearly mass output into the lake divided by the total simulated groundwater discharge the best fit between the simulated 58 1 µg l 1 and observed 60 µg l 1 average concentrations was achieved for the release rate of 0 14 µg dip l 1 d 1 the steady state conditions for the transport model were reached after simulation period of approximately 1000 years the simulated dip concentration in groundwater that discharged into the lake ranged between 5 and 330 µg l 1 fig 10 with the highest predicted dip concentrations below the thick gyttja layer in the northern part of the lake dip concentrations at the western seepage face ranged 5 to 25 µg l 1 and increased to 75 µg l 1 at the western near shore zone of the lake the concentration simulated at the location of the eastern piezometer transects was 25 to 100 µg l 1 and beneath the thick gyttja layer in the area of the single piezometer ranged 50 75 µg l 1 the yearly dip loading into the lake through the lake bottom inlets and the seepage faces equaled 267 kg the model simulated the highest dip inputs through the sandy lake bottom and the seepage faces fig 10 dip loading through a thick gyttja layer was 0 5 g d 1 despite of high dip concentrations 50 mg dip m 3 predicted in this part of an aquifer fig 10 5 discussion 5 1 groundwater controlled dip inputs estimation of nutrient inputs into lakes via groundwater is a challenging task lewandowski et al 2015 rosenberry et al 2015 lake væng is recharged approximately 75 3d flow model to 81 segment approach by groundwater thus a good understanding of the groundwater flow system adjacent to the lake was needed to estimate the groundwater driven geogenic dip loading into the lake groundwater discharge assessed by the lake segment approach would have been overestimated by 67 resulting in the increased annual dip loading if the method would not be adjusted to account for the identified groundwater flow beneath the lake and flow convergence zones kazmierczak et al 2016 kidmose et al 2013 the aquifer interacting with the lake is at a steady state the contribution of groundwater to the lake water balance and groundwater chemistry do not show significant temporary changes kazmierczak et al 2016 2020 these conditions allowed for simplifications and decreased uncertainty in the nutrient loading calculations as seasonal or annual fluctuations in dip concentrations were observed only at the sediment water interface and wetlands while dip concentration in the aquifer was stable kazmierczak et al 2020 flow conditions observed near the lake are simulated by a 3d flow model with a high degree of accuracy hydraulic heads near the lake match the measured values fig 9 simulated stream discharge agrees with observations 4 and water inflow to the lake varies only by 8 from the measured average discharge via the surface water outlet the average simulated seepage rate at the sandy lakebed of 0 08 m d 1 reflects the average measured seepage rates of approximately 0 02 to 0 25 m d 1 measured in this area with the use of seepage meters kazmierczak et al 2016 the differences may be explained by the fact that seepage meters measure discharge at a point 0 25 m2 while the simulated seepage is an average over a cell of 625 m2 the simulated high discharge zones are shifted north and south from the location of the offshore high discharge zone observed by kazmierczak et al 2016 kidmose et al 2013 and sebok et al 2013 figs 2 and 10 the offset may be explained by the following reasons 1 application of homogeneous hydraulic properties within the pleistocene erosional valley in the model eliminated the occurrence of the bodies of high hydraulic conductivity which often create preferential flow paths kishel and gerla 2002 2 the bottom of the gyttja was mapped based on eight gpr lines kidmose et al 2013 thus the exact geometry of this low permeable layer is not known while even small changes in the distribution of the clay bodies within the aquifer may significantly influence the flow system nield et al 1994 cl as a conservative tracer can be successfully used for the validation of flow models for shallow lakes turner and townley 2006 the simulated percentage distribution of groundwater discharge at the western 66 and eastern 37 side of lake væng was consistent with the distribution of groundwater discharge into the lake estimated based on the variation in the cl concentrations within the aquifer the average cl concentration of 25 mg l 1 measured in the water sampled at lake væng can be achieved by mixing 65 and 35 of groundwater with chemical composition characteristic for the western and eastern side of the lake respectively the 3d flow model for lake væng showed that 37 of groundwater flowing from west and south passes beneath the lake along the deep circulation flow paths and flows out at the eastern sandy lakebed figs 4 and 10 the estimate is close to the results of a 2d flow model presented by kazmierczak et al 2016 where 31 of groundwater flowing from the west passes beneath the lake and discharges at the eastern lake shore the complex flow system could not be represented in the lake segment approach which assumes that flow passing beneath the lake does not enter the surface water body rosenberry and labaugh 2008 the fraction of groundwater originating from the western and southern parts of the catchment and discharging at the flow convergence zone at the eastern lake shore kazmierczak et al 2016 could not be precisely estimated and deducted with the use of the lake segment approach the eastern segments were excluded from the calculation and all groundwater discharge accumulated at the western and southern lake shores thus the method can only be used for a rough estimation of water exchange between the aquifer and lake fig 8 the lake segment approach is also not suitable for the prediction of spatial variations in groundwater discharge rates which are important for the assessment of occurrence of the kinetic processes re bounding dip at the sediment water interface e g iron hydroxides vivianite and calcite precipitation or biogeochemical processes kazmierczak et al 2020 lewandowski et al 2015 the yearly dip loading into the lake with discharging groundwater estimated with the use of the three different methods is on the same order of magnitude and equals 351 220 and 267 kg dip yr 1 for the lake segment integrated and numerical approach respectively these values provide insight into the uncertainty of the estimated dip loading into the lake and may vary further by approximately 25 to 59 percent if the standard deviation from an average dip concentration at different hydrogeochemical zones is considered the dip inputs predicted with the use of the numerical modelling and the lake segment approach may be overestimated due to the simplifications used in both methods and the associated uncertainty in the lake segment approach groundwater inflow to the lake was overestimated by 24 and would have been overestimated by 67 if the eastern lake shoreline was included in the calculation the entire dip input is accumulated at the western and southern lake shore due to the method limitations bounding the groundwater recharge area to the discharge at the nearest lake shoreline rosenberry and labaugh 2008 while according to the results of 3d flow and transport modelling the dip loading is highest at the eastern sandy lakebed dip concentrations measured east of the lake are also slightly higher than at the western part in the lake segment approach the spatial variations in dip concentrations are included in the calculation except of the values measured at the eastern lake shore due to application of the field data within the corresponding segments while the estimated groundwater fluxes are only a rough approximation of the water exchange between aquifer and the lake fig 8 the 3d flow model predicts the total and spatial variations of groundwater discharge with high level of accuracy while the simulation of dip distribution within the aquifer is simplified due to the application of a homogeneous dip rate in the 3d transport model fig 10 the dip release rate is heterogeneous and depends on the hydrogeological and hydrochemical conditions in the aquifer kazmierczak et al 2020 lewandowski et al 2015 furthermore the exact extent of the terrace i where dip release takes place is not known precisely thus the simulated dip concentrations depend only on the groundwater flow rates while the influence of reaction kinetics and variations in the chemical composition of the sediments and groundwater are omitted the influence of the simplifications used in mt3dms model is visible in the simulated local distribution of dip concentrations solute transport models should be kept simple and cannot be expected to reproduce the observed concentrations with a high accuracy konikow 2011 compared to the measured values dip concentrations are underestimated at the western seepage face and in the area of a single piezometer installed below the thick gyttja layer overestimated at the northern part of the sandy lake bottom and match dip concentrations at the southern area of the sandy lake bottom thus the dip loading via the western seepage face and at the central part of the lake is likely underestimated and overestimated at the north eastern piezometer transects the difference is visible by comparing the distribution of the simulated dip loading fig 10 with that estimated using the integrated approach fig 13 no hydrochemical samples were taken from below the thick gyttja layer in the northern area of the lake where model predicts dip concentration up to 330 µg dip l 1 however the dip concentration was 105 µg dip l 1 below the thick gyttja layer at the central part of the lake kazmierczak et al 2020 and up to 424 µg dip l 1 at the eastern high discharge zone kidmose et al 2013 the approach integrating simulated water fluxes with the observed dip concentrations should therefore 1 result in an estimate of the groundwater controlled dip inputs into the lake associated with the lowest degree of uncertainty and 2 show the spatial distribution of dip loading with the highest accuracy fig 13 the integrated and numerical approaches contrary to the lake segment approach additionally allow for the prediction of the heterogeneities in the dip loading at the lakebed related to differences in distribution of the discharge rates and dip concentrations detailed 3d spatial hydrogeological information is important in the estimation of the loading of external geogenic dip into the lake since occurrence of hydrogeochemical processes re bounding dip at the sediment water interface depends on the groundwater discharge rate kazmierczak et al 2020 5 2 external dip inputs into lakes the integrated approach resulted in a loading of 220 kg dip yr 1 which equals 1 4 g dip m 2 yr 1 of the lake bottom this value compares well with the dip loading of 1 0 g dip m 2 yr 1 into the lake estimated in the 2d cross section by kazmierczak et al 2020 the difference may be a result of omitting the northern lake area in the 2d study where according to the numerical modelling and integrated approach high dip inputs may be expected figs 10 and 13 figs 10 and 13 a groundwater borne phosphorus loading at lake væng is at the higher end of the dip loading compiled from the literature that ranges 0 74 10 3 to 2 9 g m 2 yr 1 lewandowski et al 2015 for example external dip fluxes at lake eucha usa equal 0 047 g m 2 yr 1 with 24 originating from a wastewater treatment plant haggard et al 2005 likewise the 0 16 g dip m 2 yr 1 discharged with groundwater into lake arendsee germany is of both anthropogenic and geogenic origin meinikmann et al 2015 while groundwater delivered dip at lake væng is all of geogenic origin kazmierczak et al 2020 the dip discharge into lake væng is 1000 times higher than the input of 7 4 4 3 10 3 g dip m 2 yr 1 into the hypereutrophic shallow max depth of 4 m lake persimmon usa where phosphorus was the limiting nutrient kang et al 2005 and 10 times higher than the input of 0 1 g m 2 yr into eutrophic shallow max depth of 5 7 m nørresø denmark nisbeth et al 2019a 5 3 dip origin and its implications for lake eutrophication dip discharging into lake væng is of geogenic origin kazmierczak et al 2020 this is further confirmed by simulated age 70 years of the groundwater discharging into the lake which is prior to the common application of the n p k fertilizers on the arable lands cooke and williams 1973 the simulated distribution of the groundwater age compared well with variations in the cl concentrations within the aquifer concentration of cl in the uppermost 15 m of the aquifer at the western side of the lake is close to 15 mg cl l 1 a typical cl value in recharge water in jutland hinsby and rasmussen 2008 the simulated groundwater age in this area ranged between 5 and 25 years indicating shallow flow paths fig 12 groundwater sampled at the eastern side of the lake is enriched in cl due to the contact with the miocene marine clay deposits along the deep circulation flow paths hinsby and rasmussen 2008 kazmierczak et al 2016 it indicates that groundwater discharging at the eastern lake shore should be older than the groundwater flowing through the western seepage faces the simulated groundwater age reached up to 200 years below the gyttja sediments and at the eastern lake side figs 11 and 12 part of phosphorus present in the pleistocene aquifers including terrace i where further dip release occurred kazmierczak et al 2020 might have originated from marine miocene sediments the average dip concentration in the deep groundwater from marine miocene deposits 15 m a s l based on a few samples taken in the catchment is 61 µg l 1 figs 4 and 7 these deposits are effective reservoirs for phosphorus incorporated into the organic matter and mineral phases golterman 1973 föllmi 1996 and may be an additional source of geogenic dip the simulated dip release rate in the sediments of terrace i equals 0 14 µg dip per liter of water per day assuming a porosity of 0 3 and a sediment density of 1600 kg m 3 the dip release rate within the terrace i fig 4 equals 0 12 µg dip per kilogram of sediments per day the given release rate is overestimated since the groundwater discharging into the lake contains background dip from other geological sources in the catchment kazmierczak et al 2020 while the transport model does not include the external dip inflows into terrace i the background dip concentration was set to 0 mg l 1 the phosphorus sorption capacity of sandy sediments deposited in similar environments in sweden varies between 7 and 200 mg dip kg 1 carlsson and horkeby 1976 vanek 1993 thus the low dip release rate compared to the probable amount of phosphorus stored in the sediments of the terrace i can maintain the lake eutrophication for hundreds to thousands of years if the pool of the reductants in the aquifer kazmierczak et al 2020 is not exhausted the process of release and transport of geogenic dip towards the lake can be further extended due to re adsorption of part of dip onto iron hydroxides and or organic matter in the most recent sediments at the sediment water interface kazmierczak et al 2020 it would result in the movement of the contamination front towards the lake similar mechanisms controlling the transport of geogenic contaminants within the aquifer were described from the red river delta vietnam where the arsenic content in groundwater is correlated with the age of the sediments and volume of groundwater flushed through them over a time postma et al 2012 an average dip concentration in groundwater entering lake væng equals 60 µg l 1 figs 4 and 7 this concentration classifies the lake into the group of moderate ecological quality søndergaard et al 2005 in the period of 2007 2010 the tp concentration in the lake water ranged between 35 and 196 µg l 1 the seasonal deterioration and improvement of the lake water quality can be explained by temporally bounding of part of the groundwater delivered dip in the internal lake and wetland phosphorus cycles kazmierczak et al 2020 reddy et al 1999 the low phosphorus release rate in the aquifer resulting in the high dip concentrations in groundwater seems to be one of the factors responsible for the lake eutrophication over a scale of thousands of years this effect is additionally emphasized by dip inputs into the lake from anthropogenic sources until 1983 e g fertilizers sewage water and seasonal deterioration of the lake water quality due to the internal phosphorus cycling and explains the short lasting improvement of the lake water quality after the restoration attempts 6 conclusions lake water balance and groundwater controlled dip loading were estimated with the use of three methods based on data from the field surveys 1 lake segment 2 integrated and 3 numerical the calculated net mass loading is within the same order of magnitude for all methods however the integrated approach is associated with the lowest degree of uncertainty and therefore predicts the spatial distribution of the mass loading into the lake with the highest degree of accuracy the present study shows that cl can be successfully used to estimate the spatial distribution of groundwater discharge into the lake and to track flow paths even for the complex flow systems if a dense net of water sampling is applied low permeable gyttja layer acts as a barrier for the external geogenic dip loading despite high measured and simulated dip concentrations in groundwater beneath the lake actual contribution of these areas into annual groundwater driven dip loading is low this shows the importance of an integrated approach where 3d spatial hydrogeological information is used to understand the magnitude of transport pathways in the entire system such information can improve planning of the lake restoration attempts dip mobilization within the old lake bottom resulting in the high dip concentrations in groundwater seems to be the major factor responsible for continued lake eutrophication the low dip release rate in the aquifer and re adsorption of dip in the recent sediments combined nowadays with an additional dip inputs from the anthropogenic sources can lead to the lake eutrophication over a period of thousands of years credit authorship

4493,transport of hexavalent chromium cr vi in groundwater is largely influenced by adsorption and desorption processes sediment types can result in substantial difference in adsorption mechanisms the goal of this work is to explore the adsorption mechanism of cr vi within sediments with different properties and to identify the controlling factors in this paper cr vi adsorption onto six different natural unconsolidated sediments two loamy sands two sandy loams one loam and one silty loam clay collected from a typical fluvial aquifer in qiqihar china was assessed with batch and column experiments equilibrium adsorption capacities and kinetic rates were quantified with batch experiments potential controlling effects of ph solid solution ratio grain size and clay mineral content on adsorption capacities were also analyzed adsorption kinetics was evaluated with elovich pseudo first and second order models and equilibrium properties were assessed with henry freundlich and langmuir isotherms model adequacy was discriminated with selection criteria of akaike information criterion aic modified akaike information criterion aicc bayesian information criterion bic and hannan information criterion hic adsorption and desorption of cr vi onto and from the collected sediment samples under flow conditions were investigated with column experiments key results suggest that irreversible chemical adsorption is the dominant mechanism for cr vi adsorption onto the sediment samples grain sizes and clay mineral contents are the controlling factors for adsorption capacity fine grained sediments with high clay mineral contents present the highest cr vi adsorption capacity chromium vi presents high retention on loam and silty loam clay and high mobility on loamy sand results from this study may provide important insight for understanding the transport behaviors of cr vi in shallow aquifers keywords hexavalent chromium adsorption model selection criteria non equilibrium transport 1 introduction contamination of heavy metals such as chromium cr from anthropogenic sources kanagaraj and elango 2019 kazakis et al 2018 is a serious threat to groundwater resources due to their impacts to human health and their non biodegradability dhal et al 2013 jobby et al 2018 chromium usually exists in trivalent iii and hexavalent vi valence states in nature cr vi is of higher toxicity and solubility in water and may transport over longer distances in the subsurface than cr iii these properties make cr vi a more significant concern for groundwater quality therefore detailed investigations of migration and reaction mechanisms of cr vi is required costa 2003 it is known that cr vi retention in groundwater is largely controlled by adsorption and desorption processes bradl 2004 kuo and bembenek 2008 lazaridis 2005 a deep understanding of cr vi transferring between liquid and aquifer sediments surfaces is of great significance for understanding its behavior in natural environments and potential impacts on groundwater quality zhao et al 2010 most prior research on cr vi mobilization focused on removal of cr vi contamination by adsorption gheju et al 2016 han et al 2016 wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2018a it is believed that adsorption characterizations of different types of sedimentary units usually exhibit significant differences dai et al 2009 deng et al 2013 soltanian et al 2015a 2015b 2015c very few of these studies assessed key mechanisms controlling cr vi adsorption in different types of aquifer sediments which exhibit different physicochemical properties such as grain sizes and chemical compositions up to date studies on transport and adsorption of cr vi mainly focus on sand and topsoil choppala et al 2013 2018 fonseca et al 2009a 2009b jiang et al 2008 khan et al 2010 mpouras et al 2017 but few experimental studies focus on cr vi transport in clay sediments although clay sediments are usually treated as aquitards their adsorptive and desorptive properties lead to a secondary source for contaminants which may have a long term impact on groundwater quality alvarez et al 2012 jiao et al 2010 liu et al 2020 xiao et al 2016 therefore a comparasion of all types of sediments with different adsorption capacities under same experimental protocal is needed our study aim at this issue the sediments samples were of various grain sizes from sand to clay with similar chemical and mineral compositions but different contents which is convenient for comparing different types of sediments in fluvial and lacustrine sedimentary environments heavy metal adsorption mechanisms on different adsorbents and their controlling factors such as ph initial adsorbate concentration ionic strength can be investigated by batch and column experiments martínez lladó et al 2011 ritzi and dai 2006 batch studies are easily implemented and mostly applied to investigate adsorption mechanisms but they neglect flow and transport conditions occuring in geologic environments with significantly larger solid solution ratio limousin et al 2007 tran et al 1998 xiao et al 2017 yang et al 2014 column experiments considering flow and transport conditions are then preferable for studying cr vi sorption mechanisms with mimicing natural subsurface flow dai and samper 2004 garcı a gutiérrez et al 2001 samper et al 2006 equilibrium and kinetic models are useful for quantifying adsorption and desorption behaviors in sediments azizian 2004 equilibrium models provide information at stable states in a system and kinetics reflects dynamic changes of physical and chemical reactions over time oliveira et al 2008 uysal and ar 2007 selection of different models by appropriate techniques with specialized assumptions and conditions is helpful for identifying adsorption mechanisms and predicting the process with a high degree of accuracy limousin et al 2007 with incorporation of kinetics and equilibrium isotherm equations into chemical speciation program the model types might even affect the prediction results of solute mobility in groundwater brusseau 1998 dai et al 2015 2008 hinz et al 1994 the identification of kinetic and equilibrium models is critical for adsorption study especially for the interpretation of mechanism however little attention has been paid to the contribution of model selection generally correlation coefficient r2 is the most widely used criterion for model selection in experimental studies however it is largely affected by the numbers of data set and model parameters el khaiary and malash 2011 and is not sufficient for kinetic and equilibrium model selection azizian and yahyaei 2006 bolster and hornberger 2007 di bucchianico 2008 saiers and hornberger 1996 simonin 2016 criteria considering both quantity of data and complexity of models are considered superior to the error equations cai et al 2015 el khaiary and malash 2011 janetti et al 2012 akaike s information criterion aic modified akaike information criterion aicc bayesian information criterion bic and hannan information criterion hic based on maximum likelihood theory were used to identify subsurface hydrology and groundwater hydrochemical models in previous studies dai et al 2006 2012 samper and neuman 1989a 1989b 1989c ye et al 2008 the model criteria were successfully applied to compare kinetic and equilibrium models with different complexity aic and aicc rank multiple equilibrium isotherms that have different numbers of parameters akpa and unuabonah 2011 zhang et al 2018b geochemical adsorption mechanism was identified through selecting best kinetic model through aic and bic cai et al 2015 these criteria were found sensitive to model performance and reducing overfitting caused by models with more parameters as number of parameters is confirmed to be important for model ranking we hence use these criteria in our study to determine the kinetic and equilibrium model with the best fit and least parameters the major objective of this work is to evaluate the adsorption and transport of cr vi on several natural sediments the effects of sediment characteristics and controlling factors such as ph and solid solution ratio were considered another objective is to select the most appropriate model for adsorption mechanism through model selection criteria specifically six sediments with different physical and chemical characteristics were collected from a representative alluvial area in qiqihar heilongjiang china to conduct both batch and column experiments batch adsorption parameters were evaluated by three kinetic models and three equilibrium isotherm equations model selection criteria aic bic aicc hic were used for model identification the breakthrough curves of column experiments were calibrated with a deterministic equilibrium model and a chemical non equilibrium model in cxtfit toride et al 1995 to estimate the transport and adsorption parameters respectively 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description a typical alluvial plain in the west of songnen plain was selected as a case study fig 1 the hydrogeological conditions of the study site were described in previous studies in detail li 2016 zhang et al 2012 only a brief introduction is provided in this paper the study site locates in qiqihar heilongjiang province in northeast china qiqihar is one of the important old industrial bases in china in the process of urbanization of such heavy industrial cities industrial activities might easily affect groundwater quality currently there is no evidence of cr contamination in this area however cr containing industrial effluent is still a contamination risk in this area via potential leakage from treatment oxidation ponds li 2016 the site is in a fluvial and lacustrine sedimentary environment and deposited thick pleistocene unconsolidated sediments since the quaternary loose sediments with large thickness created favorable conditions for groundwater formation and distribution to form the main aquifer in this area the topography in this area shows obvious zonation in the transverse direction of low floodplain high floodplain and low hillock plain fig 1 the sampling sites were selected on different geomorphic terraces along the east west direction before sampling the topsoil rich in organic matter and plant roots as well as non depositional artificial miscellaneous fill about 20 30 cm was removed we collected six sediment samples as s1 to s6 at the depth 60 86 116 30 50 46 cm specifically the groundwater table in study area was 2 12 m li et al 2014 s1 and s3 were loamy sand s2 and s6 were sandy loam s4 was silty loam clay and s5 was loam the sediment samples were air dried for two days and sieved through a 2 mm stainless steel screen before the experiments grain size distributions of the samples were determined by a bettersize2000 laser grain size analyzer the sedimentary types were identified through the grain size distributions subjected to an international standard for soil texture classification the major chemical components of the sediments were analyzed by x ray fluorescence spectrometer xrf the major mineral phases were identified with a dx 2700 x ray diffractometer xrd the content range of total cr in the sediments was between 37 66 and 56 75 mg kg close to the local background value thus it is neglected in the subsequent experiments 2 2 batch experiments chromium vi solutions were prepared with k2cr2o7 guarantee reagent ph was adjusted to 2 5 by 10 wt hcl and 10 mol l naoh solution to mimic industrial effluent containing cr vi with high acidity sthiannopkao and sreesai 2009 all the batch experiments were performed at room temperature 25 1 c in a sha c oscillator at 200 round min rpm each sample in a conical flask contained 2 g dried sediment and 50 ml cr solution all the conical flasks were sealed with parafilm to exclude evaporation after adsorption 10 ml suspension was collected and centrifuged to separate the aqueous phase from the solid phase then the supernatant was filtered with 0 45 um polyethersulfone pes filters the concentration of cr vi was analyzed by 1 5 diphenylcarbohydrazide spectrophotometric method at 540 nm wavelength with a lambda365 uv vis spectrophotometer bartlett and james 1979 control experiments without cr vi in the solution were also conducted under each test condition for the investigations of controlling factors of ph and solid solution ratio sample s6 was selected as the sorbent because of its medium grain size and a moderate equilibrium time for the effect of ph on adsorption initial ph of the solutions was adjusted ranging from 1 to 5 for the effect of solid solution ratio soil mass from 2 to 5 g was added to 50 ml solution with solid solution ratios of 1 25 3 50 2 25 and 1 10 g ml respectively for batch kinetic adsorption experiments the initial concentration of cr vi was assigned 5 mg l to study the amount of adsorbed cr vi changing over time cr vi concentrations were analyzed at appropriate time intervals till the concentrations did not show any obvious alteration which was considered equilibrium in order to prevent the change of solid solution ratio caused by concentration analysis for each type of sediments three parallel experiments were conducted with same amount of sediment and initial solution at each time point and the average adsorption amounts were calculated the batch equilibrium adsorption experiments were set with initial cr vi concentrations of 2 5 10 20 30 40 and 50 mg l followed with 48 h oscillation to obtain relationships between the adsorbed cr vi and the aqueous concentrations at equilibrium for each initial concentration above three parallel experiments were conducted and the average adsorption amounts were calculated the adsorption amount was calculated by eq 1 günay et al 2007 1 q b v c 0 c m where qb is the amount of cr vi adsorbed mg kg v is the volume of solution ml c0 is the initial concentration mg l c is the equilibrium concentration mg l m is the mass of the sorbent g the slope of the amount of cr vi adsorbed at equilibrium and the equilibrium concentration can be defined as distribution coefficient kd which characterize the adsorption capacity of adsorbent for heavy metal in aquatic environment morera et al 2001 2 3 column experiments the transport experiments were conducted in plexiglass columns the diameter of the columns for s1 s2 and s3 was 6 cm and the filling height was 10 cm due to low permeability and difficulty of flows with this column size for s4 s5 and s6 smaller columns with 2 cm diameter and filling height 1 cm were used instead columns were packed following the density measured in the field of 1 6 g cm3 the top and bottom of each column were covered with a layer of gravel to make influent evenly infiltrate from top and prevent loss of the sediments from bottom each column was then filled with distilled water and porosity was calculated by the volume of water filled the flowrate was set with 0 5 ml min for the large columns and 0 25 ml min for the small columns with peristaltic pumps respectively all the column experiments were conducted at room temperature 25 1 c the settings of the columns are summarized in table 1 before the experiments each column was leached by distilled water to determine the background concentration of cr vi and then to remove residual mobile cr vi till its concentration was under detection limit then a 200 mg l nacl solution was injected into the columns as non reactive tracers the electronic conductivity was measured at the outlets of the columns with a real time electrode probe the breakthrough curve was electrical conductivity in the adsorption experiments the influent cr vi concentration was 5 mg l with initial ph 2 5 the influent was injected from the top of the column chromium vi concentration in the effluent was analyzed every 20 min till steady state condition was reached in the desorption experiments the influent solution was cr vi free and injected after the adsorption process attaining steady state the adsorption amount of each column can be estimated by the following equation 2 q c c 0 c d v m where qc is the amount of cr vi adsorbed mg kg v is the volume of the effluent solution ml c0 is the concentration in influent mg l c is the

re 1 qeβ is defined as the approaching equilibrium factor with dimensionless elovich equation when qe is determined through kinetic experiment te and re can be evaluated through nonlinear curve fitting with qe fixed 2 4 2 equilibrium adsorption isotherms the equilibrium adsorption of cr vi on these sediments was described with henry langmuir and freundlich isotherms henry isotherm describes a linear dependence between the adsorption and the equilibrium concentration which is defined 6 q e k d c e where qe is the concentration of cr vi adsorbed at equilibrium mg kg ce is concentration at

coefficient l kg indicating the adsorption capacity n is a constant related to the adsorption intensity 2 4 3 model selection criteria because all selected kinetic and equilibrium models in this study contain different number of parameters model selection criteria were used to eliminate their impact on the fitting results akaile information criterion aic is the most widely used criterion akaike

transport cxtfit code provides several mathematical models for equilibrium and non equilibrium transport problems toride et al 1995 to simplify the solutions and reduce the number of parameters to be estimated the one dimensional 1 d equilibrium advection dispersion equation was used to describe the transport of nacl solution in this study assuming no production and degradation of the solute the

transport of reactive solute subjected to adsorption is affected by a variety of chemical non equilibrium processes the two site non equilibrium theory assumes that the adsorption sites can be divided into two types of chemical adsorption processes type i assumes that adsorption is an instantaneous process to reach equilibrium type ii considers adsorption is time dependent and governed by the first

distributions six sediment samples were classified as loamy sand sandy loam silty loam clay and loam table 3 presents the major chemical and mineral components of the sediments the major mineral compositions of sediments in the study site were quartz feldspar and plagioclase trace amounts of calcite chlorite and hornblende also existed in the sediments the predominant components of clay minerals were illite and smectite the major chemical composition of sediments was silicon oxide and the major metallic oxide was aluminum oxide followed by iron oxides the loss on ignition of all the sediments suggested the level of organic matter content d50 average grain size μm ssa specific surface area m2 g loi loss on ignition 3 2 batch experiments 3 2 1 adsorption kinetics the kinetic data for all sediments under the condition of initial 5 mg l cr vi concentration at 25 c are plotted in fig 2 all the sediments exhibited a rapid adsorption in the first a few minutes following with a progressively slower adsorption the samples s1 s2 and s3 attained nearly equilibrium within three hours and the samples s4 s5 and s6 took a much longer time to reach equilibrium with larger adsorption capacities we interpret that grain sizes surface area and clay mineral contents control the adsorption capacity and the equilibrium time of these sediments s4 s5 and s6 presented higher adsorption capacity with smaller grain sizes s5 showed the highest adsorption capacity among the six samples with the highest mineral content although its grain size was not the finest besides the ph of suspension after mixing and at equilibrium were detected the suspension ph before adsorption was 2 64 2 77 2 61 2 78 2 72 2 68 for s1 s6 after mixing with initial solution at ph 2 5 this was due to the different acid buffering capacities of sediments after adsorption the ph turned to 3 01 3 8 3 19 4 15 3 98 3 58 for s1 s6 respectively this indicated the adsorption processes consumed hydrogen ions the greater the adsorption capacity the more hydrogen ions consumed also mineral dissolution may occur during adsorption the kinetic parameters evaluated from the three kinetic models and the values of aic aicc bic hic from these three models are summarized in table 4 the nonlinear curve fitting method was used to fit all the data and the value of the objective function φ was calculated in terms of correlation coefficient pseudo first order model showed a good match to the experimental data correlation coefficients 0 9 instead the model selection criteria suggested that elovich equation was superior to other two models for the kinetic data of s5 and s6 and pseudo second order equation showed the best fitness for s3 the time to reach equilibrium evaluated from elovich equation was in good agreement with the experimental data except s4 and s5 of which the evaluated equilibrium time was longer than the actual experimental result the fitted curves of elovich equation for s4 and s5 with slow adsorption rate were slightly lower than the experimental observation data at equilibrium resulting in overestimated time to reach equilibrium the expected value of qe was the experimental observed mass of cr vi adsorbed at equilibrium the qe evaluated from model with better prediction should be closer to expected qe the values of qe of the pseudo first order model were closer to the expected qe than pseudo second order for all the samples due to its goodness of fit to observation data the results were also supported by model selection criteria for sample s3 the performance of both pseudo first order and pseudo second order model were similar but the values of model selection criteria varied widely because model selection criteria considered the number of model parameter and data they were more sensitive to models with similar performance as shown in table 4 the rate constants of adsorption k1 and k2 from both pseudo first order equation and pseudo second order equation revealed large differences among the sediments the rate constants of s4 s6 were of one to two orders of magnitude smaller than that of s1 s3 with similar clay mineral contents the rate constant of s2 was much higher than that of s4 and s6 this indicated that grain size was the most important rate limiting factor sediments with greater grain sizes were more rapidly to achieve adsorption equilibrium the range of rate constants was similar to the results of previous studies of cr vi adsorption on a loamy sand soil fonseca et al 2009a 3 2 2 equilibrium adsorption isotherms the equilibrium adsorption capacities of six sediments versus concentration are plotted in fig 3 with the increase of initial concentration the adsorption capacity of these sediments increased the adsorption parameters evaluated by equilibrium models and values of aic aicc bic hic calculated are summarized in table 5 freundlich model showed the highest correlation coefficients for all sediments 0 97 according to the evaluations of aic aicc bic hic langmuir model was favorable for s1 s2 and s3 this indicated that langmuir model was more suitable for coarse grained sediments with less adsorption capacity freundlich performed well in describing fine grained sediments with large adsorption capacity the models selected by model selection criteria had the minimum values of objective function it demonstrated that for the models considered in our study model selection criteria still selected the best fit models when considering number of parameters and available data as shown in table 5 linear distribution coefficient kd and freundlich adsorption coefficient kf measured the adsorption capacity of each sediment increasing from 0 897 to 6 430 l kg and 1 599 to 59 897 l kg due to changes in sediment types the order of adsorption capacity of these sediments according to henry and freundlich isotherm was s5 s4 s6 s2 s3 s1 in table 5 the values of 1 n of these sediments ranged from 0 to 1 indicating favorable adsorption conditions chen and zhang 2014 n was higher for s4 and s5 suggesting that adsorption site energy was more heterogeneous there was a positive correlation 0 959 between the values of n and langmuir adsorption coefficient kl indicating that the heterogeneity of surface site energy enhanced the attachment between adsorbate and sediment surface qm estimated by the langmuir isotherm was much higher than that measured in the experiments especially for s1 s3 and s6 this was because the range of initial concentrations was relatively low for s1 s3 and s6 resulting in klce 1 leading to almost linear relationship between equilibrium concentration and adsorption capacity 3 2 3 effects of ph and solid solution ratio on adsorption ph is one of the major factors that influence the adsorption process by changing the surface properties of soil fig 4 a shows the adsorption capacity of cr vi as a function of initial ph cr vi adsorption capacity decreased with increasing ph adsorption of cr vi increased dramatically when ph dropped below 3 this was consistent with the observation from literature mpouras et al 2017 namasivayam and sureshkumar 2008 weng et al 2008 the reason is that the dominant form of cr vi is hcro4 under more acidic conditions ajouyed et al 2010 robertson 1975 low ph results in positive charge on sediment surface and electrostatically attracts negatively charged hcro4 with increasing ph the dominant form of cr vi changs to cro4 2 increasing oh ions in the solution results in the decrease of attractive surface charge and hinders the diffusion of cro4 2 the adsorption of cr vi is also a proton consuming hydroxyl releasing reaction 23 s oh hcro4 h s hcro4 h2o the symbol s oh represents potential surface site thus the adsorption of the cr vi was promoted by high acidity fig 4b shows cr vi adsorption capacity as a function of solid to solution ratio g ml the adsorption capacity decreased as the ratio increased chang et al 2002 du and hayashi 2006 and puls et al 1991 reported similar results of the effect of solid solution ratio although the total amount of cr vi adsorbed increased as solid to solution ratio increased the adsorption capacity per unit mass decreased the reason is that higher sorbent concentration diluting the sorbate concentration at higher solid solution ratios chang et al 2002 the cr vi concentration distributes on sediment of unit mass decreases as the mass of sediment increases when reducing the mass of solids the available surface sites of adsorbent are easier to reach saturation since the adsorption is a surface driven process therefore the solid to solution ratio of 1 25 was selected to achieve a larger adsorption capacity in other experiments of this study 3 2 4 effects of grain size and mineralogy on adsorption although the sediments in this study were natural without sieving the grain sizes of each sediment were distinctive table 1 as grain size decreased the sediment adsorption capacity increased and the adsorption rate decreased with longer equilibrium time one probable reason is that the decrease of grain size leads to the increase of specific surface area with large number of binding sites exposed another reason is that the compositions of sediments varies in different grain size ranges it was proved in literatures that the grain size fractions of soils led to different chemical compositions mpouras et al 2017 sangster et al 2015 wu et al 2012 the fraction which dominates the adsorption process clay minerals amorphous fe al oxide and organic matters are usually with small grain sizes in this study the predominant components of clay minerals were illite and smectite which were with layer lattice structures composed of silicon and aluminum oxide the sediments also contained a small amount of iron oxide therefore there are more than one type of surface sites at which adsorption can occur according to the surface complexation mechanism the available sites for complexation are hydroxylated aluminum and silicon atoms exposed on the surface with ratios dictated by clay crystal structure additionally iron sites may exist as metal hydroxide secondary surface coatings wang et al 2018 ward and bassett 1990 3 3 column experiments the cr vi breakthrough curves of all the columns at the outlet are shown in fig 5 the durations of the cr vi injection phase for s1 to s6 were 720 1850 1434 345 215 235 min respectively the tailings in the breakthrough curves could be due to the existence of multiple porosity structures in the samples the desorption results table 6 clearly showed that only a fraction of the absorbed pool was desorbable incomplete desorption indicated the appearance of diffusion of cr vi from edge to interlayer regions liu et al 2003 it also suggested that sediment type was a key factor for cr vi adsorption as the same type of sediments had similar recovery rate as grain size became smaller the adsorption capacity increased and cr vi adsorption tended to be irreversible a plausible explanation for this finding is that the reaction between cr vi and sediments with smaller grain sizes clay and loam are dominated by irreversible chemical adsorption cr vi ions are bound to the interlayer regions by chemical bonds which are much stronger than electrostatic attraction larger specific surface area contributes to the diffusion of ions to interlayer region leading to more chemical adsorption the adsorbed ions eventually enter the crystal lattice and become a portion demir 2015 sun et al 2019 it is also possible that cr vi ions adsorbed on sediments via electrostatic attraction are then reduced to cr iii by adjacent electron donor groups malkoc et al 2006 park et al 2005 making it irreversible reversible physical adsorption controlled by electrostatic attraction occurs more in the sediments with larger grain sizes loamy sand which is easily to desorb the difference in recovery rates is the result of the combination of two mechanisms of adsorption it is also believed that metal ions firstly adsorb on sediments via irreversible chemical adsorption till saturated and only reversible adsorption occurs thereafter chen et al 2000 kan et al 1998 silva yumi et al 2018 3 4 evaluation of transport and adsorption parameters the estimation of relevant parameters was performed with inverse method firstly transport parameters were evaluated with experimental data of cl in the case of r 1 then the adsorption parameters were evaluated with cr vi adsorption experimental data the cxtfit code with equilibrium and two site non equilibrium models was used for parameter estimation toride et al 1995 transport and adsorption parameters estimated by inverse simulations are presented in table 7 high correlation coefficients 0 99 suggested good fittings of these parameters fig 6 shows the breakthrough curves of cl fitted by equilibrium model fig 7 shows the breakthrough curves of cr vi fitted by two site non equilibrium model it denoted that two site non equilibrium model properly described the mobility of cr vi in different sediments with high correlation coefficients 0 99 high retardation factor r of s4 s5 and s6 represented high adsorption capacity and low mobility both β the ratio of instantaneous adsorption sites to rate limited sites and ω the ratio of hydraulic retention time to adsorption characteristic time were 1 suggesting that it was not an instantaneous but a rate limited adsorption process the higher value of ω of s2 than other sediments indicated that the fraction of the type 2 adsorption sites which was assumed to be kinetic dependent was the dominant sites for retardation process the distribution coefficient kd of column experiments was calculated from eq 22 the results compared to the batch experiments are shown in fig 8 the kd of batch experiments at a certain concentration was calculated through the mass of adsorption divided by equilibrium concentration observed kd was overall higher for batch experiments than that for column experiments excluding s6 this may be an overestimation of parameters in batch experiments which is due to two reasons maszkowska et al 2013 vereecken et al 2011 first different experiment protocols result in different observed adsorption capacities the optimized contact between sediment particles and solution occurs with continuously shaking which also results in faster adsorption rate in batch experiments second the packing strategy in the columns leads to a high solid solution ratio limits cr vi adsorption in sediments for s6 the column derived kd was higher than the batch derived kd which was also observed in previous studies porro et al 2000 srinivasan and sarmah 2014 it is possible that not only adsorption but also other additional retention mechanisms occur in the column experiments e g reduction and precipitation saturated packed column provides an anaerobic condition for cr vi being reduced to cr iii while batch experiments are conducted in aerobic conditions because the solution is in full contact with the air all the time seo et al 2008 considered that the adsorption is the only process for retention in batch experiments as bacteria can also provide adsorption sites for metal ions templeton et al 2003 it is not sure whether there is a microbial effect as the sediments used in this study was not sterilized therefore it is also possible for weak biosorption of bacteria resulting in a higher kd for s6 4 model uncertainties although the retention of cr vi was mainly attributed to the adsorption properties of different types of sediments in this study uncertainty exists regarding the role of organic matter om and other reducing agents in the retention of cr in the sediments the cr iii was not detected in either of the solutions or the effluent of batch and column experiments of this study however this does not mean that cr vi is not reduced as cr iii is of less mobility and easy to form sparingly soluble complexes and precipitate in studies of hong et al 2012 and jardine et al 2011 the species of cr precipitated in sediments was analyzed through spectroscopic methods and trivalent state was detected the part of reduction in retention usually caused by om could not be neglected in those cases banks et al 2006 guha et al 2001 hong et al 2012 molinero huguet et al 2004 in addition iron also plays an important role in the retention of cr because fe ii has a strong reductive ability and can form complexes with reduced species zhang et al 2008 though fe iii does not react directly with cr vi it can provide positive charge on the surface for the adsorption of cr vi and cr iii choppala et al 2013 ding et al 2016 the results of this study also suggested the potential of reduction by om first although the adsorption distribution coefficient of batch experiments tended to be overestimated the degree of overestimation was different especially the column derived kd was higher than the batch derived kd for s6 discussed in section 3 4 second the order of adsorption capacity is almost the same as that of loi except for s4 and s5 loi representing the content of organic matter is a widely used methods for measuring om contents in soil and had good relationships with the contents of organic carbon hoogsteen et al 2015 wright et al 2008 in the case of low om contents it is still possible for solid phase associated om to promote the reduction of cr vi to cr iii jardine et al 2011 finally s4 and s5 with relatively high loi had lowest recovery rates among all the sediments this indicates a possibility that the reduction accounts for a large proportion of the irreversible part which is consistent with the findings of hong et al 2012 as a result of complex and wide variety of crystalline structures textural properties and chemical compositions of sediments few studies clarified the statistical relationship between reduction and om contents natural om may exist as secondary coatings on the mineral surface significantly contribute to reduction and either increase or decrease the adsorption of heavy metals removal of om from soil does not always reduce retention instead it may promote the adsorption as more surface bonding sites are exposed usman 2008 the mechanisms of interaction between cr vi and om also depend on the type of om compounds cumberland et al 2016 overall there is a possibility that cr vi removed by sediments from aqueous solution undergoes adsorption coupled reduction cr vi is directly reduced to cr iii by reducing agents such as fe ii then chromic hydroxide cr oh 3 forms and is removed by adsorption and or precipitation also the cr vi of anionic adsorption binding on the surface sites can also be reduced to cr iii by electrons provided by om hong et al 2012 park et al 2005 tran et al 2017 many previous studies attributed the retention of cr vi only to adsorption or reduction however considering cr iii have completely different characteristics with cr vi especially different toxicity resulting in different degree of threat to the environment the uncertainty brought by the reduction combined adsorption is worthy of further study 5 conclusions this study investigated adsorption and transport of cr vi in different types of natural unconsolidated sediments through batch and column experiments we considered the effects of potential key controlling factors including solution ph solid solution ratio grain size and clay mineral and organic matter content the following results extracted from this work will contribute to a better understanding of the environmental fate of cr vi the order of adsorption capacity was s5 s4 s6 s2 s3 and s1 loam silty loam clay two sandy loam and two loamy sand respectively four model selection criteria of aic aicc bic and hic successfully evaluated the kinetic and equilibrium models in this study pseudo first order equation best described s1 s2 and s4 pseudo second order equation showed the best match for s3 elovich equation well described a chemical adsorption process of s5 and s6 equilibrium studies showed that s1 s2 and s3 were best fitted by freundlich isotherm and s4 s5 s6 were best fitted by langmuir isotherm these statistical model selection criteria highlighted the importance of considering the number of model parameters and experimental data to obtain reliable parameters and robust prediction which suggests their promising applications in identification of groundwater models with different complexity the adsorption capacity was significantly affected by ph and solid solution ratio the increase of the solution ph and solid solution ratio resulted in the decrease of the adsorption of cr vi the properties of sediments especially the grain size and clay minerals were the key factors controlling the adsorption capacity and rate higher adsorption capacity and lower adsorption rate were observed in the sediments with smaller grain size and higher clay mineral content the two site non equilibrium model fitted well the transport of cr vi in all sediments evaluated in this study the differences in adsorption parameter estimated showed environmental implication that sediment types should be considered in cr vi transport prediction especially clay aquitard and sediments with high clay mineral content would be a concern due to their high retention capacity and potential of a long term impact on groundwater quality the adsorption levels evaluated in this study of different sediments will guide groundwater risk assessment and protection in qiqihar or other sites with similar sediment types credit authorship contribution statement yang cao

4493,transport of hexavalent chromium cr vi in groundwater is largely influenced by adsorption and desorption processes sediment types can result in substantial difference in adsorption mechanisms the goal of this work is to explore the adsorption mechanism of cr vi within sediments with different properties and to identify the controlling factors in this paper cr vi adsorption onto six different natural unconsolidated sediments two loamy sands two sandy loams one loam and one silty loam clay collected from a typical fluvial aquifer in qiqihar china was assessed with batch and column experiments equilibrium adsorption capacities and kinetic rates were quantified with batch experiments potential controlling effects of ph solid solution ratio grain size and clay mineral content on adsorption capacities were also analyzed adsorption kinetics was evaluated with elovich pseudo first and second order models and equilibrium properties were assessed with henry freundlich and langmuir isotherms model adequacy was discriminated with selection criteria of akaike information criterion aic modified akaike information criterion aicc bayesian information criterion bic and hannan information criterion hic adsorption and desorption of cr vi onto and from the collected sediment samples under flow conditions were investigated with column experiments key results suggest that irreversible chemical adsorption is the dominant mechanism for cr vi adsorption onto the sediment samples grain sizes and clay mineral contents are the controlling factors for adsorption capacity fine grained sediments with high clay mineral contents present the highest cr vi adsorption capacity chromium vi presents high retention on loam and silty loam clay and high mobility on loamy sand results from this study may provide important insight for understanding the transport behaviors of cr vi in shallow aquifers keywords hexavalent chromium adsorption model selection criteria non equilibrium transport 1 introduction contamination of heavy metals such as chromium cr from anthropogenic sources kanagaraj and elango 2019 kazakis et al 2018 is a serious threat to groundwater resources due to their impacts to human health and their non biodegradability dhal et al 2013 jobby et al 2018 chromium usually exists in trivalent iii and hexavalent vi valence states in nature cr vi is of higher toxicity and solubility in water and may transport over longer distances in the subsurface than cr iii these properties make cr vi a more significant concern for groundwater quality therefore detailed investigations of migration and reaction mechanisms of cr vi is required costa 2003 it is known that cr vi retention in groundwater is largely controlled by adsorption and desorption processes bradl 2004 kuo and bembenek 2008 lazaridis 2005 a deep understanding of cr vi transferring between liquid and aquifer sediments surfaces is of great significance for understanding its behavior in natural environments and potential impacts on groundwater quality zhao et al 2010 most prior research on cr vi mobilization focused on removal of cr vi contamination by adsorption gheju et al 2016 han et al 2016 wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2018a it is believed that adsorption characterizations of different types of sedimentary units usually exhibit significant differences dai et al 2009 deng et al 2013 soltanian et al 2015a 2015b 2015c very few of these studies assessed key mechanisms controlling cr vi adsorption in different types of aquifer sediments which exhibit different physicochemical properties such as grain sizes and chemical compositions up to date studies on transport and adsorption of cr vi mainly focus on sand and topsoil choppala et al 2013 2018 fonseca et al 2009a 2009b jiang et al 2008 khan et al 2010 mpouras et al 2017 but few experimental studies focus on cr vi transport in clay sediments although clay sediments are usually treated as aquitards their adsorptive and desorptive properties lead to a secondary source for contaminants which may have a long term impact on groundwater quality alvarez et al 2012 jiao et al 2010 liu et al 2020 xiao et al 2016 therefore a comparasion of all types of sediments with different adsorption capacities under same experimental protocal is needed our study aim at this issue the sediments samples were of various grain sizes from sand to clay with similar chemical and mineral compositions but different contents which is convenient for comparing different types of sediments in fluvial and lacustrine sedimentary environments heavy metal adsorption mechanisms on different adsorbents and their controlling factors such as ph initial adsorbate concentration ionic strength can be investigated by batch and column experiments martínez lladó et al 2011 ritzi and dai 2006 batch studies are easily implemented and mostly applied to investigate adsorption mechanisms but they neglect flow and transport conditions occuring in geologic environments with significantly larger solid solution ratio limousin et al 2007 tran et al 1998 xiao et al 2017 yang et al 2014 column experiments considering flow and transport conditions are then preferable for studying cr vi sorption mechanisms with mimicing natural subsurface flow dai and samper 2004 garcı a gutiérrez et al 2001 samper et al 2006 equilibrium and kinetic models are useful for quantifying adsorption and desorption behaviors in sediments azizian 2004 equilibrium models provide information at stable states in a system and kinetics reflects dynamic changes of physical and chemical reactions over time oliveira et al 2008 uysal and ar 2007 selection of different models by appropriate techniques with specialized assumptions and conditions is helpful for identifying adsorption mechanisms and predicting the process with a high degree of accuracy limousin et al 2007 with incorporation of kinetics and equilibrium isotherm equations into chemical speciation program the model types might even affect the prediction results of solute mobility in groundwater brusseau 1998 dai et al 2015 2008 hinz et al 1994 the identification of kinetic and equilibrium models is critical for adsorption study especially for the interpretation of mechanism however little attention has been paid to the contribution of model selection generally correlation coefficient r2 is the most widely used criterion for model selection in experimental studies however it is largely affected by the numbers of data set and model parameters el khaiary and malash 2011 and is not sufficient for kinetic and equilibrium model selection azizian and yahyaei 2006 bolster and hornberger 2007 di bucchianico 2008 saiers and hornberger 1996 simonin 2016 criteria considering both quantity of data and complexity of models are considered superior to the error equations cai et al 2015 el khaiary and malash 2011 janetti et al 2012 akaike s information criterion aic modified akaike information criterion aicc bayesian information criterion bic and hannan information criterion hic based on maximum likelihood theory were used to identify subsurface hydrology and groundwater hydrochemical models in previous studies dai et al 2006 2012 samper and neuman 1989a 1989b 1989c ye et al 2008 the model criteria were successfully applied to compare kinetic and equilibrium models with different complexity aic and aicc rank multiple equilibrium isotherms that have different numbers of parameters akpa and unuabonah 2011 zhang et al 2018b geochemical adsorption mechanism was identified through selecting best kinetic model through aic and bic cai et al 2015 these criteria were found sensitive to model performance and reducing overfitting caused by models with more parameters as number of parameters is confirmed to be important for model ranking we hence use these criteria in our study to determine the kinetic and equilibrium model with the best fit and least parameters the major objective of this work is to evaluate the adsorption and transport of cr vi on several natural sediments the effects of sediment characteristics and controlling factors such as ph and solid solution ratio were considered another objective is to select the most appropriate model for adsorption mechanism through model selection criteria specifically six sediments with different physical and chemical characteristics were collected from a representative alluvial area in qiqihar heilongjiang china to conduct both batch and column experiments batch adsorption parameters were evaluated by three kinetic models and three equilibrium isotherm equations model selection criteria aic bic aicc hic were used for model identification the breakthrough curves of column experiments were calibrated with a deterministic equilibrium model and a chemical non equilibrium model in cxtfit toride et al 1995 to estimate the transport and adsorption parameters respectively 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description a typical alluvial plain in the west of songnen plain was selected as a case study fig 1 the hydrogeological conditions of the study site were described in previous studies in detail li 2016 zhang et al 2012 only a brief introduction is provided in this paper the study site locates in qiqihar heilongjiang province in northeast china qiqihar is one of the important old industrial bases in china in the process of urbanization of such heavy industrial cities industrial activities might easily affect groundwater quality currently there is no evidence of cr contamination in this area however cr containing industrial effluent is still a contamination risk in this area via potential leakage from treatment oxidation ponds li 2016 the site is in a fluvial and lacustrine sedimentary environment and deposited thick pleistocene unconsolidated sediments since the quaternary loose sediments with large thickness created favorable conditions for groundwater formation and distribution to form the main aquifer in this area the topography in this area shows obvious zonation in the transverse direction of low floodplain high floodplain and low hillock plain fig 1 the sampling sites were selected on different geomorphic terraces along the east west direction before sampling the topsoil rich in organic matter and plant roots as well as non depositional artificial miscellaneous fill about 20 30 cm was removed we collected six sediment samples as s1 to s6 at the depth 60 86 116 30 50 46 cm specifically the groundwater table in study area was 2 12 m li et al 2014 s1 and s3 were loamy sand s2 and s6 were sandy loam s4 was silty loam clay and s5 was loam the sediment samples were air dried for two days and sieved through a 2 mm stainless steel screen before the experiments grain size distributions of the samples were determined by a bettersize2000 laser grain size analyzer the sedimentary types were identified through the grain size distributions subjected to an international standard for soil texture classification the major chemical components of the sediments were analyzed by x ray fluorescence spectrometer xrf the major mineral phases were identified with a dx 2700 x ray diffractometer xrd the content range of total cr in the sediments was between 37 66 and 56 75 mg kg close to the local background value thus it is neglected in the subsequent experiments 2 2 batch experiments chromium vi solutions were prepared with k2cr2o7 guarantee reagent ph was adjusted to 2 5 by 10 wt hcl and 10 mol l naoh solution to mimic industrial effluent containing cr vi with high acidity sthiannopkao and sreesai 2009 all the batch experiments were performed at room temperature 25 1 c in a sha c oscillator at 200 round min rpm each sample in a conical flask contained 2 g dried sediment and 50 ml cr solution all the conical flasks were sealed with parafilm to exclude evaporation after adsorption 10 ml suspension was collected and centrifuged to separate the aqueous phase from the solid phase then the supernatant was filtered with 0 45 um polyethersulfone pes filters the concentration of cr vi was analyzed by 1 5 diphenylcarbohydrazide spectrophotometric method at 540 nm wavelength with a lambda365 uv vis spectrophotometer bartlett and james 1979 control experiments without cr vi in the solution were also conducted under each test condition for the investigations of controlling factors of ph and solid solution ratio sample s6 was selected as the sorbent because of its medium grain size and a moderate equilibrium time for the effect of ph on adsorption initial ph of the solutions was adjusted ranging from 1 to 5 for the effect of solid solution ratio soil mass from 2 to 5 g was added to 50 ml solution with solid solution ratios of 1 25 3 50 2 25 and 1 10 g ml respectively for batch kinetic adsorption experiments the initial concentration of cr vi was assigned 5 mg l to study the amount of adsorbed cr vi changing over time cr vi concentrations were analyzed at appropriate time intervals till the concentrations did not show any obvious alteration which was considered equilibrium in order to prevent the change of solid solution ratio caused by concentration analysis for each type of sediments three parallel experiments were conducted with same amount of sediment and initial solution at each time point and the average adsorption amounts were calculated the batch equilibrium adsorption experiments were set with initial cr vi concentrations of 2 5 10 20 30 40 and 50 mg l followed with 48 h oscillation to obtain relationships between the adsorbed cr vi and the aqueous concentrations at equilibrium for each initial concentration above three parallel experiments were conducted and the average adsorption amounts were calculated the adsorption amount was calculated by eq 1 günay et al 2007 1 q b v c 0 c m where qb is the amount of cr vi adsorbed mg kg v is the volume of solution ml c0 is the initial concentration mg l c is the equilibrium concentration mg l m is the mass of the sorbent g the slope of the amount of cr vi adsorbed at equilibrium and the equilibrium concentration can be defined as distribution coefficient kd which characterize the adsorption capacity of adsorbent for heavy metal in aquatic environment morera et al 2001 2 3 column experiments the transport experiments were conducted in plexiglass columns the diameter of the columns for s1 s2 and s3 was 6 cm and the filling height was 10 cm due to low permeability and difficulty of flows with this column size for s4 s5 and s6 smaller columns with 2 cm diameter and filling height 1 cm were used instead columns were packed following the density measured in the field of 1 6 g cm3 the top and bottom of each column were covered with a layer of gravel to make influent evenly infiltrate from top and prevent loss of the sediments from bottom each column was then filled with distilled water and porosity was calculated by the volume of water filled the flowrate was set with 0 5 ml min for the large columns and 0 25 ml min for the small columns with peristaltic pumps respectively all the column experiments were conducted at room temperature 25 1 c the settings of the columns are summarized in table 1 before the experiments each column was leached by distilled water to determine the background concentration of cr vi and then to remove residual mobile cr vi till its concentration was under detection limit then a 200 mg l nacl solution was injected into the columns as non reactive tracers the electronic conductivity was measured at the outlets of the columns with a real time electrode probe the breakthrough curve was electrical conductivity in the adsorption experiments the influent cr vi concentration was 5 mg l with initial ph 2 5 the influent was injected from the top of the column chromium vi concentration in the effluent was analyzed every 20 min till steady state condition was reached in the desorption experiments the influent solution was cr vi free and injected after the adsorption process attaining steady state the adsorption amount of each column can be estimated by the following equation 2 q c c 0 c d v m where qc is the amount of cr vi adsorbed mg kg v is the volume of the effluent solution ml c0 is the concentration in influent mg l c is the concentration in effluent solution mg l m is the mass of the sorbent g 2 4 kinetic and equilibrium models 2 4 1 kinetic models rate constant was evaluated by fitting the kinetic experimental data with selected adsorption kinetic models commonly used kinetic models of pseudo first order pseudo second order and elovich models were applied to evaluate our experimental results the linear form of pseudo

re 1 qeβ is defined as the approaching equilibrium factor with dimensionless elovich equation when qe is determined through kinetic experiment te and re can be evaluated through nonlinear curve fitting with qe fixed 2 4 2 equilibrium adsorption isotherms the equilibrium adsorption of cr vi on these sediments was described with henry langmuir and freundlich isotherms henry isotherm describes a linear dependence between the adsorption and the equilibrium concentration which is defined 6 q e k d c e where qe is the concentration of cr vi adsorbed at equilibrium mg kg ce is concentration at

transport cxtfit code provides several mathematical models for equilibrium and non equilibrium transport problems toride et al 1995 to simplify the solutions and reduce the number of parameters to be estimated the one dimensional 1 d equilibrium advection dispersion equation was used to describe the transport of nacl solution in this study assuming no production and degradation of the solute the

transport of reactive solute subjected to adsorption is affected by a variety of chemical non equilibrium processes the two site non equilibrium theory assumes that the adsorption sites can be divided into two types of chemical adsorption processes type i assumes that adsorption is an instantaneous process to reach equilibrium type ii considers adsorption is time dependent and governed by the first

distributions six sediment samples were classified as loamy sand sandy loam silty loam clay and loam table 3 presents the major chemical and mineral components of the sediments the major mineral compositions of sediments in the study site were quartz feldspar and plagioclase trace amounts of calcite chlorite and hornblende also existed in the sediments the predominant components of clay minerals were illite and smectite the major chemical composition of sediments was silicon oxide and the major metallic oxide was aluminum oxide followed by iron oxides the loss on ignition of all the sediments suggested the level of organic matter content d50 average grain size μm ssa specific surface area m2 g loi loss on ignition 3 2 batch experiments 3 2 1 adsorption kinetics the kinetic data for all sediments under the condition of initial 5 mg l cr vi concentration at 25 c are plotted in fig 2 all the sediments exhibited a rapid adsorption in the first a few minutes following with a progressively slower adsorption the samples s1 s2 and s3 attained nearly equilibrium within three hours and the samples s4 s5 and s6 took a much longer time to reach equilibrium with larger adsorption capacities we interpret that grain sizes surface area and clay mineral contents control the adsorption capacity and the equilibrium time of these sediments s4 s5 and s6 presented higher adsorption capacity with smaller grain sizes s5 showed the highest adsorption capacity among the six samples with the highest mineral content although its grain size was not the finest besides the ph of suspension after mixing and at equilibrium were detected the suspension ph before adsorption was 2 64 2 77 2 61 2 78 2 72 2 68 for s1 s6 after mixing with initial solution at ph 2 5 this was due to the different acid buffering capacities of sediments after adsorption the ph turned to 3 01 3 8 3 19 4 15 3 98 3 58 for s1 s6 respectively this indicated the adsorption processes consumed hydrogen ions the greater the adsorption capacity the more hydrogen ions consumed also mineral dissolution may occur during adsorption the kinetic parameters evaluated from the three kinetic models and the values of aic aicc bic hic from these three models are summarized in table 4 the nonlinear curve fitting method was used to fit all the data and the value of the objective function φ was calculated in terms of correlation coefficient pseudo first order model showed a good match to the experimental data correlation coefficients 0 9 instead the model selection criteria suggested that elovich equation was superior to other two models for the kinetic data of s5 and s6 and pseudo second order equation showed the best fitness for s3 the time to reach equilibrium evaluated from elovich equation was in good agreement with the experimental data except s4 and s5 of which the evaluated equilibrium time was longer than the actual experimental result the fitted curves of elovich equation for s4 and s5 with slow adsorption rate were slightly lower than the experimental observation data at equilibrium resulting in overestimated time to reach equilibrium the expected value of qe was the experimental observed mass of cr vi adsorbed at equilibrium the qe evaluated from model with better prediction should be closer to expected qe the values of qe of the pseudo first order model were closer to the expected qe than pseudo second order for all the samples due to its goodness of fit to observation data the results were also supported by model selection criteria for sample s3 the performance of both pseudo first order and pseudo second order model were similar but the values of model selection criteria varied widely because model selection criteria considered the number of model parameter and data they were more sensitive to models with similar performance as shown in table 4 the rate constants of adsorption k1 and k2 from both pseudo first order equation and pseudo second order equation revealed large differences among the sediments the rate constants of s4 s6 were of one to two orders of magnitude smaller than that of s1 s3 with similar clay mineral contents the rate constant of s2 was much higher than that of s4 and s6 this indicated that grain size was the most important rate limiting factor sediments with greater grain sizes were more rapidly to achieve adsorption equilibrium the range of rate constants was similar to the results of previous studies of cr vi adsorption on a loamy sand soil fonseca et al 2009a 3 2 2 equilibrium adsorption isotherms the equilibrium adsorption capacities of six sediments versus concentration are plotted in fig 3 with the increase of initial concentration the adsorption capacity of these sediments increased the adsorption parameters evaluated by equilibrium models and values of aic aicc bic hic calculated are summarized in table 5 freundlich model showed the highest correlation coefficients for all sediments 0 97 according to the evaluations of aic aicc bic hic langmuir model was favorable for s1 s2 and s3 this indicated that langmuir model was more suitable for coarse grained sediments with less adsorption capacity freundlich performed well in describing fine grained sediments with large adsorption capacity the models selected by model selection criteria had the minimum values of objective function it demonstrated that for the models considered in our study model selection criteria still selected the best fit models when considering number of parameters and available data as shown in table 5 linear distribution coefficient kd and freundlich adsorption coefficient kf measured the adsorption capacity of each sediment increasing from 0 897 to 6 430 l kg and 1 599 to 59 897 l kg due to changes in sediment types the order of adsorption capacity of these sediments according to henry and freundlich isotherm was s5 s4 s6 s2 s3 s1 in table 5 the values of 1 n of these sediments ranged from 0 to 1 indicating favorable adsorption conditions chen and zhang 2014 n was higher for s4 and s5 suggesting that adsorption site energy was more heterogeneous there was a positive correlation 0 959 between the values of n and langmuir adsorption coefficient kl indicating that the heterogeneity of surface site energy enhanced the attachment between adsorbate and sediment surface qm estimated by the langmuir isotherm was much higher than that measured in the experiments especially for s1 s3 and s6 this was because the range of initial concentrations was relatively low for s1 s3 and s6 resulting in klce 1 leading to almost linear relationship between equilibrium concentration and adsorption capacity 3 2 3 effects of ph and solid solution ratio on adsorption ph is one of the major factors that influence the adsorption process by changing the surface properties of soil fig 4 a shows the adsorption capacity of cr vi as a function of initial ph cr vi adsorption capacity decreased with increasing ph adsorption of cr vi increased dramatically when ph dropped below 3 this was consistent with the observation from literature mpouras et al 2017 namasivayam and sureshkumar 2008 weng et al 2008 the reason is that the dominant form of cr vi is hcro4 under more acidic conditions ajouyed et al 2010 robertson 1975 low ph results in positive charge on sediment surface and electrostatically attracts negatively charged hcro4 with increasing ph the dominant form of cr vi changs to cro4 2 increasing oh ions in the solution results in the decrease of attractive surface charge and hinders the diffusion of cro4 2 the adsorption of cr vi is also a proton consuming hydroxyl releasing reaction 23 s oh hcro4 h s hcro4 h2o the symbol s oh represents potential surface site thus the adsorption of the cr vi was promoted by high acidity fig 4b shows cr vi adsorption capacity as a function of solid to solution ratio g ml the adsorption capacity decreased as the ratio increased chang et al 2002 du and hayashi 2006 and puls et al 1991 reported similar results of the effect of solid solution ratio although the total amount of cr vi adsorbed increased as solid to solution ratio increased the adsorption capacity per unit mass decreased the reason is that higher sorbent concentration diluting the sorbate concentration at higher solid solution ratios chang et al 2002 the cr vi concentration distributes on sediment of unit mass decreases as the mass of sediment increases when reducing the mass of solids the available surface sites of adsorbent are easier to reach saturation since the adsorption is a surface driven process therefore the solid to solution ratio of 1 25 was selected to achieve a larger adsorption capacity in other experiments of this study 3 2 4 effects of grain size and mineralogy on adsorption although the sediments in this study were natural without sieving the grain sizes of each sediment were distinctive table 1 as grain size decreased the sediment adsorption capacity increased and the adsorption rate decreased with longer equilibrium time one probable reason is that the decrease of grain size leads to the increase of specific surface area with large number of binding sites exposed another reason is that the compositions of sediments varies in different grain size ranges it was proved in literatures that the grain size fractions of soils led to different chemical compositions mpouras et al 2017 sangster et al 2015 wu et al 2012 the fraction which dominates the adsorption process clay minerals amorphous fe al oxide and organic matters are usually with small grain sizes in this study the predominant components of clay minerals were illite and smectite which were with layer lattice structures composed of silicon and aluminum oxide the sediments also contained a small amount of iron oxide therefore there are more than one type of surface sites at which adsorption can occur according to the surface complexation mechanism the available sites for complexation are hydroxylated aluminum and silicon atoms exposed on the surface with ratios dictated by clay crystal structure additionally iron sites may exist as metal hydroxide secondary surface coatings wang et al 2018 ward and bassett 1990 3 3 column experiments the cr vi breakthrough curves of all the columns at the outlet are shown in fig 5 the durations of the cr vi injection phase for s1 to s6 were 720 1850 1434 345 215 235 min respectively the tailings in the breakthrough curves could be due to the existence of multiple porosity structures in the samples the desorption results table 6 clearly showed that only a fraction of the absorbed pool was desorbable incomplete desorption indicated the appearance of diffusion of cr vi from edge to interlayer regions liu et al 2003 it also suggested that sediment type was a key factor for cr vi adsorption as the same type of sediments had similar recovery rate as grain size became smaller the adsorption capacity increased and cr vi adsorption tended to be irreversible a plausible explanation for this finding is that the reaction between cr vi and sediments with smaller grain sizes clay and loam are dominated by irreversible chemical adsorption cr vi ions are bound to the interlayer regions by chemical bonds which are much stronger than electrostatic attraction larger specific surface area contributes to the diffusion of ions to interlayer region leading to more chemical adsorption the adsorbed ions eventually enter the crystal lattice and become a portion demir 2015 sun et al 2019 it is also possible that cr vi ions adsorbed on sediments via electrostatic attraction are then reduced to cr iii by adjacent electron donor groups malkoc et al 2006 park et al 2005 making it irreversible reversible physical adsorption controlled by electrostatic attraction occurs more in the sediments with larger grain sizes loamy sand which is easily to desorb the difference in recovery rates is the result of the combination of two mechanisms of adsorption it is also believed that metal ions firstly adsorb on sediments via irreversible chemical adsorption till saturated and only reversible adsorption occurs thereafter chen et al 2000 kan et al 1998 silva yumi et al 2018 3 4 evaluation of transport and adsorption parameters the estimation of relevant parameters was performed with inverse method firstly transport parameters were evaluated with experimental data of cl in the case of r 1 then the adsorption parameters were evaluated with cr vi adsorption experimental data the cxtfit code with equilibrium and two site non equilibrium models was used for parameter estimation toride et al 1995 transport and adsorption parameters estimated by inverse simulations are presented in table 7 high correlation coefficients 0 99 suggested good fittings of these parameters fig 6 shows the breakthrough curves of cl fitted by equilibrium model fig 7 shows the breakthrough curves of cr vi fitted by two site non equilibrium model it denoted that two site non equilibrium model properly described the mobility of cr vi in different sediments with high correlation coefficients 0 99 high retardation factor r of s4 s5 and s6 represented high adsorption capacity and low mobility both β the ratio of instantaneous adsorption sites to rate limited sites and ω the ratio of hydraulic retention time to adsorption characteristic time were 1 suggesting that it was not an instantaneous but a rate limited adsorption process the higher value of ω of s2 than other sediments indicated that the fraction of the type 2 adsorption sites which was assumed to be kinetic dependent was the dominant sites for retardation process the distribution coefficient kd of column experiments was calculated from eq 22 the results compared to the batch experiments are shown in fig 8 the kd of batch experiments at a certain concentration was calculated through the mass of adsorption divided by equilibrium concentration observed kd was overall higher for batch experiments than that for column experiments excluding s6 this may be an overestimation of parameters in batch experiments which is due to two reasons maszkowska et al 2013 vereecken et al 2011 first different experiment protocols result in different observed adsorption capacities the optimized contact between sediment particles and solution occurs with continuously shaking which also results in faster adsorption rate in batch experiments second the packing strategy in the columns leads to a high solid solution ratio limits cr vi adsorption in sediments for s6 the column derived kd was higher than the batch derived kd which was also observed in previous studies porro et al 2000 srinivasan and sarmah 2014 it is possible that not only adsorption but also other additional retention mechanisms occur in the column experiments e g reduction and precipitation saturated packed column provides an anaerobic condition for cr vi being reduced to cr iii while batch experiments are conducted in aerobic conditions because the solution is in full contact with the air all the time seo et al 2008 considered that the adsorption is the only process for retention in batch experiments as bacteria can also provide adsorption sites for metal ions templeton et al 2003 it is not sure whether there is a microbial effect as the sediments used in this study was not sterilized therefore it is also possible for weak biosorption of bacteria resulting in a higher kd for s6 4 model uncertainties although the retention of cr vi was mainly attributed to the adsorption properties of different types of sediments in this study uncertainty exists regarding the role of organic matter om and other reducing agents in the retention of cr in the sediments the cr iii was not detected in either of the solutions or the effluent of batch and column experiments of this study however this does not mean that cr vi is not reduced as cr iii is of less mobility and easy to form sparingly soluble complexes and precipitate in studies of hong et al 2012 and jardine et al 2011 the species of cr precipitated in sediments was analyzed through spectroscopic methods and trivalent state was detected the part of reduction in retention usually caused by om could not be neglected in those cases banks et al 2006 guha et al 2001 hong et al 2012 molinero huguet et al 2004 in addition iron also plays an important role in the retention of cr because fe ii has a strong reductive ability and can form complexes with reduced species zhang et al 2008 though fe iii does not react directly with cr vi it can provide positive charge on the surface for the adsorption of cr vi and cr iii choppala et al 2013 ding et al 2016 the results of this study also suggested the potential of reduction by om first although the adsorption distribution coefficient of batch experiments tended to be overestimated the degree of overestimation was different especially the column derived kd was higher than the batch derived kd for s6 discussed in section 3 4 second the order of adsorption capacity is almost the same as that of loi except for s4 and s5 loi representing the content of organic matter is a widely used methods for measuring om contents in soil and had good relationships with the contents of organic carbon hoogsteen et al 2015 wright et al 2008 in the case of low om contents it is still possible for solid phase associated om to promote the reduction of cr vi to cr iii jardine et al 2011 finally s4 and s5 with relatively high loi had lowest recovery rates among all the sediments this indicates a possibility that the reduction accounts for a large proportion of the irreversible part which is consistent with the findings of hong et al 2012 as a result of complex and wide variety of crystalline structures textural properties and chemical compositions of sediments few studies clarified the statistical relationship between reduction and om contents natural om may exist as secondary coatings on the mineral surface significantly contribute to reduction and either increase or decrease the adsorption of heavy metals removal of om from soil does not always reduce retention instead it may promote the adsorption as more surface bonding sites are exposed usman 2008 the mechanisms of interaction between cr vi and om also depend on the type of om compounds cumberland et al 2016 overall there is a possibility that cr vi removed by sediments from aqueous solution undergoes adsorption coupled reduction cr vi is directly reduced to cr iii by reducing agents such as fe ii then chromic hydroxide cr oh 3 forms and is removed by adsorption and or precipitation also the cr vi of anionic adsorption binding on the surface sites can also be reduced to cr iii by electrons provided by om hong et al 2012 park et al 2005 tran et al 2017 many previous studies attributed the retention of cr vi only to adsorption or reduction however considering cr iii have completely different characteristics with cr vi especially different toxicity resulting in different degree of threat to the environment the uncertainty brought by the reduction combined adsorption is worthy of further study 5 conclusions this study investigated adsorption and transport of cr vi in different types of natural unconsolidated sediments through batch and column experiments we considered the effects of potential key controlling factors including solution ph solid solution ratio grain size and clay mineral and organic matter content the following results extracted from this work will contribute to a better understanding of the environmental fate of cr vi the order of adsorption capacity was s5 s4 s6 s2 s3 and s1 loam silty loam clay two sandy loam and two loamy sand respectively four model selection criteria of aic aicc bic and hic successfully evaluated the kinetic and equilibrium models in this study pseudo first order equation best described s1 s2 and s4 pseudo second order equation showed the best match for s3 elovich equation well described a chemical adsorption process of s5 and s6 equilibrium studies showed that s1 s2 and s3 were best fitted by freundlich isotherm and s4 s5 s6 were best fitted by langmuir isotherm these statistical model selection criteria highlighted the importance of considering the number of model parameters and experimental data to obtain reliable parameters and robust prediction which suggests their promising applications in identification of groundwater models with different complexity the adsorption capacity was significantly affected by ph and solid solution ratio the increase of the solution ph and solid solution ratio resulted in the decrease of the adsorption of cr vi the properties of sediments especially the grain size and clay minerals were the key factors controlling the adsorption capacity and rate higher adsorption capacity and lower adsorption rate were observed in the sediments with smaller grain size and higher clay mineral content the two site non equilibrium model fitted well the transport of cr vi in all sediments evaluated in this study the differences in adsorption parameter estimated showed environmental implication that sediment types should be considered in cr vi transport prediction especially clay aquitard and sediments with high clay mineral content would be a concern due to their high retention capacity and potential of a long term impact on groundwater quality the adsorption levels evaluated in this study of different sediments will guide groundwater risk assessment and protection in qiqihar or other sites with similar sediment types credit authorship contribution statement yang cao

4494,this paper considered the behavior of an incompressible fluid sediment and solid particles debris at the time of a dam break this process was studied numerically on the basis of three dimensional reynolds averaged navier stokes equations in combination with the k ω turbulence model the vof volume of fluid method was used to simulate the fluid and sediment in order to simulate the movement of water and sediment a combination of newtonian and non newtonian models was carried out the effect of water flow on the transport of solid particles and moving sediments is also considered in order to be convinced of the effectiveness and reliability of the model the numerical results were compared with experimental data and with calculated data performed by other authors further a proven mathematical model is applied to numerically simulate the movement of fluid behind the dam during the break of the dam body with a riverbed landscape taking into account multi level protection the pressure that the water flow exerts on the additional dam in downstream in the case of cylindrical columns and without them was calculated since the columns block the path of solid particles the pressure exerted on the additional dam is noticeably reduced and in this case it can be assumed that a potential dam break will not occur and if it does then with the least damage this configuration imitates a robust multi level protection system that can be used to prevent the serious consequences of a dam failure keywords multilevel protection dpm and mpm models interaction of macroscopic particles flood zones vof method 1 introduction floods happen for several reasons prolonged torrential rains melting glaciers tsunamis and the reason we are interested in is the dams break or reservoirs a dam break occurs when a reservoir or dam can no longer hold a strong water pressure due to an earthquake wear of the dam itself etc morris 2000 despite the fact that to date a lot of work has been done on the dam break process this problem of hydraulic engineering remains relevant to this day in connection with the danger posed to the entire human society abbasi et al 2010 over the past several decades due to the increase in the number of accidents more attention has been paid to the analysis of dam break the problem raised in this paper is very relevant for the republic of kazakhstan today the dam break of the sardoba dam on may 1 2020 in uzbekistan also affected the southern regions of kazakhstan in the border areas of the turkestan region 14 settlements were flooded more than 30 thousand people were evacuated so far no official conclusions have been given on this issue although there is a large amount of work on this described problem of hydraulic engineering it is still relevant due to the serious danger posed to the entire human society abbasi et al 2010 the consequences of a dam break are large scale floods which lead to serious consequences from catastrophic damage to infrastructure and property of the population to casualties among the population chanson 2006 such unfortunate events can be minimized by anticipating potential hazards in advance water breakthrough observation can be performed using a laboratory experiment oertel and bung 2012 soares frazão and zech 2007 chen et al 2014 fraccarollo and toro 1995 stansby et al 1998 spinewine and zech 2007 haltas et al 2016a 2016b or numerical simulation cunge et al 1980 chaudhry 1993 morris 2000 experimental studies on dam breaks are presented in many works and are mainly considered in a simplified rectangular channel shape the popularity of numerical modeling increases with the growth of computing power the most accurate numerical analysis is achieved when taking into account various natural constituent factors zanuttigh and lamberti 2011 wang et al 2017 of the dam break the shape of the river cross section and its complex relief the presence of homogeneous sand mud layer and hard stone particles bed composition with water flow after the dam break water wave mainly propagates along the bottom of the riverbed downstream it is much more difficult to predict the behavior of fluid in a channel with a complex topography that results from the natural tortuosity of river beds channel configuration has a significant impact on the modality of wave distribution ozmen cagatay et al 2014 kocaman et al 2020 wang et al 2019 kocaman and ozmen cagatay 2012 and the more complex the configuration the more difficult it is to predict the behavior of the wave mentioning about the dam break problem it should be noticed that this process involves the transfer of not only water flow but also various deposits in the form of mud clay sand etc coussot 1995 in numerical simulations a non newtonian fluid is most often used to simulate such bottom sediments the combination of newtonian and non newtonian fluids makes it possible to study multilayer natural flows for example a mixture of water and mud flows debris clay sand etc to date there are a number of studies in which the dam break process is considered only by non newtonian fluids boroomand et al 2007 ancey and cochard 2009 chambon et al 2009 hosseinzadeh tabrizi and ghaeini hessaroeyeh 2017 movahedi et al 2018 issakhov and zhandaulet 2020a 2020b the use of a non newtonian fluid makes it possible to establish the dependence of fluid viscosity on stress gotoh and fredsøe 2000 spinewine and zech 2007 have developed a two layer one dimensional model to simulate dam break over moving layers in cao et al 2004 a one dimensional model of the flow around the dam over the moving layers was also proposed which taking into account the uneven transport of sediments and their influence on the water flow in the channel this work was subsequently extended to a two dimensional model in simpson and castelltort 2006 for free surface flow and sediment transport often along with the transport of the mud layer a process of soil movement occurs which entails important morphological changes in the river valley capart et al 2007 in the paper biswal et al 2018 the authors developed a numerical model of a dam break the main factor of which is the coefficient of friction between layers the developed model solves the system of two dimensional reynolds averaged navier stokes equations rans for closing the k ε turbulent model was used a similar approach to using the rans equations in combination with turbulent models can be found in studies shigematsu et al 2004 quecedo et al 2005 abdolmaleki et al 2004 the paper also considered the addition of particulate matter to simulate rocks dam debris and other residual material studies of the water flow with solid particles as well as the interactions between them have been considered in many works two dimensional cases were considered in papers lube et al 2005 balmforth and kerswell 2005 issakhov et al 2020 and in papers li and zhao 2018 canelas et al 2016 ward et al 2009 di cristo et al 2010 minussi and maciel 2012 park et al 2018 zhang et al 2009 ancey et al 2013 saramito et al 2013 three dimensional cases were considered in the paper proposed by kim and yoon 2020 the numerical cfd dem computational fluid dynamics and discrete element method method was used to study the effect that fluid density has on a liquid gas particle multiphase medium the authors found that despite the value of the liquid density the position of the liquid front for the liquid gas medium will be ahead of the position for the liquid gas particle medium the liquid gas particle flow has also been considered in other study guo and morita 2013 compared changes in the behavior of the liquid gas particle medium depending on the height of the particle layer the authors demonstrated that the position of the liquid front changed much faster if the height of the particle layer increased in addition to the height of the particle layer the influence of the particles number on the multiphase liquid gas particle flow is considered the influence of the particles number on the liquid gas particle flow behavior has been studied lin and chen 2013 the authors found that as the concentration decreases the flow rate increases and the momentum in turn decreases in addition they demonstrated the influence of the friction coefficient stiffness and damping coefficient of particles the behavior of such hardstone particles can be quite unpredictable according to fan et al 2012 they can even completely block the free water flow movement in the channel in the numerical simulation of granular particles the moving particle method mps is very popular which allows you to study the interaction of a solid with a liquid this method was successfully applied in koshizuka et al 1998 to simulate a moving rigid body in breaking waves on slopes the study also reports that the mps method is a reliable approach for modeling liquid solid mixture flow and does not need to track the interface between phases in the work issakhov et al 2018 obstacles blocking the path of water flow were investigated due to the various shapes of the obstacles the pressure exerted on the dam surface has decreased by 3 times issakhov and imanberdiyeva 2019 studied the water flow behavior during a dam break on the complex uneven relief of the river channel taking into account the uneven channel bottom softens the idealized conditions adopted in the course of solving such problems in the paper issakhov and zhandaulet 2020a presents a numerical model of the dam break flows with the natural landscape of the river modeling the real coastal contours of the river allowed for a better study of the dam break process which is the closest to natural conditions in a study issakhov and zhandaulet 2020b numerical simulations were carried out in moving layers of the earth with varying sediment thicknesses to maximize pressure reduction the obtained numerical results of 3d modeling will allow predicting the dynamic process of sludge transfer a non newtonian liquid with a density ρ 2630 kg m3 was taken as the basis of the mud impurity the main problem of the work issakhov et al 2020 was to study the behavior of macroscopic particles stones dam debris debris during the dam break flows one of the limitations in the course of this work is the idealized spherical shape of particles as well as material particle sizes and other natural conditions to protect urban areas from dam break flows are often constructed main and additional dams so in real life cases it should be borne in mind that the main dam is usually used to contain and collect water the main load falls on the main dam while the additional dam acts as additional protection for the population however the worst case cannot be ignored because with large volumes of water complete and partial collapse of the main dam can occur issakhov et al 2020 as a result there is a great risk that the mud rock flow which now contains debris from the main dam will put more stress on the additional dam di cristo et al 2010 ancey et al 2013 however it should be borne in mind that to carry out full scale three dimensional modeling of a dam break for a complex river bed haltas et al 2016a 2016b taking into account the mud stone flow large computer resources will be needed which leads to great restrictions to carry out this calculation in an adequate time simplifications of the mathematical model are carried out and many important factors are not taken into account in this work to take into account important factors the reduced size of the computational area with some simplifications in the river beds was used to conduct a complete analysis of the modified mathematical model which takes into account four phases air water mud and stones of various sizes i e complex motion of newtonian and non newtonian fluid chambon et al 2009 movahedi et al 2018 with particles of various sizes to take into account all the above processes adaptations of mathematical models were carried out from papers issakhov et al 2018 issakhov and imanberdiyeva 2019 a mathematical model was used to simulate the flow of water movement for various reliefs of the computational area from papers issakhov and zhandaulet 2020a 2020b mathematical models were used to simulate the water flow and mud movement while from paper issakhov et al 2020 a mathematical model was used to simulate the flow of water movement with particles of various sizes in this work the adaptation and modification of the mathematical model were carried out in order to take into account all these processes in this paper an assessment of the impact of a multi level protective column on the propagation of a water wave and pressure distribution during a dam break was considered for maximum protection of the additional dam from mud stone flow multi level protection in the form of cylindrical columns is being constructed in the space between the dams the first row of cylindrical columns blocks the path of large particles the second row prevents the passage of smaller particles during real dam breaks not only the transfer of water flow is involved but also various deposits in the form of mud clay sand etc as well as rocky debris in the heterogeneous terrain so the water breaks through the main dam and the resulting mud stone flow which is formed after the collapse of the main dam goes downstream to the additional dam taking these factors into account brings the considered problem as closely as possible to the real problem to solve the problem numerically the navier stokes equation was modified to take into account the transportation of mud and rocky debris and additional equations were added to describe the motion of solid particles the new type of multi level protection proposed in this work which consists of two rows of cylindrical columns by their location which prevents any passage of solid particles to the additional dam in the form of a trapezoid in open river channels has reduced the shock pressure on the additional dam from the mud stone flow and accordingly minimizes the damage to the main dam these complex processes are shown in the form of comparative figures and illustrations 2 the governing equations to describe the process 3d averaged navier stokes equations and continuity equation

different phases the vof method is applied hirt and nichols 1981 to close the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations rans a shear stress transport sst k ω turbulent model for two variables k and ω is applied 2 1 discrete phase model dpm currently there are two methods for the numerical calculation of multiphase flows the euler euler and euler lagrange 2 1 1 euler lagrange approach the application of lagrange model of the dpm follows the euler lagrange method the liquid phase is taken as continuous by solving the rans equations while the dispersed phase is found by tracking a large number of particles through the found flow field the momentum mass and energy transfer between the continuous and dispersed phases can take place the method is simplified when interactions between particles can be neglected and claims that the dispersed second phase fill a small volume fraction when the large mass load is acceptable m particles m fluid the particle trajectories are found particularly at regular intervals when finding the continuous phase 2 1 2 the balance of forces acting on particles this model builds the trajectory of a particle in the discrete phase integrating the law of forces equilibrium acting on the particle which is presented in the lagrangian reference frame the balance of forces equates the inertia of a particle with the forces acting on the particle and

approach simulates the behavior of sufficiently large macroscopic solid particles that can interact with fluid flow region walls and different particles this method is useful to lagrangian particle flows that cannot be found by applying conventional point mass particle method the particle size like that flow cannot be neglected in the situation the particle volume should be considered when simulating collisions and hydrodynamics the mpm approach ensures a specific regime that considers the next 1 the attraction forces between particles with walls and particles 2 accumulation and sedimentation of particles 3 collision of particle particle and particle particle with walls 4 calculation of torque and resistance on particles 5 flow blocking and impulse transmission all details of the use of these models are described in the papers chara and kysela 2018 luchini et al 2015 wadnerkar et al 2016 issakhov and imanberdiyeva 2019 issakhov and zhandaulet 2020a 2020b 3 numerical simulation algorithm for the numerical solution of this system of eqs 1 3 the piso algorithm was chosen issa 1986 jang et al 1986 issakhov and imanberdiyeva 2019 issakhov et al 2018 2021 issakhov and zhandaulet 2020a 2020b issakhov 2016 issakhov and omarova 2020 2021 the piso is originally developed for non iterative simulation of non steady compressible flow but can be usefully adjusted to steady problems and a pressure velocity calculation procedure for the navier stokes equations the piso consists of a totally three steps which were constructed to ensure mass conservation 1 the predictor

corrected pressure and velocity components the equation for volume fraction was found by explicit time discretization in this method the standard finite difference interpolation schemes were used to the volume fraction values that were found at the previous time step 4 validation problem the proposed numerical model was validated by comparing the calculated data with a laboratory experiment cadam morris 2000 and in addition with the numerical values of other authors zhou et al 2004 kao and chang 2012 marsooli and wu 2014 the reservoir was 15 5 m long 1 0 m wide and 1 0 m high the vertical gate was located 15 5 m from the beginning of the reservoir the total length of the experimental flume together with the reservoir was 38 m width 1 m and height 1 m fig 1 a the symmetrical triangular dam from the metal was located at a distance of 10 m from the central gate and had the following length width and height dimensions 6 m 1 m and 0 4 m respectively fig 1b prior to the dam break the initial water depth was 0 75 m four control points g4 g10 g13 and g20 were located 4 m 10 m 13 m and 20 m downstream of the gate respectively fig 1c beyond the triangular dam was a layer of water 0 15 m high the boundary conditions at the end of the canal were a wall that prevents water from flowing out of the experimental setup the total simulation time was 40 s since the start of the dam break numerical simulation was performed with a time step δt 0 005 s the spatial step was taken as 0 02 m as a result the size of the computational grid was more than 4 752 500 elements fig 2 demonstrates the change in the depth of the water flow at the control points g4 g10 g13 g20 at different times until the end of the experiment the fortieth second the water level in the g4 point increases sharply at t 12 s and t 35 s such a jump can be explained by the fact that the passage of the incident shock wave at these moments of time and the reflection of the water flow from the dam upon impact the highest water level almost 0 6 m was seen on the g10 point which was located right in front of the triangular barrier the position of the third control point at the top of the triangular ledge explains the low water level in this point because when measuring the water depth the height of the dam was not taken into account the presence of a small volume of water after a dam is the cause of a hydraulic jump after the collision of water with a triangular ledge and finally reaching the end of the channel and hitting the closed lower boundary of the configuration the water reflects off the wall and returns back upstream in general the simulated and experimental profile of the free water surface showed satisfactory adjustment with the measurement and numerical values of other authors good agreement between the calculated data and the experiment was achieved through the use of the vof method which showed reliability and efficiency in modeling complex flows during a dam break 5 impact of a multilevel protection column on the propagation of a water wave good qualitative agreement between the experiment and the calculated data made it possible to proceed to carry out numerical simulation close to the real problem so the water breaks through the main dam and the resulting mud stone flow which is formed after the collapse of the main dam goes downstream to the additional dam to determine the impact of multi level protection in an open river channel on the additional dam from mud stone flow two problems were considered in the first case there was no multi level protection after the first trapezoidal dam and in the second case multi level protection was located at a distance of 0 925 m from it and at the same distance from each other fig 3 cylindrical obstacles located inside the channel interacted with solid particles like a strainer as a result of which not one granular particle did not pass beyond the second protective row of columns thus the pressure exerted by the mud flow on the additional dam is reduced fig 3d shows the location of cylindrical barriers the distance between them the diameter of the bases and the distance from the channel to the columns 5 1 geometry settings the configuration of this problem was as follows the length width and height of the channel were 11 88 m 0 3 m and 0 34 m respectively at the upstream of the canal there was a water reservoir with dimensions 4 65 m long 0 3 m wide and 0 25 m high directly behind the reservoir was a vertical gate that prevents water from spreading along the canal fig 3 the channel is located horizontally at a distance of 1 53 m from the gate there was a trapezoidal dam with a partially symmetrical hole in the middle mud deposits and solid particles were located inside the hole in successive three layer superposition on each other fig 3 the density of the non newtonian fluid which imitates the described mud deposits was taken as 2683 kg m3 and the density of solid particles was 2800 kg m3 the particle diameter of the first layer was 0 025 m the second layer was 0 018 m and 0 014 m of the third layer further along the path of the water flow there were two rows of cylindrical columns by their location which prevent any passage of solid particles to the additional dam in the form of a trapezoid since the diameters of the solid particles are larger than the gaps between the cylinders the diameter of the bases of the first cylindrical row was taken as 0 0325 m and that of the second row was 0 01 m while the height was taken as 0 1 m at the moment of opening the vertical gate the water flow begins to move downstream a detailed diagram of the described geometry is shown in fig 3 fig 3c shows a scheme of a trapezoidal dam initially observation of the water flow behavior in the presence of cylindrical columns and their absence was carried out using the control points g1 g2 g0 g5a and g8a the location in the form of coordinates is shown in table 1 and in fig 4 5 2 simulation results fig 5 shows the change in water depth in installed control points with and without cylindrical protective columns points g1 and g2 were located before the first two obstacles so no significant changes in the water level were noticed in them the g5a point showed an increase in water level from about 4 5 s which can be explained by an approaching impact on cylindrical columns and a reverse movement of a certain part of the water the same point showed the deepest water in the case of a cylinder shaped obstacle the flow reached a depth of 0 15 m in the absence of columns row in the g8a point the water flow moves much faster because at about t 6 2 s the water already reaches the trapezoidal dam which was not noticed in the case of the presence of a number of protective columns thus in addition to solid particles cylindrical columns also inhibit the water movement which in the future can be used to minimize the damaging effects of the dam fig 6 demonstrates the change in water level at some points in time which allows us to make the following observations in general there is no significant difference between the water flow behaviors before colliding with the first row of cylindrical columns a noticeable discrepancy was observed when the water reaches cylindrical obstacles the water level rises due to the collision of the stream against the obstacle such jumps were observed at all considered times t 1 9 s t 2 8 s t 3 3 s t 3 68 s t 4 74 s t 6 68 s fig 7 illustrates a three dimensional process of solid particles propagation without and with cylindrical obstacles at some moments of time t 1 9 s t 2 8 s t 3 3 s t 3 68 s t 4 74 s t 6 68 s fig 8 shows comparative graphs of the shock pressure value at the control points exerted by water flows on the additional dam when colliding with cylindrical protective columns and without them in order to make the necessary calculations five control points u1 u2 u3 u4 and u5 were taken the coordinates of which are given in table 2 as can be seen from the obtained numerical results for all control points the value of the shock pressure at the beginning has a negative value this is due to the fact that the pressure value 0 on the figures indicates atmospheric pressure 105 pa as a negative value indicates pressure below atmospheric pressure see fig 9 fig 8 shows comparative graphs of the pressure value over time at the control points p1 p2 p3 p4 p5 and p6 located on the first and second rows of cylindrical protective columns in order to make the necessary calculations the control points p1 p2 p3 p4 p5 and p6 were taken the coordinates of which were given in tables 3 and 4 it is clearly seen from fig 7 that at t 2 8 s the fluid flow almost completely covers the first row of the cylindrical protective column and in the obtained profiles of the water level contour appear the main wave and an additional wave which appears a little further from the main wave these waves appear due to the fact that the emerging reverse flow from the collision collides with a water column that goes forward and from the obtained profiles some oscillations appear in the obtained solutions the appearance of an additional wave can be explained by the fact that the water column collides against the first row of the cylindrical protective column and the further movement of the water column is divided into two flows the first mud flow collides with the first row of the cylindrical protective column and the first collision of particles with different sizes occurs and particles that are largely due to the presence of the columns cannot pass this obstacle due to the particles blocking the free movement of the water flow the main part of the water that could not pass begins to move upstream and the rest of the water volume rises up and passes the cylindrical protective column and the part of the water that did not manage to pass already collides with the water column that was moving forward and the second flow occurs between cylindrical protective columns where there are macroscopic particles that have a smaller diameter after the dam break the water column collides with the particle mixture and carries these particles downstream while some openings are formed between the cylindrical protective columns but however it should be noted that since the entire volume of water cannot instantly pass through the given hole between the cylindrical protective columns which failed to pass some of the water and particles begin to move upstream and collide with the column of water that was moving downstream due to this process additional waves appear see fig 10 also from the obtained numerical results it can be noticed that at all control points on the additional dam a decrease in the pressure value on the wall is observed compared to without cylindrical protective columns the decrease in the pressure value occurs from 1 to 40 depending on the location of the control point so the presence of a multi level cylindrical protective column has a beneficial effect first of all on slowing down the propagation of a water wave which gives a little more time for evacuation from the obtained data it can be concluded that without the use of multi level protection mud impurities reach the additional dam in 3 45 s while using multi level protection in 3 6 s and also there is a significant decrease in the pressure value at some control points which are located on the wall of the additional dam which generally leads to minimization of damage to the main barrier from obtained the results it can be concludes that the presence of protective cylindrical columns did not affect the water level so much for the initial control points while for the downstream control points it increased the maximum depth of the flood wave it should also be noticed that the presence of protective cylindrical columns had a significant impact on the downstream wave pattern these influences are associated with the fact that a progressive wave with mud stone flow after a partial break of the main dam begins to go downstream and due to the fact that part of the impurity with stones cannot immediately pass through the protective cylindrical columns and waves are formed that propagate upstream the same results can be observed when the water collides with the main dam so after the water dam break it can be seen that the water level begins to fall very sharply and after a collision with the main dam for the control points immediately in front of the main dam a sharp increase in the water level occurs and the subsequent increase in water levels is not so fast this collision forms additional humps in the progressive wave while the depth of the flood waves increases significantly this process does not take place for a long time and after 3 1 s the water level begins to decrease gradually as already by this time finishes the main process of partial dam break which formed waves coming upstream 6 conclusions this model was developed for numerical simulation of dam break with a riverbed landscape taking into account multi level protection to begin with the model was validated for reliability and efficiency by a test problem comparison of these numerical results with experiment and calculations of other authors showed satisfactory agreement which was sufficient to use this numerical model further after obtaining good matches work began on modeling a more complex problem that is close to the real problem consisting of an incompressible fluid sediment and solid particles debris at the time of the dam break a real dam break is accompanied by a number of related factors these factors are incomplete destruction of the dam tortuosity and erosion of the canal the complex landscape of the river the drift of inhomogeneous sediments and other residual material stones etc by the water flow then in this work most of these components were taken into account the obtained results show a strong influence of the flood water downstream on the progressive wave which is reduced due to the presence of protective cylindrical columns so after the protective cylindrical columns a significant decrease in the speed of the driving wave is noticeable which can have a beneficial effect on the additional dam since a decrease in the speed of the driving wave will lead to a decrease in the pressure value exerted on the additional dam however due to the limited computing resources various forms of solid particles were not taken into account the work considered particles in the form of a sphere although as is known in reality such a form is an extremely rare phenomenon from the obtained results it can be concluded that the presence of a multi level cylindrical protective column has a beneficial effect first of all on slowing down the propagation of a water wave which gives a little more time for evacuation and also there was a significant decrease in the pressure value at some control points from 1 to 40 depending on the location of the control point which were located on the wall of the additional dam which generally leads to minimization of damage to the main barrier in general in this work the process of dam break followed by the transfer of mud stone flow was successfully reproduced the modeling was carried out on a heterogeneous terrain with multilevel obstacles in this study proposed complex protection system can help avoid catastrophic consequences up to the prevention of human loss as well as damage to infrastructure and the environment thus it should be noticed that the presence of the protective cylindrical columns generally led to an increase in the maximum height of the flood wave downstream which may lead to the risk of complete submersion of these protective cylindrical columns for this purpose it is necessary to build protective cylindrical columns high enough to avoid such risks in sum there appears to be a degree of uncertainty based on the results while the concluding statements are absolute in support of the hypothesis credit authorship contribution statement alibek issakhov conceptualization

4494,this paper considered the behavior of an incompressible fluid sediment and solid particles debris at the time of a dam break this process was studied numerically on the basis of three dimensional reynolds averaged navier stokes equations in combination with the k ω turbulence model the vof volume of fluid method was used to simulate the fluid and sediment in order to simulate the movement of water and sediment a combination of newtonian and non newtonian models was carried out the effect of water flow on the transport of solid particles and moving sediments is also considered in order to be convinced of the effectiveness and reliability of the model the numerical results were compared with experimental data and with calculated data performed by other authors further a proven mathematical model is applied to numerically simulate the movement of fluid behind the dam during the break of the dam body with a riverbed landscape taking into account multi level protection the pressure that the water flow exerts on the additional dam in downstream in the case of cylindrical columns and without them was calculated since the columns block the path of solid particles the pressure exerted on the additional dam is noticeably reduced and in this case it can be assumed that a potential dam break will not occur and if it does then with the least damage this configuration imitates a robust multi level protection system that can be used to prevent the serious consequences of a dam failure keywords multilevel protection dpm and mpm models interaction of macroscopic particles flood zones vof method 1 introduction floods happen for several reasons prolonged torrential rains melting glaciers tsunamis and the reason we are interested in is the dams break or reservoirs a dam break occurs when a reservoir or dam can no longer hold a strong water pressure due to an earthquake wear of the dam itself etc morris 2000 despite the fact that to date a lot of work has been done on the dam break process this problem of hydraulic engineering remains relevant to this day in connection with the danger posed to the entire human society abbasi et al 2010 over the past several decades due to the increase in the number of accidents more attention has been paid to the analysis of dam break the problem raised in this paper is very relevant for the republic of kazakhstan today the dam break of the sardoba dam on may 1 2020 in uzbekistan also affected the southern regions of kazakhstan in the border areas of the turkestan region 14 settlements were flooded more than 30 thousand people were evacuated so far no official conclusions have been given on this issue although there is a large amount of work on this described problem of hydraulic engineering it is still relevant due to the serious danger posed to the entire human society abbasi et al 2010 the consequences of a dam break are large scale floods which lead to serious consequences from catastrophic damage to infrastructure and property of the population to casualties among the population chanson 2006 such unfortunate events can be minimized by anticipating potential hazards in advance water breakthrough observation can be performed using a laboratory experiment oertel and bung 2012 soares frazão and zech 2007 chen et al 2014 fraccarollo and toro 1995 stansby et al 1998 spinewine and zech 2007 haltas et al 2016a 2016b or numerical simulation cunge et al 1980 chaudhry 1993 morris 2000 experimental studies on dam breaks are presented in many works and are mainly considered in a simplified rectangular channel shape the popularity of numerical modeling increases with the growth of computing power the most accurate numerical analysis is achieved when taking into account various natural constituent factors zanuttigh and lamberti 2011 wang et al 2017 of the dam break the shape of the river cross section and its complex relief the presence of homogeneous sand mud layer and hard stone particles bed composition with water flow after the dam break water wave mainly propagates along the bottom of the riverbed downstream it is much more difficult to predict the behavior of fluid in a channel with a complex topography that results from the natural tortuosity of river beds channel configuration has a significant impact on the modality of wave distribution ozmen cagatay et al 2014 kocaman et al 2020 wang et al 2019 kocaman and ozmen cagatay 2012 and the more complex the configuration the more difficult it is to predict the behavior of the wave mentioning about the dam break problem it should be noticed that this process involves the transfer of not only water flow but also various deposits in the form of mud clay sand etc coussot 1995 in numerical simulations a non newtonian fluid is most often used to simulate such bottom sediments the combination of newtonian and non newtonian fluids makes it possible to study multilayer natural flows for example a mixture of water and mud flows debris clay sand etc to date there are a number of studies in which the dam break process is considered only by non newtonian fluids boroomand et al 2007 ancey and cochard 2009 chambon et al 2009 hosseinzadeh tabrizi and ghaeini hessaroeyeh 2017 movahedi et al 2018 issakhov and zhandaulet 2020a 2020b the use of a non newtonian fluid makes it possible to establish the dependence of fluid viscosity on stress gotoh and fredsøe 2000 spinewine and zech 2007 have developed a two layer one dimensional model to simulate dam break over moving layers in cao et al 2004 a one dimensional model of the flow around the dam over the moving layers was also proposed which taking into account the uneven transport of sediments and their influence on the water flow in the channel this work was subsequently extended to a two dimensional model in simpson and castelltort 2006 for free surface flow and sediment transport often along with the transport of the mud layer a process of soil movement occurs which entails important morphological changes in the river valley capart et al 2007 in the paper biswal et al 2018 the authors developed a numerical model of a dam break the main factor of which is the coefficient of friction between layers the developed model solves the system of two dimensional reynolds averaged navier stokes equations rans for closing the k ε turbulent model was used a similar approach to using the rans equations in combination with turbulent models can be found in studies shigematsu et al 2004 quecedo et al 2005 abdolmaleki et al 2004 the paper also considered the addition of particulate matter to simulate rocks dam debris and other residual material studies of the water flow with solid particles as well as the interactions between them have been considered in many works two dimensional cases were considered in papers lube et al 2005 balmforth and kerswell 2005 issakhov et al 2020 and in papers li and zhao 2018 canelas et al 2016 ward et al 2009 di cristo et al 2010 minussi and maciel 2012 park et al 2018 zhang et al 2009 ancey et al 2013 saramito et al 2013 three dimensional cases were considered in the paper proposed by kim and yoon 2020 the numerical cfd dem computational fluid dynamics and discrete element method method was used to study the effect that fluid density has on a liquid gas particle multiphase medium the authors found that despite the value of the liquid density the position of the liquid front for the liquid gas medium will be ahead of the position for the liquid gas particle medium the liquid gas particle flow has also been considered in other study guo and morita 2013 compared changes in the behavior of the liquid gas particle medium depending on the height of the particle layer the authors demonstrated that the position of the liquid front changed much faster if the height of the particle layer increased in addition to the height of the particle layer the influence of the particles number on the multiphase liquid gas particle flow is considered the influence of the particles number on the liquid gas particle flow behavior has been studied lin and chen 2013 the authors found that as the concentration decreases the flow rate increases and the momentum in turn decreases in addition they demonstrated the influence of the friction coefficient stiffness and damping coefficient of particles the behavior of such hardstone particles can be quite unpredictable according to fan et al 2012 they can even completely block the free water flow movement in the channel in the numerical simulation of granular particles the moving particle method mps is very popular which allows you to study the interaction of a solid with a liquid this method was successfully applied in koshizuka et al 1998 to simulate a moving rigid body in breaking waves on slopes the study also reports that the mps method is a reliable approach for modeling liquid solid mixture flow and does not need to track the interface between phases in the work issakhov et al 2018 obstacles blocking the path of water flow were investigated due to the various shapes of the obstacles the pressure exerted on the dam surface has decreased by 3 times issakhov and imanberdiyeva 2019 studied the water flow behavior during a dam break on the complex uneven relief of the river channel taking into account the uneven channel bottom softens the idealized conditions adopted in the course of solving such problems in the paper issakhov and zhandaulet 2020a presents a numerical model of the dam break flows with the natural landscape of the river modeling the real coastal contours of the river allowed for a better study of the dam break process which is the closest to natural conditions in a study issakhov and zhandaulet 2020b numerical simulations were carried out in moving layers of the earth with varying sediment thicknesses to maximize pressure reduction the obtained numerical results of 3d modeling will allow predicting the dynamic process of sludge transfer a non newtonian liquid with a density ρ 2630 kg m3 was taken as the basis of the mud impurity the main problem of the work issakhov et al 2020 was to study the behavior of macroscopic particles stones dam debris debris during the dam break flows one of the limitations in the course of this work is the idealized spherical shape of particles as well as material particle sizes and other natural conditions to protect urban areas from dam break flows are often constructed main and additional dams so in real life cases it should be borne in mind that the main dam is usually used to contain and collect water the main load falls on the main dam while the additional dam acts as additional protection for the population however the worst case cannot be ignored because with large volumes of water complete and partial collapse of the main dam can occur issakhov et al 2020 as a result there is a great risk that the mud rock flow which now contains debris from the main dam will put more stress on the additional dam di cristo et al 2010 ancey et al 2013 however it should be borne in mind that to carry out full scale three dimensional modeling of a dam break for a complex river bed haltas et al 2016a 2016b taking into account the mud stone flow large computer resources will be needed which leads to great restrictions to carry out this calculation in an adequate time simplifications of the mathematical model are carried out and many important factors are not taken into account in this work to take into account important factors the reduced size of the computational area with some simplifications in the river beds was used to conduct a complete analysis of the modified mathematical model which takes into account four phases air water mud and stones of various sizes i e complex motion of newtonian and non newtonian fluid chambon et al 2009 movahedi et al 2018 with particles of various sizes to take into account all the above processes adaptations of mathematical models were carried out from papers issakhov et al 2018 issakhov and imanberdiyeva 2019 a mathematical model was used to simulate the flow of water movement for various reliefs of the computational area from papers issakhov and zhandaulet 2020a 2020b mathematical models were used to simulate the water flow and mud movement while from paper issakhov et al 2020 a mathematical model was used to simulate the flow of water movement with particles of various sizes in this work the adaptation and modification of the mathematical model were carried out in order to take into account all these processes in this paper an assessment of the impact of a multi level protective column on the propagation of a water wave and pressure distribution during a dam break was considered for maximum protection of the additional dam from mud stone flow multi level protection in the form of cylindrical columns is being constructed in the space between the dams the first row of cylindrical columns blocks the path of large particles the second row prevents the passage of smaller particles during real dam breaks not only the transfer of water flow is involved but also various deposits in the form of mud clay sand etc as well as rocky debris in the heterogeneous terrain so the water breaks through the main dam and the resulting mud stone flow which is formed after the collapse of the main dam goes downstream to the additional dam taking these factors into account brings the considered problem as closely as possible to the real problem to solve the problem numerically the navier stokes equation was modified to take into account the transportation of mud and rocky debris and additional equations were added to describe the motion of solid particles the new type of multi level protection proposed in this work which consists of two rows of cylindrical columns by their location which prevents any passage of solid particles to the additional dam in the form of a trapezoid in open river channels has reduced the shock pressure on the additional dam from the mud stone flow and accordingly minimizes the damage to the main dam these complex processes are shown in the form of comparative figures and illustrations 2 the governing equations to describe the process 3d averaged navier stokes equations and continuity equation

different phases the vof method is applied hirt and nichols 1981 to close the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations rans a shear stress transport sst k ω turbulent model for two variables k and ω is applied 2 1 discrete phase model dpm currently there are two methods for the numerical calculation of multiphase flows the euler euler and euler lagrange 2 1 1 euler lagrange approach the application of lagrange model of the dpm follows the euler lagrange method the liquid phase is taken as continuous by solving the rans equations while the dispersed phase is found by tracking a large number of particles through the found flow field the momentum mass and energy transfer between the continuous and dispersed phases can take place the method is simplified when interactions between particles can be neglected and claims that the dispersed second phase fill a small volume fraction when the large mass load is acceptable m particles m fluid the particle trajectories are found particularly at regular intervals when finding the continuous phase 2 1 2 the balance of forces acting on particles this model builds the trajectory of a particle in the discrete phase integrating the

approach simulates the behavior of sufficiently large macroscopic solid particles that can interact with fluid flow region walls and different particles this method is useful to lagrangian particle flows that cannot be found by applying conventional point mass particle method the particle size like that flow cannot be neglected in the situation the particle volume should be considered when simulating collisions and hydrodynamics the mpm approach ensures a specific regime that considers the next 1 the attraction forces between particles with walls and particles 2 accumulation and

corrected pressure and velocity components the equation for volume fraction was found by explicit time discretization in this method the standard finite difference interpolation schemes were used to the volume fraction values that were found at the previous time step 4 validation problem the proposed numerical model was validated by comparing the calculated data with a laboratory experiment cadam morris 2000 and in addition with the numerical values of other authors zhou et al 2004 kao and chang 2012 marsooli and wu 2014 the reservoir was 15 5 m long 1 0 m wide and 1 0 m high the vertical gate was located 15 5 m from the beginning of the reservoir the total length of the experimental flume together with the reservoir was 38 m width 1 m and height 1 m fig 1 a the symmetrical triangular dam from the metal was located at a distance of 10 m from the central gate and had the following length width and height dimensions 6 m 1 m and 0 4 m respectively fig 1b prior to the dam break the initial water depth was 0 75 m four control points g4 g10 g13 and g20 were located 4 m 10 m 13 m and 20 m downstream of the gate respectively fig 1c beyond the triangular dam was a layer of water 0 15 m high the boundary conditions at the end of the canal were a wall that prevents water from flowing out of the experimental setup the total simulation time was 40 s since the start of the dam break numerical simulation was performed with a time step δt 0 005 s the spatial step was taken as 0 02 m as a result the size of the computational grid was more than 4 752 500 elements fig 2 demonstrates the change in the depth of the water flow at the control points g4 g10 g13 g20 at different times until the end of the experiment the fortieth second the water level in the g4 point increases sharply at t 12 s and t 35 s such a jump can be explained by the fact that the passage of the incident shock wave at these moments of time and the reflection of the water flow from the dam upon impact the highest water level almost 0 6 m was seen on the g10 point which was located right in front of the triangular barrier the position of the third control point at the top of the triangular ledge explains the low water level in this point because when measuring the water depth the height of the dam was not taken into account the presence of a small volume of water after a dam is the cause of a hydraulic jump after the collision of water with a triangular ledge and finally reaching the end of the channel and hitting the closed lower boundary of the configuration the water reflects off the wall and returns back upstream in general the simulated and experimental profile of the free water surface showed satisfactory adjustment with the measurement and numerical values of other authors good agreement between the calculated data and the experiment was achieved through the use of the vof method which showed reliability and efficiency in modeling complex flows during a dam break 5 impact of a multilevel protection column on the propagation of a water wave good qualitative agreement between the experiment and the calculated data made it possible to proceed to carry out numerical simulation close to the real problem so the water breaks through the main dam and the resulting mud stone flow which is formed after the collapse of the main dam goes downstream to the additional dam to determine the impact of multi level protection in an open river channel on the additional dam from mud stone flow two problems were considered in the first case there was no multi level protection after the first trapezoidal dam and in the second case multi level protection was located at a distance of 0 925 m from it and at the same distance from each other fig 3 cylindrical obstacles located inside the channel interacted with solid particles like a strainer as a result of which not one granular particle did not pass beyond the second protective row of columns thus the pressure exerted by the mud flow on the additional dam is reduced fig 3d shows the location of cylindrical barriers the distance between them the diameter of the bases and the distance from the channel to the columns 5 1 geometry settings the configuration of this problem was as follows the length width and height of the channel were 11 88 m 0 3 m and 0 34 m respectively at the upstream of the canal there was a water reservoir with dimensions 4 65 m long 0 3 m wide and 0 25 m high directly behind the reservoir was a vertical gate that prevents water from spreading along the canal fig 3 the channel is located horizontally at a distance of 1 53 m from the gate there was a trapezoidal dam with a partially symmetrical hole in the middle mud deposits and solid particles were located inside the hole in successive three layer superposition on each other fig 3 the density of the non newtonian fluid which imitates the described mud deposits was taken as 2683 kg m3 and the density of solid particles was 2800 kg m3 the particle diameter of the first layer was 0 025 m the second layer was 0 018 m and 0 014 m of the third layer further along the path of the water flow there were two rows of cylindrical columns by their location which prevent any passage of solid particles to the additional dam in the form of a trapezoid since the diameters of the solid particles are larger than the gaps between the cylinders the diameter of the bases of the first cylindrical row was taken as 0 0325 m and that of the second row was 0 01 m while the height was taken as 0 1 m at the moment of opening the vertical gate the water flow begins to move downstream a detailed diagram of the described geometry is shown in fig 3 fig 3c shows a scheme of a trapezoidal dam initially observation of the water flow behavior in the presence of cylindrical columns and their absence was carried out using the control points g1 g2 g0 g5a and g8a the location in the form of coordinates is shown in table 1 and in fig 4 5 2 simulation results fig 5 shows the change in water depth in installed control points with and without cylindrical protective columns points g1 and g2 were located before the first two obstacles so no significant changes in the water level were noticed in them the g5a point showed an increase in water level from about 4 5 s which can be explained by an approaching impact on cylindrical columns and a reverse movement of a certain part of the water the same point showed the deepest water in the case of a cylinder shaped obstacle the flow reached a depth of 0 15 m in the absence of columns row in the g8a point the water flow moves much faster because at about t 6 2 s the water already reaches the trapezoidal dam which was not noticed in the case of the presence of a number of protective columns thus in addition to solid particles cylindrical columns also inhibit the water movement which in the future can be used to minimize the damaging effects of the dam fig 6 demonstrates the change in water level at some points in time which allows us to make the following observations in general there is no significant difference between the water flow behaviors before colliding with the first row of cylindrical columns a noticeable discrepancy was observed when the water reaches cylindrical obstacles the water level rises due to the collision of the stream against the obstacle such jumps were observed at all considered times t 1 9 s t 2 8 s t 3 3 s t 3 68 s t 4 74 s t 6 68 s fig 7 illustrates a three dimensional process of solid particles propagation without and with cylindrical obstacles at some moments of time t 1 9 s t 2 8 s t 3 3 s t 3 68 s t 4 74 s t 6 68 s fig 8 shows comparative graphs of the shock pressure value at the control points exerted by water flows on the additional dam when colliding with cylindrical protective columns and without them in order to make the necessary calculations five control points u1 u2 u3 u4 and u5 were taken the coordinates of which are given in table 2 as can be seen from the obtained numerical results for all control points the value of the shock pressure at the beginning has a negative value this is due to the fact that the pressure value 0 on the figures indicates atmospheric pressure 105 pa as a negative value indicates pressure below atmospheric pressure see fig 9 fig 8 shows comparative graphs of the pressure value over time at the control points p1 p2 p3 p4 p5 and p6 located on the first and second rows of cylindrical protective columns in order to make the necessary calculations the control points p1 p2 p3 p4 p5 and p6 were taken the coordinates of which were given in tables 3 and 4 it is clearly seen from fig 7 that at t 2 8 s the fluid flow almost completely covers the first row of the cylindrical protective column and in the obtained profiles of the water level contour appear the main wave and an additional wave which appears a little further from the main wave these waves appear due to the fact that the emerging reverse flow from the collision collides with a water column that goes forward and from the obtained profiles some oscillations appear in the obtained solutions the appearance of an additional wave can be explained by the fact that the water column collides against the first row of the cylindrical protective column and the further movement of the water column is divided into two flows the first mud flow collides with the first row of the cylindrical protective column and the first collision of particles with different sizes occurs and particles that are largely due to the presence of the columns cannot pass this obstacle due to the particles blocking the free movement of the water flow the main part of the water that could not pass begins to move upstream and the rest of the water volume rises up and passes the cylindrical protective column and the part of the water that did not manage to pass already collides with the water column that was moving forward and the second flow occurs between cylindrical protective columns where there are macroscopic particles that have a smaller diameter after the dam break the water column collides with the particle mixture and carries these particles downstream while some openings are formed between the cylindrical protective columns but however it should be noted that since the entire volume of water cannot instantly pass through the given hole between the cylindrical protective columns which failed to pass some of the water and particles begin to move upstream and collide with the column of water that was moving downstream due to this process additional waves appear see fig 10 also from the obtained numerical results it can be noticed that at all control points on the additional dam a decrease in the pressure value on the wall is observed compared to without cylindrical protective columns the decrease in the pressure value occurs from 1 to 40 depending on the location of the control point so the presence of a multi level cylindrical protective column has a beneficial effect first of all on slowing down the propagation of a water wave which gives a little more time for evacuation from the obtained data it can be concluded that without the use of multi level protection mud impurities reach the additional dam in 3 45 s while using multi level protection in 3 6 s and also there is a significant decrease in the pressure value at some control points which are located on the wall of the additional dam which generally leads to minimization of damage to the main barrier from obtained the results it can be concludes that the presence of protective cylindrical columns did not affect the water level so much for the initial control points while for the downstream control points it increased the maximum depth of the flood wave it should also be noticed that the presence of protective cylindrical columns had a significant impact on the downstream wave pattern these influences are associated with the fact that a progressive wave with mud stone flow after a partial break of the main dam begins to go downstream and due to the fact that part of the impurity with stones cannot immediately pass through the protective cylindrical columns and waves are formed that propagate upstream the same results can be observed when the water collides with the main dam so after the water dam break it can be seen that the water level begins to fall very sharply and after a collision with the main dam for the control points immediately in front of the main dam a sharp increase in the water level occurs and the subsequent increase in water levels is not so fast this collision forms additional humps in the progressive wave while the depth of the flood waves increases significantly this process does not take place for a long time and after 3 1 s the water level begins to decrease gradually as already by this time finishes the main process of partial dam break which formed waves coming upstream 6 conclusions this model was developed for numerical simulation of dam break with a riverbed landscape taking into account multi level protection to begin with the model was validated for reliability and efficiency by a test problem comparison of these numerical results with experiment and calculations of other authors showed satisfactory agreement which was sufficient to use this numerical model further after obtaining good matches work began on modeling a more complex problem that is close to the real problem consisting of an incompressible fluid sediment and solid particles debris at the time of the dam break a real dam break is accompanied by a number of related factors these factors are incomplete destruction of the dam tortuosity and erosion of the canal the complex landscape of the river the drift of inhomogeneous sediments and other residual material stones etc by the water flow then in this work most of these components were taken into account the obtained results show a strong influence of the flood water downstream on the progressive wave which is reduced due to the presence of protective cylindrical columns so after the protective cylindrical columns a significant decrease in the speed of the driving wave is noticeable which can have a beneficial effect on the additional dam since a decrease in the speed of the driving wave will lead to a decrease in the pressure value exerted on the additional dam however due to the limited computing resources various forms of solid particles were not taken into account the work considered particles in the form of a sphere although as is known in reality such a form is an extremely rare phenomenon from the obtained results it can be concluded that the presence of a multi level cylindrical protective column has a beneficial effect first of all on slowing down the propagation of a water wave which gives a little more time for evacuation and also there was a significant decrease in the pressure value at some control points from 1 to 40 depending on the location of the control point which were located on the wall of the additional dam which generally leads to minimization of damage to the main barrier in general in this work the process of dam break followed by the transfer of mud stone flow was successfully reproduced the modeling was carried out on a heterogeneous terrain with multilevel obstacles in this study proposed complex protection system can help avoid catastrophic consequences up to the prevention of human loss as well as damage to infrastructure and the environment thus it should be noticed that the presence of the protective cylindrical columns generally led to an increase in the maximum height of the flood wave downstream which may lead to the risk of complete submersion of these protective cylindrical columns for this purpose it is necessary to build protective cylindrical columns high enough to avoid such risks in sum there appears to be a degree of uncertainty based on the results while the concluding statements are absolute in support of the hypothesis credit authorship contribution statement alibek issakhov conceptualization
