6000,a new data assimilation technique unscented weighted ensemble kalman filter uwenkf was developed based on the scaled unscented transformation and ensemble kalman filter enkf in uwenkf the individual members selected are unequally weighted and symmetric about the expectation to investigate the performance of uwenkf nine assimilation experiments with different ensemble sizes 161 1601 16001 and different assimilation frequencies every 6 h every 12 h every 24 h were designed to assimilate soil surface 5 cm moisture data observed at station hy in the upper reaches of the yellow river in the northeastern of tibetan plateau china into the richards equation the results showed that the performance of the filter was greatly affected by random noise and the filter was sensitive to ensemble size and assimilation frequency increasing the ensemble size reduced the effects of random noise on filter performance in several independent assimilation runs i e it decreased the differences between the results of the several independent assimilation runs reducing the assimilation frequency also reduced the effects of random noise on filter performance uwenkf gave more accurate soil moisture model results than enkf for all ensemble sizes and assimilation frequencies at all soil depths additionally enkf may have different performances according to different initial conditions but not for uwenkf precipitation and soil properties uncertainties had some impact on filter performance thus uwenkf is a better choice than enkf while it is more computationally demanding for improving soil moisture predictions by assimilating data from many sources such as satellite observed soil moisture data at a low assimilation frequency e g every 24 h keywords soil moisture richards equation ensemble kalman filter enkf unscented weighted ensemble kalman filter uwenkf 1 introduction soil moisture is an important state variable in land surface processes meteorology hydrology and agriculture heathman et al 2003 soil moisture determines the proportions of rainfall directed into surface runoff and soil infiltration yu et al 1999 silberstein et al 1999 western and bloschl 1999 koster et al 2003 influences the distribution of sensible and latent heat koster et al 2004 and affects irrigation scheduling and crop production in agriculture hanson et al 1998 ma et al 1998 lü et al 2011 fu et al 2014 however despite its importance accurate long term observations of soil moisture over large areas and in deep soil layers are difficult to obtain yu et al 2001 huang et al 2008 in recent decades land surface models and hydrological models have been used to provide long term soil moisture values for increased depths of soil at a regional scale yu et al 2006 for example the biosphere atmosphere transfer scheme dickinson et al 1993 and the simple biosphere model sib2 sellers et al 1996 were used to obtain soil moisture values at different soil depths the widely used common land model oleson et al 2004 has been used to simulate horizontal and vertical soil moisture and temperature behavior for a long period the variable infiltration capacity model vic liang et al 1994 and the topmodel based land surface atmosphere transfer scheme famiglietti and wood 1994a famiglietti and wood 1994b fu et al 2018a also simulate soil moisture behavior for different spatial scales however the results given by these models are biased because of uncertainties in model parameters model structure and forcing data yu et al 2001 2002 huang et al 2008 xu et al 2017 remote sensing can be used to obtain soil moisture data on a large scale for example parinussa et al 2012 used a radiative transfer based model to derive surface soil moisture data from the windsat spaceborne polarimetric microwave radiometer however remote sensing observation and data collection are limited to the soil surface jackson et al 1999 wang et al 2016 balsamo et al 2007 data assimilation is an effective technique to improve model predictions and simulations and has been widely used to estimate soil moisture by combining multi source datasets e g in situ soil moisture observations and remote sensing data over the past few decades kalman 1960 han and li 2008 yu et al 2014a 2014b fu et al 2014 dong et al 2015 dong et al 2016 sequential data assimilation has often been used to improve the accuracy of soil moisture predictions and simulations since the introduction of the kalman filter kf kalman 1960 however the application of kf is limited to linear dynamic systems and the linear observation operator luo and moroz 2009 to overcome the limitation of kf the extended kalman filter ekf was developed by restricting the taylor series for nonlinear functions to the second order evensen 1992 miller et al 1994 however ekf is not effective for large scale problems because the full forward covariance matrix greatly increases its computational cost luo and moroz 2009 the ensemble kalman filter enkf introduced by evensen 1994 is a computationally efficient technique that can accommodate nonlinear dynamics and which has been used in soil moisture assimilation experiments huang et al 2008 fu et al 2014 2019 liu et al 2016 brandhorst et al 2017 huang et al 2008 used enkf to assimilate the tropical rainfall measuring mission microwave imager brightness temperature data into the sib2 model to improve soil moisture predictions in tibetan plateau lievens et al 2016 used enkf to assimilate the soil moisture and ocean salinity brightness temperature data products into vic model to improve soil moisture predictions brandhorst et al 2017 used enkf to manage the uncertainty of soil hydraulic parameters in predicting soil moisture in enkf all ensemble members are equally weighted which reduces the effects of important members and exaggerates the effects of unimportant members luo and moroz 2009 demonstrated that even randomly selected members can have the correct mean and covariance in enkf but still introduce spurious modes in the transformed distribution which affects the performance of enkf han and li 2008 de lannoy et al 2006 sigma points with different weights for different members which supersedes the scaled unscented transformation julier and uhlmann 2004 han and li 2008 luo and moroz 2009 fu et al 2018b can more accurately reflect the importance of each member and may lead to incorporate the scaled unscented transformation to benefit the enkf performance han and li 2008 showed that filter performance is influenced by different equally sized ensembles of randomly selected members thus we aim to investigate the impact of the different randomly and equally sized ensembles on filters performance and lessen its influence in successive independently simulation runs then combined the characteristics of the scaled unscented transformation with enkf to create a new highly effective data assimilation technique the unscented weighted ensemble kalman filter uwenkf to achieve the objective experiments were designed to assimilate observed soil surface moisture data into the richards equation with ensemble sizes 161 1601 and 16001 and assimilation intervals δ t ass 6 h 12 h and 24 h using data observed at station hy in the upper reaches of the yellow river in the northeastern of the tibetan plateau china the field site and available data are described in section 2 section 3 describes the model operator filter structure experimental design and evaluation criteria the results are given and discussed in section 4 and the summary and conclusions are given in section 5 2 field site and data the source of the yellow river is in the northeast of the tibetan plateau the area has been the subject of much research because of its unique land surface processes which are due to the geographical location terrain and altitude fig 1 there are areas of permanent and seasonal permafrost in this region so the soil moisture observations and atmospheric forcing data e g precipitation wind speed air temperature from 2015 05 17 to 2015 09 21 recorded at experimental site hy in hongyuan county for 5 cm 20 cm 40 cm and 80 cm depths were selected to avoid the effects of permafrost soil moisture was measured every hour using an auto measurement system decagon inc usa which consisted of an em50 and four 5tm sensors precipitation was recorded every hour using a rain gauge land cover at the site is mainly alpine meadow and the average values of soil properties at different depths are listed in table 1 average annual precipitation is 749 1 mm and average annual temperature is 1 4 c 3 methodology 3 1 richards equation the richards equation is an one dimensional equation that describes soil water fluxes in the unsaturated zone of a homogeneous and isotropic soil richards 1931 hoeben and troch 2000 oleson et al 2004 lü et al 2011 chirico et al 2014 medina et al 2014a medina et al 2014b it was used as the model operator in the data assimilation scheme the θ based richards equation can be written as 1 θ t z d θ θ z k θ e where θ is volumetric soil moisture content m3 m3 t is time s z is soil depth mm d θ k θ d ψ d θ is the unsaturated diffusivity thus eq 1 is equal to θ t z k θ ψ z k θ e ψ is soil water matric potential mm k is soil hydraulic conductivity mm s and e is evapotranspiration loss mm s the clapp hornberger relationships clapp and hornberger 1978 are used to specify the dependence between k ψ and soil moisture content θ 2 ψ θ ψ s θ θ s b 3 k θ k s θ θ s 2 b 3 where ψ s ks and θ s are the saturated soil matric potential mm saturated soil hydraulic conductivity mm s and saturated volumetric soil moisture content m3 m3 respectively b is the distribution exponent of soil porosity in the numerical solution for the richards equation hoeben and troch 2000 lü et al 2010 medina et al 2014a b the upper boundary condition was determined by infiltration and precipitation and the lower boundary condition was defined as free drainage the initial state values used were the observed data for each layer to achieve the objective and they were set 0 2 m3 m3 to analyze the impact of initial value on filter performance soil hydraulic conductivity was calculated from the soil properties in table 1 and evapotranspiration was calculated by using the fao 56 penman monteith equation allen 2002 3 2 ensemble kalman filter enkf the state function f which maps the previous state x t 1 at time t 1 to state x t at time t the observation function h which indicates the deterministic relationship between the system states and observations both of them are required for enkf based data assimilation evensen 1994 moradkhani et al 2005 kumar et al 2008 xie and zhang 2010 yu et al 2014a b fu et al 2014 han et al 2014 the richards equation is used as the state function the observation function h is used to link the system state vector with the observations the two functions are presented as 4 x t f x t 1 v t 1 5 y t h x t u t where x t and y t are the state and measurement vectors of soil moisture at time t and v t and u t are state noise and measurement noise or error at time t there are two steps in enkf forecasting and updating the state 3 2 1 forecasting initial ensemble members x 0 i i 1 m is obtained by adding the random perturbations to the initial value x 0 according to the gaussian distribution with zero mean and error covariance matrix p huang et al 2008 fu et al 2014 the state variables can then be predicted by the state function 6 x t i f x t 1 i up v t 1 i v t 1 i n 0 q where x t 1 i up is the updated state value at time t 1 x t i is the predicted state value q is the model error covariance matrix and m is the enkf ensemble size 3 2 2 updating the state the state predictions can be updated with the observations by 7 x t i up x t i k t y t i h x t i where k t is the kalman gain which is calculated by 8 k t p t h t h p t h t r 1 where r is the observation error covariance matrix the error covariance matrix p t is calculated by 9 p t 1 m 1 e t e t t the error matrix e t for each ensemble member and the mean value of the forecast state are given by 10 e t x t 1 x t x t m x t 11 x t 1 m i 1 m x t i the updated value at time t is 12 x t up 1 m i 1 m x t i up if the measurements are a nonlinear combination of state variables the terms

of x is estimated using 16 y g x to calculate the mean and covariance of y using scaled unscented transform the 2 n 1 points x i with corresponding weight julier and uhlmann 2004 van der merwe 2004

and those points are called the sigma points n λ p x i is the ith row or column of the matrix square root of n λ p x in the sigma points α 0 α 1 controls the distribution spread of the sigma points l l 0 is a parameter introduced to guarantee the positive semi definiteness of the covariance matrix β β 0 is used to include the higher order moments of the distribution julier and uhlmann 2004 van der merwe 2004 after that the transformation of each sigma point can be propagated as 18 y i g x i i 0 2 n the mean y covariance p y and cross covariance p xy can be calculated 19 y i 0 2 n ω i m y i 20 p

generated using a gaussian distribution with zero mean and error covariance matrix p x the sigma points ensemble with number 2 n n 1 is defined by 22 x 0 x x i x q jj n λ a b s p x j i 1 n n j j 1 n j

the number of errors generated in this study there are the same number of ensemble members i e the number of sigma points in uwenkf and enkf therefore m 2 n n 1 3 3 2 1 forecasting the state

members x t i based on eqs 27 30 4 resampling if the weight w t i is too small resample the ensemble members and re calculate the corresponding weights 5 updating update all ensemble members based on eqs 24 35 and calculate the state estimation using eq 36 3 3 3 the differences between uwenkf and some new kf based filters some new kf based filters have recently been published such as the weighted ensemble kalman filter wenkf papadakis et al 2010 the weighted ensemble transform kalman filter wetkf beyou et al 2013 and the ensemble unscent kalman filter enukf luo and moroz 2009 however they differ from uwenkf proposed in this study in more detail the randomly selected ensemble members in wenkf and wetkf are not symmetric about the mean which may introduce spurious modes in transformed distribution similar to enkf luo and moroz 2009 errors are selected randomly in uwenkf but the ensemble members i e sigma points obtained by eq 22 are symmetric about the mean which reduces the effect of sample error luo and moroz 2009 for enukf the sigma points are derived from eq 17 with dimension 2 l 1 and l n l s l o where n is the dimension of state variable l s and l o are the dimensions of simulation noise and observation noise thus the dimensions of state variable simulation noise and observation noise determine the dimension of the sigma points however the number of sigma points in uwenkf 2 n n 1 is adjustable whereby the number of ensemble members differs between uwenkf and enukf in addition the weights are ω 0 λ l λ and ω i 1 2 l λ i 1 2 l for each sigma point in enukf whereas in uwenkf they are given by eqs 27 28 the ensemble members in uwenkf are therefore random and symmetric while their weights are different thus uwenkf has the advantages of enkf and gives larger weight to the important ensemble member and reduces the impact of sampling error luo and moroz 2009 3 4 data assimilation experiments design to achieve the aim of this study we set the ensemble size to 161 1601 and 16 001 members and the assimilation interval δ t ass to 6 h 12 h and 24 h thus nine assimilation experiments table 2 were conducted and the model with each filter was run independently 100 times in each experiment the time step in the simulation process was set to 1 h and only the surface 5 cm observed soil moisture data were assimilated into the richards equation for each assimilation interval the assimilation frequencies every 6 h every 12 h and daily every 24 h corresponded to the assimilation intervals for the data to be assimilated δ t ass 6 h 12 h and 24 h fig 2 shows the flowchart of the soil moisture assimilation process using enkf and uwenkf the nine assimilation experiments were followed by another five brief experiments that were designed and conducted to analyze the impact of initial value uncertainty of precipitation and soil properties on filter performance table 3 the precipitation in assimilation period and soil properties were set to have error ranges of 5 of observed values the initial value of soil moisture was set 0 2 m3 m3 in all soil layers 3 5 evaluation criteria the root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae were used to evaluate the influence of randomly generated ensemble members on filter performance when assimilating surface soil moisture data 39 rmse 1 tt t 1 tt x pred t x obs t 2 1 2 40 mae 1 tt t 1 tt x pred t x obs t where x pred t is the predicted assimilated soil moisture at time t x obs t is the observed soil moisture at time t and tt is the total number of time steps 4 results and discussion in the study the model was run for the period 2015 05 17 to 2015 09 21 and the assimilation experiments were conducted from 2015 08 01 day 213 to 2015 09 21 day 264 using data from station hy 4 1 performance of enkf and uwenkf figs 3 and 4 cases 1 9 show the 100 rmse and 100 mae values distributions with 100 independent assimilations runs for each of the nine experimental trials 3 assimilation frequencies 6 h 12 h 24 h 3 ensemble sizes 161 1201 16001 using enkf and uwenkf at four different soil depths 5 cm 20 cm 40 cm 80 cm the rmse and mae values indicate that random noise affected the performance of both enkf and uwenkf it is importantly to note that the 100 rmse and mae values for uwenkf were less than those for enkf no matter what the ensemble size or assimilation interval was the 100 rmse and mae values for uwenkf were more distributed than those for enkf especially for the assimilation frequency of every 6 h in soil depths 5 cm fig 3 a1 and fig 4 a1 40 cm fig 3 a3 and fig 4 a3 and 80 cm fig 3 a4 and fig 4 a4 as a result of the distribution the means of 100 rmse and mae values for uwenkf were smaller than those for enkf in other words the performance of uwenkf in soil moisture assimilation experiment was better than that of enkf irrespective of ensemble size and assimilation frequency the reason for this may be that the more important ensemble members were given larger weights in uwenkf whereas each member had the same weight in enkf which effectively decreased the weight of important members and increased the weight of unimportant members 4 2 effects of ensemble size figs 3 and 4 also show that the 100 rmse and mae values were distributed differently when the ensemble sizes differed to analyze the effects of ensemble size on enkf and uwenkf the means and standard errors std of 100 independent rmse values for different ensemble sizes and different assimilation intervals for soil moisture assimilation using enkf and uwenkf were shown in fig 5 cases 1 9 fig 5 a1 a4 and fig 5 c1 c4 show the means of 100 rmse values for enkf and uwenkf at all soil depths the mean rmse for each assimilation frequency showed little change when the ensemble size changed from 161 to 16001 that is to say the rmse for the assimilation results was distributed around the same value for a given assimilation frequency whatever the ensemble size changes fig 5 a4 shows that the mean rmse for enkf was larger than the rmse for simulations i e model results without assimilation at the fourth soil layer 80 cm whatever the assimilation frequency and ensemble size was the reason for this will be discussed later at other soil depths the smaller rmse values show that enkf gave better soil moisture simulations uwenkf improves the accuracy of soil moisture simulations at all soil depths fig 5 b1 b4 and 5 d1 d4 show the stds of 100 rmse values for enkf and uwenkf at different soil depths it is noted that the std for both enkf and uwenkf decreased when the ensemble size changed from 161 to 16 001 and were least for ensemble size 16001 that is to say that the range of the 100 rmse values decreases as ensemble size increases and the 100 rmse values were distributed more closely about the mean value for the larger ensemble size this occurs for the following reasons although each member selected from the probability distribution in an ensemble was different the effect of random noise on the mean value of the members for each ensemble was small and decreased as the ensemble size increased for all 100 independent sampling ensembles this indicates that increasing the number of ensemble members ensemble size selected reduced the effect of random noise on filter performance which is consistent with the results in dong et al 2015 thus the filter performance over several independent assimilation runs was more stable with a larger ensemble size the mean and std of 100 independent mae values of soil moisture for enkf and uwenkf with different ensemble sizes and different assimilation intervals were shown in fig 6 cases 1 9 the observations made from this figure parallel those made for rmse from fig 5 for different ensemble sizes 4 3 effects of assimilation frequency figs 5 6 also show that the assimilation frequency influenced filter performance it is noted that the std of rmse fig 5 b1 b4 and mae fig 6 b1 b4 for enkf decreased when the assimilation frequency changed from every 6 h to every 24 h except at soil depth 5 cm for ensemble size 161 when the ensemble size increased from 161 to 16001 the differences in std between the three assimilation frequencies for enkf became small similar conclusions were drawn for uwenkf fig 5 d1 d4 and fig 6 d1 d4 except at soil depth 20 cm for ensemble size 161 with assimilation intervals δ t ass 12 h however the differences in std values of rmse or mae between the three assimilation frequencies for uwenkf were larger than those for enkf at soil depths 5 cm 40 cm and 80 cm when the assimilation frequency changed from every 6 h to every 12 h in other words uwenkf was more easily influenced by random noise than enkf especially at a higher assimilation frequency this was due to the unequal weights of the ensemble members in uwenkf the important members differed among several sampled ensembles which led to the large differences in std of rmse values between several independent assimilation runs in comparison to enkf in which the members are equally weighted for a low assimilation frequency every 24 h with large ensemble size 16001 the random noise has little effect on the performance of either filter 4 4 computational overhead computational complexity is also a factor to consider in the evaluation of filter performance it determined that the calculation complexities of enkf and uwenkf are o m and o m2 where m is ensemble size this implies that uwenkf has a larger computational cost than enkf however the results obtained above showed that uwenkf was more effective than enkf in assimilating soil moisture thus using uwenkf with low assimilation frequency will reduce the computational burden to some degree but still provide accurate state predictions 4 5 soil moisture assimilation results the std of rmse and mae for assimilation results of several independent assimilation runs decreased as the ensemble size increased we take ensemble size 16 001 as an example to show the change in soil moisture at different assimilation frequencies figs 7 9 show the soil moisture assimilations for enkf and uwenkf with ensemble size 16 001 and δ t ass 6 h fig 7 case 3 12 h fig 8 case 6 and 24 h fig 9 case 9 the figures show that the simulations model results without assimilation well represented the changes in soil moisture when compared to the observation soil moisture decreased after precipitation perhaps because of the sandy loam soil and high evaporation the soil moisture model simulations show the greatest improvements from enkf and uwenkf when the surface 5 cm depth in situ soil moisture observations were assimilated except at the lowest soil layer 80 cm for enkf for the first three soil layers 5 cm 20 cm and 40 cm the assimilations using uwenkf were much closer to the observations than those using enkf i e uwenkf performed better than enkf at soil depth 80 cm enkf did not improve the soil moisture simulations but uwenkf did as shown in figs 7 9 the first reason for this is that the simulations overestimated soil moisture in the upper three soil layers but underestimated it in the 80 cm layer the second reason has to do with the ensemble member weighting the ensemble members were equally weighted in enkf and soil moisture was underestimated by enkf when compared to the simulations for the upper three soil layers the combination of equal member weighting and underestimation of soil moisture led to the enkf assimilations underestimating soil moisture compared to the simulation at 80 cm depth because only the surface soil moisture observed data were assimilated i e enkf did not improve soil moisture model simulations for the lowest soil layer however for uwenkf the unequal weight for each ensemble member and the members being symmetric distribution about the expectation perhaps led to uwenkf improving soil moisture simulations at all soil layers comparisons between the results shown in figs 7 9 show that the assimilation results differed most from the observations when the assimilation frequency decreased from every 6 h to every 24 h this can also be seen in fig 10 cases 3 6 9 which shows the rmse and mae values for enkf and uwenkf with ensemble size 16 001 and different δ t ass values correspond to figs 7 9 fig 10 shows that the rmse and mae values for enkf and uwenkf with different δ t ass frequencies were all less than model simulations the model results without assimilation except at 80 cm depth for enkf and the rmse and mae for uwenkf were smaller than those for enkf this demonstrates that the performance of uwenkf was better than that of enkf in soil moisture assimilation rmse and mae values for enkf and uwenkf increased as the assimilation frequency changed from every 6 h to every 24 h which also can be found in figs 5 and 6 except for enkf at 80 cm this is because the number of soil moisture model results updated decreased as the assimilation frequency decreased 4 6 effects of uncertainty of precipitation and soil properties and initial value in cases 10 14 ensemble size 16 001 is used as an example to analyze the effects of uncertainty in precipitation and soil properties and initial values on filter performance in the impact experiments an error range of 5 was allowed for precipitation and soil properties and the initial soil moisture 0 2 m3 m3 on 2015 05 17 was set in all four soil layers table 3 fig 11 cases 10 11 shows the rmse and mae for 5 errors of observed precipitation during the assimilation period it is noted that the rmse and mae varied for both filters when precipitation error changed from 5 to 5 that is they are increased for the topmost three layers and decreased for the lowest layer for high assimilation frequency e g every 6 h the variation of rmse and mae for two filters was smaller than that for simulations for low assimilation frequency e g every 24 h sometimes the variation of rmse and mae for two filters was larger than that for simulation but not apparently this is because many soil moisture model results were updated with high assimilation frequency similar to that of precipitation the rmse and mae for 5 errors of soil properties were shown in fig 12 cases 12 13 the rmse and mae decreased for the three topmost soil layers as error in soil properties changed from 5 to 5 but increased from 5 error to 0 and decreased from 0 to 5 for the lowest layer while the changes are small ensemble size of 16 001 is used as an example to investigate the effects of initial values on filters performance fig 13 shows the soil moisture assimilation results for initial soil moisture of 0 2 m3 m3 at all soil layers on 2015 05 17 with assimilation interval 6 h comparison of the results shown in fig 13 to those in fig 7 shows that both filters can improve the soil moisture simulations for the first three soil layers and that uwenkf performed better than enkf however for the bottom layer both filters can also improve the soil moisture simulations with initial soil moisture 0 2 m3 m3 but enkf does not when measured value is used as the initial value and uwenkf still performs better than enkf this is because when the measured value is used as the initial soil moisture the simulations underestimate the soil moisture at bottom layer and overestimated it at upper three layers however when the initial soil moisture is set to 0 2 m3 m3 the simulations are overestimated at all soil layers which led to the well performance of enkf in bottom layer the results are also can be seen by comparing the rmse and mae results in fig 10 and fig 14 with different initial values 5 summary and conclusions in this study based on enkf and the scaled unscented transformation we presented a new data assimilation technique the unscented weighted ensemble kalman filter uwenkf in uwenkf the randomly selected ensemble members are symmetric about the expectation and are unequally weighted i e no two members have equal weights the performance of uwenkf was investigated by assimilating surface 5 cm soil moisture data observed at the hy station in the upper reaches of the yellow river china into the richards equation with different assimilation frequencies and different ensemble sizes the preceding discussion of the results led to the following conclusions 1 the rmse and mae values for 100 independent assimilation runs show that the performance of the filter was greatly affected by noise perturbations which was also found by de lannoy et al 2006 uwenkf improves the model simulations better than enkf at all soil depths no matter what the ensemble size and the assimilation frequency are at the deepest soil layer enkf is influenced by the initial value but uwenkf greatly improves soil moisture simulations uncertainty in precipitation and soil properties has some impact on filter performance because both impact the model performance 2 the filter was sensitive to ensemble size and assimilation frequency increasing the ensemble size i e the number of randomly selected members can reduce the effects of random noise on filter performance over several independent assimilation runs as the ensemble size increases the differences between the results of independent assimilation runs decrease decreasing the assimilation frequency i e increasing the assimilation interval also reduces the effects of random noise on filter performance 3 uwenkf is computationally more cost than enkf but more effective thus for future multi source dataset assimilations e g using satellite soil moisture data with low assimilation frequency such as every 24 h uwenkf is a better choice if the computational burden is not a concern overall uwenkf is an effective and practical data assimilation technique that improves soil moisture model simulations although it requires considerably more computational resources it is benefit to obtain the high accuracy of catchment or global soil moisture estimations for different soil depths using the sparse in situ soil observations and remote sensing data which is helpful for rainfall proportions in watershed flood forecasting drought warning and

6000,a new data assimilation technique unscented weighted ensemble kalman filter uwenkf was developed based on the scaled unscented transformation and ensemble kalman filter enkf in uwenkf the individual members selected are unequally weighted and symmetric about the expectation to investigate the performance of uwenkf nine assimilation experiments with different ensemble sizes 161 1601 16001 and different assimilation frequencies every 6 h every 12 h every 24 h were designed to assimilate soil surface 5 cm moisture data observed at station hy in the upper reaches of the yellow river in the northeastern of tibetan plateau china into the richards equation the results showed that the performance of the filter was greatly affected by random noise and the filter was sensitive to ensemble size and assimilation frequency increasing the ensemble size reduced the effects of random noise on filter performance in several independent assimilation runs i e it decreased the differences between the results of the several independent assimilation runs reducing the assimilation frequency also reduced the effects of random noise on filter performance uwenkf gave more accurate soil moisture model results than enkf for all ensemble sizes and assimilation frequencies at all soil depths additionally enkf may have different performances according to different initial conditions but not for uwenkf precipitation and soil properties uncertainties had some impact on filter performance thus uwenkf is a better choice than enkf while it is more computationally demanding for improving soil moisture predictions by assimilating data from many sources such as satellite observed soil moisture data at a low assimilation frequency e g every 24 h keywords soil moisture

hydrology and agriculture heathman et al 2003 soil moisture determines the proportions of rainfall directed into surface runoff and soil infiltration yu et al 1999 silberstein et al 1999 western and bloschl 1999 koster et al 2003 influences the distribution of sensible and latent heat koster et al 2004 and affects irrigation scheduling and crop production in agriculture hanson et al 1998 ma et al 1998 lü et al 2011 fu et al 2014 however despite its importance accurate long term observations of soil moisture over large areas and in deep soil layers are difficult to obtain yu et al 2001 huang et al 2008 in recent decades land surface models and hydrological models have been used to provide long term soil moisture values for increased depths of soil at a regional scale yu et al 2006 for example the biosphere atmosphere transfer scheme dickinson et al 1993 and the simple biosphere model sib2 sellers et al 1996 were used to obtain soil moisture values at different soil depths the widely used common land model oleson et al 2004 has been used to simulate horizontal and vertical soil moisture and temperature behavior for a long period the variable infiltration capacity model vic liang et al 1994 and the topmodel based land surface atmosphere transfer scheme famiglietti and wood 1994a famiglietti and wood 1994b fu et al 2018a also simulate soil moisture behavior for different spatial scales however the results given by these models are biased because of uncertainties in model parameters model structure and forcing data yu et al 2001 2002 huang et al 2008 xu et al 2017 remote sensing can be used to obtain soil moisture data on a large scale for example parinussa et al 2012 used a radiative transfer based model to derive surface soil moisture data from the windsat spaceborne polarimetric microwave radiometer however remote sensing observation and data collection are limited to the soil surface jackson et al 1999 wang et al 2016 balsamo et al 2007 data assimilation is an effective technique to improve model predictions and simulations and has been widely used to estimate soil moisture by combining multi source datasets e g in situ soil moisture observations and remote sensing data over the past few decades kalman 1960 han and li 2008 yu et al 2014a 2014b fu et al 2014 dong et al 2015 dong et al 2016 sequential data assimilation has often been used to improve the accuracy of soil moisture predictions and simulations since the introduction of the kalman filter kf kalman 1960 however the application of kf is limited to linear dynamic systems and the linear observation operator luo and moroz 2009 to overcome the limitation of kf the extended kalman filter ekf was developed by restricting the taylor series for nonlinear functions to the second order evensen 1992 miller et al 1994 however ekf is not effective for large scale problems because the full forward covariance matrix greatly increases its computational cost luo and moroz 2009 the ensemble kalman filter enkf introduced by evensen 1994 is a computationally efficient technique that can accommodate nonlinear dynamics and which has been used in soil moisture assimilation experiments huang et al 2008 fu et al 2014 2019 liu et al 2016 brandhorst et al 2017 huang et al 2008 used enkf to assimilate the tropical rainfall measuring mission microwave imager brightness temperature data into the sib2 model to improve soil moisture predictions in tibetan plateau lievens et al 2016 used enkf to assimilate the soil moisture and ocean salinity brightness temperature data products into vic model to improve soil moisture predictions brandhorst et al 2017 used enkf to manage the uncertainty of soil hydraulic parameters in predicting soil moisture in enkf all ensemble members are equally weighted which reduces the effects of important members and exaggerates the effects of unimportant members luo and moroz 2009 demonstrated that even randomly selected members can have the correct mean and covariance in enkf but still introduce spurious modes in the transformed distribution which affects the performance of enkf han and li 2008 de lannoy et al 2006 sigma points with different weights for different members which supersedes the scaled unscented transformation julier and uhlmann 2004 han and li 2008 luo and moroz 2009 fu et al 2018b can more accurately reflect the importance of each member and may lead to incorporate the scaled unscented transformation to benefit the enkf performance han and li 2008 showed that filter performance is influenced by different equally sized ensembles of randomly selected members thus we aim to investigate the impact of the different randomly and equally sized ensembles on filters performance and lessen its influence in successive independently simulation runs then combined the characteristics of the scaled unscented transformation with enkf to create a new highly effective data assimilation technique the unscented weighted ensemble kalman filter uwenkf to achieve the objective experiments were designed to assimilate observed soil surface moisture data into the richards equation with ensemble sizes 161 1601 and 16001 and assimilation intervals δ t ass 6 h 12 h and 24 h using data observed at station hy in the upper reaches of the yellow river in the northeastern of the tibetan plateau china the field site and available data are described in section 2 section 3 describes the model operator filter structure experimental design and evaluation criteria the results are given and discussed in section 4 and the summary and conclusions are given in section 5 2 field site and data the source of the yellow river is in the northeast of the tibetan plateau the area has been the subject of much research because of its unique land surface processes which are due to the geographical location terrain and altitude fig 1 there are areas of permanent and seasonal permafrost in this region so the soil moisture observations and atmospheric forcing data e g precipitation wind speed air temperature from 2015 05 17 to 2015 09 21 recorded at experimental site hy in hongyuan county for 5 cm 20 cm 40 cm and 80 cm depths were selected to avoid the effects of permafrost soil moisture was measured every hour using an auto measurement system decagon inc usa which consisted of an em50 and four 5tm sensors precipitation was recorded every hour using a rain gauge land cover at the site is mainly alpine meadow and the average values of soil properties at different depths are listed in table 1 average annual precipitation is 749 1 mm and average annual temperature is 1 4 c 3 methodology 3 1 richards equation the richards equation is an one dimensional equation that describes soil water fluxes in the unsaturated zone of a homogeneous and isotropic soil richards 1931 hoeben and troch 2000 oleson et al 2004 lü et al 2011 chirico et al 2014 medina et al 2014a medina et al 2014b it was used as the model operator in the data assimilation scheme the θ based richards equation can be written as 1 θ t z d θ θ z k θ e where θ is volumetric soil moisture content m3 m3 t is time s z is soil depth mm d θ k θ d ψ d θ is the unsaturated diffusivity thus eq 1 is equal to θ t z k θ ψ z k θ e ψ is soil water matric potential mm k is soil hydraulic conductivity mm s and e is evapotranspiration loss mm s the clapp hornberger relationships clapp and hornberger 1978 are used to specify the dependence between k ψ and soil moisture content θ 2 ψ θ ψ s θ θ s b 3 k θ k s θ θ s 2 b 3 where ψ s ks and θ s are the saturated soil matric potential mm saturated soil hydraulic conductivity mm s and saturated volumetric soil moisture content m3 m3 respectively b is the distribution exponent of soil porosity in the numerical solution for the richards equation hoeben and troch 2000 lü et al 2010 medina et al 2014a b the upper boundary condition was determined by infiltration and precipitation and the lower boundary condition was defined as free drainage the initial state values used were the observed data for each layer to achieve the objective and they were set 0 2 m3 m3 to analyze the impact of initial value on filter performance soil hydraulic conductivity was calculated from the soil properties in table 1 and evapotranspiration was calculated by using the fao 56 penman monteith equation allen 2002 3 2 ensemble kalman filter enkf the state function f which maps the previous state x t 1 at time t 1 to state x t at time t the observation function h which indicates the deterministic relationship between the system states and observations both of them are required for enkf based data assimilation evensen 1994 moradkhani et al 2005 kumar et al 2008 xie and zhang 2010 yu et al 2014a b fu et al 2014 han et al 2014 the richards equation is used as the state function the observation function h is used to link the system state vector with the observations the two functions are presented as 4 x t f x t 1 v t 1 5 y t h x t u t where x t and y t are the state and measurement vectors of soil moisture at time t and v t and u t are state noise and measurement noise or error at time t there are two steps in enkf forecasting and updating the state 3 2 1 forecasting initial ensemble members x 0 i i 1 m is obtained by adding the random perturbations to the initial value x 0 according to the gaussian distribution with zero mean and error covariance matrix p huang et al 2008 fu et al 2014 the state variables can then be predicted by the state function 6 x t i f x t 1 i up

the number of errors generated in this study there are the same number of ensemble members i e the number of sigma points in uwenkf and enkf therefore m 2 n n 1 3 3 2 1 forecasting the state

eqs 24 35 and calculate the state estimation using eq 36 3 3 3 the differences between uwenkf and some new kf based filters some new kf based filters have recently been published such as the weighted ensemble kalman filter wenkf papadakis et al 2010 the weighted ensemble transform kalman filter wetkf beyou et al 2013 and the ensemble unscent kalman filter enukf luo and moroz 2009 however they differ from uwenkf proposed in this study in more detail the randomly selected ensemble members in wenkf and wetkf are not symmetric about the mean which may introduce spurious modes in transformed distribution similar to enkf luo and moroz 2009 errors are selected randomly in uwenkf but the ensemble members i e sigma points obtained by eq 22 are symmetric about the mean which reduces the effect of sample error luo and moroz 2009 for enukf the sigma points are derived from eq 17 with dimension 2 l 1 and l n l s l o where n is the dimension of state variable l s and l o are the dimensions of simulation noise and observation noise thus the dimensions of state variable simulation noise and observation noise determine the dimension of the sigma points however the number of sigma points in uwenkf 2 n n 1 is adjustable whereby the number of ensemble members differs between uwenkf and enukf in addition the weights are ω 0 λ l λ and ω i 1 2 l λ i 1 2 l for each sigma point in enukf whereas in uwenkf they are given by eqs 27 28 the ensemble members in uwenkf are therefore random and symmetric while their weights are different thus uwenkf has the advantages of enkf and gives larger weight to the important ensemble member and reduces the impact of sampling error luo and moroz 2009 3 4 data assimilation experiments design to achieve the aim of this study we set the ensemble size to 161 1601 and 16 001 members and the assimilation interval δ t ass to 6 h 12 h and 24 h thus nine assimilation experiments table 2 were conducted and the model with each filter was run independently 100 times in each experiment the time step in the simulation process was set to 1 h and only the surface 5 cm observed soil moisture data were assimilated into the richards equation for each assimilation interval the assimilation frequencies every 6 h every 12 h and daily every 24 h corresponded to the assimilation intervals for the data to be assimilated δ t ass 6 h 12 h and 24 h fig 2 shows the flowchart of the soil moisture assimilation process using enkf and uwenkf the nine assimilation experiments were followed by another five brief experiments that were designed and conducted to analyze the impact of initial value uncertainty of precipitation and soil properties on filter performance table 3 the precipitation in assimilation period and soil properties were set to have error ranges of 5 of observed values the initial value of soil moisture was set 0 2 m3 m3 in all soil layers 3 5 evaluation criteria the root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae were used to evaluate the influence of randomly generated ensemble members on filter performance when assimilating surface soil moisture data 39 rmse 1 tt t 1 tt x pred t x obs t 2 1 2 40 mae 1 tt t 1 tt x pred t x obs t where x pred t is the predicted assimilated soil moisture at time t x obs t is the observed soil moisture at time t and tt is the total number of time steps 4 results and discussion in the study the model was run for the period 2015 05 17 to 2015 09 21 and the assimilation experiments were conducted from 2015 08 01 day 213 to 2015 09 21 day 264 using data from station hy 4 1 performance of enkf and uwenkf figs 3 and 4 cases 1 9 show the 100 rmse and 100 mae values distributions with 100 independent assimilations runs for each of the nine experimental trials 3 assimilation frequencies 6 h 12 h 24 h 3 ensemble sizes 161 1201 16001 using enkf and uwenkf at four different soil depths 5 cm 20 cm 40 cm 80 cm the rmse and mae values indicate that random noise affected the performance of both enkf and uwenkf it is importantly to note that the 100 rmse and mae values for uwenkf were less than those for enkf no matter what the ensemble size or assimilation interval was the 100 rmse and mae values for uwenkf were more distributed than those for enkf especially for the assimilation frequency of every 6 h in soil depths 5 cm fig 3 a1 and fig 4 a1 40 cm fig 3 a3 and fig 4 a3 and 80 cm fig 3 a4 and fig 4 a4 as a result of the distribution the means of 100 rmse and mae values for uwenkf were smaller than those for enkf in other words the performance of uwenkf in soil moisture assimilation experiment was better than that of enkf irrespective of ensemble size and assimilation frequency the reason for this may be that the more important ensemble members were given larger weights in uwenkf whereas each member had the same weight in enkf which effectively decreased the weight of important members and increased the weight of unimportant members 4 2 effects of ensemble size figs 3 and 4 also show that the 100 rmse and mae values were distributed differently when the ensemble sizes differed to analyze the effects of ensemble size on enkf and uwenkf the means and standard errors std of 100 independent rmse values for different ensemble sizes and different assimilation intervals for soil moisture assimilation using enkf and uwenkf were shown in fig 5 cases 1 9 fig 5 a1 a4 and fig 5 c1 c4 show the means of 100 rmse values for enkf and uwenkf at all soil depths the mean rmse for each assimilation frequency showed little change when the ensemble size changed from 161 to 16001 that is to say the rmse for the assimilation results was distributed around the same value for a given assimilation frequency whatever the ensemble size changes fig 5 a4 shows that the mean rmse for enkf was larger than the rmse for simulations i e model results without assimilation at the fourth soil layer 80 cm whatever the assimilation frequency and ensemble size was the reason for this will be discussed later at other soil depths the smaller rmse values show that enkf gave better soil moisture simulations uwenkf improves the accuracy of soil moisture simulations at all soil depths fig 5 b1 b4 and 5 d1 d4 show the stds of 100 rmse values for enkf and uwenkf at different soil depths it is noted that the std for both enkf and uwenkf decreased when the ensemble size changed from 161 to 16 001 and were least for ensemble size 16001 that is to say that the range of the 100 rmse values decreases as ensemble size increases and the 100 rmse values were distributed more closely about the mean value for the larger ensemble size this occurs for the following reasons although each member selected from the probability distribution in an ensemble was different the effect of random noise on the mean value of the members for each ensemble was small and decreased as the ensemble size increased for all 100 independent sampling ensembles this indicates that increasing the number of ensemble members ensemble size selected reduced the effect of random noise on filter performance which is consistent with the results in dong et al 2015 thus the filter performance over several independent assimilation runs was more stable with a larger ensemble size the mean and std of 100 independent mae values of soil moisture for enkf and uwenkf with different ensemble sizes and different assimilation intervals were shown in fig 6 cases 1 9 the observations made from this figure parallel those made for rmse from fig 5 for different ensemble sizes 4 3 effects of assimilation frequency figs 5 6 also show that the assimilation frequency influenced filter performance it is noted that the std of rmse fig 5 b1 b4 and mae fig 6 b1 b4 for enkf decreased when the assimilation frequency changed from every 6 h to every 24 h except at soil depth 5 cm for ensemble size 161 when the ensemble size increased from 161 to 16001 the differences in std between the three assimilation frequencies for enkf became small similar conclusions were drawn for uwenkf fig 5 d1 d4 and fig 6 d1 d4 except at soil depth 20 cm for ensemble size 161 with assimilation intervals δ t ass 12 h however the differences in std values of rmse or mae between the three assimilation frequencies for uwenkf were larger than those for enkf at soil depths 5 cm 40 cm and 80 cm when the assimilation frequency changed from every 6 h to every 12 h in other words uwenkf was more easily influenced by random noise than enkf especially at a higher assimilation frequency this was due to the unequal weights of the ensemble members in uwenkf the important members differed among several sampled ensembles which led to the large differences in std of rmse values between several independent assimilation runs in comparison to enkf in which the members are equally weighted for a low assimilation frequency every 24 h with large ensemble size 16001 the random noise has little effect on the performance of either filter 4 4 computational overhead computational complexity is also a factor to consider in the evaluation of filter performance it determined that the calculation complexities of enkf and uwenkf are o m and o m2 where m is ensemble size this implies that uwenkf has a larger computational cost than enkf however the results obtained above showed that uwenkf was more effective than enkf in assimilating soil moisture thus using uwenkf with low assimilation frequency will reduce the computational burden to some degree but still provide accurate state predictions 4 5 soil moisture assimilation results the std of rmse and mae for assimilation results of several independent assimilation runs decreased as the ensemble size increased we take ensemble size 16 001 as an example to show the change in soil moisture at different assimilation frequencies figs 7 9 show the soil moisture assimilations for enkf and uwenkf with ensemble size 16 001 and δ t ass 6 h fig 7 case 3 12 h fig 8 case 6 and 24 h fig 9 case 9 the figures show that the simulations model results without assimilation well represented the changes in soil moisture when compared to the observation soil moisture decreased after precipitation perhaps because of the sandy loam soil and high evaporation the soil moisture model simulations show the greatest improvements from enkf and uwenkf when the surface 5 cm depth in situ soil moisture observations were assimilated except at the lowest soil layer 80 cm for enkf for the first three soil layers 5 cm 20 cm and 40 cm the assimilations using uwenkf were much closer to the observations than those using enkf i e uwenkf performed better than enkf at soil depth 80 cm enkf did not improve the soil moisture simulations but uwenkf did as shown in figs 7 9 the first reason for this is that the simulations overestimated soil moisture in the upper three soil layers but underestimated it in the 80 cm layer the second reason has to do with the ensemble member weighting the ensemble members were equally weighted in enkf and soil moisture was underestimated by enkf when compared to the simulations for the upper three soil layers the combination of equal member weighting and underestimation of soil moisture led to the enkf assimilations underestimating soil moisture compared to the simulation at 80 cm depth because only the surface soil moisture observed data were assimilated i e enkf did not improve soil moisture model simulations for the lowest soil layer however for uwenkf the unequal weight for each ensemble member and the members being symmetric distribution about the expectation perhaps led to uwenkf improving soil moisture simulations at all soil layers comparisons between the results shown in figs 7 9 show that the assimilation results differed most from the observations when the assimilation frequency decreased from every 6 h to every 24 h this can also be seen in fig 10 cases 3 6 9 which shows the rmse and mae values for enkf and uwenkf with ensemble size 16 001 and different δ t ass values correspond to figs 7 9 fig 10 shows that the rmse and mae values for enkf and uwenkf with different δ t ass frequencies were all less than model simulations the model results without assimilation except at 80 cm depth for enkf and the rmse and mae for uwenkf were smaller than those for enkf this demonstrates that the performance of uwenkf was better than that of enkf in soil moisture assimilation rmse and mae values for enkf and uwenkf increased as the assimilation frequency changed from every 6 h to every 24 h which also can be found in figs 5 and 6 except for enkf at 80 cm this is because the number of soil moisture model results updated decreased as the assimilation frequency decreased 4 6 effects of uncertainty of precipitation and soil properties and initial value in cases 10 14 ensemble size 16 001 is used as an example to analyze the effects of uncertainty in precipitation and soil properties and initial values on filter performance in the impact experiments an error range of 5 was allowed for precipitation and soil properties and the initial soil moisture 0 2 m3 m3 on 2015 05 17 was set in all four soil layers table 3 fig 11 cases 10 11 shows the rmse and mae for 5 errors of observed precipitation during the assimilation period it is noted that the rmse and mae varied for both filters when precipitation error changed from 5 to 5 that is they are increased for the topmost three layers and decreased for the lowest layer for high assimilation frequency e g every 6 h the variation of rmse and mae for two filters was smaller than that for simulations for low assimilation frequency e g every 24 h sometimes the variation of rmse and mae for two filters was larger than that for simulation but not apparently this is because many soil moisture model results were updated with high assimilation frequency similar to that of precipitation the rmse and mae for 5 errors of soil properties were shown in fig 12 cases 12 13 the rmse and mae decreased for the three topmost soil layers as error in soil properties changed from 5 to 5 but increased from 5 error to 0 and decreased from 0 to 5 for the lowest layer while the changes are small ensemble size of 16 001 is used as an example to investigate the effects of initial values on filters performance fig 13 shows the soil moisture assimilation results for initial soil moisture of 0 2 m3 m3 at all soil layers on 2015 05 17 with assimilation interval 6 h comparison of the results shown in fig 13 to those in fig 7 shows that both filters can improve the soil moisture simulations for the first three soil layers and that uwenkf performed better than enkf however for the bottom layer both filters can also improve the soil moisture simulations with initial soil moisture 0 2 m3 m3 but enkf does not when measured value is used as the initial value and uwenkf still performs better than enkf this is because when the measured value is used as the initial soil moisture the simulations underestimate the soil moisture at bottom layer and overestimated it at upper three layers however when the initial soil moisture is set to 0 2 m3 m3 the simulations are overestimated at all soil layers which led to the well performance of enkf in bottom layer the results are also can be seen by comparing the rmse and mae results in fig 10 and fig 14 with different initial values 5 summary and conclusions in this study based on enkf and the scaled unscented transformation we presented a new data assimilation technique the unscented weighted ensemble kalman filter uwenkf in uwenkf the randomly selected ensemble members are symmetric about the expectation and are unequally weighted i e no two members have equal weights the performance of uwenkf was investigated by assimilating surface 5 cm soil moisture data observed at the hy station in the upper reaches of the yellow river china into the richards equation with different assimilation frequencies and different ensemble sizes the preceding discussion of the results led to the following conclusions 1 the rmse and mae values for 100 independent assimilation runs show that the performance of the filter was greatly affected by noise perturbations which was also found by de lannoy et al 2006 uwenkf improves the model simulations better than enkf at all soil depths no matter what the ensemble size and the assimilation frequency are at the deepest soil layer enkf is influenced by the initial value but uwenkf greatly improves soil moisture simulations uncertainty in precipitation and soil properties has some impact on filter performance because both impact the model performance 2 the filter was sensitive to ensemble size and assimilation frequency increasing the ensemble size i e the number of randomly selected members can reduce the effects of random noise on filter performance over several independent assimilation runs as the ensemble size increases the differences between the results of independent assimilation runs decrease decreasing the assimilation frequency i e increasing the assimilation interval also reduces the effects of random noise on filter performance 3 uwenkf is computationally more cost than enkf but more effective thus for future multi source dataset assimilations e g using satellite soil moisture data with low assimilation frequency such as every 24 h uwenkf is a better choice if the computational burden is not a concern overall uwenkf is an effective and practical data assimilation technique that improves soil moisture model simulations although it requires considerably more computational resources it is benefit to obtain the high accuracy of catchment or global soil moisture

6001,short rainfall events contribute to large portions of annual sediment and nutrient exports most water quality sampling schemes rely on regularly spaced temporal sampling and increasingly monitoring schemes are including a form of event based sampling a typical approach is to sample each event using equal intervals in time using an automatic sampler the use of this form of sampling is systematic in nature and requires model based statistics to be analysed correctly probabilistic based sampling methods allow for easier and more defendable statistical inference as the assumptions are not based on a model rather they are based on the sample design several probabilistic methods have been developed however these methods commonly require additional hardware to implement in this paper we present a method using a stratified random sampling procedure for automatic samplers which does not require any additional hardware our approach is to divide the mean event hydrograph into strata based on key features such as the rising and falling limbs random sampling is applied within each strata a problem of this approach is that the length of the event and strata must be defined before each event we therefore outline how the samples can be post stratified after each event based on the key hydrological components of each event the sampling scheme is outlined using continuously sampled electrical conductivity and turbidity data of three events from a creek in south eastern australia limited to 24 samples per event estimated event mean cis were within the observed event means for all three events this method provides a flexible low cost sampling scheme providing unbiased estimates of key event hydrological components which can be easily adapted by catchment management authorities keywords load estimation electrical conductivity turbidity event sampling event mean concentration 1 introduction it is widely accepted that event based water quality sampling is required to accurately characterise the temporal variation in water quality this is especially evident in catchments characterised by long durations of base flow where short rainfall events are responsible for exporting the majority of nutrients kronvang and bruhn 1996 johnes 2007 drewry et al 2009 recent studies using continuously measured data have highlighted the importance of high frequency sampling and the information this can provide for understanding hydrological processes kirchner et al 2004 burt et al 2011 cassidy and jordan 2011 wade et al 2012 however due to financial constraints it is unlikely that these new technologies will be widely implemented in the near future wade et al 2012 with the majority of catchment managers relying on automatic samplers to sample during rainfall events bartley et al 2012 lessels and bishop 2015 furthermore for many water quality properties there are no options for field based continuous sensors without access to continuously monitored data catchment managers often rely on a combination of grab samples and automatic samplers to collect samples during rainfall events however during rainfall events access to water quality monitoring sites is often limited for example safety constraints require the sydney catchment authority in australia to use helicopters to access sites after 10 15 mm rainfall events sydney catchment authority 2011 under these restrictions it is necessary for catchment managers to rely on field based equipment to take samples during an event this equipment generally consists of two devices a stream discharge measuring device and an automatic sampling device wang et al 2011 the use of these devices introduces additional limitations on the sample scheme one of the largest constraints of automatic samplers is the number of bottles which is typically 24 and therefore the maximum samples possible per event common objectives of event based sampling studies are for estimation of load drewry et al 2009 and event mean concentration bartley et al 2012 it is important to assess the objectives of the sampling schemes to determine the most appropriate design de gruijter et al 2006 the research of marsh and waters 2009 found that event load estimation requires samples to be collected during both the rising and falling limb to ensure accurate estimates are obtained if the objective of event based sampling is to estimate the event mean concentration then continuous sampling would be preferred as this is rarely possible it is important that the selected sampling scheme is unbiased and therefore provides unbiased estimates of the mean and its uncertainty thomas and lewis 1993 several water quality models now require a form of event mean concentration for parameterisation bartley et al 2012 in general sampling schemes can be divided into two categories probabilistic design based and non probabilistic model based de gruijter et al 2006 non probabilistic sampling designs do not require known inclusion probabilities i e the probability of a sample being taken at time t however these methods require the use of a model to provide unbiased estimates of the uncertainty of the mean de gruijter et al 2006 lessels and bishop 2013 probabilistic sampling schemes rely on known inclusion probabilities and therefore do not require a model to provide unbiased estimates of the uncertainty of the mean de gruijter et al 2006 the most commonly used event based sampling scheme is systematic sampling based on equally spaced samples through time or flow volume harmel et al 2006 this form of sampling is known to provide unbiased mean estimates when used with a random starting time de gruijter et al 2006 lohr 2009 or by using a model which accounts for the correlation between samples lessels and bishop 2013 de gruijter et al 2006 under this form of sampling one must assume the sample interval is short enough to provide adequate coverage of the sampled property throughout the event which may not be true especially during the rising limb of an event probabilistic sampling schemes provide unbiased estimates of the event mean and its uncertainty the use of probabilistic sample designs for water quality sampling has been investigated by thomas 1985 thomas 1988 thomas and lewis 1993 thomas and lewis 1995 and arabkhedri et al 2010 focusing on suspended sediments they evaluated several different probabilistic methods the methods evaluated include selection at list time which is a form of probabilities proportional to size sampling thomas 1985 thomas 1988 thomas and lewis 1995 simple random sampling thomas 1988 flow proportional thomas 1988 flow stratified thomas and lewis 1995 and time stratified thomas and lewis 1993 thomas and lewis 1995 sampling schemes more recently arabkhedri et al 2010 has demonstrated the use of adaptive cluster sampling to estimate suspended sediments the results of these studies showed that it is possible to provide accurate unbiased event based estimates using probabilistic sample designs however these methods have not been widely implemented we believe the main reason for the lack of use is due to the perceived complexity of the design and possibly due to the focus on suspended sediment exports and the additional hardware and software requirements we are therefore proposing a method which is a variation of that of thomas and lewis 1993 the time stratified method outlined by thomas and lewis 1993 used a scheduled based approach with the sampling strata based on the size and extent of real time changes of stream discharge during an event in combination with short strata with small sample sizes to maximise sample coverage the implementation of this method requires additional hardware and programming knowledge therefore we have attempted to simplify their method by using a simplified design based on historical stream discharge data in contrast to predicting strata lengths in real time we propose the use of one stratification based on a mean hydrograph combined with post stratification which provides the ability to re stratify the samples into key components of each observed event hydrograph e g rising and falling limbs the novelty our work is that it builds on previous work on stratified random sampling of events but improves on this by illustrating the use of post event stratification of the events this allows users to estimate the mean and its precision for whole events or components of events which in most cases can be only identified retrospectively rainfall events and the corresponding response of water quality and stream discharge is of great interest to catchment managers as the exported particles and nutrients during these periods represent a large portion of the annual exports however catchment managers are often challenged by low budgets and multiple monitoring sites with the goal of monitoring the state of catchments through time and space therefore a sampling scheme which can utilise low cost sampling equipment to provide unbiased accurate estimates of water quality variables which are affected by different hydrological controls is required in this paper we evaluate a simplified time stratified sampling scheme to estimate different water quality properties affected by different transport pathways using turbidity and electrical conductivity ec we evaluated the use of event based time stratified sampling to provide estimates that relate to two distinctly different flow transport paths the two flow paths of interest are overland flow and baseflow using turbidity and ec to reflect these paths respectively turbidity has been used to improve estimates of total phosphorus tp biggs 1995 and total suspended solids tss biggs 1995 lane et al 2006 and heavily affected by rainfall intensity and duration miller et al 2015 whereas ec has been used for base flow separation pellerin et al 2008 and to estimate dissolved nitrogen and particulate nitrogen kim and furumai 2012 and has been found to significantly correlated to the mean transit time of the catchment mosquera and vaché 2016 by sampling continuously turbidity and ec data we examine the use of stratified sampling for event based water quality monitoring therefore it is the aim of this paper to 1 outline a simple stratified sampling for estimating event mean concentrations for different water quality properties and 2 outline the method used to restratify samples after each event based on the observed stream discharge to provide information on key hydrological components of events which is restricted by the capacity of commonly used automatic water samplers 2 methods 2 1 catchment description fig 1 presents the muttama creek catchment 1061 km2 which is located in the south west slopes of new south wales in south eastern australia agriculture is the main land use in the catchment with winter cropping and pastures being the dominant agricultural practices a main feature of the catchment are several north south fault lines on the eastern side of the main stream conyers et al 2008 these fault lines are associated with ultrabasic rocks with frequent outcrops of serpentine conyers et al 2008 in contrast the western side is dominated by slates and rhyolite conyers et al 2008 the geological variety in the catchment has lead to a variety of soil types of particular importance are sodosols in the north west of the catchment warren et al 1995 which are highly dispersive soils isbell 2002 these areas are also associated with saline areas conyers et al 2008 a recent study by orton et al 2016 found high soil clay content variability ranging from 8 to 83 several catchment characteristics are provided in table 1 rainfall within the catchment was 507 mm with an annual discharge of 578 98 gl rainfall was recorded at a single location in the north of the catchment 1 as this was the only gauge in the catchment with sub hourly data the main township of cootamundra is in the north of the catchment with a population of 7729 australian bureau of statistics 2010 2 2 event description a ysi sonde hydrolab corporation austin texas was used to collect turbidity data for each event rainfall stream discharge and electrical conductivity data was obtained from the government monitoring stations http waterinfo nsw gov au table 2 provides a summary of the conditions prior to and during each event each of the events were triggered by rainfall events with the total rainfall being larger prior to the event for the first and third events however more rainfall was recorded during the second event the second event was the largest event with a total of 142 mm rainfall falling prior to and during the event the rainfall intensity average observed rainfall 15 min 1 was higher prior to each of the events mean turbidity was lower in the 24 h period prior to each of the events while ec was higher before each of the events and lower during the events fig 2 shows the observed rainfall stream discharge turbidity and ec of the three events the first event fig 2a occurred in august 2011 and is representative of events for this catchment the observed double peak in the hydrograph is a common feature of event hydrographs at this site which is possibly due to the figure eight like shape of the catchment gordon et al 2004 p 67 the second event fig 2b occurred in march 2012 and was the largest event on record three peaks occurred during this event with two distinct rainfall events the third event fig 2c occurred in july 2012 and is similar but smaller than the first event however rain during the falling limb caused an additional smaller peak 2 3 defining strata and sample sizes to perform event based sampling it is necessary to define certain aspects of an event to use a probabilistic based sampling design the start and end of the event and the sample sizes length and number of strata are also required we propose a simple 4 step process to define a general time stratified sampling scheme 1 determine the event trigger height based on the upper 5 of the stream height distribution 2 find all events using the trigger height as the start and end of each event 3 determine the length of the event using the mean duration of these events and 4 create a mean event hydrograph using the trigger height and the mean event length use this to define strata and sample sizes event based sampling is generally commenced using a trigger consisting of a pre determined stream height reached during the rising limb it is therefore important that this height is not too low as to be triggered by small rises of stream height but not too large which would commence the sampling to late harmel et al 2002 our approach is to use the stream height which corresponds to the 95th percentile stream height the flow duration curve for muttama creek is based on the last 10 years of observations and is shown in fig 3 with the corresponding 95th percentile stream height 1 4 m to define the duration of the mean event all events are found by defining the start of the event as the time where the trigger height is exceeded and the end of the event as the time where the stream height recedes below the trigger height using these events the mean event length is defined as the mean of all events which are longer than 12 h fig 4 shows the event mean hydrograph based on the trigger height with the mean event strata boundaries the initial strata are defined based on the mean event hydrograph and are such that they provide good coverage of rapid changes of stream discharge strata 1 2 and 3 are designed to cover the rising limb initial peak and second peak of the hydrograph strata 4 and 5 are longer and designed to capture the tail of the event assuming a maximum sample size of 24 the sample size of each strata is defined as 6 6 4 4 and 4 larger sample sizes are given to the initial two strata as these strata are associated with sharp changes in stream discharge 2 4 strata and event analysis stratified sampling is a common sampling design a detailed description of its application is provided by de gruijter et al 2006 p 82 using this information the mean of an event is estimated using 1 z st 1 t h 1 h t h z h where h is the number of strata in the event t is the total time of the event th duration of time in strata h and z h is the mean of stratum h in this study t 107 h the mean event duration th 5 9 26 35 32 h the variance of each stratum mean is estimated by 2 v z h 1 n h n h 1 i 1 n h z hi z h 2 where n h is the sample size of stratum h therefore n h 2 is needed to estimate the variance of the mean using eq 2 the variance of the event mean can be estimated using 3 v z st 1 t 2 h 1 h t h 2 v z h which can be used to estimate the standard error of the event mean v z st confidence intervals are easily estimated for each strata by 4 z t 1 α 2 v z h where t 1 α 2 is the t critical value of the student distribution with degrees of freedom and α is the probability value which is set to 0 025 if we wish to estimate the 95 confidence interval around the mean similarly eq 4 can be used to estimate the confidence interval around the event mean concentration 2 5 post event stratification post event stratification is the term given to the reclassification of samples into new strata to simplify and reduce confusion new strata are referred to as domains in this paper this process is used to combine samples from multiple strata into domains the major benefit of this process is the ability to perform this task based on the observed stream hydrograph of each individual event the only limitation of this process is the requirement that at least 2 samples from each stratum fall within the domain to estimate the variance of the domain mean using event 2 as an example the samples from multiple strata are reclassified into domains based on the three peaks of the event fig 5 shows the hydrograph of the event with the three domains and locations of the samples in addition to mean estimates the rising and falling limbs are also examined in this chapter the rising limb is from the start of the event to the maximum value of the first peak and the falling limb is the remaining part of the event a detailed description of reclassification of stratified sampling into domains can be found in särndal et al 2003 p 390 based on this description the mean of a stratum within each domain can be estimated using 5 z dh i 1 n h i dhi z hi n dh where i dhi is an indicator vector where 1 indicates the sample is within the domain and 0 the sample is not within the domain z hi is the i th observation of domain h and n dh is the amount of samples in stratum h and domain d therefore the mean of the domain is estimated using 6 z d h 1 h t h n dh n h z dh h 1 h t h n dh n h the associated standard error of the domain mean can be estimated by 7 se z d 1 t d 2 h 1 h t h 2 n dh 1 s dh 2 n dh 1 n dh n h z dh z d 2 n d n d 1 where t d is the duration of time of the domain n d is the amount of samples with domain d and the variance is estimated using 8 s dh 2 i 1 n h i dhi z di z d 2 n dh 1 it is important to note that each domain requires n dh 2 to allow for an estimate of s dh 2 särndal et al 2003 3 results 3 1 time stratified sampling sampling locations fig 6 shows the location of each sample within each strata of the three observed events the shape of the hydrograph of the first event fig 6a closely resembles the mean event hydrograph fig 4 with the strata boundaries closely matching the desired components of the hydrograph the second event fig 6b is not similar to the mean event hydrograph due to additional rainfall during the event and only the first and second strata match the changing conditions of the first peak of the event in addition to this the pre determined time of the event did not meet the extended duration of the event the third event fig 6c is similar to both the first event and the mean event hydrograph with the strata matching the desired hydrograph components however a small peak occurred during the falling stage of the hydrograph the use of the mean event strata closely matched 2 of the 3 observed events such variation would be expected and shows the importance of post stratification if we wish to extract mean values from different components of the event hydrograph 3 2 stratified estimates the stratified mean estimates with confidence intervals of turbidity and ec of each event are shown in fig 7 in addition to the strata estimates the observed continuous data is also provided with the mean estimates of each strata also provided observed means for all strata estimates for both turbidity and ec of all three events are within the associated confidence intervals except for the third strata for turbidity for event 3 fig 7c confidence interval width related to the number of samples and variation within the strata therefore strata with the greatest variation require additional sampling effort to increase the precision of the mean estimates the confidence intervals of event 1 fig 7a indicate that the underlying trend of turbidity varies most during the first and third strata this variation is shown by the continuously sampled turbidity data similarly the first strata of ec in this event was also the largest confidence interval ci of this event event 2 fig 7b was the largest event on record for the site in terms of maximum stream height and it had three distinct peaks within the event hydrograph the first and last strata have large ci widths indicating a large amount of variation during these times which is confirmed by the continuously monitored data a similar trend can also be seen in event 3 fig 7c where the ci width of the first strata is quite wide compared with other strata ci widths of this event the third strata ci estimate does not cover the observed mean turbidity with the observed mean falling outside the ci by 9 96 ntu by examining fig 6c it can be seen that 3 out of the 4 samples were collected towards the end of this strata after the peak of observed turbidity fig 7c observed mean ec of each strata do fall within the ci of the estimates for this event with relatively large ci widths for the first and third strata these results indicate that this simple application of stratified sampling provides accurate estimates of key hydrological components of event hydrographs and can provide information about transport pathways during events 3 3 event estimates by combining the strata mean estimates it is possible to obtain event mean estimates table 3 provides event mean estimates and observed means for each event using the time stratified event estimates it is possible to observe the relationship between the size of the event and the observed means for each event this trend indicates that the event means of turbidity and ec are directly related to the size of each event with the largest event event 2 having the largest mean turbidity during the event and the smallest event event 3 having the smallest estimated mean turbidity of the three events this trend can be explained by the higher amount of surface derived suspended sediments in the stream during the events this trend is inversely true for ec where the rainfall dilutes the ec of the stream water resulting in a lower conductivity during the event as prior to the event where the stream water is dominated by sub surface flows observed turbidity 224 73 was overestimated by 62 42 for event 2 but within the ci of the estimate in this situation the large estimated uncertainty provides additional information indicating the large variation during this event in contrast to this the estimated mean turbidity of event 3 was very accurate and had ci of 18 22 ntu this accuracy was achieved with a sample size of 24 for the 107 h period comprising 428 possible sample times reinforcing the ability of design based methods to provide accurate estimates of event means 3 4 re stratified domain estimates by re stratifying the strata into domains it is possible to provide unbiased estimates of key components of the event hydrograph table 4 provides the estimates of the key components of each event hydrograph for each event estimates were made of the rising limb falling limb and peak of the event the boundaries of each peak in an event is based on the start minima between each peak and the end of the event for example the boundaries of each peak for the second event are shown in fig 5 three peaks were observed for the second event but there was no easily definable rising and falling limb therefore the rising and falling limbs were not estimated for this event the observed ec mean for each domain is within the ci of the estimates for the rising limb falling limb and all peak estimates for the three events the observed means of turbidity were within the estimated ci of the rising limb falling limb and peak 1 domains for all events the estimation of the peak 2 of event 1 was over estimated and the observed mean fell outside the ci this is most likely due to only 2 samples being available to estimate the domain mean during event 2 a smaller peak at the start of the event triggered the event sampling scheme whilst a second rainfall event occurred towards the end of the event causing a third peak of stream discharge as this was the final peak was towards the end of the event only 4 samples fell within this range of this domain as a result of this large variation of turbidity during this period the ci of the estimate is large and reflects the large variation between the four samples peak 2 event 3 was also poorly estimated with the observed mean falling outside the estimated ci 4 discussion the majority of event based sampling schemes are non probabilistic wang et al 2011 the results of these sampling schemes are inherently biased and may be affected by large intervals between samples thomas and lewis 1995 the importance of high frequency samples to accurately characterise variation in water quality is well known kirchner et al 2004 burt et al 2011 cassidy and jordan 2011 however the majority of event based sampling schemes rely on automatic samplers with a maximum sample size of 24 to sample events the presented time stratified sampling scheme offers the ability to provide accurate unbiased estimates under this restriction with the ability to reclassify strata after each event to estimate mean values for key hydrograph components by using the stream discharge data it was possible to identify key components of the event hydrograph and design a simple time stratified sampling scheme for the three observed events these strata were quite close to events 1 and 3 the defined strata did not match the shape of the second event by using domain based estimates it was possible to provide accurate mean estimates of both turbidity and ec for the three peaks of this event with the observed mean within the ci of each domain in some situations historical stream discharge data is not available under these limitations it is still possible to use the outlined method but instead of using stream discharge to define the initial strata rainfall or expert knowledge could be used with the flexibility of the proposed sampling scheme it would be possible to derive accurate estimates using post event stratification the proposed sampling scheme is framed around the limitation of an automatic water sampler with a total capacity of 24 samples being trigger by a rise in stream height at the start of the event this restriction on the proposed sampling scheme was emplaced as most catchment managers have limited resources but often have access to an automatic sampler with a capacity of 24 samples however this restriction can lead to too few samples being collected at periods of high variation as seen during the second half of the second event in these situations post event restratification can be utilised to provide more accurate estimates of water quality properties during these periods water quality sampling schemes are often designed to sample multiple water quality properties are affected by different hydrological flow paths and different biological physical and chemical processes under this situation it is often difficult to design a sampling scheme which is capable of providing accurate estimates of all variables in this study we focussed on turbidity and ec because they are affected differently by rainfall intensity and duration and transit times the results show that the sampling scheme is capable of providing accurate event mean estimates of both turbidity and ec the results also highlight the complexity of designing a sampling scheme which under the limitations of automatic samplers can provide accurate estimates during highly variable periods the results of the stratified sampling shows the mean turbidity of the first strata rising limb is greater than the second strata of each event in addition to this the domain estimates also help identify these controlling processes for example during the second event fig 2b the second peak of turbidity coincided with an additional rainfall event the controlling processes of ec are also evident for example the results of the domain estimates of each of these individual peaks table 4 improves the understanding of groundwater sources of each individual peak for events 1 and 3 the second peak had a higher ec mean than the first peak of these events however the second event had a smaller ec mean for the second peak due to the additional rainfall event based sampling is often used to estimate event mean concentration or event loads for water quality modelling wang et al 2011 bartley et al 2012 ratio based methods are commonly used to estimate true loads however these require probabilistic sample designs wang et al 2011 these results show how a simple time stratified sample design can provide unbiased accurate mean estimates which can be used in conjunction with ratio based methods or used to directly estimate event loads thomas and lewis 1995 many water quality models now require estimates of event mean concentration feikema et al 2011 bartley et al 2012 time stratified sampling offers the ability to provide unbiased accurate event mean concentrations for these models 5 conclusion we have presented the use of a simple time stratified sampling scheme which can be implemented in the bounds of current hardware limitations the method provided accurate mean event estimates of two water quality properties affected by different flow paths through this we have shown 1 probabilistic sampling schemes do not require great complexity to provide accurate event mean estimates 2 it is possible to use probabilistic sampling schemes to provide accurate event means of two separate water quality variables affected by two different flow paths without any additional hardware or software 3 estimates of key hydrograph components can be made using re stratification after each event the presented research focussed on turbidity and ec in an australian catchment and future research should examine the reliability of the sampling scheme in different catchments and for other water quality properties additionally improvements to the sample design are possible by optimising the number of samples per strata in order to get more precise estimates of the event mean for example more variable strata would receive more samples unbiased meaningful sampling schemes are required as it is highly unlikely that continuous monitoring devices will be widely deployed event based water quality sampling schemes require additional attention to provide unbiased accurate estimates of event exports and should not be limited to systematic sampling schemes acknowledgments the authors would like to

measuring device and an automatic sampling device wang et al 2011 the use of these devices introduces additional limitations on the sample scheme one of the largest constraints of automatic samplers is the number of bottles which is typically 24 and therefore the maximum samples possible per event common objectives of event based sampling studies are for estimation of load drewry et al 2009 and event mean concentration bartley et al 2012 it is important to assess the objectives of the sampling schemes to determine the most appropriate design de gruijter et al 2006 the research of marsh and waters 2009 found that event load estimation requires samples to be collected during both the rising and falling limb to ensure accurate estimates are obtained if the objective of event based sampling is to estimate the event mean concentration then continuous sampling would be preferred as this is rarely possible it is important that the selected sampling scheme is unbiased and therefore provides unbiased estimates of the mean and its uncertainty thomas and lewis 1993 several water quality models now require a form of event mean concentration for parameterisation bartley et al 2012 in general sampling schemes can be divided into two categories probabilistic design based and non probabilistic model based de gruijter et al 2006 non probabilistic sampling designs do not require known inclusion probabilities i e the probability of a sample being taken at time t however these methods require the use of a model to provide unbiased estimates of the uncertainty of the mean de gruijter et al 2006 lessels and bishop 2013 probabilistic sampling schemes rely on known inclusion probabilities and therefore do not require a model to provide unbiased estimates of the uncertainty of the mean de gruijter et al 2006 the most commonly used event based sampling scheme is systematic sampling based on equally spaced samples through time or flow volume harmel et al 2006 this form of sampling is known to provide unbiased mean estimates when used with a random starting time de gruijter et al 2006 lohr 2009 or by using a model which accounts for the correlation between samples lessels and bishop 2013 de gruijter et al 2006 under this form of sampling one must assume the sample interval is short enough to provide adequate coverage of the sampled property throughout the event which may not be true especially during the rising limb of an event probabilistic sampling schemes provide unbiased estimates of the event mean and its uncertainty the use of probabilistic sample designs for water quality sampling has been investigated by thomas 1985 thomas 1988 thomas and lewis 1993 thomas and lewis 1995 and arabkhedri et al 2010 focusing on suspended sediments they evaluated several different probabilistic methods the methods evaluated include selection at list time which is a form of probabilities proportional to size sampling thomas 1985 thomas 1988 thomas and lewis 1995 simple random sampling thomas 1988 flow proportional thomas 1988 flow stratified thomas and lewis 1995 and time stratified thomas and lewis 1993 thomas and lewis 1995 sampling schemes more recently arabkhedri et al 2010 has demonstrated the use of adaptive cluster sampling to estimate suspended sediments the results of these studies showed that it is possible to provide accurate unbiased event based estimates using probabilistic sample designs however these methods have not been widely implemented we believe the main reason for the lack of use is due to the perceived complexity of the design and possibly due to the focus on suspended sediment exports and the additional hardware and software requirements we are therefore proposing a method which is a variation of that of thomas and lewis 1993 the time stratified method outlined by thomas and lewis 1993 used a scheduled based approach with the sampling strata based on the size and extent of real time changes of stream discharge during an event in combination with short strata with small sample sizes to maximise sample coverage the implementation of this method requires additional hardware and programming knowledge therefore we have attempted to simplify their method by using a simplified design based on historical stream discharge data in contrast to predicting strata lengths in real time we propose the use of one stratification based on a mean hydrograph combined with post stratification which provides the ability to re stratify the samples into key components of each observed event hydrograph e g rising and falling limbs the novelty our work is that it builds on previous work on stratified random sampling of events but improves on this by illustrating the use of post event stratification of the events this allows users to estimate the mean and its precision for whole events or components of events which in most cases can be only identified retrospectively rainfall events and the corresponding response of water quality and stream discharge is of great interest to catchment managers as the exported particles and nutrients during these periods represent a large portion of the annual exports however catchment managers are often challenged by low budgets and multiple monitoring sites with the goal of monitoring the state of catchments through time and space therefore a sampling scheme which can utilise low cost sampling equipment to provide unbiased accurate estimates of water quality variables which are affected by different hydrological controls is required in this paper we evaluate a simplified time stratified sampling scheme to estimate different water quality properties affected by different transport pathways using turbidity and electrical conductivity ec we evaluated the use of event based time stratified sampling to provide estimates that relate to two distinctly different flow transport paths the two flow paths of interest are overland flow and baseflow using turbidity and ec to reflect these paths respectively turbidity has been used to improve estimates of total phosphorus tp biggs 1995 and total suspended solids tss biggs 1995 lane et al 2006 and heavily affected by rainfall intensity and duration miller et al 2015 whereas ec has been used for base flow separation pellerin et al 2008 and to estimate dissolved nitrogen and particulate nitrogen kim and furumai 2012 and has been found to significantly correlated to the mean transit time of the catchment mosquera and vaché 2016 by sampling continuously turbidity and ec data we examine the use of stratified sampling for event based water quality monitoring therefore it is the aim of this paper to 1 outline a simple stratified sampling for estimating event mean concentrations for different water quality properties and 2 outline the method used to restratify samples after each event based on the observed stream discharge to provide information on key hydrological components of events which is restricted by the capacity of commonly used automatic water samplers 2 methods 2 1 catchment description fig 1 presents the muttama creek catchment 1061 km2 which is located in the south west slopes of new south wales in south eastern australia agriculture is the main land use in the catchment with winter cropping and pastures being the dominant agricultural practices a main feature of the catchment are several north south fault lines on the eastern side of the main stream conyers et al 2008 these fault lines are associated with ultrabasic rocks with frequent outcrops of serpentine conyers et al 2008 in contrast the western side is dominated by slates and rhyolite conyers et al 2008 the geological variety in the catchment has lead to a variety of soil types of particular importance are sodosols in the north west of the catchment warren et al 1995 which are highly dispersive soils isbell 2002 these areas are also associated with saline areas conyers et al 2008 a recent study by orton et al 2016 found high soil clay content variability ranging from 8 to 83 several catchment characteristics are provided in table 1 rainfall within the catchment was 507 mm with an annual discharge of 578 98 gl rainfall was recorded at a single location in the north of the catchment 1 as this was the only gauge in the catchment with sub hourly data the main township of cootamundra is in the north of the catchment with a population of 7729 australian bureau of statistics 2010 2 2 event description a ysi sonde hydrolab corporation austin texas was used to collect turbidity data for each event rainfall stream discharge and electrical conductivity data was obtained from the government monitoring stations http waterinfo nsw gov au table 2 provides a summary of the conditions prior to and during each event each of the events were triggered by rainfall events with the total rainfall being larger prior to the event for the first and third events however more rainfall was recorded during the second event the second event was the largest event with a total of 142 mm rainfall falling prior to and during the event the rainfall intensity average observed rainfall 15 min 1 was higher prior to each of the events mean turbidity was lower in the 24 h period prior to each of the events while ec was higher before each of the events and lower during the events fig 2 shows the observed rainfall stream discharge turbidity and ec of the three events the first event fig 2a occurred in august 2011 and is representative of events for this catchment the observed double peak in the hydrograph is a common feature of event hydrographs at this site which is possibly due to the figure eight like shape of the catchment gordon et al 2004 p 67 the second event fig 2b occurred in march 2012 and was the largest event on record three peaks occurred during this event with two distinct rainfall events the third event fig 2c occurred in july 2012 and is similar but smaller than the first event however rain during the falling limb caused an additional smaller peak 2 3 defining strata and sample sizes to perform event based sampling it is necessary to define certain aspects of an event to use a probabilistic based sampling design the start and end of the event and the sample sizes length and number of strata are also required we propose a simple 4 step process to define a general time stratified sampling scheme 1 determine the event trigger height based on the upper 5 of the stream height distribution 2 find all events using the trigger height as the start and end of each event 3 determine the length of the event using the mean duration of these events and 4 create a mean event hydrograph using the trigger height and the mean event length use this to define strata and sample sizes event based sampling is generally commenced using a trigger consisting of a pre determined stream height reached during the rising limb it is therefore important that this height is not too low as to be triggered by small rises of stream height but not too large which would commence the sampling to late harmel et al 2002 our approach is to use the stream height which corresponds to the 95th percentile stream height the flow duration curve for muttama creek is based on the last 10 years of observations and is shown in fig 3 with the corresponding 95th percentile stream height 1 4 m to define the duration of the mean event all events are found by defining the start of the event as the time where the trigger height is exceeded and the end of the event as the time where the stream height recedes below the trigger height using these events the mean event length is defined as the mean of all events which are longer than 12 h fig 4 shows the event mean hydrograph based on the trigger height with the mean event strata boundaries the initial strata are defined based on the mean event hydrograph and are such that they provide good coverage of rapid changes of stream discharge strata 1 2 and 3 are designed to cover the rising limb initial peak and second peak of the hydrograph strata 4 and 5 are longer and designed to capture the tail of the event assuming a maximum sample size of 24 the sample size of each strata is defined as 6 6 4 4 and 4 larger sample sizes are given to the initial two strata as these strata are associated with sharp changes in stream discharge 2 4 strata and event analysis stratified sampling is a common sampling design a detailed description of its application is provided by de gruijter et al 2006 p 82 using this information the mean of an event is estimated using 1 z st 1 t h 1 h t h z h where h is the number of strata in the event t is the total time of the event th duration of time in strata h and z h is the mean of stratum h in this study t 107 h the mean event duration th 5 9 26 35 32 h the variance of each stratum mean is estimated by 2 v z h 1 n h n h 1 i 1 n h z hi z h 2 where n h is the sample size of stratum h therefore n h 2 is needed to estimate the variance of the mean using eq 2 the variance of the event mean can be estimated using 3 v z st 1 t 2 h 1 h t h 2 v z h which can be used to estimate the standard error of the event mean v z st confidence intervals are easily estimated for each strata by 4 z t 1 α 2 v z h where t 1 α 2 is the t critical value of the student distribution with degrees of freedom and α is the probability value which is set to 0 025 if we wish to estimate the 95 confidence interval around the mean similarly eq 4 can be used to estimate the confidence interval around the event mean concentration 2 5 post event stratification post event stratification is the term given to the reclassification of samples into new strata to simplify and reduce confusion new strata are referred to as domains in this paper this process is used to combine samples from multiple strata into domains the major benefit of this process is the ability to perform this task based on the observed stream hydrograph of each individual event the only limitation of this process is the requirement that at least 2 samples from each stratum fall within the domain to estimate the variance of the domain mean using event 2 as an example the samples from multiple strata are reclassified into domains based on the three peaks of the event fig 5 shows the hydrograph of the event with the three domains and locations of the samples in addition to mean estimates the rising and falling limbs are also examined in this chapter the rising limb is from the start of the event to the maximum value of the first peak and the falling limb is the remaining part of the event a detailed description of reclassification of stratified sampling into domains can be found in särndal et al 2003 p 390 based on this description the mean of a stratum within each domain can be estimated using 5 z dh i 1 n h i dhi z hi n dh where i dhi is an indicator vector where 1 indicates the sample is within the domain and 0 the sample is not within the domain z hi is the i th observation of domain h and n dh is the amount of samples in stratum h and domain d therefore the mean of the domain is estimated using 6 z d h 1 h t h n dh n h z dh h 1 h t h n dh n h the associated standard error of the domain mean can be estimated by 7 se z d 1 t d 2 h 1 h t h 2 n dh 1 s dh 2 n dh 1 n dh n h z dh z d 2 n d n d 1 where t d is the duration of time of the domain n d is the amount of samples with domain d and the variance is estimated using 8 s dh 2 i 1 n h i dhi z di z d 2 n dh 1 it is important to note that each domain requires n dh 2 to allow for an estimate of s dh 2 särndal et al 2003 3 results 3 1 time stratified sampling sampling locations fig 6 shows the location of each sample within each strata of the three observed events the shape of the hydrograph of the first event fig 6a closely resembles the mean event hydrograph fig 4 with the strata boundaries closely matching the desired components of the hydrograph the second event fig 6b is not similar to the mean event hydrograph due to additional rainfall during the event and only the first and second strata match the changing conditions of the first peak of the event in addition to this the pre determined time of the event did not meet the extended duration of the event the third event fig 6c is similar to both the first event and the mean event hydrograph with the strata matching the desired hydrograph components however a small peak occurred during the falling stage of the hydrograph the use of the mean event strata closely matched 2 of the 3 observed events such variation would be expected and shows the importance of post stratification if we wish to extract mean values from different components of the event hydrograph 3 2 stratified estimates the stratified mean estimates with confidence intervals of turbidity and ec of each event are shown in fig 7 in addition to the strata estimates the observed continuous data is also provided with the mean estimates of each strata also provided observed means for all strata estimates for both turbidity and ec of all three events are within the associated confidence intervals except for the third strata for turbidity for event 3 fig 7c confidence interval width related to the number of samples and variation within the strata therefore strata with the greatest variation require additional sampling effort to increase the precision of the mean estimates the confidence intervals of event 1 fig 7a indicate that the underlying trend of turbidity varies most during the first and third strata this variation is shown by the continuously sampled turbidity data similarly the first strata of ec in this event was also the largest confidence interval ci of this event event 2 fig 7b was the largest event on record for the site in terms of maximum stream height and it had three distinct peaks within the event hydrograph the first and last strata have large ci widths indicating a large amount of variation during these times which is confirmed by the continuously monitored data a similar trend can also be seen in event 3 fig 7c where the ci width of the first strata is quite wide compared with other strata ci widths of this event the third strata ci estimate does not cover the observed mean turbidity with the observed mean falling outside the ci by 9 96 ntu by examining fig 6c it can be seen that 3 out of the 4 samples were collected towards the end of this strata after the peak of observed turbidity fig 7c observed mean ec of each strata do fall within the ci of the estimates for this event with relatively large ci widths for the first and third strata these results indicate that this simple application of stratified sampling provides accurate estimates of key hydrological components of event hydrographs and can provide information about transport pathways during events 3 3 event estimates by combining the strata mean estimates it is possible to obtain event mean estimates table 3 provides event mean estimates and observed means for each event using the time stratified event estimates it is possible to observe the relationship between the size of the event and the observed means for each event this trend indicates that the event means of turbidity and ec are directly related to the size of each event with the largest event event 2 having the largest mean turbidity during the event and the smallest event event 3 having the smallest estimated mean turbidity of the three events this trend can be explained by the higher amount of surface derived suspended sediments in the stream during the events this trend is inversely true for ec where the rainfall dilutes the ec of the stream water resulting in a lower conductivity during the event as prior to the event where the stream water is dominated by sub surface flows observed turbidity 224 73 was overestimated by 62 42 for event 2 but within the ci of the estimate in this situation the large estimated uncertainty provides additional information indicating the large variation during this event in contrast to this the estimated mean turbidity of event 3 was very accurate and had ci of 18 22 ntu this accuracy was achieved with a sample size of 24 for the 107 h period comprising 428 possible sample times reinforcing the ability of design based methods to provide accurate estimates of event means 3 4 re stratified domain estimates by re stratifying the strata into domains it is possible to provide unbiased estimates of key components of the event hydrograph table 4 provides the estimates of the key components of each event hydrograph for each event estimates were made of the rising limb falling limb and peak of the event the boundaries of each peak in an event is based on the start minima between each peak and the end of the event for example the boundaries of each peak for the second event are shown in fig 5 three peaks were observed for the second event but there was no easily definable rising and falling limb therefore the rising and falling limbs were not estimated for this event the observed ec mean for each domain is within the ci of the estimates for the rising limb falling limb and all peak estimates for the three events the observed means of turbidity were within the estimated ci of the rising limb falling limb and peak 1 domains for all events the estimation of the peak 2 of event 1 was over estimated and the observed mean fell outside the ci this is most likely due to only 2 samples being available to estimate the domain mean during event 2 a smaller peak at the start of the event triggered the event sampling scheme whilst a second rainfall event occurred towards the end of the event causing a third peak of stream discharge as this was the final peak was towards the end of the event only 4 samples fell within this range of this domain as a result of this large variation of turbidity during this period the ci of the estimate is large and reflects the large variation between the four samples peak 2 event 3 was also poorly estimated with the observed mean falling outside the estimated ci 4 discussion the majority of event based sampling schemes are non probabilistic wang et al 2011 the results of these sampling schemes are inherently biased and may be affected by large intervals between samples thomas and lewis 1995 the importance of high frequency samples to accurately characterise variation in water quality is well known kirchner et al 2004 burt et al 2011 cassidy and jordan 2011 however the majority of event based sampling schemes rely on automatic samplers with a maximum sample size of 24 to sample events the presented time stratified sampling scheme offers the ability to provide accurate unbiased estimates under this restriction with the ability to reclassify strata after each event to estimate mean values for key hydrograph components by using the stream discharge data it was possible to identify key components of the event hydrograph and design a simple time stratified sampling scheme for the three observed events these strata were quite close to events 1 and 3 the defined strata did not match the shape of the second event by using domain based estimates it was possible to provide accurate mean estimates of both turbidity and ec for the three peaks of this event with the observed mean within the ci of each domain in some situations historical stream discharge data is not available under these limitations it is still possible to use the outlined method but instead of using stream discharge to define the initial strata rainfall or expert knowledge could be used with the flexibility of the proposed sampling scheme it would be possible to derive accurate estimates using post event stratification the proposed sampling scheme is framed around the limitation of an automatic water sampler with a total capacity of 24 samples being trigger by a rise in stream height at the start of the event this restriction on the proposed sampling scheme was emplaced as most catchment managers have limited resources but often have access to an automatic sampler with a capacity of 24 samples however this restriction can lead to too few samples being collected at periods of high variation as seen during the second half of the second event in these situations post event restratification can be utilised to provide more accurate estimates of water quality properties during these periods water quality sampling schemes are often designed to sample multiple water quality properties are affected by different hydrological flow paths and different biological physical and chemical processes under this situation it is often difficult to design a sampling scheme which is capable of providing accurate estimates of all variables in this study we focussed on turbidity and ec because they are affected differently by rainfall intensity and duration and transit times the results show that the sampling scheme is capable of providing accurate event mean estimates of both turbidity and ec the results also highlight the complexity of designing a sampling scheme which under the limitations of automatic samplers can provide accurate estimates during highly variable periods the results of the stratified sampling shows the mean turbidity of the first strata rising limb is greater than the second strata of each event in addition to this the domain estimates also help identify these controlling processes for example during the second event fig 2b the second peak of turbidity coincided with an additional rainfall event the controlling processes of ec are also evident for example the results of the domain estimates of each of these individual peaks table 4 improves the understanding of groundwater sources of each individual peak for events 1 and 3 the second peak had a higher ec mean than the first peak of these events however the second event had a smaller ec mean for the second peak due to the additional rainfall event based sampling is often used to estimate event mean concentration or event loads for water quality modelling wang et al 2011 bartley et al 2012 ratio based methods are commonly used to estimate true loads however these require probabilistic sample designs wang et al 2011 these results show how a simple time stratified sample design can provide unbiased accurate mean estimates which can be used in conjunction with ratio based methods or used to directly estimate event loads thomas and lewis 1995 many water quality models now require estimates of event mean concentration feikema et al 2011 bartley et al 2012 time stratified sampling offers the ability to provide unbiased accurate event mean concentrations for these models 5 conclusion we have presented the use of a simple time stratified sampling scheme which can be implemented in the bounds of current hardware limitations the method provided accurate mean event estimates of two water quality properties affected by different flow paths through this we have shown 1 probabilistic sampling schemes do not require great complexity to provide accurate event mean estimates 2 it is possible to use probabilistic sampling schemes to provide accurate event means of two separate water quality variables affected by two different flow paths without any additional hardware or software 3 estimates of key hydrograph components can be made using re stratification after each event the presented research focussed on turbidity and ec in an australian catchment and future research should examine the reliability of the sampling scheme in different catchments and for other water quality properties additionally improvements to the sample design are possible by optimising the number of samples per strata in order to get more precise estimates of the event mean for example more variable strata would receive more samples unbiased meaningful sampling schemes are required as it is highly unlikely that continuous monitoring devices will be widely deployed event based water quality sampling schemes require additional attention to provide unbiased accurate estimates of event exports and should not be limited to systematic sampling schemes acknowledgments the authors would like to

6002,in this study a non darcian flow model was developed for a constant rate test of a partially penetrating well with a non uniform flux boundary in a leaky confined aquifer the izbash equation was applied to describe non darcian flow in the radial direction both analytical and numerical methods were employed to solve this model it was found that the analytical solution with linearization was adequate only when non darcian effects were relatively small with the finite difference method the radial and vertical fluxes along the well screen were analyzed under four different cases involving leaky and non darcian effects the leaky and non darcian effects on the drawdowns with non uniform flux nuf boundary were compared with those with uniform flux uf boundary the results indicate that both leaky and non darcian effects can reduce the fluxes along the well screen while non darcian effects can diminish the leakage induced differences of flux and drawdown between the two well screen ends non darcian effects can reduce the differences between uf and nuf drawdowns at any elevation with the greatest reduction difference at the elevation of the top end of the screen the uf solution can replace the nuf solution when the distance is far from the well as this distance is smallest at the elevation of the screen midpoint and can be distinctly reduced by non darcian effects in general the results are most sensitive to the power index n moderately sensitive to the other aquifer parameters and least sensitive to the parameters of the aquitard keywords non darcian flow partially penetrating well leaky confined aquifer izbash equation non uniform flux boundary 1 introduction partially penetrating well denoted as ppw in the following types are popularly applied when the aquifer is relatively thick commonly the study of flow to ppw involves much of the boundary at the well screen including the uniform flux denoted as uf in the following boundary and non uniform flux denoted as nuf in the following boundary uf was assumed to first appear in the classical papers by dupuit 1863 and thiem 1887 though nahrgang 1954 and petersen et al 1955 first shown that uf was unlikely to occur in actual wells the conventional approach to describing groundwater to ppw employed uf boundary for the solution of continuity equation hantush 1964 dougherty and babu 1984 moench 1985 at the uf boundary the discharge is assumed to be uniform over the well screen with a non uniform head distribution along the screen regarding the nuf boundary the drawdown along the well screen is assumed to be constant which prescribes a dirichlet boundary while neumann conditions with no flux are stipulated over the remaining unscreened part cassiani and kabala 1998 chang and chen 2003 mathias and wen 2015 feng and zhan 2016 among those studies involving a nuf boundary condition cassiani and kabala 1998 used dual integral equations to obtain a semianalytical solution with the aquifer recognized as semi infinite in addition chang and chen 2002 2003 proposed an analytical approach via integral transform techniques to describe the flow considering nuf boundary it is worth pointing out that the nuf boundary derived from the early experimental and mathematical findings of non uniform distribution along the well screen petersen et al 1955 garg and lal 1971 cooley and cunningham 1979 in the past few decades the nuf boundary involved in ppw has been studied not only by analytical perina and lee 2006 barua and bora 2010 feng and zhan 2016 but also by numerical methods ruud and kabala 1997 mathias and wen 2015 however all of the abovementioned studies on ppws assume that darcian flow takes place which might cause severe discrepancies when estimating aquifer parameters for cases in which the flow is non darcian basak 1977 sen 1987 1988 after all flow can be non darcian near the pumping due to sufficiently high or low velocity sen 1989 1990 mathias et al 2008 feng and wen 2016 wang et al 2014 2017 as darcy s law cannot be used to describe non darcian behavior several relations have been proposed in the literature e g forchheimer 1901 izbash 1931 rose 1951 escande 1953 slepicka 1961 among which the most two widely used are the forchheimer equation forchheimer 1901 and the izbash equation izbash 1931 although the latter one is named after the hydrogeologist izbash it was actually first proposed by forchheimer 1901 it seems that zekai sen was an early investigator of non darcian transient flow to a pumping well using analytical methods he used the boltzmann transform to solve different non darcian flow models in different forms of aquifer systems sen 1987 1989 1990 however using the boltzmann transform to solve the non darcian flow to a pumping well is not a mathematically rigorous approach camacho and vasquez 1992 mathias et al 2008 wen et al 2008a as noted by wen et al 2008a the boltzmann transform might cause severe errors if the wellbore storage was considered in the non darcian flow models therefore wen et al 2008a 2008b 2008c proposed a linearization procedure when the non darcian flow can be described by the izbash equation which has been proven to be very effective in describing nonlinear flow yamada et al 2005 qian et al 2007 moutsopoulos et al 2009 by using this linearization approach analytical solutions can be developed which nevertheless may underestimate the drawdown at early times wen et al 2009 several studies have incorporated ppws with the non darcian flow during the last few years wen et al 2013 developed a non darcian flow model for a ppw and approximate analytical solutions were obtained using a linearization procedure associated with the laplace transform and the finite fourier cosine transform this work was extended by wen et al 2014 to investigate the non darcian flow to a ppw considering wellbore storage feng and wen 2016 described radial non darcian flow and vertical darcian flow for a ppw with a finite thickness skin in a confined aquifer however as far as we know all the above studies combining ppws with non darcian effects adopted uf boundary conditions at the well face except mathias and wen 2015 very few studies integrated a ppw nuf boundary and non darcian factor as a specific focus of the research nevertheless mathias and wen 2015 developed a numerical model but included very little knowledge from the analytical methods which had been successfully employed in the case of a ppw with darcian flow to a nuf boundary by chang and chen 2002 2003 and perina and lee 2006 mathias and wen 2015 included only a simple confined aquifer without a leaky effect that is common in nature furthermore mathias and wen 2015 focused mainly on the combined role of ppws and non darcian effects concerning well production performance but investigated little on the comparison between the nuf solution and its uf counterpart this comparison has provided insight into the characteristics of the nuf boundary in some other studies ruud and kabala 1997 perina and lee 2006 feng and zhan 2016 thus in this study we aim to develop both analytical and numerical solutions to the model incorporating a ppw a nuf boundary non darcian and leaky effects together we employed the izbash equation rather than the forchheimer equation used in mathias and wen 2015 for the non darcian flow description because on one hand yamada et al 2005 reported that the izbash equation could describe the relationship between hydraulic gradient and specific discharge more accurately than the forchheimer equation on the other hand the power law function is more feasible for the linearization than the forchheimer equation which includes not only a linear item but also a quadratic item one of our aims is to verify the performance of each solution with respect to this comprehensive model the other aim is to study the combined leaky and non darcian influences on the flow to ppw considering nuf boundary and to compare the results of the nuf solution with those of the uf solution under those effects 2 mathematical model of the problem 2 1 problem statement the conceptual model of the groundwater flow to a ppw in a leaky confined aquifer is shown in fig 1 because the effects of location and length of well screen are not the research aims we simplified the conceptual model by setting the well screen with constant length in the middle of the aquifer we assumed that the radial flow is non darcian and can be described by the izbash equation while the vertical flow is darcian similar to wen et al 2013 the assumptions used in this study were as follows 1 the aquifer is homogeneous radially isotropic and infinite in the radial direction with a finite constant thickness 2 the pumping rate is constant and equal to q 3 the system is hydrostatic before the pumping starts 4 the inner boundary is a nuf boundary which will be denoted in the following based on these assumptions the mathematical model can be established as follows 1 r q r r z t r r q z r z t z s m s r z t t 2 s r z 0 0 3 s z t 0 4 s r 0 t z 0 for the inner boundary in the radial direction considering a mixed type boundary it can be

eq 36 can be inverted numerically with the stehfest method stehfest 1970a 1970b 2 4 numerical solution we used the finite difference method denoted as fdm in the following to solve this model first we employed a relatively large radius red to approximate an infinite boundary at which the drawdown is equal to zero after discretization the domain rwd red comprised n 1 subdomains i e n 2 nodes similar to previous studies mathias et al 2008 wen et al 2009 the radial spatial domain was discretized logarithmically 37 r d i r d i 1 2 r d i 1 2 2 i 1 2 n with 38 log 10 r d i 1 2 log 10 r wd i log 10 r ed log 10 r wd n i 0 1 2 n because the vertical flow to the pumping well cannot be ignored for a ppw the vertical spatial domain should also be discretized chang and chen 2003 recommended finer grids near the well screen ends and coarser grids in the middle portion in addition due to the necessary description of the flux continuity at the aquifer aquitard interface as eq 27 indicates the aquifer aquitard interface has been discretized using finer grids therefore the vertical spatial domain including the aquifer interface and aquitard was split into six subdomains i e 0 z 0 d z 0 d z 0 d z 1 d 2 z 0 d z 1 d 2 z 1 d z 1 d z 1 d 1 2 z 1 d 1 2 1 and 1 1 μ from bottom to top respectively each subdomain was discretized logarithmically into 10 segments which has been found to be sufficient for this model chang and chen 2003 the details of vertical discretization are described in appendix a the governing equation eq 16 can be reduced to a series of discrete equations with respect to dimensionless time td as follows 39 d s d i j d t d r d i 1 2 q rd i 1 2 j r d i 1 2 q rd i 1 2 j r d i r d i 1 2 r d i 1 2 q zd i j 1 q zd i j z d j 1 z d j i 1 2 n j 1 2 50 with i 1 2 and j indicating the node numbers in the radial and vertical directions respectively the expression for zd j can be found in appendix a similar to the boundary condition eq 24 can be reduced to the following equation with respect to dimensionless time td 40 d s wd d t d 4 s r wd 2 1 r wd 2 j 11 j 30 q rd j 1 z d j z d j 1 where qrd j 1 is the radial flux at each segment of the well screen since j from 11 to 30 represents the occupation of the well screen in the vertical direction because the radial flow is opposite to the coordinate axis in the radial direction qrd is negative and can be rewritten from eq 22 as follows 41 q rd k d k r 1 n n s d r d 1 n thus at a specific vertical location if j is constant the dimensionless radial flux that goes into and out of each cell can be written as 42 q rd i 1 2 k d k r 1 n n s d i s d i 1 r d i 1 r d i 1 n i 1 2 n 1 43 q rd i 1 2 k d k r 1 n n s d i 1 s d i r d i r d i 1 1 n i 2 3 n respectively at the inner and outer boundaries in the r

dimensionless radial flux qrd eq 27 brings about the drawdown at the aquifer aquitard interface as 46 s d i 51 s d i 5 0 p s d i 5 2 1 p i 1 2 n with p α z d 51 z d 50 α z d 52 z d 51 eq 46 indicates that the drawdown at the interface depends on the two closely adjacent drawdowns on both sides additionally the drawdown in the aquitard can be expressed as 47 d s d i j d t d μ λ q zd i j q zd i j 1 z d j z d j 1 i 1 2 n j 52 53 61 the dimensionless vertical flux that goes into and out of each cell in the whole system is expressed like the radial flux shown in eqs 42 45 it should be pointed out that we assume that the non darcian flow occurs in the radial direction in the aquifer for the above derivation for example a simple case of darcian flow is easy to deal with by letting the power index n be equal to 1 in eqs 22 and 25 with the aforementioned preparations the problem stated here can be solved with matlab software using the stiff integrator ode15s mathias et al 2008 wen et al 2011 we developed a matlab program to perform such calculations the number of nodes in the radial direction n was chosen to be 1000 rwd and red were set to 0 01 and 5000 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 accuracy verification of the solutions if the radial flow is assumed to be darcian instead of non darcian the power index n in eq 36 equals to 1 and the linearization procedure has no effects then eq 36 becomes 48 s d r d z d p m 1 k 0 r d ε cos w m z d δ m ε k 1 r wd ε j 1 m q wd j sin w m ξ j sin w m ξ j w m eq 48 is a special solution with respect to ppws nuf boundary and leaky effects which have also been involved in the analytical solution of feng and zhan 2016 if making the skin thickness equal to zero or the skin permeability equal to the formation permeability as in feng and zhan 2016 one can obtain the same solution to eq 48 figure 2 shows the dimensionless wellbore drawdowns with respect to dimensionless time from three kinds of special solutions including the analytical solution of feng and zhan 2016 without skin effects the analytical and numerical solutions in this study with a power index n of 1 as shown in fig 2 the three solution curves agree perfectly with each other indicating that both the analytical and numerical solutions in our study have good performance if non darcian flow is not considered to check the performance of the linearization method in our analytical solution we compared our analytical and numerical solutions in fig 3 it is obvious that except when n equals to 1 i e the non darcian effect does not exist there are practically no discrepancies between the analytical and the numerical solutions additionally as the non darcian effects become larger a greater discrepancy and an earlier deviation between these two kinds of solution curves occur this was expected because we employed a linearization method to solve the nonlinear problem by assuming that the radial component of the velocity can be approximated by eq 33 however for the nuf boundary problem the flux along the well screen is non uniform von hofe and helweg 1998 cassiani et al 1999 korom et al 2003 houben 2006 perina and lee 2006 houben and hauschild 2011 which means that the calculated dimensionless well screen flux q wd j in eq 36 will deviate from its correct value if the linearization procedure is implemented resulting in an error in the drawdowns meanwhile a larger n amplifies the deviation from the actual value in addition if replacing the nuf boundary with the uf boundary the linearization method works very well as was demonstrated in the study of wen et al 2016 this is because the linearization approximation coincides with the flux properties in the uf boundary in addition as fig 3 reveals if the value of the power index n lies between 1 and 1 1 i e there is actually turbulent flow but the turbulence is relatively small the curves of our analytical solution can still match moderately well with those of our numerical solution which means that our analytical solution is adequate when the non darcian effect exists but is small however if the non darcian effect is moderate or large our analytical solution cannot be used therefore for the latter case we used the numerical solution to analyze the flow processes 3 2 leaky and non darcian effects on quasi steady state fluxes along the well face the most typical outcome of the nuf boundary is the non uniform flux along the well face it is widely accepted that the largest flux exists at screen ends and the smallest flux exists at the screen midpoint von hofe and helweg 1998 cassiani et al 1999 korom et al 2003 houben 2006 perina and lee 2006 houben and hauschild 2011 in addition some studies of actual partially penetrating well also indicate that the peak of flux appears at the ends of screen such as garg and lal 1971 with experimental results and korom et al 2003 with physical models as fig 4 shows our numerical solution also yields this kind of flux at a quasi steady state moreover the previous studies on nuf boundary fluxes are extended by discussing the effects of leakage and non darcian flow in this section in fig 4 four different cases are presented in two subfigures in case 1 the power index n is set to 1 i e the radial flow is darcian meanwhile the leaky effect does not exist and only a confined aquifer is considered in case 2 instead of darcian flow as in case 1 non darcian flow has been considered in case 3 leakage from an aquitard above the main aquifer has been considered while as in case 1 flow is assumed to be darcian in case 4 both non darcian and leakage effects have been taken into account the details of each case are outlined in table 3 the parameter values for these four cases are listed in table 1 subfigure a indicates the dimensionless radial flux qrd along the well screen that is expressed by the dimensionless elevation zd similarly subfigure b indicates that a positive value of qzd the dimensionless vertical flux indicates the flow direction is from top to bottom and a negative value indicates flow direction from bottom to top in the same way the four cases are also set in fig 5 in which the dimensionless quasi steady state drawdowns versus dimensionless distance at both screen ends are represented to support the explanation of fig 4 as the two subfigures in fig 4 reveal the comparisons between case 1 and case 2 indicate without a leaky effect the non darcian effect can reduce both radial and vertical fluxes at a quasi steady state time while the fluxes at both well screen ends decrease by the same degree this is because compared with the darcian case the non darcian case implies that the radial flow approaches turbulent flow and that the water from aquifer storage near the well is used faster this implies that the drawdown drops to zero very quickly at any given distance in addition the comparison between case 1 and case 2 in fig 5 also illustrates that the drawdowns at both screen ends decrease while the cone of depression around the well shrinks furthermore the same degree of reduction in drawdowns at the screen ends in fig 5 indicates the similar degree of reduction of fluxes in fig 4 analyzing the comparison between case 1 and case 3 we found that without a non darcian effect the leakage from the aquitard can reduce both radial and vertical fluxes at the screen ends this is because the aquitard aquifer interface flow can partially take the place of the main aquifer for water supply leading to a smaller drawdown at any given distance as revealed by the comparison between case 1 and case 3 in fig 5 case 3 in the two subfigures of fig 4 clearly shows that when a leaky effect exists both the radial and vertical fluxes at the top end are smaller than those at the bottom end of the well screen this is due to the closer distance between the top end of the well screen and the aquifer aquitard interface making the top end collect more water than the bottom end therefore the drawdown versus distance at the top end is smaller than that at the bottom end i e a steeper hydraulic gradient exists at the elevation of the bottom end which is indicated by case 3 in fig 5 explaining why the fluxes at the bottom end are larger than those at the top end in fig 4 in addition as case 3 in fig 5 shows the curves of hbotttom and htop share a joint front end at a distance that equals to the well radius rd 0 01 this is due to the characteristics of the nuf boundary that assumes the head along the well screen is uniform on the other hand the curves of hbotttom and htop overlap each other with zero drawdown at a far enough distance for example at rd larger than 10 this is because the flow field far away from well is not influenced by pumping and no drawdown occurs at any given elevation making the drawdowns at both screen ends equal to zero based on the above analysis the results of case 4 in fig 4 can be well interpreted by the comparison to the results of cases 2 and 3 on the basis of the results in case 2 it is the leaky effect that reduces both radial and vertical fluxes at screen ends and makes the fluxes at the bottom larger than those at top on the basis of the results in case 3 it is the non darcian effect that synchronously reduces both radial and vertical fluxes at screen ends interestingly the non darcian effect can shorten the leakage induced differences of fluxes and drawdowns between two screen ends as shown in fig 4 and fig 5 respectively this is because non darcian flow effects can increase the mixture of water particles causing the head or flux differences to approach zero to investigate the degree of influence of aquifer and aquitard parameters on the fluxes we chose the wellbore drawdown for convenience purposes to perform a sensitivity analysis with respect to kr kz k z s s and n the normalized sensitivity method kabala 2001 huang and yeh 2007 was adopted for calculation and the results are shown in fig 6 as revealed in this figure one can easily see that the wellbore drawdown is most sensitive to the power index n while it is moderately sensitive to some other aquifer parameters i e s kr and kz however the wellbore drawdown seems to not be sensitive to all aquitard parameters therefore it can be judged that if adjusting the aquitard parameters to produce various degrees of leaky effects in case 3 one can obtain much less change in the results compared with adjusting the power index n in case 2 3 3 comparisons between uf and nuf boundaries with respect to leaky and non darcian effects several studies have compared the drawdowns due to uf and nuf boundary conditions ruud and kabala 1997 perina and lee 2006 feng and zhan 2016 tügel et al 2016 this study extends previous research by adding the effects of leaky and non darcian effects into the comparison the solution incorporating the uf boundary aquitard aquifer interface flow and radial non darcian flow is from wen et al 2016 a significant reference additionally the wellbore storage which is not considered in wen et al 2016 is not taken into account in our study either figure 7 reveals a series of curves indicating the dimensionless drawdown versus dimensionless distance at a quasi steady state time these curves can be classified generally in three ways i e boundary types uf or nuf vertical location zd 0 25 0 5 0 75 and flow patterns darcian or non darcian several results and conclusions are discussed in the following sections based on fig 7 for convenience the drawdowns in the cases of uf and nuf boundaries are denoted as uf drawdown and nuf drawdown respectively in general under the same conditions i e the flow pattern vertical location and aquitard conditions are the same the uf drawdowns were larger than the nuf drawdown at the screen midpoint zd 0 5 while the uf drawdowns are smaller than the nuf drawdowns at the two screen ends zd 0 25 and zd 0 75 this coincides with the results of perina and lee 2006 and feng and zhan 2016 who did not consider non darcian effects in addition the nuf drawdowns at the two screen ends rd 0 01 are equal but the uf drawdowns at the top end are smaller than those at the bottom end this is because the nuf boundary prescribes head along the well screen to be uniform however the uf boundary sets flux to be uniform making the uf drawdowns along the screen non uniform meanwhile recharge from the aquitard makes the top end which is closer to the aquitard than the bottom end receive leakage more easily therefore the uf drawdowns at the top end are smaller than those at the bottom end which can also explain the nuf drawdowns differences between the top and bottom when the distance is far away from the well screen furthermore one can see that if the distance is far enough from well the uf drawdowns equal the nuf drawdowns indicating that the uf boundary can replace the nuf boundary when the distance is greater than or equal to one in addition it is worth pointing out that the convergence between uf and nuf drawdowns occurs most early at the elevation of zd 0 5 moreover non darcian effects can distinctly diminish the differences between the uf drawdowns and nuf drawdowns for example in fig 7 the black curve uf zd 0 75 darcian has a considerable deviation from the green curve nuf zd 0 75 darcian but the deviation between the red curve uf zd 0 75 non darcian and the blue curve nuf zd 0 75 non darcian is much smaller than that without non darcian effects this phenomenon occurs at the elevations of zd 0 25 and zd 0 5 in addition with a careful examination of those figures one can see that the greatest reduction of differences between uf and nuf drawdowns occurs at the elevation of the top end in addition the non darcian effects accelerate the convergence between uf and nuf drawdowns as fig 7 shows this is because nonlinear non darcian flow effects can accelerate the mixture or internal operation of the flow regime that is to say non darcian effects can reform different flow situations in the same way and the head or flux differences along the well screen are ready to be diminished regardless of whether the boundary is uf or nuf 4 conclusions in this study we investigated non darcian flow to a ppw by considering a nuf boundary in a leaky confined aquifer the izbash equation was applied to describe the non darcian flow in the radial direction both analytical methods and fdm were used to solve the composite model the radial and vertical fluxes along the well screen for four different cases have been analyzed the drawdowns versus distance under the four cases have also been revealed the leaky and non darcian effects on both uf and nuf drawdowns have been discussed several conclusions can be drawn from this study 1 the analytical solution with linearization is adequate when non darcian effects are relatively small in this study s nuf boundary 2 both leaky and non darcian effects can reduce drawdowns radial and vertical fluxes at two well screen ends the drawdowns and fluxes at the top end are smaller than those at the bottom end due to leakage and non darcian effects can diminish the drawdown differences between these two well ends 3 non darcian effects can diminish the differences between uf and nuf drawdowns at any elevation and the greatest reduction of differences occurs at the elevation of the top end of the screen 4 the nuf boundary can be replaced by the uf boundary at a distance greater than or equal to one from the well this distance is smallest at the elevation of the screen midpoint and can be distinctly reduced by non darcian effects 5 the results are most sensitive to the power index n while they are moderately sensitive to the other parameters of the aquifer and least sensitive to the parameters of the aquitard acknowledgments this research was partially supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant

2003 perina and lee 2006 feng and zhan 2016 the well screen length should be discretized uniformly into m segments with each length as δ ξ j additionally the radial flux over the segment j denoted as

6002,in this study a non darcian flow model was developed for a constant rate test of a partially penetrating well with a non uniform flux boundary in a leaky confined aquifer the izbash equation was applied to describe non darcian flow in the radial direction both analytical and numerical methods were employed to solve this model it was found that the analytical solution with linearization was adequate only when non darcian effects were relatively small with the finite difference method the radial and vertical fluxes along the well screen were analyzed under four different cases involving leaky and non darcian effects the leaky and non darcian effects on the drawdowns with non uniform flux nuf boundary were compared with those with uniform flux uf boundary the results indicate that both leaky and non darcian effects can reduce the fluxes along the well screen while non darcian effects can diminish the leakage induced differences of flux and drawdown between the two well screen ends non darcian effects can reduce the differences between uf and nuf drawdowns at any elevation with the greatest reduction difference at the elevation of the top end of the screen the uf solution can replace the nuf solution when the distance is far from the well as this distance is smallest at the elevation of the screen midpoint and can be distinctly reduced by non darcian effects in general the results are most sensitive to the power index n moderately sensitive to the other aquifer parameters and least sensitive to the parameters of the aquitard keywords non darcian flow partially penetrating well leaky confined aquifer izbash equation non uniform flux boundary 1 introduction partially penetrating well denoted as ppw in the following types are popularly applied when the aquifer is relatively thick commonly the study of flow to ppw involves much of the boundary at the well screen including the uniform flux denoted as uf in the following boundary and non uniform flux denoted as nuf in the following boundary uf was assumed to first appear in the classical papers by dupuit 1863 and thiem 1887 though nahrgang 1954 and petersen et al 1955 first shown that uf was unlikely to occur in actual wells the conventional approach to describing groundwater to ppw employed uf boundary for the solution of continuity equation hantush 1964 dougherty and babu 1984 moench 1985 at the uf boundary the discharge is assumed to be uniform over the well screen with a non uniform head distribution along the screen regarding the nuf boundary the drawdown along the well screen is assumed to be constant which prescribes a dirichlet boundary while neumann conditions with no flux are stipulated over the remaining unscreened part cassiani and kabala 1998 chang and chen 2003 mathias and wen 2015 feng and zhan 2016 among those studies involving a nuf boundary condition cassiani and kabala 1998 used dual integral equations to obtain a semianalytical solution with the aquifer recognized as semi infinite in addition chang and chen 2002 2003 proposed an analytical approach via integral transform techniques to describe the flow considering nuf boundary it is worth pointing out that the nuf boundary derived from the early experimental and mathematical findings of non uniform distribution along the well screen petersen et al 1955 garg and lal 1971 cooley and cunningham 1979 in the past few decades the nuf boundary involved in ppw has been studied not only by analytical perina and lee 2006 barua and bora 2010 feng and zhan 2016 but also by numerical methods ruud and kabala 1997 mathias and wen 2015 however all of the abovementioned studies on ppws assume that darcian flow takes place which might cause severe discrepancies when estimating aquifer parameters for cases in which the flow is non darcian basak 1977 sen 1987 1988 after all flow can be non darcian near the pumping due to sufficiently high or low velocity sen 1989 1990 mathias et al 2008 feng and wen 2016 wang et al 2014 2017 as darcy s law cannot be used to describe non darcian behavior several relations have been proposed in the literature e g forchheimer 1901 izbash 1931 rose 1951 escande 1953 slepicka 1961 among which the most two widely used are the forchheimer equation forchheimer 1901 and the izbash equation izbash 1931 although the latter one is named after the hydrogeologist izbash it was actually first proposed by forchheimer 1901 it seems that zekai sen was an early investigator of non darcian transient flow to a pumping well using analytical methods he used the boltzmann transform to solve different non darcian flow models in different forms of aquifer systems sen 1987 1989 1990 however using the boltzmann transform to solve the non darcian flow to a pumping well is not a mathematically rigorous approach camacho and vasquez 1992 mathias et al 2008 wen et al 2008a as noted by wen et al 2008a the boltzmann transform might cause severe errors if the wellbore storage was considered in the non darcian flow models therefore wen et al 2008a 2008b 2008c proposed a linearization procedure when the non darcian flow can be described by the izbash equation which has been proven to be very effective in describing nonlinear flow yamada et al 2005 qian et al 2007 moutsopoulos et al 2009 by using this linearization approach analytical solutions can be developed which nevertheless may underestimate the drawdown at early times wen et al 2009 several studies have incorporated ppws with the non darcian flow during the last few years wen et al 2013 developed a non darcian flow model for a ppw and approximate analytical solutions were obtained using a linearization procedure associated with the laplace transform and the finite fourier cosine transform this work was extended by wen et al 2014 to investigate the non darcian flow to a ppw considering wellbore storage feng and wen 2016 described radial non darcian flow and vertical darcian flow for a ppw with a finite thickness skin in a confined aquifer however as far as we know all the above studies combining ppws with non darcian effects adopted uf boundary conditions at the well face except mathias and wen 2015 very few studies integrated a ppw nuf boundary and non darcian factor as a specific focus of the research nevertheless mathias and wen 2015 developed a numerical model but included very little knowledge from the analytical methods which had been successfully employed in the case of a ppw with darcian flow to a nuf boundary by chang and chen 2002 2003 and perina and lee 2006 mathias and wen 2015 included only a simple confined aquifer without a leaky effect that is common in nature furthermore mathias and wen 2015 focused mainly on the combined role of ppws and non darcian effects concerning well production performance but investigated little on the comparison between the nuf solution and its uf counterpart this comparison has provided insight into the characteristics of the nuf boundary in some other studies ruud and kabala 1997 perina and lee 2006 feng and zhan 2016 thus in this study we aim to develop both analytical and numerical solutions to the model incorporating a ppw a nuf boundary non darcian and leaky effects together we employed the izbash equation rather than the forchheimer equation used in mathias and wen 2015 for the non darcian flow description because on one hand yamada et al 2005 reported that the izbash equation could describe the relationship between hydraulic gradient and specific discharge more accurately than the forchheimer equation on the other hand the power law function is more feasible for the linearization than the forchheimer equation which includes not only a linear item but also a quadratic item one of our aims is to verify the performance of each solution with respect to this comprehensive model the other aim is to study the combined leaky and non darcian influences on the flow to ppw considering nuf boundary and to compare the results of the nuf solution with those of the uf solution under those effects 2 mathematical model of the problem 2 1 problem statement the conceptual model of the groundwater flow to a ppw in a leaky confined aquifer is shown in fig 1 because the effects of location and length of well screen are not the research aims we simplified the conceptual model by setting the well screen with constant length in the middle of the aquifer we assumed that the radial flow is non darcian and can be described by the izbash equation while the vertical flow is darcian similar to wen et al 2013 the assumptions used in this study were as follows 1 the aquifer is homogeneous radially isotropic and infinite in the radial direction with a finite constant thickness 2 the pumping rate is constant and equal to q 3 the system is hydrostatic before the pumping starts 4 the inner boundary is a nuf boundary which will be denoted in the following based on these assumptions the mathematical model can be established as follows 1 r q r r z t r r q z r z t z s m s r z t t 2 s r z 0 0 3 s z t 0 4 s r 0 t z 0 for the inner boundary in the radial direction considering a mixed type boundary it can be

length from the bottom of the aquifer to the top of the well screen l m is the thickness of the aquifer l it should be noted that eq 6 is time dependent meaning that sw t which is unknown is the drawdown inside the well and depends on the pumping rate q l3t 1 the izbash equation was employed to describe the non darcian flow in this study which can be expressed as 7 q r q r n 1 k r s r z t r for the radial flux where n is a power index and kr which is an empirical coefficient can be recognized as the apparent radial hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer l n t n note that when n 1 the above nonlinear equation can be transformed into a linear one which is the same as darcy s law dissimilarly the vertical flux is darcian and can be expressed as 8 q z k z s r z t z in which kz is the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer lt 1 considering a more general case if the wellbore storage cannot be ignored which means that the radius of the well rw is relatively large the inner boundary condition can be rewritten as 9 2 π r w z 0 z 1 q w z t d z π r w 2 d s w t dt q z 0 z z 1 for a constant pumping rate q positive values indicate pumping while negative values indicate injection in eq 9 qw z t is the flux at the wellbore which equals the flow rate per unit area of the well screen according to the izbash equation it can be defined as 10 q w q w n 1 k r s r z t r r r w the continuities of the flux and drawdown at the aquifer aquitard interface can be described as follows 11 s r z t s r z t z m and 12 k s r z t z k z s r z t z z m respectively where k is the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the aquitard lt 1 and s r z t is the drawdown in the aquitard l with storage considered the transient continuity equation in the aquitard is 13 q z r z t z s b s r z t t m z m b where b is the aquitard thickness l s is the storage coefficient of the aquitard and q z r z t is the vertical flux in the aquitard the top boundary condition of the aquitard is described as 14 s r z t 0 z m b the initial drawdown in the aquitard can be expressed as 15 s r z 0 0 the default values in this model are listed in table 1 2 2 dimensionless transform using the dimensionless variables defined in table 2 the equations related to the aquifer eqs 1 10 can be rewritten in dimensionless form as follows 16 r d q rd r d r d q zd z d s d t d 17 s d r d z d 0 0 18 s d z d t d 0 19

the above equations the subscript d denotes the dimensionless form of each specific item 2 3 analytical method similar to eq 1 the governing equation can be rewritten as 31 q r r z t r q r r z t r k z

2008a 2008b 2008c to transform the expression of qr as 33 q r n 1 q 2 π r m n 1 substituting eq 33 into eq 32 leads to 34 2 s r z t r 2 n r s r z t r n k z k r q 2 π r b n 1 2 s r z t z 2 sn m k r q 2

n sin w m ξ j sin w m ξ j w m where kv x is the second kind of modified bessel function with order v and the other parameters are explained in appendix b to obtain the drawdown behavior in real time eq 36 can be inverted numerically with the stehfest method stehfest 1970a 1970b 2 4 numerical solution we used the finite difference method denoted as fdm in the following to solve this model first we employed a relatively large radius red to approximate an infinite boundary at which the drawdown is equal to zero after discretization the domain rwd red comprised n 1 subdomains i e n 2 nodes similar to previous studies mathias et al 2008 wen et al 2009 the radial spatial domain was discretized logarithmically 37 r d i r d i 1 2 r d i 1 2 2 i 1 2 n with 38 log 10 r d i 1 2 log 10 r wd i log 10 r ed log 10 r wd n i 0 1 2 n because the vertical flow to the pumping well cannot be ignored for a ppw the vertical spatial domain should also be discretized chang and chen 2003 recommended finer grids near the well screen ends and coarser grids in the middle portion in addition due to the necessary description of the flux continuity at the aquifer aquitard interface as eq 27 indicates the aquifer aquitard interface has been discretized using finer grids therefore the vertical spatial domain including the aquifer interface and aquitard was split into six subdomains i e 0 z 0 d z 0 d z 0 d z 1 d 2 z 0 d z 1 d 2 z 1 d z 1 d z 1 d 1 2 z 1 d 1 2 1 and 1 1 μ from bottom to top respectively each subdomain was discretized logarithmically into 10 segments which has been found to be sufficient for this model chang and chen 2003 the details of vertical discretization are described in appendix a the governing equation eq 16 can be reduced to a series of discrete equations with respect to dimensionless time td as follows 39 d s d i j d t d r d i 1 2 q rd i 1 2 j r d i 1 2 q rd i 1 2 j r d i r d i 1 2 r d i 1 2 q zd i j 1 q zd i j z d j 1 z d j i 1 2 n j 1 2 50 with i 1 2 and j indicating the node numbers in the radial and vertical directions respectively the expression for zd j can be found in appendix a similar to the boundary condition eq 24 can be reduced to the following equation with respect to dimensionless time td 40 d s wd d t d 4 s r wd 2 1 r wd 2 j 11 j 30 q rd j 1 z d j z d j 1 where qrd j 1 is the radial flux at each segment of the well screen since j from 11 to 30 represents the occupation of the well screen in the vertical direction because the radial flow is opposite to the coordinate axis in the radial direction qrd is negative and can be rewritten from eq 22 as follows 41 q rd k d k r 1 n n s d r d 1 n thus at a specific vertical location if j is constant the dimensionless radial flux that goes into and out of each cell can be written as 42 q rd i 1 2 k d k r 1 n n s d i s d i 1 r d i 1 r d i 1 n i 1 2 n 1 43 q rd i 1 2 k d k r 1 n n s d i 1 s d i r d i r d i 1 1 n i 2 3 n respectively at the inner and outer boundaries in the r

dimensionless radial flux qrd eq 27 brings about the drawdown at the aquifer aquitard interface as 46 s d i 51 s d i 5 0 p s d i 5 2 1 p i 1 2 n with p α z d 51 z d 50 α z d 52 z d 51 eq 46 indicates that the drawdown at the interface depends on the two closely adjacent drawdowns on both sides additionally the drawdown in the aquitard can be expressed as 47 d s d i j d t d μ λ q zd i j q zd i j 1 z d j z d j 1 i 1 2 n j 52 53 61 the dimensionless vertical flux that goes into and out of each cell in the whole system is expressed like the radial flux shown in eqs 42 45 it should be pointed out that we assume that the non darcian flow occurs in the radial direction in the aquifer for the above derivation for example a simple case of darcian flow is easy to deal with by letting the power index n be equal to 1 in eqs 22 and 25 with the aforementioned preparations the problem stated here can be solved with matlab software using the stiff integrator ode15s mathias et al 2008 wen et al 2011 we developed a matlab program to perform such calculations the number of nodes in the radial direction n was chosen to be 1000 rwd and red were set to 0 01 and 5000 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 accuracy verification of the solutions if the radial flow is assumed to be darcian instead of non darcian the power index n in eq 36 equals to 1 and the linearization procedure has no effects then eq 36 becomes 48 s d r d z d p m 1 k 0 r d ε cos w m z d δ m ε k 1 r wd ε j 1 m q wd j sin w m ξ j sin w m ξ j w m eq 48 is a special solution with respect to ppws nuf boundary and leaky effects which have also been involved in the analytical solution of feng and zhan 2016 if making the skin thickness equal to zero or the skin permeability equal to the formation permeability as in feng and zhan 2016 one can obtain the same solution to eq 48 figure 2 shows the dimensionless wellbore drawdowns with respect to dimensionless time from three kinds of special solutions including the analytical solution of feng and zhan 2016 without skin effects the analytical and numerical solutions in this study with a power index n of 1 as shown in fig 2 the three solution curves agree perfectly with each other indicating that both the analytical and numerical solutions in our study have good performance if non darcian flow is not considered to check the performance of the linearization method in our analytical solution we compared our analytical and numerical solutions in fig 3 it is obvious that except when n equals to 1 i e the non darcian effect does not exist there are practically no discrepancies between the analytical and the numerical solutions additionally as the non darcian effects become larger a greater discrepancy and an earlier deviation between these two kinds of solution curves occur this was expected because we employed a linearization method to solve the nonlinear problem by assuming that the radial component of the velocity can be approximated by eq 33 however for the nuf boundary problem the flux along the well screen is non uniform von hofe and helweg 1998 cassiani et al 1999 korom et al 2003 houben 2006 perina and lee 2006 houben and hauschild 2011 which means that the calculated dimensionless well screen flux q wd j in eq 36 will deviate from its correct value if the linearization procedure is implemented resulting in an error in the drawdowns meanwhile a larger n amplifies the deviation from the actual value in addition if replacing the nuf boundary with the uf boundary the linearization method works very well as was demonstrated in the study of wen et al 2016 this is because the linearization approximation coincides with the flux properties in the uf boundary in addition as fig 3 reveals if the value of the power index n lies between 1 and 1 1 i e there is actually turbulent flow but the turbulence is relatively small the curves of our analytical solution can still match moderately well with those of our numerical solution which means that our analytical solution is adequate when the non darcian effect exists but is small however if the non darcian effect is moderate or large our analytical solution cannot be used therefore for the latter case we used the numerical solution to analyze the flow processes 3 2 leaky and non darcian effects on quasi steady state fluxes along the well face the most typical outcome of the nuf boundary is the non uniform flux along the well face it is widely accepted that the largest flux exists at screen ends and the smallest flux exists at the screen midpoint von hofe and helweg 1998 cassiani et al 1999 korom et al 2003 houben 2006 perina and lee 2006 houben and hauschild 2011 in addition some studies of actual partially penetrating well also indicate that the peak of flux appears at the ends of screen such as garg and lal 1971 with experimental results and korom et al 2003 with physical models as fig 4 shows our numerical solution also yields this kind of flux at a quasi steady state moreover the previous studies on nuf boundary fluxes are extended by discussing the effects of leakage and non darcian flow in this section in fig 4 four different cases are presented in two subfigures in case 1 the power index n is set to 1 i e the radial flow is darcian meanwhile the leaky effect does not exist and only a confined aquifer is considered in case 2 instead of darcian flow as in case 1 non darcian flow has been considered in case 3 leakage from an aquitard above the main aquifer has been considered while as in case 1 flow is assumed to be darcian in case 4 both non darcian and leakage effects have been taken into account the details of each case are outlined in table 3 the parameter values for these four cases are listed in table 1 subfigure a indicates the dimensionless radial flux qrd along the well screen that is expressed by the dimensionless elevation zd similarly subfigure b indicates that a positive value of qzd the dimensionless vertical flux indicates the flow direction is from top to bottom and a negative value indicates flow direction from bottom to top in the same way the four cases are also set in fig 5 in which the dimensionless quasi steady state drawdowns versus dimensionless distance at both screen ends are represented to support the explanation of fig 4 as the two subfigures in fig 4 reveal the comparisons between case 1 and case 2 indicate without a leaky effect the non darcian effect can reduce both radial and vertical fluxes at a quasi steady state time while the fluxes at both well screen ends decrease by the same degree this is because compared with the darcian case the non darcian case implies that the radial flow approaches turbulent flow and that the water from aquifer storage near the well is used faster this implies that the drawdown drops to zero very quickly at any given distance in addition the comparison between case 1 and case 2 in fig 5 also illustrates that the drawdowns at both screen ends decrease while the cone of depression around the well shrinks furthermore the same degree of reduction in drawdowns at the screen ends in fig 5 indicates the similar degree of reduction of fluxes in fig 4 analyzing the comparison between case 1 and case 3 we found that without a non darcian effect the leakage from the aquitard can reduce both radial and vertical fluxes at the screen ends this is because the aquitard aquifer interface flow can partially take the place of the main aquifer for water supply leading to a smaller drawdown at any given distance as revealed by the comparison between case 1 and case 3 in fig 5 case 3 in the two subfigures of fig 4 clearly shows that when a leaky effect exists both the radial and vertical fluxes at the top end are smaller than those at the bottom end of the well screen this is due to the closer distance between the top end of the well screen and the aquifer aquitard interface making the top end collect more water than the bottom end therefore the drawdown versus distance at the top end is smaller than that at the bottom end i e a steeper hydraulic gradient exists at the elevation of the bottom end which is indicated by case 3 in fig 5 explaining why the fluxes at the bottom end are larger than those at the top end in fig 4 in addition as case 3 in fig 5 shows the curves of hbotttom and htop share a joint front end at a distance that equals to the well radius rd 0 01 this is due to the characteristics of the nuf boundary that assumes the head along the well screen is uniform on the other hand the curves of hbotttom and htop overlap each other with zero drawdown at a far enough distance for example at rd larger than 10 this is because the flow field far away from well is not influenced by pumping and no drawdown occurs at any given elevation making the drawdowns at both screen ends equal to zero based on the above analysis the results of case 4 in fig 4 can be well interpreted by the comparison to the results of cases 2 and 3 on the basis of the results in case 2 it is the leaky effect that reduces both radial and vertical fluxes at screen ends and makes the fluxes at the bottom larger than those at top on the basis of the results in case 3 it is the non darcian effect that synchronously reduces both radial and vertical fluxes at screen ends interestingly the non darcian effect can shorten the leakage induced differences of fluxes and drawdowns between two screen ends as shown in fig 4 and fig 5 respectively this is because non darcian flow effects can increase the mixture of water particles causing the head or flux differences to approach zero to investigate the degree of influence of aquifer and aquitard parameters on the fluxes we chose the wellbore drawdown for convenience purposes to perform a sensitivity analysis with respect to kr kz k z s s and n the normalized sensitivity method kabala 2001 huang and yeh 2007 was adopted for calculation and the results are shown in fig 6 as revealed in this figure one can easily see that the wellbore drawdown is most sensitive to the power index n while it is moderately sensitive to some other aquifer parameters i e s kr and kz however the wellbore drawdown seems to not be sensitive to all aquitard parameters therefore it can be judged that if adjusting the aquitard parameters to produce various degrees of leaky effects in case 3 one can obtain much less change in the results compared with adjusting the power index n in case 2 3 3 comparisons between uf and nuf boundaries with respect to leaky and non darcian effects several studies have compared the drawdowns due to uf and nuf boundary conditions ruud and kabala 1997 perina and lee 2006 feng and zhan 2016 tügel et al 2016 this study extends previous research by adding the effects of leaky and non darcian effects into the comparison the solution incorporating the uf boundary aquitard aquifer interface flow and radial non darcian flow is from wen et al 2016 a significant reference additionally the wellbore storage which is not considered in wen et al 2016 is not taken into account in our study either figure 7 reveals a series of curves indicating the dimensionless drawdown versus dimensionless distance at a quasi steady state time these curves can be classified generally in three ways i e boundary types uf or nuf vertical location zd 0 25 0 5 0 75 and flow patterns darcian or non darcian several results and conclusions are discussed in the following sections based on fig 7 for convenience the drawdowns in the cases of uf and nuf boundaries are denoted as uf drawdown and nuf drawdown respectively in general under the same conditions i e the flow pattern vertical location and aquitard conditions are the same the uf drawdowns were larger than the nuf drawdown at the screen midpoint zd 0 5 while the uf drawdowns are smaller than the nuf drawdowns at the two screen ends zd 0 25 and zd 0 75 this coincides with the results of perina and lee 2006 and feng and zhan 2016 who did not consider non darcian effects in addition the nuf drawdowns at the two screen ends rd 0 01 are equal but the uf drawdowns at the top end are smaller than those at the bottom end this is because the nuf boundary prescribes head along the well screen to be uniform however the uf boundary sets flux to be uniform making the uf drawdowns along the screen non uniform meanwhile recharge from the aquitard makes the top end which is closer to the aquitard than the bottom end receive leakage more easily therefore the uf drawdowns at the top end are smaller than those at the bottom end which can also explain the nuf drawdowns differences between the top and bottom when the distance is far away from the well screen furthermore one can see that if the distance is far enough from well the uf drawdowns equal the nuf drawdowns indicating that the uf boundary can replace the nuf boundary when the distance is greater than or equal to one in addition it is worth pointing out that the convergence between uf and nuf drawdowns occurs most early at the elevation of zd 0 5 moreover non darcian effects can distinctly diminish the differences between the uf drawdowns and nuf drawdowns for example in fig 7 the black curve uf zd 0 75 darcian has a considerable deviation from the green curve nuf zd 0 75 darcian but the deviation between the red curve uf zd 0 75 non darcian and the blue curve nuf zd 0 75 non darcian is much smaller than that without non darcian effects this phenomenon occurs at the elevations of zd 0 25 and zd 0 5 in addition with a careful examination of those figures one can see that the greatest reduction of differences between uf and nuf drawdowns occurs at the elevation of the top end in addition the non darcian effects accelerate the convergence between uf and nuf drawdowns as fig 7 shows this is because nonlinear non darcian flow effects can accelerate the mixture or internal operation of the flow regime that is to say non darcian effects can reform different flow situations in the same way and the head or flux differences along the well screen are ready to be diminished regardless of whether the boundary is uf or nuf 4 conclusions in this study we investigated non darcian flow to a ppw by considering a nuf boundary in a leaky confined aquifer the izbash equation was applied to describe the non darcian flow in the radial direction both analytical methods and fdm were used to solve the composite model the radial and vertical fluxes along the well screen for four different cases have been analyzed the drawdowns versus distance under the four cases have also been revealed the leaky and non darcian effects on both uf and nuf drawdowns have been discussed several conclusions can be drawn from this study 1 the analytical solution with linearization is adequate when non darcian effects are relatively small in this study s nuf boundary 2 both leaky and non darcian effects can reduce drawdowns radial and vertical fluxes at two well screen ends the drawdowns and fluxes at the top end are smaller than those at the bottom end due to leakage and non darcian effects can diminish the drawdown differences between these two well ends 3 non darcian effects can diminish the differences between uf and nuf drawdowns at any elevation and the greatest reduction of differences occurs at the elevation of the top end of the screen 4 the nuf boundary can be replaced by the uf boundary at a distance greater than or equal to one from the well this distance is smallest at the elevation of the screen midpoint and can be distinctly reduced by non darcian effects 5 the results are most sensitive to the power index n while they are moderately sensitive to the other parameters of the aquifer and least sensitive to the parameters of the aquitard acknowledgments this research was partially supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant

6003,shallow alluvial aquifers are important local and regional water resources but obtaining sufficient hydrogeologic data to properly characterize their spatial extent and hydraulic conditions can often be difficult time consuming and expensive in this study we used over 40 000 measurements of electrical resistivity tomography ert data and hydraulic conductivity k data from 33 pump tests across eight shallow alluvial and glacial outwash aquifer field sites in iowa to 1 assess the relation between hydraulic k tests and electrical resistivity er in alluvial and glacial outwash systems and 2 evaluate the application of the er k relationship as input data for local scale groundwater flow modeling average field measured k across the eight sites was 95 m day and ranged from 29 to 246 m day whereas aquifer resistivity ranged from 27 to 896 ohm m both k and er were greater at the glacial outwash aquifer sites compared to the alluvial aquifer sites and a linear relationship r2 0 90 was observed between field measured k and er when incorporating all field sites we evaluated how k derived from the er k relationship compared to k estimated from pump tests and calibrated k in a local scale groundwater flow model the k estimated by the er k relationship was comparable to the k estimated from the pump tests in terms of providing reasonable values for model development utilizing the er k relationship to estimate k would save significant time compared to conducting pump tests hence estimating k from electrical resistivity can provide a non intrusive cost and time efficient way to

perhaps the most important goal in the emerging field of hydrogeophysics lesmes and friedman 2005 electrical resistivity er is a geophysical method where electrical current is introduced into the

study we used over 40 000 measurements of electrical resistivity tomography ert data and hydraulic conductivity k data from 33 pump tests across eight shallow alluvial and glacial outwash aquifer field sites in iowa to evaluate the relation of er to k at the wellfield scale our specific objectives were to assess the relation between hydraulic k tests and er in alluvial and glacial outwash systems and evaluate the application of the er k relationship as input data for local scale groundwater flow modeling 2 materials and methods 2 1 field site locations eight aquifer field sites located in western iowa were investigated as part of this study fig 1 each site serves as a municipal or rural water wellfield consisting of active pumping wells and observation wells aquifer depths ranged from approximately five meters hospers site to approximately 25 m rock valley east site aquifer thickness varied from three to 15 m among the wellfield areas the aquifer sites evaluated were considered local scale with sizes ranging from tens to hundreds of hectares investigation activities at the field sites were reported in individual project reports published by the iowa geological survey igs gannon 2012 gannon and vogelgesang 2013a b gannon and vogelgesang 2014 gannon and vogelgesang 2015 gannon et al 2016 gannon and holt 2017 holt et al 2017 although the objectives of these projects varied slightly they were primarily focused on the quantification and or exploration of local groundwater resources field investigations at all eight sites included the collection of er data adjacent to pump test wells the compilation of these er data to measured aquifer properties represented the dataset used in this paper 2 2 geology the aquifer field sites evaluated in this study are located in two landform regions in iowa fig 1 the shenandoah and manning sites are situated within the southern iowa drift plain an area characterized by steeply rolling hills and well developed drainage prior 1991 soils consist mainly of silty clay loams silt loams or clay loams formed in loess and pre illinoian till with many soils characterized by moderate to high erosion potential the remaining six sites are located in the northwest iowa plains landscape region characterized by open gently rolling hills and thick loess cover sourced from the nearby missouri and big sioux river valleys six field site locations are situated in alluvial aquifers fig 1 in western iowa alluvial aquifers are often the sole source of groundwater for rural communities and agricultural producers these aquifers tend to be relatively shallow unconfined systems that lie adjacent to modern rivers the holocene alluvial sediments in northwest iowa are part of the deforest formation bettis 1990 gravel sand silt and clay are present in this environment as evidenced by drilling records from each site however fine grained silt and clay derived from the erosion of upland loess and glacial till dominate in this formation extreme lithologic heterogeneities exist in these aquifers due to the variable deposition of meandering river systems coarse sand and gravel from a point bar deposition environment may lie immediately adjacent to less permeable silt and clay sediments two sites are established in glacial outwash sediments table 1 outwash derived from continental glaciers deposited cobbles pebbles gravel sand and other sediments as they ebbed and flowed across the landscape proximity to glacial margins often determines the types of sediments that can be expected the coarsest sediments including cobbles boulders and gravel will be found on or proximal to the glacier due to the sediment laden meltwater or floodwater present in these environments these materials can be fairly well sorted and serve as a good aquifer under certain conditions gannon et al 2008 finer sediments are transported farther downstream 2 3 geophysical methods data from ert investigations at the eight field sites were analyzed as part of this study field measurements were obtained from 39 ert lines lines were located near existing production wells to obtain representative correlations of aquifer resistivity to pump test results measurements of er were collected using an advanced geosciences inc agi supersting r8 8 channel er meter a direct current was introduced into the subsurface through current electrodes and resulting voltages were measured through potential electrodes an array of up to 56 electrodes were spaced 2 6 m apart driven approximately 0 25 m into the ground and connected via electrode cables and a switch box to a central er meter a dipole dipole collection configuration was utilized to better image geologic variability associated with shallow alluvial and glacial outwash aquifers measure time was set at 1 2 s and measurements were stacked averaged twice unless the standard deviation of all channels was less than 2 in that case a third measurement was taken and included in the average to quantify error overlapping data were collected in areas already covered by normal measurement data were processed using agi earthimager 2d version 2 4 0 software advanced geosciences 2008 earthimager s default surface inversion setting was used on all datasets to ensure comparisons could be made across sites a smooth model inversion method was used the inversion mesh was fine for the near surface region in each transect and coarsened with depth resistivity values below one ohm m or above 10 000 ohm m were removed as these values are typically representative of erroneous data inversion stop criteria were kept at the default settings final models had a median root mean squared value of 2 92 and a median l2 norm ratio of 0 9 each model was corrected for land surface elevation using statewide light detection and ranging lidar three meter grid elevation data the ert models were exported as xyz files so resistivity data in the aquifer could be filtered and analyzed top bottom and lateral extents of the aquifer were determined from the resistivity data of each line fig 2 aquifer boundaries were determined by taking an average of high and low outliers for example fig 2 shows ert results from line 12 at the sioux center site the upper red line was designated as the top of the aquifer at 10 5 m which was an average of the uppermost transition from high to low resistivity 8 8 m and the lowermost transition from high to low resistivity 12 2 m bottom and lateral aquifer extents were determined using the same methodology higher resistivity zones defined by these criteria were compared to known aquifer depths from boreholes and assumed to represent the aquifer at each site analyses including mean resistivity standard deviation of resistivity and sum of data points used were performed on the filtered aquifer data at each site a field er was determined by averaging the mean er from all ert transects within the site 2 4 pump test methods hydraulic properties of an aquifer e g hydraulic conductivity are needed in order evaluate groundwater flow contaminant transport and potential water production aquifer pump tests are commonly used to determine local hydraulic properties in situ k at the eight field sites was measured by aquifer pump tests a total of 33 pump tests were conducted across the field sites each pump test was analyzed using the aquifertest software waterloo hydrogeologic 2017 employing the appropriate solution method from those outlined in freeze and cherry 1979 solution methods used for the pump tests included theis cooper jacob neuman and theis recovery theis 1935 cooper and jacob 1946 neuman 1975 at each site a field k was determined by averaging values calculated from each pump test within the site field k from each site was compared to corresponding field er to develop a relationship between er and k theoretically aquifer heterogeneities and geologic boundaries within the drawdown cone of a pump test are incorporated into a single global value of k while the er data used in this study were originally collected as a way to visualize an aquifer s thickness extent and coarse sediments at the local scale most er transects were also located close enough to the pump tests that the majority were within or adjacent to the drawdown cones of the pump tests gannon 2012 gannon and vogelgesang 2013a b gannon and vogelgesang 2014 gannon and vogelgesang 2015 gannon et al 2016 gannon and holt 2017 holt et al 2017 therefore most er transects in this study were measuring er for portions of the aquifers within the drawdown cones of the pump tests however er was not measured across the entire drawdown cone of the each pump test thus some external aquifer boundaries or heterogeneities that could impact the drawdown cones and thus k from the pump tests may not have been accounted for by the er measurements 3 results 3 1 summary of data field hydraulic conductivity and aquifer electrical resistivity for the eight field sites were determined by averaging results from multiple pump tests and ert transects that were conducted at each site each aquifer site had one to 12 pump tests to determine hydraulic conductivity and two to eight ert transects to determine aquifer resistivity table 1 the total length of transects ran at each site ranged from 432 to 2022 m

relationship an empirical relationship between aquifer resistivity and field hydraulic conductivity er k was developed by incorporating the 33 pump tests over 10 000 m of ert transects and 40 000 er measurements from the eight aquifer field sites a linear relationship r2 0 90 was observed between field hydraulic conductivity and aquifer resistivity across all field sites incorporating both the glacial outwash and alluvium depositional environments fig 3 the nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nse between measured k and k from the er k relationship was 0 89 across all sites in order to evaluate the ability of aquifer resistivity to predict hydraulic conductivity field k across the eight sites was estimated using the er k relationship shown in fig 3 and compared with the field hydraulic conductivities measured by the pump tests as shown in fig 4 er was able to provide reasonable estimates of k at the wellfield scale using the empirical relationship developed in this study the average absolute error between field hydraulic conductivities estimated by electrical resistivity and measured by the pump tests was 23 m day or 34 considering the variability of hydraulic conductivity measured by pump tests at each field site standard deviations between 11 and 82 m day table 2 the hydraulic conductivities estimated by er would certainly be considered reasonable at the wellfield scale it should be noted that the linear correlation between er and k decreases r2 0 12 when only considering the alluvial sites which indicates k estimated from the er k relationship does not fully capture the substantial heterogeneity present in the alluvial aquifers relative to the magnitude of differences in field k measured by the pump tests at the alluvial sites this could be caused by how the er k relationship was developed in this study to develop the er k relationship k values measured by the pump tests at each site were averaged to provide a field k the range of field hydraulic conductivities e g averages was comparatively small 29 92 m day relative to the variability measured by the pump tests at each individual site standard deviations 11 55 m day table 2 the absolute error between k measured by pump tests and k estimated with the er k relationship for the alluvial sites was 20 m day considering the variability of hydraulic conductivity measured by the pump tests at each alluvial site standard deviations 11 55 m day table 2 k estimated using the er k relationship could still be considered s reasonable practical estimate of an average k at the wellfield scale especially if detailed hydrogeologic information for an alluvial aquifer at the wellfield scale is not available 3 3 application of the er k relationship to groundwater modeling the er k relationship developed in this study fig 3 was used to estimate k at locations in the alluvial aquifer site at sioux center iowa where both pump tests and ert transects had been conducted fig 5 hydraulic conductivities estimated from the er k relationship were compared to those estimated from pump tests and to those used in a calibrated local scale groundwater model of the sioux center aquifer site that had been developed as part of a groundwater exploration project gannon and vogelgesang 2015 the sioux center model had been developed using visual modflow version 11 1 waterloo hydrogeologic 2015 and was comprised of three layers with the middle layer representing the sand and gravel alluvial aquifer boundary conditions included no flow to represent upland areas and general heads to represent benches and terraces along the valley wall the model was calibrated manually under transient conditions hydraulic conductivities were calibrated such that simulated drawdowns matched those measured in the observation wells of the pump tests conducted at the site calibrating to pump test drawdowns allowed the model to simulate transient conditions of the aquifer during active pumping more detailed information on model development can be found in gannon and vogelgesang 2015 our goal was to determine if hydraulic conductivity estimated from the er k relationship was 1 consistent with k estimated by the pump tests and 2 sufficient for use in the development of the groundwater flow model comparisons of k estimated from the er k relationship and pump tests to the calibrated k from the groundwater model are shown in fig 6 average differences between model calibrated k and those determined by the er k relationship and the pump tests were 90 and 78 m day respectively calibrated hydraulic conductivities were closer to the pump test values for three wells and to the er k relationship derived values for two wells as observed in fig 6 k in model calibration was allowed to vary significantly 200 from the initial values measured by the pump tests considering the allowed variation in model calibration the hydraulic conductivities estimated by the er k relationship could have provided functional values to develop the groundwater flow model 4 discussion previous studies comparing k from pump tests to er using vertical electrical sounding ves geophysical methods kosinski and kelly 1981 niwas and singhal 1985 yadav 1995 sikandar and christen 2012 guevara et al 2017 have typically used four electrodes to determine er at a single point astm

approach at a much larger scale to investigate spatial patterns of k at a wellfield we found that electrical resistivity tomography ert transects provided significantly more spatially referenced er data at a site compared to point measured ves a standard ves measurement will determine er at a single point whereas a geophysical transect with 56 electrodes and a dipole dipole collections array can return over two thousand er measurements from a 330 m line advanced geosciences 2006 while ert has been used to evaluate aquifer structure and heterogeneity robinson et al 2016 delineate fresh saltwater interfaces kazakis et al 2016 and map contaminant distribution in the subsurface johnson et al 2012 johnson and wellman 2013 simyrdanis et al 2018 the use of ert to develop er k relationships has not been widely reported study results indicate the multi dimensionality and collection density of the ert datasets provides a reliable method to obtain a comprehensive representation of the aquifer s local heterogeneity for incorporation into er k correlations and groundwater modeling despite the benefits extensive ert datasets can provide to aquifer characterization efforts drawbacks must also be considered uncertainty related to field data collection inversion and interpretation analysis can be associated with ert surveys for example choosing to use a particular collection array and settings instead of another may yield different results a dipole dipole array can be useful for imaging vertical variability in the subsurface while a wenner array can better image horizontal layers in terms of inversion different processing software settings and algorithms can produce different outputs interpretation is also an inherently critical component of er data analysis and different interpretations can lead to uncertainty in results for example anomalous resistivity values from a buried water line in an existing wellfield may be falsely interpreted as a natural aquifer characteristic additionally ert resolution decreases with depth possibly making well installations and pump tests the method of choice uncertainty in ert data was controlled in this study as much as practically possible section 2 3 however pump tests are expected to provide a more reliable means of determining k results from this study show that ert can be a helpful supplement to groundwater investigations providing an estimate of k in areas where it is not feasible to conduct traditional pump tests we suggest not solely relying on ert to gather aquifer information but rather coupling it with drilling and pump tests for a more comprehensive characterization of an aquifer hydraulic conductivities measured across the field sites in this study were in range with reported values from previous studies involving glacial outwash and alluvial aquifers weiss and razem 1980 urish 1981 niwas and singhal 1985 sikandar and christen 2012 the direct positive er k relationship developed is also supported by previous literature for shallow alluvial and glacial outwash aquifers kosinski and kelly 1981 urish 1981 niwas and singhal 1985 sikandar and christen 2012 results indicate ert was able to adequately estimate k across both alluvial and glacial outwash shallow aquifers while increasing characterization of local aquifer heterogeneity at each collection point glacial outwash sites were found to have higher k than alluvial sites which was expected considering the different energies associated with each depositional environment holocene alluvium in western iowa is derived primarily from loess silt and glacial till clay matrix dominated sources deposited by water in relatively low energy environments bettis iii 1990 glacial outwash is typically much coarser in nature and is deposited in stream channels and plains draining glaciers menzies 1995 these higher energy outwash systems are composed of coarse sand gravel and coarser materials and are often well sorted and stratified hydraulic conductivity is an essential data parameter in groundwater flow modeling determining k from high resolution ert provides a non intrusive way to improve the density and spatial distribution of hydraulic conductivity datasets while reducing time and costs for example the er k relationship was able to estimate local k similar to k determined from pump tests relative to the calibrated k values used in a previously developed local scale groundwater model at the sioux center site section 3 3 the 12 pump tests that had been completed at sioux center for development of the groundwater flow model could have been significantly reduced without any sacrifice in the quality and distribution of hydraulic conductivity dataset had the er k relationship been available to utilize consider each pump test used a pumping well with a corresponding observation well fig 5 and each observation well was drilled to an average depth of 13 m the costs associated with drilling and installing 12 observation wells to an average depth of 13 m was approximately 40 000 personal communication matthew streeter certified driller igs installing two observation wells to conduct two pump tests and utilizing ert to determine all other hydraulic conductivities would have saved over 35 000 in drilling costs obtaining k for most of the alluvial aquifer site by ert with two pump tests for verification could have also reduced the time required to obtain the hydraulic conductivity dataset needed for model development by up to three weeks although the relation of ert to k assessed in this study of eight iowa sites was encouraging more work is needed to test this relation at other shallow alluvial aquifer locations to evaluate the relationship at a more precise scale than this work future studies could be conducted where ert transects are run parallel and perpendicular to a pumping well within the drawdown cone from a pump test aquifer heterogeneity would then be similar when averaging er to a single value as when the hydraulic conductivity from the pump test is averaged to a single value future work is also needed to apply the er k developed in this study to other groundwater exploration and modeling projects involving shallow alluvial and glacial outwash aquifers to 1 use ert and pump tests to incorporate aquifers with hydrogeologic properties between the alluvial and glacial outwash aquifers presented in this study 2 evaluate the accuracy of the er k relationship across a range of geologic settings and 3 assess the ability to improve the costs and time associated with obtaining the necessary hydraulic conductivity datasets for accurate local scale groundwater flow model development for practical applied groundwater investigation and modeling projects 5 conclusions based on data from the eight iowa field sites ert was able to estimate aquifer hydraulic conductivity with a reasonable degree of accuracy utilizing ert data to estimate k provides an efficient cost effective way to increase the hydrogeological dataset for the development of groundwater flow models and characterization of aquifer heterogeneity hydraulic conductivity estimated from ert was found to be comparable to pump tests in terms of providing initial estimates for model development and calibration for a site where a local groundwater flow model had previously been developed gannon and vogelgesang 2015 while a certain amount of field verification through driller samples and pump tests should be conducted ert can improve the quantity and spatial distribution of the measured k dataset leading to improved quality of local scale groundwater flow models especially for sites that do not have existing observation wells and

6003,shallow alluvial aquifers are important local and regional water resources but obtaining sufficient hydrogeologic data to properly characterize their spatial extent and hydraulic conditions can often be difficult time consuming and expensive in this study we used over 40 000 measurements of electrical resistivity tomography ert data and hydraulic conductivity k data from 33 pump tests across eight shallow alluvial and glacial outwash aquifer field sites in iowa to 1 assess the relation between hydraulic k tests and electrical resistivity er in alluvial and glacial outwash systems and 2 evaluate the application of the er k relationship as input data for local scale groundwater flow modeling average field measured k across the eight sites was 95 m day and ranged from 29 to 246 m day whereas aquifer resistivity ranged from 27 to 896 ohm m both k and er were greater at the glacial outwash aquifer sites compared to the alluvial aquifer sites and a linear relationship r2 0 90 was observed between field measured k and er when incorporating all field sites we evaluated how k derived from the er k relationship compared to k estimated from pump tests and calibrated k in a local scale groundwater flow model the k estimated by the er k relationship was comparable to the k estimated from the pump tests in terms of providing reasonable values for model development utilizing the er k relationship to estimate k would save significant time compared to conducting pump tests hence estimating k from electrical resistivity can provide a non intrusive cost and time efficient way to

study we used over 40 000 measurements of electrical resistivity tomography ert data and hydraulic conductivity k data from 33 pump tests across eight shallow alluvial and glacial outwash aquifer field sites in iowa to evaluate the relation of er to k at the wellfield scale our specific objectives were to assess the relation between hydraulic k tests and er in alluvial and glacial outwash systems and evaluate the application of the er k relationship as input data for local scale groundwater flow modeling 2 materials and methods 2 1 field site locations eight aquifer field sites located in western iowa were investigated as part of this study fig 1 each site serves as a municipal or rural water wellfield consisting of active pumping wells and observation wells aquifer depths ranged from approximately five meters hospers site to approximately 25 m rock valley east site aquifer thickness varied from three to 15 m among the wellfield areas the aquifer sites evaluated were considered local scale with sizes ranging from tens to hundreds of hectares investigation activities at the field sites were reported in individual project reports published by the iowa geological survey igs gannon 2012 gannon and vogelgesang 2013a b gannon and vogelgesang 2014 gannon and vogelgesang 2015 gannon et al 2016 gannon and holt 2017 holt et al 2017 although the objectives of these projects varied slightly they were primarily focused on the quantification and or exploration of local groundwater resources field investigations at all eight sites included the collection of er data adjacent to pump test wells the compilation of these er data to measured aquifer properties represented the dataset used in this paper 2 2 geology the aquifer field sites evaluated in this study are located in two landform regions in iowa fig 1 the shenandoah and manning sites are situated within the southern iowa drift plain an area characterized by steeply rolling hills and well developed drainage prior 1991 soils consist mainly of silty clay loams silt loams or clay loams formed in loess and pre illinoian till with many soils characterized by moderate to high erosion potential the remaining six sites are located in the northwest iowa plains landscape region characterized by open gently rolling hills and thick loess cover sourced from the nearby missouri and big sioux river valleys six field site locations are situated in alluvial aquifers fig 1 in western iowa alluvial aquifers are often the sole source of groundwater for rural communities and agricultural producers these aquifers tend to be relatively shallow unconfined systems that lie adjacent to modern rivers the holocene alluvial sediments in northwest iowa are part of the deforest formation bettis 1990 gravel sand silt and clay are present in this environment as evidenced by drilling records from each site however fine grained silt and clay derived from the erosion of upland loess and glacial till dominate in this formation extreme lithologic heterogeneities exist in these aquifers due to the variable deposition of meandering river systems coarse sand and gravel from a point bar deposition environment may lie immediately adjacent to less permeable silt and clay sediments two sites are established in glacial outwash sediments table 1 outwash derived from continental glaciers deposited cobbles pebbles gravel sand and other sediments as they ebbed and flowed across the landscape proximity to glacial margins often determines the types of sediments that can be expected the coarsest sediments including cobbles boulders and gravel will be found on or proximal to the glacier due to the sediment laden meltwater or floodwater present in these environments these materials can be fairly well sorted and serve as a good aquifer under certain conditions gannon et al 2008 finer sediments are transported farther downstream 2 3 geophysical methods data from ert investigations at the eight field sites were analyzed as part of this study field measurements were obtained from 39 ert lines lines were located near existing production wells to obtain representative correlations of aquifer resistivity to pump test results measurements of er were collected using an advanced geosciences inc agi supersting r8 8 channel er meter a direct current was introduced into the subsurface through current electrodes and resulting voltages were measured through potential electrodes an array of up to 56 electrodes were spaced 2 6 m apart driven approximately 0 25 m into the ground and connected via electrode cables and a switch box to a central er meter a dipole dipole collection configuration was utilized to better image geologic variability associated with shallow alluvial and glacial outwash aquifers measure time was set at 1 2 s and measurements were stacked averaged twice unless the standard deviation of all channels was less than 2 in that case a third measurement was taken and included in the average to quantify error overlapping data were collected in areas already covered by normal measurement data were processed using agi earthimager 2d version 2 4 0 software advanced geosciences 2008 earthimager s default surface inversion setting was used on all datasets to ensure comparisons could be made across sites a smooth model inversion method was used the inversion mesh was fine for the near surface region in each transect and coarsened with depth resistivity values below one ohm m or above 10 000 ohm m were removed as these values are typically representative of erroneous data inversion stop criteria were kept at the default settings final models had a median root mean squared value of 2 92 and a median l2 norm ratio of 0 9 each model was corrected for land surface elevation using statewide light detection and ranging lidar three meter grid elevation data the ert models were exported as xyz files so resistivity data in the aquifer could be filtered and analyzed top bottom and lateral extents of the aquifer were determined from the resistivity data of each line fig 2 aquifer boundaries were determined by taking an average of high and low outliers for example fig 2 shows ert results from line 12 at the sioux center site the upper red line was designated as the top of the aquifer at 10 5 m which was an average of the uppermost transition from high to low resistivity 8 8 m and the lowermost transition from high to low resistivity 12 2 m bottom and lateral aquifer extents were determined using the same methodology higher resistivity zones defined by these criteria were compared to known aquifer depths from boreholes and assumed to represent the aquifer at each site analyses including mean resistivity standard deviation of resistivity and sum of data points used were performed on the filtered aquifer data at each site a field er was determined by averaging the mean er from all ert transects within the site 2 4 pump test methods hydraulic properties of an aquifer e g hydraulic conductivity are needed in order evaluate groundwater flow contaminant transport and potential water production aquifer pump tests are commonly used to determine local hydraulic properties in situ k at the eight field sites was measured by aquifer pump tests a total of 33 pump tests were conducted across the field sites each pump test was analyzed using the aquifertest software waterloo hydrogeologic 2017 employing the appropriate solution method from those outlined in freeze and cherry 1979 solution methods used for the pump tests included theis cooper jacob neuman and theis recovery theis 1935 cooper and jacob 1946 neuman 1975 at each site a field k was determined by averaging values calculated from each pump test within the site field k from each site was compared to corresponding field er to develop a relationship between er and k theoretically aquifer heterogeneities and geologic boundaries within the drawdown cone of a pump test are incorporated into a single global value of k while the er data used in this study were originally collected as a way to visualize an aquifer s thickness extent and coarse sediments at the local scale most er transects were also located close enough to the pump tests that the majority were within or adjacent to the drawdown cones of the pump tests gannon 2012 gannon and vogelgesang 2013a b gannon and vogelgesang 2014 gannon and vogelgesang 2015 gannon et al 2016 gannon and holt 2017 holt et al 2017 therefore most er transects in this study were measuring er for portions of the aquifers within the drawdown cones of the pump tests however er was not measured across the entire drawdown cone of the each pump test thus some external aquifer boundaries or heterogeneities that could impact the drawdown cones and thus k from the pump tests may not have been accounted for by the er measurements 3 results 3 1 summary of data field hydraulic conductivity

glacial outwash and alluvium depositional environments fig 3 the nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nse between measured k and k from the er k relationship was 0 89 across all sites in order to

range with reported values from previous studies involving glacial outwash and alluvial aquifers weiss and razem 1980 urish 1981 niwas and singhal 1985 sikandar and christen 2012 the direct positive er k relationship developed is also supported by previous literature for shallow alluvial and glacial outwash aquifers kosinski and kelly 1981 urish 1981 niwas and singhal 1985 sikandar and christen 2012 results indicate ert was able to adequately estimate k across both alluvial and glacial outwash shallow aquifers while increasing characterization of local aquifer heterogeneity at each collection point glacial outwash sites were found to have higher k than alluvial sites which was expected considering the different energies associated with each depositional environment holocene alluvium in western iowa is derived primarily from loess silt and glacial till clay matrix dominated sources deposited by water in relatively low energy environments bettis iii 1990 glacial outwash is typically much coarser in nature and is deposited in stream channels and plains draining glaciers menzies 1995 these higher energy outwash systems are composed of coarse sand gravel and coarser materials and are often well sorted and stratified hydraulic conductivity is an essential data parameter in groundwater flow modeling determining k from high resolution ert provides a non intrusive way to improve the density and spatial distribution of hydraulic conductivity datasets while reducing time and costs for example the er k relationship was able to estimate local k similar to k determined from pump tests relative to the calibrated k values used in a previously developed local scale groundwater model at the sioux center site section 3 3 the 12 pump tests that had been completed at sioux center for development of the groundwater flow model could have been significantly reduced without any sacrifice in the quality and distribution of hydraulic conductivity dataset had the er k relationship been available to utilize consider each pump test used a pumping well with a corresponding observation well fig 5 and each observation well was drilled to an average depth of 13 m the costs associated with drilling and installing 12 observation wells to an average depth of 13 m was approximately 40 000 personal communication matthew streeter certified driller igs installing two observation wells to conduct two pump tests and utilizing ert to determine all other hydraulic conductivities would have saved over 35 000 in drilling costs obtaining k for most of the alluvial aquifer site by ert with two pump tests for verification could have also reduced the time required to obtain the hydraulic conductivity dataset needed for model development by up to three weeks although the relation of ert to k assessed in this study of eight iowa sites was encouraging more work is needed to test this relation at other shallow alluvial aquifer locations to evaluate the relationship at a more precise scale than this work future studies could be conducted where ert transects are run parallel and perpendicular to a pumping well within the drawdown cone from a pump test aquifer heterogeneity would then be similar when averaging er to a single value as when the hydraulic conductivity from the pump test is averaged to a single value future work is also needed to apply the er k developed in this study to other groundwater exploration and modeling projects involving shallow alluvial and glacial outwash aquifers to 1 use ert and pump tests to incorporate aquifers with hydrogeologic properties between the alluvial and glacial outwash aquifers presented in this study 2 evaluate the accuracy of the er k relationship across a range of geologic settings and 3 assess the ability to improve the costs and time associated with obtaining the necessary hydraulic conductivity datasets for accurate local scale groundwater flow model development for practical applied groundwater investigation and modeling projects 5 conclusions based on data from the eight iowa field sites ert was able to estimate aquifer hydraulic conductivity with a reasonable degree of accuracy utilizing ert data to estimate k provides an efficient cost effective way to increase the hydrogeological dataset for the development of groundwater flow models and characterization of aquifer heterogeneity hydraulic conductivity estimated from ert was found to be comparable to pump tests in terms of providing initial estimates for model development and calibration for a site where a local groundwater flow model had previously been developed gannon and vogelgesang 2015 while a certain amount of field verification through driller samples and pump tests should be conducted ert can improve the quantity and spatial distribution of the measured k dataset leading to improved quality of local scale groundwater flow models especially for sites that do not have existing observation wells and

6004,specific yield is one of the most important hydrogeological parameters and is a key factor connecting flow processes in the unsaturated and saturated zones in this study an innovative expression for the dynamic or time dependent specific yield is proposed considering the coupled unsaturated saturated flow process the new specific yield equation includes parameters such as saturated water content residual water content pore characteristic parameter initial depth of water table time dependent depth of water table initial pressure head and time the involving parameters in this new specific yield equation reflect the impacts of lithology initial water table depth and other factors this new equation approaches an asymptotic steady state value which is the same as reported previously for a shallow water table condition both advective and diffusive unsaturated flow processes are taken into consideration which is in contrast to a previous study that ignored the diffusive unsaturated flow process the model established in this study reveals the complete dynamic process of variation of water content and water head in the unsaturated zone the newly developed specific

water table declines in an unconfined aquifer said et al 2005 song and chen 2010 it is one of the most important and controversy as well hydrogeological concepts for groundwater flow in unconfined aquifer systems bear 1972 istanbulluoglu et al 2012 varni et al 2013 machiwal and jha 2015 yue et al 2016 because of the complexity of flow in a variably saturated porous media debate on the concept of specific yield has been going on for a long time e g meinzer 1923 todd 1959 bear 1972 this is partially because the initial concept of specific yield proposed is ambiguous such as the concept of specific yield defined by meinzer 1923 and todd 1959 neither of the those takes into account the impact of the unsaturated zone hydrodynamics and hence the specific yield thus defined is a constant duke 1972 stephen et al 2006 the amount of water dischargeable in the water table aquifer should include the amount of water dischargeable in the fluctuation zone of the water table and the amount of water dischargeable in the unsaturated zone above the fluctuation zone childs 1960 in addition the water release process in the unsaturated zone is of obviously hysteretic nature akindunni and gillham 1992 nwankwor et al 1992 lee et al 2001 which suggests that the specific yield is a time dependent hydrogeological parameter and may even depends on the wetting and drying processes the evolution of the specific yield concept has developed with increasing understanding of the unsaturated saturated flow process and several formulas have been proposed to quantify the specific yield including the very first simple equation proposed by meinzer 1923 and subsequent improvement of the equation by duke 1972 nachabe 2002 and cheng et al 2015 the complexity of those formulas evolves from time independent ones to time dependent ones and from single factor equations to multi factor equations for example the specific yield formula used by meinzer 1923 is expressed as the difference between the water content of saturated volume and the water content of residual volume a major limitation of the specific yield equation of duke 1972 is that it is not suitable for rapid fluctuations of water table that may occur after a major recharge event nachabe 2002 the specific yield equation of nachabe 2002 includes multiple factors such as water content saturated permeability pore size distribution index air entry pressure head time and so on the generally accepted specific yield is defined as the volume of water released by gravity from the soil column per unit area extending to the ground surface from the water table when the water table declines by one unit of depth bear 1972 freeze and cherry 1979 and the mathematical expression for this definition is 1 s y v w al where sy is the specific yield vw is the volume of water drained or stored in soil when the water table elevation changes by l a is the horizontal area of the water table based on the specific yield concept outlined in eq 1 chen 1984 suggested that the factors associated with the specific yield for a homogeneous soil should include the following four aspects 1 lithology 2 hysteresis of the water content profile in the unsaturated zone 3 initial water table depth and 4 initial water content profile however because the volume of water drained or stored in soil when the water table elevation changes is usually unknown eq 1 is often inapplicable another problem associated with the specific yield equation of nachabe 2002 is that it ignores the diffusive flux term in the unsaturated zone completely thus it works only when water content in the unsaturated zone is approaching its saturated value a condition may be satisfied when the water table is extremely shallow and the saturation of the unsaturated zone is close to 1 0 when the water table is not sufficiently shallow and the water content profile in the unsaturated zone includes stages with various saturations the specific yield equation of nachabe 2002 may generate considerable errors as it substantially overestimates the drainage capacity above the water table the main purpose of this study is to derive an innovative expression for the time dependent specific yield considering factors such as lithology initial water profile of the unsaturated zone considering both advective and diffusive fluxes in the unsaturated zone this new specific yield equation offers an opportunity to understand the fundamental physics of the drainage process of water table in a variably saturated porous system such a new specific yield equation may also be used to replace the constant specific yield in present groundwater flow governing equations in unconfined aquifers in summary this work represents our persistent effort to resolve the long term debate on how to describe the dynamic water table properly by honoring the fundamental physical and hydrologic principles involved in the unsaturated saturated flow process 2 quantification of the transient specific yield 2 1 development of a time dependent specific yield equation for the purpose of illustration the media of concern is assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic and the water table rapidly declines from an initial depth b 1 to a new depth of b 2 the process of water table rise can be studied similarly following the same procedure the water release process by gravity can be summarized as the following two phases 1 a transient water table decline phase from depth of b 1 to b 2 and 2 a phase for water table remaining at b 2 and the seepage process gradually approaches its steady state as shown in fig 1 the origin of the z axis is at the initial water table position and positive z direction is upward the lateral variation of water table is assumed to be a secondary factor thus this study focuses on the one dimensional 1d vertical flow dynamics only in fig 1 i is the initial water content profile with water table depth at b 1 ii is the transient water content profile with water table depth at bt at time t iii is the transient water content profile with water table depth at b 2 iv is the steady state water content profile with water table at b 2 and the specific retention profile according to fig 1 when the water table declines to bt at a given time t the amount of water drained should be the sum of the amount of water drained from the unsaturated zone above the initial water table at b 1 and the amount of water drained when the saturated zone becomes unsaturated below the water table at b 1 and it is written as 2 v w t a 0 b t b 1 θ s θ zt d z b t b 1 b t θ zi θ zt d z where v w t is the total volume of water released at time t b t b 1 is the elevation change of the water table θ s is the saturated water content θ zi is the initial water content θ zt is the water content at time t according to eq 1 the specific yield can be computed as 3 s y t v w t a b t b 1 0 b t b 1 θ s θ zt d z b t b 1 b t θ zi θ zt d z b t b 1 where s y t is the specific yield at time t by means of the soil water characteristic curve model the specific yield equation with the water content as the variable may be converted into the specific yield equation with the negative pressure head suction as the variable to illustrate this the brooks corey model brooks and corey 1964 is adopted as an example 4 s e θ θ r θ s θ r h a h λ h h a 1 h h a where se is the effective saturation θ is the water content θ r is the residual water content h a is the air entry pressure head λ is the brooks corey model parameter called the pore size distribution index an important point to note is that although the residual water content is used in the above brooks corey model the range of water content variation due to the influence of gravity drainage is between saturation and field capacity or specific retention such a range is usually narrower than the range between saturation and residual water content unless the field capacity is very close to the residual water content which could be the case for very coarse and homogeneous soils this means that the variational range of magnitude of the pressure head h in above eq 4 is between ha and an upper bound that is determined by the field capacity rather than infinity which is corresponding to the residual water content another point to emphasis is that the field capacity is a parameter that depends on both the soil structure and the depth of water table as shown in fig 1 so it is usually not a constant for a given soil type since the water content in the range of h ha above the water table is constant eq 3 can be written as 5 s y t h a b ha b 1 2 h a θ s θ zt d z b ha b 1 2 h a b ha h a θ zi θ zt d z b ha h a b 1 where bha is the thickness of the unsaturated zone above the elevation z ha hereinafter referred to as the ha plane bha bt ha replacing the water content in eq 5 with the negative pressure head will lead to 6 s y t θ s θ r 1 h a b 1 h a h i λ d z h a b ha h a h a h t λ d z b ha h a b 1 where hi is the initial negative pressure head ht is the negative pressure head at time t using the trapezoidal rule for integrations in eq 6 one has 7 s y t θ s θ r 1 δ z 2 j 1 b 1 h a δ z h a h ij λ h a h ij 1 λ δ z 2 k 1 b ha δ z h a h tk λ h a h tk 1 λ b ha h a b 1 where δ z is a uniform vertical spatial step hij is the initial negative pressure head at the j th node htk is the negative pressure head at the k th node at time t j k 1 2 under hydrostatic condition the negative pressure head is a linear function of depth lu and likos 2004 8 h z where h is the negative pressure head z is the depth to the water table from the ground surface for the water release by gravity with an initial hydrostatic condition the specific yield s y t can be written as 9 s y t θ s θ r 1 h a 1 λ h a b 1 λ 1 1 δ z 2 k 1 b ha δ z h a h tk λ h a h tk 1 λ b ha h a b 1 the above eq 9 for calculating the specific yield includes the following seven parameters 1 saturated water content 2 residual water content 3 pore characteristic parameter 4 initial depth of water table 5 time dependent depth of water table 6 initial pressure head and 7 time accordingly these parameters reflect the impacts of lithology initial water table depth and other factors when the drainage process lasts over a sufficiently long period of time the specific yield will approach its steady state value as 10 s y std v w std a b 2 b 1 θ s θ r 1 h a 1 λ h a b 1 λ 1 h a b 2 λ 1 b 2 b 1 where v w std is the total volume of water released under the steady state condition eq 10 is identical to the s y std equation of nachabe 2002 2 2 the dynamic process of water release from the unsaturated zone the negative pressure head should be known before one can use the specific yield equations given in eqs 6 7 or 9 in section 2 1 a fundamental improvement of this study over nachabe 2002 lies in the fact that this study takes into account the diffusive term of the unsaturated flow thus removes the constrain of a sufficiently shallow water table presumption in nachabe 2002 such an improvement makes the new specific yield equation of this study more general and robust for dealing with a wide range of water table depths specifically this study differs from nachabe 2002 in the following two aspects first the unsaturated flow equation ignoring the diffusive term is used to describe the water release process at the elevation z ha the ha plane above the water table second for the water release process from the unsaturated zone above the ha plane to the surface it is described by the unsaturated flow equation taking into account both advective and diffusive terms as mentioned previously the gravity driven water release process shown in fig 1 includes two phases in phase 1 the water release process can be described by the unsaturated flow equation ignoring the diffusive term as follows charbeneau 2000 11 θ t k θ z where k θ is the hydraulic conductivity of the unsaturated zone when the brooks corey model eq 4 is adopted as the soil water characteristic curve and the burdine model burdine 1953 brooks and corey 1964 brooks 1964 in the following eq 12 is adopted as the hydraulic conductivity function the relationship between the negative pressure h and the elevation z above the water table can be obtained in eq 13 12 k s e k s s e 2 3 λ λ 13 z ξ t 2 3 λ k s λ θ s θ r h a h 2 2 λ where ξ is the initial elevation corresponding to the new negative pressure head above the new water table and ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity since the effective saturation se 1 within the elevation z ha above the water table the impact of the water content on the specific yield may be ignored within that range therefore the amount of water released due to water content fluctuation of the unsaturated zone above the water table equals to the amount of water released from the unsaturated zone above the ha plane the elevation variation of the water table equals to that of the ha plane and the rate of decline in water table equals to that of the ha plane which is 2 3 λ k s λ θ s θ r derived by eq 13 in phase 1 the thickness of the unsaturated zone above the ha plane bha and the pressure head hb2 at water table b2 are eqs 14 a and 15 a respectively in phase 2 bha and hb2 are eqs 14 b and 15 b respectively 14 b ha b 1 h a 2 3 λ k s λ θ s θ r t 0 t t c a b 2 h a t t c b 15 h b 2 b 2 b 1 2 3 λ k s λ θ s θ r t 0 t t c a 0 t t c b where tc is the critical time of water table reaching the depth of b 2 t c λ θ s θ r b 2 b 1 2 3 λ k s one may refer to appendix a for the derivation of bha hb 2 and tc based on richards equation richards 1931 the mathematical model of the saturated unsaturated flow process above the water table b2 can be described as 16 z k h h z k h z c h η s s h t b 2 z 0 t 0 a h z 0 f z b 2 z 0 b h z z b ha h a 1 t 0 c h z t z b ha b 2 h b 2 d where c h is the specific moisture capacity function f z is the distribution of the initial negative water head when the initial state is under hydrostatic condition one has 17 f z z eq 16c denotes the no flow condition at the surface eq 16d is the water table condition this mathematical model can be solved by commonly used software package such as hydrogeosphere therrien et al 2010 3 results the specific yields for two floridian soils a mulat fine sand and a mulat fine sandy loam are calculated using the newly developed solution and the result is compared with the solution of nachabe 2002 which is hereinafter called the nachabe s solution carlisle et al 1989 have tested the soil water characteristic curves of both soils and the physical parameters of the two soils are shown in table 1 the same types of soils were also used in nachabe 2002 fig 2 a and b show the pressure gradients in the mulat fine sand and the mulat fine sandy loam respectively from fig 2 we can easily find that the dynamic change of pressure gradients with depths at different time for these two soils are similar the initial state and the final steady state are both under hydrostatic condition thus the pressure gradient is constant equaling to 1 for these two end members in other states the pressure gradient decreases first and then increases with depths meanwhile the minimum pressure gradients for different pressure gradient profiles clearly decreases with time first and then increases with time afterward fig 3 a and b show the evolution of specific yield in the mulat fine sand and the mulat fine sandy loam respectively the dot dash line shows the nachabe s solution and the red solid line shows the solution of this study in the simulation the initial state is under hydrostatic condition and the water table declines from a depth of 100 cm to a depth of 120 cm the critical time of water table reaching the depth of b 2 tc is 0 49 hr for mulat fine sand and 1 25 hr for mulat fine sandy loam respectively as shown in fig 3 a and b the specific yield shows a nonlinear increase trend with time and eventually reaches an asymptotic steady state value specifically the s y std values of the mulat fine sand and the mulat fine sandy loam are 0 276 and 0 131 respectively a few points are notable first the solution of specific yield presented here is smaller than the nachabe s solution second it takes longer time to reach steady state based on the new solution for example it takes respectively about 701 h and 248 h for the mulat fine sand and the mulat fine sandy loam to reach steady state based on the nachabe s solution while such times become 2500 h and 1800 h respectively based on the new solution of this study the reason for this discrepancy is primarily because the nachabe s solution ignores the diffusive unsaturated flow completely while the solution presented here takes into account the diffusive unsaturated flow thus is a better representation of the dynamic process of unsaturated flow obviously the nachabe s solution is acceptable for advection dominated flow to quantify the relative contributions of advective versus diffusive unsaturated flow processes the péclet number is used and it is defined as the ratio between the advective flow rate and the diffusive flow rate as follows bear 1972 wang et al 2012 18 p e ul d where pe is the péclet number l is the characteristic length u is the local flow velocity d is the diffusion coefficient defined as d k h h θ if pe is less than 2 the unsaturated flow process is generally considered as diffusion dominated otherwise it is regarded as advection dominated ward 1964 suggested that l k in porous media where k is the intrinsic permeability of the media and k k s μ γ where μ is coefficient of viscosity and γ is gravity density based on the brooks corey model and the burdine model when h ha eq 18 becomes 19 p e 2 3 λ h k from eq 19 the péclet number decreases with the increase of h using table 1 eq 19 and γ 9 777 10 5 n cm3 and μ 2 472 10 11 nhr cm2 at 25 c guo et al 1994 one has pe 2 0 10 5 for the mulat fine sand above the ha plane and pe 6 2 10 6 for the mulat fine sandy loam above the ha plane obviously the péclet numbers are several orders of magnitude smaller than 2 for both soils suggesting that the unsaturated flow are primarily diffusion dominated which invalidates the presumption for the use of the nachabe s solution it is easily found that sy is time dependent in fig 3 to identify the dynamic feature of sy the normalized specific yield s y s y std as a function of the normalized time t t std is shown in fig 4 one can see that the normalized specific yield increases with the normalized time and the rate of change decreases with the normalized time the normalized change rate of specific yield is approximated by a finite difference form shown as eq 20 20 n s y d s y s y std d t t std t std s y std s y t i 1 s y t i t i 1 t i where n s y is the normalized change rate of specific yield tstd is the time of specific yield reaching steady state s y t i 1 and s y t i are the specific yield at time ti 1 and ti respectively in actual computation one may choose tstd as the time for the specific yield to be 99 or 99 9 of its steady state value it should be noted that the exact choice of thresholds either 99 or 99 9 for approximating the steady state condition is arbitrary but such different thresholds will not affect the final conclusion as long as the thresholds are very close to 1 0 the process of the time dependent specific yield can be divided into three stages namely a rapid change stage at early time a smooth change stage at intermediate time and a steady stage at late time with n s y 1 1 n s y 0 01 and n s y 0 01 respectively for the mulat fine sand the normalized time and actual time are respectively 0 066 and 165 h when n s y 1 and they are respectively 0 48 and 1200 h when n s y 0 0 1 shown as figs 3 a and 4 a for the mulat fine sandy loam they are respectively 0 094 and 170 h when n s y 1 and are respectively 0 472 and 850 h when n s y 0 0 1 shown as figs 3 b and 4 b at different stages the normalized change rate of specific yield is significantly difference from each other and the sensitivity of sy on the controlling parameters are significantly difference from each other as well which will be discussed in section 4 a sensitivity analysis of the transient specific yield is documented in the following section 4 besides the transient specific yield the steady state specific yield s y std is probably more easy to use from a practical point of view because of its independence of time and closed form expression therefore a detailed analysis on the influence of multiple involved parameters in s y std is documented in the following section 4 as well to carry out this analysis we will adopt a so called derivative analysis method which concerns the first derivative of s y std with different parameters by inspecting such first derivatives one can identify a number of variational trends of s y std with multiple variables involved if necessary one can also invoke second order derivative or even higher order derivatives to gain further insights on the parameter of concern 4 discussions of limitations of the new specific yield equation 4 1 sensitivity analysis to estimate the impacts of parameters in eqs 9 and 14 on sy a sensitivity analysis is conducted and the parameters of concern are θ s θ r h a λ b 1 b 2 and ks the normalized sensitivity is defined by kabala 2001 and approximated by a finite difference form huang and yeh 2007 li et al 2018 as 21 s i t p i o p i p i o p i δ p i o p i δ p i where s i t is the normalized sensitivity of the i th input parameter at time t o is the output function of the system and pi is the i th input parameter of the system δpi denotes small increments which is usually chosen as10 3 pi the mulat fine sandy loam and the physical model are used to conduct sensitivity analysis fig 5 shows the sensitivity analysis of sy with respect to each of seven parameters θ s θ r h a λ b 1 b 2 and ks from fig 5 it is easy to find that θ s λ and b 1 have positive impacts on sy θ r and ha have negative impacts on sy in all stages ks has positive impact on sy in stage i and stage ii and hardly has any impact on sy in stage iii b 2 has negative impact on sy in stage i has negative impact first then positive impact later on sy in stage ii and has positive impact on sy in stage iii the saturated water content θ s controls the amount of gravitational water in unit volume of soil the residual moisture content θ r represents the moisture beyond the capillary influence bear et al 2011 an increasing θ s and or a decreasing θ r trend means that the amount of gravitational water discharge increases thus θ s imposes positive impacts on sy while θ r has negative impacts on sy the λ parameter reflects the impact of pore size distribution of soil on the soil water characteristic curve a larger λ value implies a more uniform pore size distribution in the soil xie 2015 which benefits the gravitational water discharge however the influence of λ on sy is not always positive which will be discussed in section 4 2 the influence of initial depth of water table b1 on sy has different mechanisms in different stages when time t is shorter than the time required for water table reaching a depth of b 2 namely tc in stage i increasing the b 1 value causes the total drainable water in soil above the initial water table to increase as well and the difference between the initial water table depth and water table depth at time t is almost the same under different b 1 conditions when t is longer than tc however increasing b 1 means that the value of fluctuation of the water table b 2 b 1 decreases although increasing b 1 causes the total drainable water in soil above water table b2 to decrease such an impact on sy is not enough to offset the impact caused by the decreasing b 2 b 1 on sy thus sy increases when b 1 decreases the air entry pressure ha is defined as the matrix suction when the air begins to enter the largest pore of soil and it is a parameter reflecting the water retention capacity of soil fredlund and xing 1994 ha also controls the thickness of the water releasing soil as known from eq 14 the increase of ha implies that the water retention capacity of soil increases so the drainable water is reduced and s y becomes smaller the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks reflects the capability of soil to conduct flow thus a larger ks means more drainable water in stages i and ii however when the seepage tends to steady state condition the total drainable water appears to be unrelated to ks thus ks has positive impact on sy in stage i and stage ii and hardly has any impact on sy in stage iii increasing the depth of water table b2 causes the total drainable water and the fluctuation of water table b 2 b 1 to increase however in the early stage the influence of increased drainable water on sy is not enough to offset the influence of b 2 b 1 on sy thus b 2 has negative impact on sy during early stage beyond the early stage of drainage the accumulated drainable water increases and its positive impact on sy gradually surpasses the negative impact of b 2 b 1 on sy thus b 2 eventually has positive impact on sy at late stage it is evident from above analysis that sensitivity of sy varies with parameters in different stages in stage i early time sy is most sensitive to the water table depth b 2 followed by the initial water table depth b 1 in stage ii intermediate time sy is most sensitive to the saturated water content θ s followed by the residual moisture content θ r in stage iii late time sy is most sensitive to the saturated water content θ s followed by θ r h a λ b 1 and b 2 sy is least sensitive to ks in stage iii 4 2 factors affecting s y std in section 4 1 the sensitivity analysis of transient state of specific yield is carried out by numerical method steady state specific yield s y std is an important parameter in groundwater simulation nachabe 2002 at the same time s y std has a clear analytical expression by calculating the first derivative of s y std with different parameters and analyzing its positive or negative the influences of different parameters on s y std can be understood analytically s y std eq 10 contains the following parameters the difference between saturated water content and residual water content θ s θ r the air entry pressure head ha the initial depth of water table b1 the depth of the water table upon the steady state b 2 and the pore size distribution index λ to facilitate the analysis these parameters are specified first for the water release process the depth of the water table at steady state should not be less than the initial depth of the water table so b 2 b 1 0 according to the brooks corey model brooks and corey 1964 if the depth of the water table b2 is less than the air entry pressure head ha when reaching the steady state the soil above the water table can be regarded as saturated but no drainage occurs or the specific yield is essentially zero on the other hand if the depth of the water table b2 is greater than the air entry pressure head ha at steady state condition drainage will occur above the water table and the specific yield is nonzero therefore we consider b 2 h a 0 in the following discussions 4 2 1 impact of θ s θ r on s y std the difference between the saturated water content and the residual water content θ s θ r denotes the maximum amount of water that can be released per unit volume of soil under gravity since s y std 0 and θ s θ r 0 in eq 10 thus s y std is a linear function of θ s θ r which is also reflected in the original concept of specific yield used by meinzer 1923 such a linear relationship reflects that a greater maximum amount of water released per unit volume of soil under gravity will lead to a greater value of s y std without considering the impact of other parameters 4 2 2 impact of the air entry pressure head ha on s y std to address the impact of the air entry pressure head ha one may obtain the partial derivative of s y std versus ha in eq 10 as 22 s y std h a θ s θ r λ h a λ 1 b 1 1 λ b 2 1 λ λ 1 b 1 b 2 based on eq 22 one can see that 23 if λ 1 s y std h a 0 if λ 1 lim λ 1 s y std h a θ s θ r ln h a b 1 ln h a b 2 b 1 b 2 0 if 0 λ 1 s y std h a 0 to obtain the second order partial derivative of s y std versus ha based on eq 22 one has 24 2 s y std h a 2 θ s θ r λ h a λ 2 b 1 1 λ b 2 1 λ b 1 b 2 one can see from eq 24 that 25 if λ 1 2 s y std h a 2 0 if λ 1 2 s y std h a 2 0 if 0 λ 1 2 s y std h a 2 0 eqs 23 and 25 show that s y std decreases with the increase of air entry pressure head ha but the rate of change is related to the pore size distribution index λ when the initial depth of the water table b1 and the depth of the water table at steady state b 2 remain unchanged increasing the air entry pressure head ha implies that the thickness of the water releasing soil decreases and the water retention capacity of soil increases so the amount of drainable water is reduced and s y std becomes smaller the impact of the pore size distribution index λ on the relationship between s y std and the air entry pressure head ha is as follows when λ 1 s y std tends to decrease continuously at decelerated rates with the increase of ha when λ 1 s y std tends to decrease at a constant rate with the increase of ha when λ 1 s y std tends to decrease at an accelerated rate with the increase of ha 4 2 3 impact of the initial depth of the water table b1 on s y std the impact of the initial depth of the water table b1 on s y std can be analyzed as follows the partial derivative of s y std versus b 1 is 26 s y std b 1 b 2 θ s θ r h a b 1 λ λ 1 b 2 b 1 2 b 1 b 2 λ b 1 b 2 λ λ 1 based on eq 26 one can see that 27 if λ 1 s y std b 1 0 if λ 1 s y std b 1 0 if λ 1 lim λ 1 s y std b 1 b 2 θ s θ r h a b 1 b 2 b 1 2 b 1 b 2 ln b 1 b 2 b 1 b 2 1 0 therefore when b 1 b 2 s y std is positively correlated with the initial depth of the water table b1 for the soil with the same lithology if the depths of the water table at the steady state b 2 are also the same the increase of the initial depth of the water table b1 imposes two impacts first it decreases the water content above the initial water table when the flow is under steady state condition second the increase of the initial depth of the water table means that the value of b 2 b 1 decreases from eqs 27 and 10 to ensure s y std is positively correlated with b 1 the second impact must be dominant 4 2 4 impact of the depth of the water table b2 on s y std when flow reaches the steady state the impacts of the depth of the water table b2 on s y std may be analyzed as follows from eq 10 one can obtain the partial derivative of s y std versus b 2 as 28 s y std b 2 b 1 θ s θ r h a b 2 λ λ 1 b 2 b 1 2 λ b 2 b 1 λ 1 b 2 b 1 λ based on eq 28 one can see that 29 if λ 1 s y std b 2 0 if λ 1 s y std b 2 0 if λ 1 lim λ 1 s y std b 2 b 1 θ s θ r h a b 2 b 2 b 1 2 b 2 b 1 ln b 2 b 1 b 2 b 1 1 0 s y std is positively correlated with the depth of the water table at the steady state b 2 for the soil with the same lithology if the initial depth of the water table b1 is also the same the increase of the depth of the water table at the steady state b 2 imposes two impacts first it increases the amount of water released when the flow is steady state and it enhances the fluctuation of the water table from eqs 29 and 10 to ensure s y std is positively correlated with b 2 the first impact must be dominant 4 2 5 impact of the pore size distribution index λ on s y std the impact of pore size distribution index λ on s y std is analyzed based on eq 10 one can obtain the partial derivative of partial derivative of s y std versus λ as 30 s y std λ θ s θ r h a b 2 b 1 h a b 1 λ 1 h a b 2 λ 1 1 λ 2 h a b 1 λ 1 ln h a b 1 h a b 2 λ 1 ln h a b 2 1 λ as mentioned above when h a b 2 s y std is positive therefore we will only address the case of h a b 2 in the following it seems difficult to directly interpret the relationship of s y std and λ from eq 30 alternatively such a relationship is demonstrated using a graphic method let d s y s y std λ b 2 b 1 θ s θ r h a because the relative values of ha b 1 and b 2 are different the relationship curves between d s y and λ show three different forms as demonstrated in fig 6 from fig 6 one can see that if h a b 1 the d s y λ relationship is exhibited in curve i which is characterized as d s y 0 for any λ when λ tends to positive infinity lim λ d s y 0 considering that b 2 b 1 θ s θ r h a 0 thus when h a b 1 is satisfied s y std λ 0 this relationship shows that when the air entry pressure head ha is not greater than the initial depth of water table b1 a soil with a more uniform pore size distribution means a larger s y std and a stronger water release capacity of the unsaturated zone under gravity if b 1 h a b 2 exp 1 b 2 b 1 b 2 b 1 ln h a b 1 the d s y λ relationship is shown in curve ii and λzero denotes the pore size distribution index when dsy 0 as follows 31 λ zero 1 1 b 1 b 2 λ zero 1 ln h a b 1 b 1 b 2 λ zero 1 ln h a b 2 that is to say when b 1 h a b 2 exp 1 b 2 b 1 b 2 b 1 ln h a b 1 if λ λ zero s y std λ 0 thus a more uniform pore size distribution will lead to a larger water release capacity of the unsaturated zone under gravity if λ λ zero s y std λ 0 then a more uniform pore size distribution will lead to a smaller s y std value and a smaller water release capacity of the unsaturated zone under gravity if h a b 2 exp 1 b 2 b 1 b 2 b 1 ln h a b 1 the d s y λ relationship is reflected in curve iii which suggests that d s y 0 for any λ 0 considering that b 2 b 1 θ s θ r h a 0 thus when eq h a b 2 exp 1 b 2 b 1 b 2 b 1 ln h a b 1 is satisfied s y std λ 0 this relationship shows that when the air entry pressure head ha is not greater than b 2 exp 1 b 2 b 1 b 2 b 1 ln h a b 1 the soil with a more uniform pore size distribution will lead to a smaller s y std and a smaller water release capacity of the unsaturated zone under gravity 4 3 limitations of the new specific yield equation despite the fact that the new specific yield equation proposed here is much general than the nachabe s solution which only works for an extremely shallow water table with a nearly saturated vadose zone there are still a number of issues and limitations associated with this investigation that should be addressed further researches are also needed to remove some of those limitations a few notable points are briefly elaborated as follows first this study is a strict 1d investigation that only considers vertical flow and vertical variation of the water table this implies that the lateral variation of the water table and two dimensional or three dimensional flow in the unsaturated zone are not considered when studying water table dynamics over field scale such multi dimensionality of the problem is inevitable and must be addressed in the future second aquifer heterogeneity is not considered here and should be explored in future investigations for instance vertical heterogeneity such as layering of soil should be taken into consideration in further investigation as this is commonly seen in the field other types of media heterogeneity may also be considered by using a stochastic approach to assess the statistical characteristics of the water table behavior if the statistical structure of the media heterogeneity can be quantified properly third the example used in this study concerns a falling water table the methodology can be applicable for a rising water table straightforwardly however if the water table experiences multiple times of rising and falling cycles one may need to pay more attention to the delineation of bottom boundary conditions to accurately describe the dynamic process of water migration in the soil above the water table fourth this paper does not consider the influence of recharge and rain events in which processes such as air compression air encapsulation below water table and hysteresis are relevant the consideration of air compression and air encapsulation may require a two phase flow type of approach which is out of scope of the present study but should be pursued in a future investigation the influence of hysteresis is usually nonnegligible and probably even dominates the whole hydrodynamics during cycles of wetting and drying thus is an important issue to explore in the future as well despite of various limitations outlined above this study expands the present concept of specific yield from a time independent parameter and time dependent dynamic term which forms an important foundation for further endeavor of gaining a better understanding of the unsaturated saturated flow process 5 conclusions in this paper an innovative analytical expression for the time dependent specific yield is proposed the new specific yield equation includes parameters such as the saturated water content residual water content pore characteristic parameter time initial depth of water table declined depth of water table and initial pressure head the parameters reflect the impacts of lithology depth of water table change of elevation of water table initial water content profile and other factors on the specific yield this new specific yield equation approaches its asymptotic steady state value which is the same as reported by nachabe 2002 for a shallow water table condition both advective and diffusive unsaturated flow processes are taken into consideration in this study which is in contrast to nachabe 2002 which ignores the diffusive flow in the unsaturated flow process the péclet number is used to quantify the relative contributions of advective versus diffusive unsaturated flow processes the péclet numbers are smaller than 2 for both soils in this study suggesting that the unsaturated flow is primarily diffusion dominated the evolution of specific yield can be divided into three stages including a rapid change stage at early time a smooth change stage at intermediate time and a steady stage at late time the model established can reveal the dynamic process of the variation of water content and water head in the unsaturated zone after the groundwater water table declines the sensitivity analysis of sy and factors affecting s y std are discussed in details in different stages the sensitivities of sy on different parameters vary quite distinctively in stage i sy is most sensitive to the water table depth b 2 followed by the initial water table depth b 1 at the early time of drainage in stage ii and iii sy is most sensitive to the saturated water content θ s followed by the residual water content θ r the impacts of multiple parameters on the steady state specific yield s y std are examined in details the value of θ s θ r reflects the maximum amount of water that can be drained per unit volume of soil under gravity a larger θ s θ r leads to a greater s y std the increase of the air entry pressure head ha implies the increase of water retention capacity of soil and the decrease of the thickness of water releasing soil layer which in turn reduces the amount of water released and consequently reduces s y std the increase of the initial depth of the water table b1 or the depth of the water table at the steady state b 2 will lead to the increase of s y std the pore size distribution index λ imposes the most complicated impact on s y std depended on the relative values of the air entry pressure head ha the initial depth of the water table b1 and the depth of the water table at the steady state b 2 s y std shows three difference trends of change when the pore size distribution index λ increases including a monotonous increase trend a monotonous decrease trend and a trend of initial increase followed by a subsequent decrease declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

table reaching a depth of b 2 when the impact of the water content on the specific yield and the hysteresis of the water content fluctuation are ignored within the range of z ha above the water table based on eq 13 the equation for the depth of the ha plane may be written as a1 z h a 2 3 λ k s λ θ s θ r t the thickness of the unsaturated zone above the ha plane at time t and the pressure head hb2 at water table b2 respectively are a2 b ha b 1 h a 2 3 λ k s λ θ s θ r t a3 h b 2 b 2 b 1 2 3 λ k s λ θ s θ r t where bha is the thickness of the unsaturated zone above the ha plane the time when the

water table is maintained at b 2 and the elevation of the water table remains constant implying that the elevation of the ha plane remains constant as well therefore when t t c one has a5 b ha b 2 h a

6004,specific yield is one of the most important hydrogeological parameters and is a key factor connecting flow processes in the unsaturated and saturated zones in this study an innovative expression for the dynamic or time dependent specific yield is proposed considering the coupled unsaturated saturated flow process the new specific yield equation includes parameters such as saturated water content residual water content pore characteristic parameter initial depth of water table time dependent depth of water table initial pressure head and time the involving parameters in this new specific yield equation reflect the impacts of lithology initial water table depth and other factors this new equation approaches an asymptotic steady state value which is the same as reported previously for a shallow water table condition both advective and diffusive unsaturated flow processes are taken into consideration which is in contrast to a previous study that ignored the diffusive

water table declines in an unconfined aquifer said et al 2005 song and chen 2010 it is one of the most important and controversy as well hydrogeological concepts for groundwater flow in unconfined aquifer systems bear 1972 istanbulluoglu et al 2012 varni et al 2013 machiwal and jha 2015 yue et al 2016 because of the complexity of flow in a variably saturated porous media debate on the concept of specific yield has been going on for a long time e g meinzer 1923 todd 1959 bear 1972 this is partially because the initial concept of specific yield proposed is ambiguous such as the concept of specific yield defined by meinzer 1923 and todd 1959 neither of the those takes into account the impact of the unsaturated zone hydrodynamics and hence the specific yield thus defined is a constant duke 1972 stephen et al 2006 the amount of water dischargeable in the water table aquifer should include the amount of water dischargeable in the fluctuation zone of the water table and the amount of water dischargeable in the unsaturated zone above the fluctuation zone childs 1960 in addition the water release process in the unsaturated zone is of obviously hysteretic nature akindunni and gillham 1992 nwankwor et al 1992 lee et al 2001 which suggests that the specific yield is a time dependent hydrogeological parameter and may even depends on the wetting and drying processes the evolution of the specific yield concept has developed with increasing understanding of the unsaturated saturated flow process and several formulas have been proposed to quantify the specific yield including the very first simple equation proposed by meinzer 1923 and subsequent improvement of the equation by duke 1972 nachabe 2002 and cheng et al 2015 the complexity of those formulas evolves from time independent ones to time dependent ones and from single factor equations to multi factor equations for example the specific yield formula used by meinzer 1923 is expressed as the difference between the water content of saturated volume and the water content of residual volume a major limitation of the specific yield equation of duke 1972 is that it is not suitable for rapid fluctuations of water table that may occur after a major recharge event nachabe 2002 the specific yield equation of nachabe 2002 includes multiple factors such as water content saturated permeability pore size distribution index air entry pressure head time and so on the generally accepted specific yield is defined as the volume of water released by gravity from the soil column per unit area extending to the ground surface from the water table when the water table declines by one unit of depth bear 1972 freeze and cherry 1979 and the mathematical expression for this definition is 1 s y v w al where sy is the specific yield vw is the volume of water drained or stored in soil when the water table elevation changes by l a is the horizontal area of the water table based on the specific yield concept outlined in eq 1 chen 1984 suggested that the factors associated with the specific yield for a homogeneous soil should include the following four aspects 1 lithology 2 hysteresis of the water content profile in the unsaturated zone 3 initial water table depth and 4 initial water content profile however because the volume of water drained or stored in soil when the water table elevation changes is usually unknown eq 1 is often inapplicable another problem associated with the specific yield equation of nachabe 2002 is that it ignores the diffusive flux term in the unsaturated zone completely thus it works only when water content in the unsaturated zone is approaching its saturated value a condition may be satisfied when the water table is extremely shallow and the saturation of the unsaturated zone is close to 1 0 when the water table is not sufficiently shallow and the water content profile in the unsaturated zone includes stages with various saturations the specific yield equation of nachabe 2002 may generate considerable errors as it substantially overestimates the drainage capacity above the water table the main purpose of this study is to derive an innovative expression for the time dependent specific yield considering factors such as lithology initial water profile of the unsaturated zone considering both advective and diffusive fluxes in the unsaturated zone this new specific yield equation offers an opportunity to understand the fundamental physics of the drainage process of water table in a variably saturated porous system such a new specific yield equation may also be used to replace the constant specific yield in present groundwater flow governing equations in unconfined aquifers in summary this work represents our persistent effort to resolve the long term debate on how to describe the dynamic water table properly by honoring the fundamental physical and hydrologic principles involved in the unsaturated saturated flow process 2 quantification of the transient specific yield 2 1 development of a time dependent specific yield equation for the purpose of illustration the media of concern is assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic and the water table rapidly declines from an initial depth b 1 to a new depth of b 2 the process of water table rise can be studied similarly following the same procedure the water release process by gravity can be summarized as the following two phases 1 a transient water table decline phase from depth of b 1 to b 2 and 2 a phase for water table remaining at b 2 and the seepage process gradually approaches its steady state as shown in fig 1 the origin of the z axis is at the initial water table position and positive z direction is upward the lateral variation of water table is assumed to be a secondary factor thus this study focuses on the one dimensional 1d vertical flow dynamics only in fig 1 i is the initial water content profile with water table depth at b 1 ii is the transient water content profile with water table depth at bt at time t iii is the transient water content profile with water table depth at b 2 iv is the steady state water content profile with water table at b 2 and the specific retention profile according to fig 1 when the water table declines to bt at a given time t the amount of water drained should be the sum of the amount of water drained from the unsaturated zone above the initial water table at b 1 and the amount of water drained when the saturated zone becomes unsaturated below the water table at b 1 and it is written as 2 v w t a 0 b t b 1 θ s θ zt d z b t b 1 b t θ zi θ zt d z where v w t is the total volume of water released at time t b t b 1 is the elevation change of the water table θ s is the saturated water content θ zi is the initial water content θ zt is the water content at time t according to eq 1 the specific yield can be computed as 3 s y t v w t a b t b 1 0 b t b 1 θ s θ zt d z b t b 1 b t θ zi θ zt d z b t b 1 where s y t is the specific yield at time t by means of the soil water characteristic curve model the specific yield equation with the water content as the variable may be converted into the specific yield equation with the negative pressure head suction as the variable to illustrate this the brooks corey model brooks and corey 1964 is adopted as an example 4 s e θ θ r θ s θ r h a h λ h h a 1 h h a where se is the effective saturation θ is the water content θ r is the residual water content h a is the air entry pressure head λ is the brooks corey model parameter called the pore size distribution index an important point to note is that although the residual water content is used in the above brooks corey model the range of water content variation due to the influence of gravity drainage is between saturation and field capacity or specific retention such a range is usually narrower than the range between saturation and residual water content unless the field capacity is very close to the residual water content which could be the case for very coarse and homogeneous soils this means that the variational range of magnitude of the pressure head h in above eq 4 is between ha and an upper bound that is determined by the field capacity rather than infinity which is corresponding to the residual water content another point to emphasis is that the field capacity is a parameter that depends on both the soil structure and the depth of water table as shown in fig 1 so it is usually not a constant for a given soil type since the water content in the range of h ha above the water table is constant eq 3 can be written as 5 s y t h a b ha b 1 2 h a θ s θ zt d z b ha b 1 2 h a b ha h a θ zi θ zt d z b ha h a b 1 where bha is the thickness of the unsaturated zone above the elevation z ha hereinafter referred to as the ha plane bha bt ha replacing the water content in eq 5 with the negative pressure head will lead to 6 s y t θ s θ r 1 h a b 1 h a h i λ d z h a b ha h a h a h t λ d z b ha h a b 1 where hi is the initial negative pressure head ht is the negative pressure head at time t using the trapezoidal rule for integrations in eq 6 one has 7 s y t θ s θ r 1 δ z 2 j

htk is the negative pressure head at the k th node at time t j k 1 2 under hydrostatic condition the negative pressure head is a linear function of depth lu and likos 2004 8 h z where h is the negative pressure head z is the depth to the water table from the ground surface for the water release by gravity with an initial hydrostatic condition the specific yield s y t can be written as 9 s y t θ s θ r 1 h a 1 λ h a b 1 λ 1 1 δ z 2 k 1 b ha δ z h a h tk λ h a h tk 1 λ b ha h a b 1 the above eq 9 for calculating the specific yield includes the following seven parameters 1 saturated water content 2 residual water content 3 pore characteristic parameter 4 initial depth of water table 5 time dependent depth of water table 6 initial pressure head and 7 time accordingly these parameters reflect the impacts of lithology initial water table depth and other factors when the drainage process lasts over a sufficiently long period of time the specific yield will approach its steady state value as 10 s y std v w std a b 2 b 1 θ s θ r 1 h a 1 λ h a b 1 λ 1 h a b 2 λ 1 b 2 b 1 where v w std is the total volume of water released under the steady state condition eq 10 is identical to the s y std equation of nachabe 2002 2 2 the dynamic process of water release from the unsaturated zone the negative pressure head should be known before one can use the specific yield equations given in eqs 6 7 or 9 in section 2 1 a fundamental improvement of this study over nachabe 2002 lies in the fact that this study takes into account the diffusive term of the unsaturated flow thus removes the constrain of a sufficiently shallow water table presumption in nachabe 2002 such an improvement makes the new specific yield equation of this study more general and robust for dealing with a wide range of water table depths specifically this study differs from nachabe 2002 in the following two aspects first the unsaturated flow equation ignoring the diffusive term is used to describe the water release process at the elevation z ha the ha plane above the water table second for the water release process from the unsaturated zone above the ha plane to the surface it is described by the unsaturated flow equation taking into account both advective and diffusive terms as mentioned previously the gravity driven water release process shown in fig 1 includes two phases in phase 1 the water release process can be described by the unsaturated flow equation ignoring the diffusive term as follows charbeneau 2000 11 θ t k θ z where k θ is the hydraulic conductivity of the unsaturated zone when the brooks corey model eq 4 is adopted as the soil water characteristic curve and the burdine model burdine 1953 brooks and corey 1964 brooks 1964 in the following eq 12 is adopted as the hydraulic conductivity function the relationship between the negative pressure h and the elevation z above the water table can be obtained in eq 13 12 k s e k s s e 2 3 λ λ 13 z ξ t 2 3 λ k s λ θ s θ r h a h 2 2 λ where ξ is the initial elevation corresponding to the new negative pressure head above the new water table and ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity since the effective saturation se 1 within the elevation z ha above the water table the impact of the water content on the specific yield may be ignored within that range therefore the amount of water released due to water content fluctuation of the unsaturated zone above the water table equals to the amount of water released from the unsaturated zone above the ha plane the elevation variation of the water table equals to that of the ha plane and the rate of decline in water table equals to that of the ha plane which is 2 3 λ k s λ θ s θ r derived by eq 13 in phase 1 the thickness of the unsaturated zone above the ha plane

the derivation of bha hb 2 and tc based on richards equation richards 1931 the mathematical model of the saturated unsaturated flow process above the water table b2 can be described as 16 z k h h z k

water head when the initial state is under hydrostatic condition one has 17 f z z eq 16c denotes the no flow condition at the surface eq 16d is the water table condition this mathematical model can be solved by commonly used software package such as hydrogeosphere therrien et al 2010 3 results the specific yields for two floridian soils a mulat fine sand and a mulat fine sandy loam are calculated using the newly developed solution and the result is compared with the solution of nachabe 2002 which is hereinafter called the nachabe s solution carlisle et al 1989 have tested the soil water characteristic curves of both soils and the physical parameters of the two soils are shown in table 1 the same types of soils were also used in nachabe 2002 fig 2 a and b show the pressure gradients in the mulat fine sand and the mulat fine sandy loam respectively from fig 2 we can easily find that the dynamic change of pressure gradients with depths at different time for these two soils are similar the initial state and the final steady state are both under hydrostatic condition thus the pressure gradient is constant equaling to 1 for these two end members in other states the pressure gradient decreases first and then increases with depths meanwhile the minimum pressure gradients for different pressure gradient profiles clearly decreases with time first and then increases with time afterward fig 3 a and b show the evolution of specific yield in the mulat fine sand and the mulat fine sandy loam respectively the dot dash line shows the nachabe s solution and the red solid line shows the solution of this study in the simulation the initial state is under hydrostatic condition and the water table declines from a depth of 100 cm to a depth of 120 cm the critical time of water table reaching the depth of b 2 tc is 0 49 hr for mulat fine sand and 1 25 hr for mulat fine sandy loam respectively as shown in fig 3 a and b the specific yield shows a nonlinear increase trend with time and eventually reaches an asymptotic steady state value specifically the s y std values of the mulat fine sand and the mulat fine sandy loam are 0 276 and 0 131 respectively a few points are notable first the solution of specific yield presented here is smaller than the nachabe s solution second it takes longer time to reach steady state based on the new solution for example it takes respectively about 701 h and 248 h for the mulat fine sand and the mulat fine sandy loam to reach steady state based on the nachabe s solution while such times become 2500 h and 1800 h respectively based on the new solution of this study the reason for this discrepancy is primarily because the nachabe s solution ignores the diffusive unsaturated flow completely while the solution presented here takes into account the diffusive unsaturated flow thus is a better representation of the dynamic process of unsaturated flow obviously the nachabe s solution is acceptable for advection dominated flow to quantify the relative contributions of advective versus diffusive unsaturated flow processes the péclet number is used and it is defined as the ratio between the advective flow rate and the diffusive flow rate as follows bear 1972 wang et al 2012 18 p e ul d where pe is the péclet number l is the characteristic length u is the local flow velocity d is the diffusion coefficient defined as d k h h θ if pe is less than 2 the unsaturated flow process is generally considered as diffusion dominated otherwise it is regarded as advection dominated ward 1964 suggested that l k in porous media where k is the intrinsic permeability of the media and k k s μ γ where μ is coefficient of viscosity and γ is gravity density based on the brooks corey model and the burdine model when h ha eq 18 becomes 19 p e 2 3 λ h k from eq 19 the péclet number decreases with the increase of h using table 1 eq 19 and γ 9 777 10 5 n cm3 and μ 2 472 10 11 nhr cm2 at 25 c guo et al 1994 one has pe 2 0 10 5 for the mulat fine sand above the ha plane and pe 6 2 10 6 for the mulat fine sandy loam above the ha plane obviously the péclet numbers are several orders of magnitude smaller than 2 for both soils suggesting that the unsaturated flow are primarily diffusion dominated which invalidates the presumption for the use of the nachabe s solution it is easily found that sy is time dependent in fig 3 to identify the dynamic feature of sy the normalized specific yield s y s y std as a function of the normalized time t t std is shown in fig 4 one can see that the normalized specific yield increases with the normalized time and the rate of change decreases with the normalized time the normalized change rate of specific yield is approximated by a finite difference form shown as eq 20 20 n s y d s y s y std d t t std t std s y std s y t i 1 s y t i t i 1 t i where n s y is the normalized change rate of specific yield tstd is the time of specific yield reaching steady state s y t i 1 and s y t i are the specific yield at time ti 1 and ti respectively in actual computation one may choose tstd as the time for the specific yield to be 99 or 99 9 of its steady state value it should be noted that the exact choice of thresholds either 99 or 99 9 for approximating the steady state condition is arbitrary but such different thresholds will not affect the final conclusion as long as the thresholds are very close to 1 0 the process of the time dependent specific yield can be divided into three stages namely a rapid change stage at early time a smooth change stage at intermediate time and a steady stage at late time with n s y 1 1 n s y 0 01 and n s y 0 01 respectively for the mulat fine sand the normalized time and actual time are respectively 0 066 and 165 h when n s y 1 and they are respectively 0 48 and 1200 h when n s y 0 0 1 shown as figs 3 a and 4 a for the mulat fine sandy loam they are respectively 0 094 and 170 h when n s y 1 and are respectively 0 472 and 850 h when n s y 0 0 1 shown as figs 3 b and 4 b at different stages the normalized change rate of specific yield is significantly difference from each other and the sensitivity of sy on the controlling parameters are significantly difference from each other as well which will be discussed in section 4 a sensitivity analysis of the transient specific yield is documented in the following section 4 besides the transient specific yield the steady state specific yield s y std is probably more easy to use from a practical point of view because of its independence of time and closed form expression therefore a detailed analysis on the influence of multiple involved parameters in s y std is documented in the following section 4 as well to carry out this analysis we will adopt a so called derivative analysis method which concerns the first derivative of s y std with different parameters by inspecting such first derivatives one can identify a number of variational trends of s y std with multiple variables involved if necessary one can also invoke second order derivative or even higher order derivatives to gain further insights on the parameter of concern 4 discussions of limitations of the new specific yield equation 4 1 sensitivity analysis to estimate the impacts of parameters in eqs 9 and 14 on sy a sensitivity analysis is conducted and the parameters of concern are θ s θ r h a λ b 1 b 2 and ks the normalized sensitivity is defined by kabala 2001 and approximated by a finite difference form huang and yeh 2007 li et al 2018 as 21 s i t p i o p i p i o p i δ p i o p i δ p i where s i t is the normalized sensitivity of the i th input parameter at time t o is the output function of the system and pi is the i th input parameter of the system δpi denotes small increments which is usually chosen as10 3 pi the mulat fine sandy loam and the physical model are used to conduct sensitivity analysis fig 5 shows the sensitivity analysis of sy with respect to each of seven parameters θ s θ r h a λ b 1 b 2 and ks from fig 5 it is easy to find that θ s λ and b 1 have positive impacts on sy θ r and ha have negative impacts on sy in all stages ks has positive impact on sy in stage i and stage ii and hardly has any impact on sy in stage iii b 2 has negative impact on sy in stage i has negative impact first then positive impact later on sy in stage ii and has positive impact on sy in stage iii the saturated water content θ s controls the amount of gravitational water in unit volume of soil the residual moisture content θ r represents the moisture beyond the capillary influence bear et al 2011 an increasing θ s and or a decreasing θ r trend means that the amount of gravitational water discharge increases thus θ s imposes positive impacts on sy while θ r has negative impacts on sy the λ parameter reflects the impact of pore size distribution of soil on the soil water characteristic curve a larger λ value implies a more uniform pore size distribution in the soil xie 2015 which benefits the gravitational water discharge however the influence of λ on sy is not always positive which will be discussed in section 4 2 the influence of initial depth of water table b1 on sy has different mechanisms in different stages when time t is shorter than the time required for water table reaching a depth of b 2 namely tc in stage i increasing the b 1 value causes the total drainable water in soil above the initial water table to increase as well and the difference between the initial water table depth and water table depth at time t is almost the same under different b 1 conditions when t is longer than tc however increasing b 1 means that the value of fluctuation of the water table b 2 b 1 decreases although increasing b 1 causes the total drainable water in soil above water table b2 to decrease such an impact on sy is not enough to offset the impact caused by the decreasing b 2 b 1 on sy thus sy increases when b 1 decreases the air entry pressure ha is defined as the matrix suction when the air begins to enter the largest pore of soil and it is a parameter reflecting the water retention capacity of soil fredlund and xing 1994 ha also controls the thickness of the water releasing soil as known from eq 14 the increase of ha implies that the water retention capacity of soil increases so the drainable water is reduced and s y becomes smaller the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks reflects the capability of soil to conduct flow thus a larger ks means more drainable water in stages i and ii however when the seepage tends to steady state condition the total drainable water appears to be unrelated to ks thus ks has positive impact on sy in stage i and stage ii and hardly has any impact on sy in stage iii increasing the depth of water table b2 causes the total drainable water and the fluctuation of water table b 2 b 1 to increase however in the early stage the influence of increased drainable water on sy is not enough to offset the influence of b 2 b 1 on sy thus b 2 has negative impact on sy during early stage beyond the early stage of drainage the accumulated drainable water increases and its positive impact on sy gradually surpasses the negative impact of b 2 b 1 on sy thus b 2 eventually has positive impact on sy at late stage it is evident from above analysis that sensitivity of sy varies with parameters in different stages in stage i early time sy is most sensitive to the water table depth b 2 followed by the initial water table depth b 1 in stage ii intermediate time sy is most sensitive to the saturated water content θ s followed by the residual moisture content θ r in stage iii late time sy is most sensitive to the saturated water content θ s followed by θ r h a λ b 1 and b 2 sy is least sensitive to ks in stage iii 4 2 factors affecting s y std in section 4 1 the sensitivity analysis of transient state of specific yield is carried out by numerical method steady state specific yield s y std is an important parameter in groundwater simulation nachabe 2002 at the same time s y std has a clear analytical expression by calculating the first derivative of s y std with different parameters and analyzing its positive or negative the influences of different parameters on s y std can be understood analytically s y std eq 10 contains the following parameters the difference between saturated water content and residual water content θ s θ r the air entry pressure head ha the initial depth of water table b1 the depth of the water table upon the steady state b 2 and the pore size distribution index λ to facilitate the analysis these parameters are specified first for the water release process the depth of the water table at steady state should not be less than the initial depth of the water table so b 2 b 1 0 according to the brooks corey model brooks and corey 1964 if the depth of the water table b2 is less than the air entry pressure head ha when reaching the steady state the soil above the water table can be regarded as saturated but no drainage occurs or the specific yield is essentially zero on the other hand if the depth of the water table b2 is greater than the air entry pressure head ha at steady state condition drainage will occur above the water table and the specific yield is nonzero therefore we consider b 2 h a 0 in the following discussions 4 2 1 impact of θ s θ r on s y std the difference between the saturated water content and the residual water content θ s θ r denotes the maximum amount of water that can be released per unit volume of soil under gravity since s y std 0 and θ s θ r 0 in eq 10 thus s y std is a linear function of θ s θ r which is also reflected in the original concept of specific yield used by meinzer 1923 such a linear relationship reflects that a greater maximum amount of water released per unit volume of soil under gravity will lead to a greater value of s y std without considering the impact of other parameters 4 2 2 impact of the air entry pressure head ha on s y std to address the impact of the air entry pressure head ha one may obtain the partial derivative of s y std versus ha in eq 10 as 22 s y std h a θ s θ r λ h a λ 1 b 1 1 λ b 2 1 λ λ 1 b 1 b 2 based on eq 22 one can see that 23 if λ 1 s y std h a 0 if λ 1 lim λ 1 s y std h a θ s θ r ln h a b 1 ln h a b 2 b 1 b 2 0 if 0 λ 1 s y std h a 0 to obtain the second order partial derivative of s y std versus ha based on eq 22 one has 24 2 s y std h a 2 θ s θ r λ h a λ 2 b 1 1 λ b 2 1 λ b 1 b 2 one can see from eq 24 that 25 if λ 1 2 s y std h a 2 0 if λ 1 2 s y std h a 2 0 if 0 λ 1 2 s y std h a 2 0 eqs 23 and 25 show that s y std decreases with the increase of air entry pressure head ha but the rate of change is related to the pore size distribution index λ when the initial depth of the water table b1 and the depth of the water table at steady state b 2 remain unchanged increasing the air entry pressure head ha implies that the thickness of the water releasing soil decreases and the water retention capacity of soil increases so the amount of drainable water is reduced and s y std becomes smaller the impact of the pore size distribution index λ on the relationship between s y std and the air entry pressure head ha is as follows when λ 1 s y std tends to decrease continuously at decelerated rates with the increase of ha when λ 1 s y std tends to decrease at a constant rate with the increase of ha when λ 1 s y std tends to decrease at an accelerated rate with the increase of ha 4 2 3 impact of the initial depth of the water table b1 on s y std the impact of the initial depth of the water table b1 on s y std can be analyzed as follows the partial derivative of s y std versus b 1 is 26 s y std b 1 b 2 θ s θ r h a b 1 λ λ 1 b 2 b 1 2 b 1 b 2 λ b 1 b 2 λ λ 1 based on eq 26 one can see that 27 if λ 1 s y std b 1 0 if λ 1 s y std b 1 0 if λ 1 lim λ 1 s y std b 1 b 2 θ s θ r h a b 1 b 2 b 1 2 b 1 b 2 ln b 1 b 2 b 1 b 2 1 0 therefore when b 1 b 2 s y std is positively correlated with the initial depth of the water table b1 for the soil with the same lithology if the depths of the water table at the steady state b 2 are also the same the increase of the initial depth of the water table b1 imposes two impacts first it decreases the water content above the initial water table when the flow is under steady state condition second the increase of the initial depth of the water table means that the value of b 2 b 1 decreases from eqs 27 and 10 to ensure s y std is positively correlated with b 1 the second impact must be dominant 4 2 4 impact of the depth of the water table b2 on s y std when flow reaches the steady state the impacts of the depth of the water table b2 on s y std may be analyzed as follows from eq 10 one can obtain the partial derivative of s y std versus b 2 as 28 s y std b 2 b 1 θ s θ r h a b 2 λ λ 1 b 2 b 1 2 λ b 2 b 1 λ 1 b 2 b 1 λ based on eq 28 one can see that 29 if λ 1 s y std b 2 0 if λ 1 s y std b 2 0 if λ 1 lim λ 1 s y std b 2 b 1 θ s θ r h a b 2 b 2 b 1 2 b 2 b 1 ln b 2 b 1 b 2 b 1 1 0 s y std is positively correlated with the depth of the water table at the steady state b 2 for the soil with the same lithology if the initial depth of the water table b1 is also the same the increase of the depth of the water table at the steady state b 2 imposes two impacts first it increases the amount of water released when the flow is steady state and it enhances the fluctuation of the water table from eqs 29 and 10 to ensure s y std is positively correlated with b 2 the first impact must be dominant 4 2 5 impact of the pore size distribution index λ on s y std the impact of pore size distribution index λ on s y std is analyzed based on eq 10 one can obtain the partial derivative of partial derivative of s y std versus λ as 30 s y std λ θ s θ r h a b 2 b 1 h a b 1 λ 1 h a b 2 λ 1 1 λ 2 h a b 1 λ 1 ln h a b 1 h a b 2 λ 1 ln h a b 2 1 λ as mentioned above when h a b 2 s y std is positive therefore we will only address the case of h a b 2 in the following it seems difficult to directly interpret the relationship of s y std and λ from eq 30 alternatively such a relationship is demonstrated using a graphic method let d s y s y std λ b 2 b 1 θ s θ r h a because the relative values of ha b 1 and b 2 are different the relationship curves between d s y and λ show three different forms as demonstrated in fig 6 from fig 6 one can see that if h a b 1 the d s y λ relationship is exhibited in curve i which is characterized as d s y 0 for any λ when λ tends to positive infinity lim λ d s y 0 considering that b 2 b 1 θ s θ r h a 0 thus when h a b 1 is satisfied s y std λ 0 this relationship shows that when the air entry pressure head ha is not greater than the initial depth of water table b1 a soil with a more uniform pore size distribution means a larger s y std and a stronger water release capacity of the unsaturated zone under gravity if b 1 h a b 2 exp 1 b 2 b 1 b 2 b 1 ln h a b 1 the d s y λ relationship is shown in curve ii and λzero denotes the pore size distribution index when dsy 0 as follows 31 λ zero 1 1 b 1 b 2 λ zero 1 ln h a b 1 b 1 b 2 λ zero 1 ln h a b 2 that is to say when b 1 h a b 2 exp 1 b 2 b 1 b 2 b 1 ln h a b 1 if λ λ zero s y std λ 0 thus a more uniform pore size distribution will lead to a larger water release capacity of the unsaturated zone under gravity if λ λ zero s y std λ 0 then a more uniform pore size distribution will lead to a smaller s y std value and a smaller water release capacity of the unsaturated zone under gravity if h a b 2 exp 1 b 2 b 1 b 2 b 1 ln h a b 1 the d s y λ relationship is reflected in curve iii which suggests that d s y 0 for any λ 0 considering that b 2 b 1 θ s θ r h a 0 thus when eq h a b 2 exp 1 b 2 b 1 b 2 b 1 ln h a b 1 is satisfied s y std λ 0 this relationship shows that when the air entry pressure head ha is not greater than b 2 exp 1 b 2 b 1 b 2 b 1 ln h a b 1 the soil with a more uniform pore size distribution will lead to a smaller s y std and a smaller water release capacity of the unsaturated zone under gravity 4 3 limitations of the new specific yield equation despite the fact that the new specific yield equation proposed here is much general than the nachabe s solution which only works for an extremely shallow water table with a nearly saturated vadose zone there are still a number of issues and limitations associated with this investigation that should be addressed further researches are also needed to remove some of those limitations a few notable points are briefly elaborated as follows first this study is a strict 1d investigation that only considers vertical flow and vertical variation of the water table this implies that the lateral variation of the water table and two dimensional or three dimensional flow in the unsaturated zone are not considered when studying water table dynamics over field scale such multi dimensionality of the problem is inevitable and must be addressed in the future second aquifer heterogeneity is not considered here and should be explored in future investigations for instance vertical heterogeneity such as layering of soil should be taken into consideration in further investigation as this is commonly seen in the field other types of media heterogeneity may also be considered by using a stochastic approach to assess the statistical characteristics of the water table behavior if the statistical structure of the media heterogeneity can be quantified properly third the example used in this study concerns a falling water table the methodology can be applicable for a rising water table straightforwardly however if the water table experiences multiple times of rising and falling cycles one may need to pay more attention to the delineation of bottom boundary conditions to accurately describe the dynamic process of water migration in the soil above the water table fourth this paper does not consider the influence of recharge and rain events in which processes such as air compression air encapsulation below water table and hysteresis are relevant the consideration of air compression and air encapsulation may require a two phase flow type of approach which is out of scope of the present study but should be pursued in a future investigation the influence of hysteresis is usually nonnegligible and probably even dominates the whole hydrodynamics during cycles of wetting and drying thus is an important issue to explore in the future as well despite of various limitations outlined above this study expands the present concept of specific yield from a time independent parameter and time dependent dynamic term which forms an important foundation for further endeavor of gaining a better understanding of the unsaturated saturated flow process 5 conclusions in this paper an innovative analytical expression for the time dependent specific yield is proposed the new specific yield equation includes parameters such as the saturated water content residual water content pore characteristic parameter time initial depth of water table declined depth of water table and initial pressure head the parameters reflect the impacts of lithology depth of water table change of elevation of water table initial water content profile and other factors on the specific yield this new specific yield equation approaches its asymptotic steady state value which is the same as reported by nachabe 2002 for a shallow water table condition both advective and diffusive unsaturated flow processes are taken into consideration in this study which is in contrast to nachabe 2002 which ignores the diffusive flow in the unsaturated flow process the péclet number is used to quantify the relative contributions of advective versus diffusive unsaturated flow processes the péclet numbers are smaller than 2 for both soils in this study suggesting that the unsaturated flow is primarily diffusion dominated the evolution of specific yield can be divided into three stages including a rapid change stage at early time a smooth change stage at intermediate time and a steady stage at late time the model established can reveal the dynamic process of the variation of water content and water head in the unsaturated zone after the groundwater water table declines the sensitivity analysis of sy and factors affecting s y std are discussed in details in different stages the sensitivities of sy on different parameters vary quite distinctively in stage i sy is most sensitive to the water table depth b 2 followed by the initial water table depth b 1 at the early time of drainage in stage ii and iii sy is most sensitive to the saturated water content θ s followed by the residual water content θ r the impacts of multiple parameters on the steady state specific yield s y std are examined in details the value of θ s θ r reflects the maximum amount of water that can be drained per unit volume of soil under gravity a larger θ s θ r leads to a greater s y std the increase of the air entry pressure head ha implies the increase of water retention capacity of soil and the decrease of the thickness of water releasing soil layer which in turn reduces the amount of water released and consequently reduces s y std the increase of the initial depth of the water table b1 or the depth of the water table at the steady state b 2 will lead to the increase of s y std the pore size distribution index λ imposes the most complicated impact on s y std depended on the relative values of the air entry pressure head ha the initial depth of the water table b1 and the depth of the water table at the steady state b 2 s y std shows three difference trends of change when the pore size distribution index λ increases including a monotonous increase trend a monotonous decrease trend and a trend of initial increase followed by a subsequent decrease declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

also like to thank editors and two anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments which help improve the quality of this manuscript appendix a computation of tc the time required for the water table reaching a depth of b 2 when the impact of the water content on the specific yield and the hysteresis of the water content fluctuation are ignored within the range of z ha above the water table based on eq 13 the equation for the depth of the ha plane may be written as a1 z h a 2 3 λ k s λ θ s θ r t the thickness of the unsaturated zone above the ha plane at time t and the pressure head hb2 at water table b2 respectively are a2 b ha b 1 h a 2 3 λ k s λ θ s θ r t a3 h b 2 b 2 b 1 2 3 λ k s λ θ s θ r t where bha is the thickness of the unsaturated zone above the ha plane the time when the
