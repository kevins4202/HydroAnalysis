movement of groundwater are controlled by the topography of the area the groundwater occurs under the unconfined condition at shallow depths and in semiconfined and confined conditions in deep aquifers average annual rainfall in the district is around 95 cm 82 of which is contributed by the indian summer monsoon between june and september 2 2 land use land cover about 88 of the area falls under agricultural land where the primary source of irrigation is private borewells tubewells the rest of the area is covered by settlements and water bodies most villages in the region have ponds

before collecting the groundwater samples handpumps and borewells were pumped for 5 min to get the representative water samples and minimize the possibilities of high fe or other elements concentration due to the reaction of water with iron pipes apha 2017 sharma et al 2022 the standard methods specified by the american public health association apha 2005 for the analysis of water samples were adopted during the chemical analyses measurement of parameters such as ph temperature ec and orp were carried out onsite using portable measuring kits of hach usa make hq40d handheld multimeter prior to use the instruments were calibrated with given buffer solutions of known ph 4 01 7 0 and 10 0 of merck and ec 1413 μs cm kcl in house solution and 1000 μs cm nacl solution of merck

accuracy of the results all the results are reported with an analytical precision of better than 5 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrochemical characteristics in all the water samples major ions are present in the sequence of ca2 na mg2 k nh4 among cations and hco3 so4 2 cl no3 2 no2 among anions the major ion concentration is dominated by the ca mg hco3 type of hydrochemical facies fig 2 indicating the dissolution of calcic minerals gibbs 1970 suggested that the major processes responsible for the ionic abundance in the water are precipitation rock dominance and evaporation the gibbs plot for the present study suggests that rock weathering is the predominant process contributing to the ionic abundance in groundwater fig 3 a and b in the scatter plot fig 4 a the dominance of hco3 so4 over ca mg indicates the dissolution of silicate rocks the samples lying close to 1 1 line indicate the pervasiveness of mineral dissolution which is supported by the presence of alkaline water and lower ionic ratios 1 of hco3 hco3 so4 which accelerates the dissolution of silicate rocks and minerals ratios of hco3 hco3 so4 ranging from 0 44 to 0 98 in pre monsoon 0 54 0 97 in post monsoon indicate that the rock weathering is predominantly accelerated by the carbonic acid formed by the reaction of soil co2 pco2 and h2o pandey et al 2001 further in na cl plots fig 4b all the samples fall along 1 1 line with a dominance of na also signify dissolution of silicate rocks and minerals 4 2 physicochemical parameters related to orp the measured data for the physical parameters major ions and trace metals the water samples is given in table 2 a b all the water samples are alkaline in nature from pre monsoon july season with ph varying from 7 1 to 8 3 and mildly acidic to alkaline in post monsoon september with ph ranging from 6 5 to 7 3 lower ph values below and close to 7 0 in post monsoon are present only in shallow handpumps with depth up to100 ft and in stagnant water present in the paddy field table 1b further orp shows a wide range of variation i e 361 7 to 236 7 mv and 323 to 149 9 mv in pre and post monsoon seasons respectively during the sampling seasons low and negative orp values are observed in all the handpumps depth 100 ft village pond and in few tubewells depth 225 ft located in sugarcane fields and village houses the presence of organic and inorganic nitrogen compounds in groundwater of agricultural regions is common sackaria and elango 2020 the primary sources of nitrogen compounds in groundwater includes human animal wastes infiltration of waste water and application of fertilizers in the agricultural fields in the study area no3 concentration varies from 0 06 to 10 6 mg l and 0 16 11 3 mg l in pre and post monsoon respectively with an average of 1 3 mg l and 2 04 mg l table 2 though the study area is dominated by agricultural activities and use of fertilizers is common no3 concentration in groundwater samples is low 1 mg l except from two tubewells located in sugarcane fields and from the pond but is still below the permissible limit of bis i e 45 mg l for drinking water similarly no2 concentration is also low ammonium nh4 occurs naturally in groundwater as a result of anaerobic degradation of organic matter and anthropogenically through leakage of manure and fertilizers from agricultural fields and human waste in the present study its concentration ranged from 0 2 to 25 5 mg l in pre monsoon and 0 2 21 8 mg l in post monsoon high concentration of nh4 above permissible limit of bis 2012 i e 0 5 mg l was observed in 50 and 46 of the samples in pre and post monsoon table 1 fig 5 a out of which 35 and 31 of pre and post monsoon samples are surface water and shallow groundwater samples the presence of high nh4 concentration mainly in pond water and handpumps symbolizes the contamination of surface water body and shallow groundwater through anthropogenic sources viz infiltration of domestic wastes fertilizers decomposition of organic matter etc also the presence of low no3 in water and that of nh4 above the permissible limit indicates the occurrence of nitrate reduction process in the study area which is supported by the presence of reducing environment sulphate in groundwater may be present on account of mineral dissolution atmospheric deposition and various other anthropogenic sources like fertilizer mining etc in nathuri village concentration of so4 2 in the water samples varies from 8 1 to 487 98 mg l average of 95 5 mg l and 3 6 389 1 mg l average of 94 4 mg l in pre and post monsoon respectively elevated so4 2 concentrations are confined only to shallow aquifers handpump samples two samples from handpumps located near the village pond have exceeded the desirable limit of bis i e 200 mg l fig 5b thus higher concentration of both nh4 and so4 2 in samples collected from structures located near the pond and agricultural fields is attributed to the contamination of shallow aquifers due to infiltration of accumulated human and animal waste in pond and contamination through dissolution of fertilizers urea in the paddy and sugarcane fields the dissolved oxygen do was measured for post monsoon season samples which varies from 1 3 to 3 49 mg l in tubewells 1 03 1 16 mg l in handpumps and 0 14 mg l in pond water lower do values signify the presence of pollutants and higher organic content in surface pond and shallow groundwater handpumps which is deteriorating the quality of water 4 3 trace metals and their sources in water the results indicates that all the metals were present in insignificant concentration and are below the bis permissible limit except for fe and mn the presence of fe and mn concentrations above the who guidelines in drinking water were reported in other regions also massmann et al 2007 farnsworth et al 2012 the desirable limit of fe in drinking water is 0 3 mg l bis 2012 in the current study its concentration varies from 0 1 to 33 5 mg l samples taken from handpumps depth 100 ft and pond water show higher values of fe with concentration varying from 0 9 to 33 5 mg l the samples collected from handpumps constituting 30 of the total samples collected during post monsoon exceeded the permissible limit of bis 1991 i e 1 mg l in absence of alternative source the permissible limit for fe is 1 0 mg l bis 2012 in addition yellow color stains near handpumps and foul smell is observed in samples from handpumps which indicates that the shallow aquifer in the area is affected by fe bacteria and thus the water is unsuitable for drinking purposes in tubewells tapping water from deeper depths depth 150 350 ft fe concentration varies from 0 1 to 0 46 mg l which is under permissible limit the higher fe concentration in the shallow aquifers is due to the ongoing geochemical processes and microbiological activities mn concentration did not show much variation during the two sampling seasons and ranged from 0 01 to 1 4 mg l and 0 04 1 3 mg l in pre and post monsoon seasons respectively with reference to the permissible limit 0 3 mg l stipulated by bis 1991 a high concentration of mn has been observed in 57 and 54 of the samples during pre and post monsoon fig 5c table 1 out of these samples 21 and 23 of samples in pre and post monsoon season respectively are from handpumps the majority of these samples also have fe concentrations above the desirable limit of 0 3 mg l the release of fe and mn in water is significantly influenced by the redox conditions jahagir 2012 reducive dissolution of fe iii oxyhydroxides in the younger sediments mainly holocene is the major cause of fe mobilization in aqueous medium bhattacharya et al 1997 von brömssen et al 2008 mn does not occur in its elemental form but is ubiquitously present in the earth crust in rock forming minerals such as manganite pyrolusite rhodochrosite sugilite purpurite and rhodonite weathering of these minerals under oxidizing conditions releases mn iii iv species which precipitates in the form of hydrous manganese oxides bundschuh et al 2017 ramachandran et al 2021 the influx of oxygenated water prevents dissolution of these ions and thus generally results in lower ionic concentration who 1996 however reducing environments with lower dissolved oxygen do and ph values accelerate the dissolution of mn in water mn ii which is the predominant species gets mobilized in aqueous media under reducing conditions bundschuh et al 2016 several authors have reported high concentration of mn ii in groundwater under a reducing environment with low oxidation reduction potential orp and dissolved oxygen thomas et al 1994 de joode et al 2016 hamer et al 2020 in addition weathering of mn ii oxyhroxides form mn iii iv oxides under oxidizing environments and these secondary oxides can consequently dissolve reductively under suboxic anoxic conditions ramachandran et al 2021 the decomposition of organic matter at varying depths results in the stratification of redox zones in the aquifers christensen et al 2000 appelo and postma 2005 which aids the dissolution of mn and fe rich minerals the presence of mn in suspended and bed sediments of the yamuna river has been reported by chakrapani and subramanian 1996 and dalai et al 2004 they have reported elevated mn concentrations mainly in residual forms of authigenic origin followed by their organic origin in the present study high mn concentration is mainly associated with the sampling sites having reducing redox potential in shallow handpumps 100 ft depth and few tubewells with depths up to 200 ft fig 6 similarly high concentrations of fe and mn are evident in shallow aquifers of matlab upazila bangladesh under reducing conditions van bromssen et al 2008 in addition the application of mn rich fungicides in the agricultural fields also serves as a potential metal source in the surrounding environment mora et al 2015 since the study area lies in an agricultural belt of saharanpur district with paddy and sugarcane as major crops grown by the villagers the large scale use of fertilizers and fungicides in the cultivated fields is common sakhuja and sharma 2016 the use of dithiocarbamate fungicide namely mancozeb complex with combination of mn and zinc in agricultural fields was confirmed by the villagers during sampling therefore apart from its reported geogenic origin chakrapani and subramanian 1996 dalai et al 2004 in the yamuna basin high mn concentration in groundwater may also have resulted due to the leaching of fungicides used in agricultural fields in the region bivariate plot of fe and mn shows a moderate relationship r2 0 67 and 0 56 in pre and post monsoon respectively implying the occurrence of heterogeneous geochemical processes i e different mineralogical composition and differential rate of mineral dissolution in the aquifers fig 7 a and b and influence of anthropogenic sources viz leaching of fertilizers and fungicides in general the concentration of fe is higher than mn postawa et al 2013 rusydi et al 2021 however concentration of mn higher than fe is also observed in a few tubewells which confirms an uneven distribution of fe and mn in minerals and the occurrence of heterogeneous weathering processes in the nathuri village 4 4 correlation among major ions and trace metals significant positive correlation among fe mn so4 and cl in the sampling months suggests similar source of their origin table 3 this also implies that fe and mn in the study area may occur as sulfides chlorides eqs 1 and 2 the concentration of mn and fe may also vary with orp for a given redox potential mn could be reduced while fe remains oxidized rusydi et al 2021 a negative correlation of orp with fe and mn indicates that the reducing environment is augmenting the release of fe and mn in water primarily from sediments followed by the leaching of fungicides fertilizers this is further substantiated by the high ionic concentrations of fe and mn at the sampling sites having low to negative orp in shallow handpumps with depths up to 100 ft fig 6 1a fe mns h2so4 fe mnso4 h2s 2a mns h mn2 hs 4 5 water quality index wqi considering the bis 1991 and who 2004a b standards the water quality index of nathuri village was computed to evaluate the overall water quality for drinking purposes using the following procedure 1 a weight wi is allocated to each parameter keeping in view its importance and influence on groundwater quality the highest weight 5 has been allocated to mn owing to its high impact on human health the weights assigned to each parameter are given in table 4 a b 2 the relative weight wi is calculated using eq 1 1 w i w i i 1 n w i where wi relative weight wi weight of each parameter n total number of parameters 3 compute the quality rating scale qi as follows 2 q i c i s i 100 where qi quality rating ci concentration of each parameter in mg l si standard concentration for each parameter as given by bis 1991 4 si sub index for each parameter is calculated using eq 3 which is subsequently used to compute wqi using eq 4 as follows ramachandran et al 2021 3 s i i w i q i 4 w q i σ s i i where sii sub index of ith parameter qi rating based on the concentration of ith parameter 5 the values of wqi are further sub divided into five categories i e excellent low wqi good moderate poor and unsuitable high wqi table 5 the computed wqi for the study area varies greatly from excellent to unsuitable category water in both the seasons table 6 in pre monsoon season high wqi was found in 04 wells 02 nos of handpump and tubewells each which increased to 07 no of wells 54 in post monsoon season table 6 owing to the presence of high fe and mn content in shallow handpumps pond and few tubewells located in the sugarcane and rice fields the high wqi in post monsoon supports the observations that besides the low orp values in post monsoon season the agricultural activities use of excessive fertilizers and fungicides are also enhancing the concentration of fe and mn in the study area this is also confirmed by the presence of high fe and mn at the sampling sites with low to negative orp 4 6 societal relevance mn is a key micronutrient for living organisms including plants animals and humans however high intake of mn causes neurological disorders parkinsonism compulsive behaviors and delusions in humans beuter and edwards 1999 erikson et al 2005 guilarte 2010 bouchard et al 2011 prolonged intake of high mn is also associated with lung diseases indigestion low fetal birth weight and increased mortality rate of infant who 2004 hafeman et al 2007 zota et al 2009 the presence of high mn in water may also cause an increased bacterial growth non harmful to human health leading to development of slimy texture in the pipes the use of dithiocarbamate fungicide mancozeb which contains 16 of mn may have serious impact on human health water from the village pond which receives animal as well as human wastes is also used for irrigating the agricultural fields which can also affect the human health in long term several households in nathuri village and surrounding areas have abandoned shallow handpumps and are drawing water from deeper tubewells several effective methods for removing fe and mn from drinking water can be adopted such as reverse osmosis and distillation at the point of use aeration followed by filtration and frequent chlorination of water tanks in regions with elevated concentrations of mn in shallow aquifers drilling wells at deeper depths aquifers can also serve as an effective way to access good quality water intermediate and deep aquifers have high potential of having low mn contamination as evident in regions of bangladesh where shallow aquifers are contaminated hossain et al 2023 5 conclusions the present study assesses the quality of groundwater and surface water in the nathuri village located in saharanpur district of uttar pradesh india the area lies in the fertile alluvial plains of the upper yamuna basin groundwater is utilized by the farmers for irrigating the croplands another source of irrigation water is the village pond that stores rainwater and wastewater from domestic drains and is used to irrigate nearby agricultural fields the ionic composition of water is predominantly controlled by the rock weathering processes with ca mg hco3 type as the dominant hydrochemical facies dissolution of rocks is predominantly accelerated by the carbonic acid formed by the reaction of soil co2 pco2 and h2o among trace metals fe and mn concentration is high because of the dissolution of mn and fe containing minerals predominantly exaggerated by low to negative redox values since the study area lies in an agricultural belt the use of fertilizers and fungicides in the agricultural fields is common that plays an important role in enhancing the mn concentration in groundwater higher concentration of nh4 and so4 2 in samples collected from handpumps located near the pond and agricultural fields indicates the contamination of shallow aquifers due to anthropogenic sources viz leaching of domestic wastes fertilizers decomposition of organic matter etc the wqi of the region gets deteriorated from pre to post monsoon season because of the presence of high mn and fe since mn is a strong neurotoxin that affects neurological health and causes numerous other serious health issues water treatment prior to use for drinking is of utmost importance subsequently extensive and prolonged use of wastewater from ponds for irrigating the paddy and sugarcane fields can also adversely affect human health declaration of competing interest there is no conflict of interest with any person or

to reduce the ph to 2 0 and restrict organic growth total alkalinity and hco3 were determined by autotitrator of tarsons titertop 25 major ions such as chloride cl sulphate so4 2 nitrate no3 calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 potassium k sodium na and ammonium nh4 were analyzed through ion chromatograph metro ohm 930 compact ic flex prior to analysis the ion chromatograph was calibrated with merck standards trace metals concentration were measured using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes agilent 5110 precalibrated with merck multi element standards to maintain the accuracy of the results all the results are reported with an analytical precision of better than 5 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrochemical characteristics in all the water samples major ions are present in the sequence of ca2 na mg2 k nh4 among cations and hco3 so4 2 cl no3 2 no2 among anions the major ion concentration is dominated by the ca mg hco3 type of hydrochemical facies fig 2 indicating the dissolution of calcic minerals gibbs 1970 suggested that the major processes responsible for the ionic abundance in the water are precipitation rock dominance and evaporation the gibbs plot for the present study suggests that rock weathering is the predominant process contributing to the ionic abundance in groundwater fig 3 a and b in the scatter plot fig 4 a the dominance of hco3 so4 over ca mg indicates the dissolution of silicate rocks the samples lying close to 1 1 line indicate the pervasiveness of mineral dissolution which is supported by the presence of alkaline water and lower ionic ratios 1 of hco3 hco3 so4 which accelerates the dissolution of silicate rocks and minerals ratios of hco3 hco3 so4 ranging from 0 44 to 0 98 in pre monsoon 0 54 0 97 in post monsoon indicate that the rock weathering is predominantly accelerated by the carbonic acid formed by the reaction of soil co2 pco2 and h2o pandey et al 2001 further in na cl plots fig 4b all the samples fall along 1 1 line with a dominance of na also signify dissolution of silicate rocks and minerals 4 2 physicochemical parameters related to orp the measured data for the physical parameters major ions and trace metals the water samples is given in table 2 a b all the water samples are alkaline in nature from pre monsoon july season with ph varying from 7 1 to 8 3 and mildly acidic to alkaline in post monsoon september with ph ranging from 6 5 to 7 3 lower ph values below and close to 7 0 in post monsoon are present only in shallow handpumps with depth up to100 ft and in stagnant water present in the paddy field table 1b further orp shows a wide range of variation i e 361 7 to 236 7 mv and 323 to 149 9 mv in pre and post monsoon seasons respectively during the sampling seasons low and negative orp values are observed in all the handpumps depth 100 ft village pond and in few tubewells depth 225 ft located in sugarcane fields and village houses the presence of organic and inorganic nitrogen compounds in groundwater of agricultural regions is common sackaria and elango 2020 the primary sources of nitrogen compounds in groundwater includes human animal wastes infiltration of waste water and application of fertilizers in the agricultural fields in the study area no3 concentration varies from 0 06 to 10 6 mg l and 0 16 11 3 mg l in pre and post monsoon respectively with an average of 1 3 mg l and 2 04 mg l table 2 though the study area is dominated by agricultural activities and use of fertilizers is common no3 concentration in groundwater samples is low 1 mg l except from two tubewells located in sugarcane fields and from the pond but is still below the permissible limit of bis i e 45 mg l for drinking water similarly no2 concentration is also low ammonium nh4 occurs naturally in groundwater as a result of anaerobic degradation of organic matter and anthropogenically through leakage of manure and fertilizers from agricultural fields and human waste in the present study its concentration ranged from 0 2 to 25 5 mg l in pre monsoon and 0 2 21 8 mg l in post monsoon high concentration of nh4 above permissible limit of bis 2012 i e 0 5 mg l was observed in 50 and 46 of the samples in pre and post monsoon table 1 fig 5 a out of which 35 and 31 of pre and post monsoon samples are surface water and shallow groundwater samples the presence of high nh4 concentration mainly in pond water and handpumps symbolizes the contamination of surface water body and shallow groundwater through anthropogenic sources viz infiltration of domestic wastes fertilizers decomposition of organic matter etc also the presence of low no3 in water and that of nh4 above the permissible limit indicates the occurrence of nitrate reduction process in the study area which is supported by the presence of reducing environment sulphate in groundwater may be present on account of mineral dissolution atmospheric deposition and various other anthropogenic sources like fertilizer mining etc in nathuri village concentration of so4 2 in the water samples varies from 8 1 to 487 98 mg l average of 95 5 mg l and 3 6 389 1 mg l average of 94 4 mg l in pre and post monsoon respectively elevated so4 2 concentrations are confined only to shallow aquifers handpump samples two samples from handpumps located near the village pond have exceeded the desirable limit of bis i e 200 mg l fig 5b thus higher concentration of both nh4 and so4 2 in samples collected from structures located near the pond and agricultural fields is attributed to the contamination of shallow aquifers due to infiltration of accumulated human and animal waste in pond and contamination through dissolution of fertilizers urea in the paddy and sugarcane fields the dissolved oxygen do was measured for post monsoon season samples which varies from 1 3 to 3 49 mg l in tubewells 1 03 1 16 mg l in handpumps and 0 14 mg l in pond water lower do values signify the presence of pollutants and higher organic content in surface pond and shallow groundwater handpumps which is deteriorating the quality of water 4 3 trace metals and their sources in water the results indicates that all the metals were present in insignificant concentration and are below the bis permissible limit except for fe and mn the presence of fe and mn concentrations above the who guidelines in drinking water were reported in other regions also massmann et al 2007 farnsworth et al 2012 the desirable limit of fe in drinking water is 0 3 mg l bis 2012 in the current study its concentration varies from 0 1 to 33 5 mg l samples taken from handpumps depth 100 ft and pond water show higher values of fe with concentration varying from 0 9 to 33 5 mg l the samples collected from handpumps constituting 30 of the total samples collected during post monsoon exceeded the permissible limit of bis 1991 i e 1 mg l in absence of alternative source the permissible limit for fe is 1 0 mg l bis 2012 in addition yellow color stains near handpumps and foul smell is observed in samples from handpumps which indicates that the shallow aquifer in the area is affected by fe bacteria and thus the water is unsuitable for drinking purposes in tubewells tapping water from deeper depths depth 150 350 ft fe concentration varies from 0 1 to 0 46 mg l which is under permissible limit the higher fe concentration in the shallow aquifers is due to the ongoing geochemical processes and microbiological activities mn concentration did not show much variation during the two sampling seasons and ranged from 0 01 to 1 4 mg l and 0 04 1 3 mg l in pre and post monsoon seasons respectively with reference to the permissible limit 0 3 mg l stipulated by bis 1991 a high concentration of mn has been observed in 57 and 54 of the samples during pre and post monsoon fig 5c table 1 out of these samples 21 and 23 of samples in pre and post monsoon season respectively are from handpumps the majority of these samples also have fe concentrations above the desirable limit of 0 3 mg l the release of fe and mn in water is significantly influenced by the redox conditions jahagir 2012 reducive dissolution of fe iii oxyhydroxides in the younger sediments mainly holocene is the major cause of fe mobilization in aqueous medium bhattacharya et al 1997 von brömssen et al 2008 mn does not occur in its elemental form but is ubiquitously present in the earth crust in rock forming minerals such as manganite pyrolusite rhodochrosite sugilite purpurite and rhodonite weathering of these minerals under oxidizing conditions releases mn iii iv species which precipitates in the form of hydrous manganese oxides bundschuh et al 2017 ramachandran et al 2021 the influx of oxygenated water prevents dissolution of these ions and thus generally results in lower ionic concentration who 1996 however reducing environments with lower dissolved oxygen do and ph values accelerate the dissolution of mn in water mn ii which is the predominant species gets mobilized in aqueous media under reducing conditions bundschuh et al 2016 several authors have reported high concentration of mn ii in groundwater under a reducing environment with low oxidation reduction potential orp and dissolved oxygen thomas et al 1994 de joode et al 2016 hamer et al 2020 in addition weathering of mn ii oxyhroxides form mn iii iv oxides under oxidizing environments and these secondary oxides can consequently dissolve reductively under suboxic anoxic conditions ramachandran et al 2021 the decomposition of organic matter at varying depths results in the stratification of redox zones in the aquifers christensen et al 2000 appelo and postma 2005 which aids the dissolution of mn and fe rich minerals the presence of mn in suspended and bed sediments of the yamuna river has been reported by chakrapani and subramanian 1996 and dalai et al 2004 they have reported elevated mn concentrations mainly in residual forms of authigenic origin followed by their organic origin in the present study high mn concentration is mainly associated with the sampling sites having reducing redox potential in shallow handpumps 100 ft depth and few tubewells with depths up to 200 ft fig 6 similarly high concentrations of fe and mn are evident in shallow aquifers of matlab upazila bangladesh under reducing conditions van bromssen et al 2008 in addition the application of mn rich fungicides in the agricultural fields also serves as a potential metal source in the surrounding environment mora et al 2015 since the study area lies in an agricultural belt of saharanpur district with paddy and sugarcane as major crops grown by the villagers the large scale use of fertilizers and fungicides in the cultivated fields is common sakhuja and sharma 2016 the use of dithiocarbamate fungicide namely mancozeb complex with combination of mn and zinc in agricultural fields was confirmed by the villagers during sampling therefore apart from its reported geogenic origin chakrapani and subramanian 1996 dalai et al 2004 in the yamuna basin high mn concentration in groundwater may also have resulted due to the leaching of fungicides used in agricultural fields in the region bivariate plot of fe and mn shows a moderate relationship r2 0 67 and 0 56 in pre and post monsoon respectively implying the occurrence of heterogeneous geochemical processes i e different mineralogical composition and differential rate of mineral dissolution in the aquifers fig 7 a and b and influence of anthropogenic sources viz leaching of fertilizers and fungicides in general the concentration of fe is higher than mn postawa et al 2013 rusydi et al 2021 however concentration of mn higher than fe is also observed in a few tubewells which confirms an uneven distribution of fe and mn in minerals and the occurrence of heterogeneous weathering processes in the nathuri village 4 4 correlation among major ions and trace metals significant positive correlation among fe mn so4 and cl in the sampling months suggests similar source of their origin table 3 this also implies that fe and mn in the study area may occur as sulfides chlorides eqs 1 and 2 the concentration of mn and fe may also vary with orp for a given redox potential mn could be reduced while fe remains oxidized rusydi et al 2021 a negative correlation of orp with fe and mn indicates that the reducing environment is augmenting the release of fe and mn in water primarily from sediments followed by the leaching of fungicides fertilizers this is further substantiated by the high ionic concentrations of fe and mn at the sampling sites having low to negative orp in shallow handpumps with depths up to 100 ft fig 6 1a fe mns h2so4 fe mnso4 h2s 2a mns h mn2 hs 4 5 water quality index wqi considering the bis 1991 and who 2004a b standards the water quality index of nathuri village was computed to evaluate the overall water quality for drinking purposes using the following procedure 1 a weight wi is allocated to each parameter keeping in view its importance and influence on groundwater quality the highest weight 5 has been allocated to mn owing to its high impact on human health the weights assigned to each parameter are given in table 4 a b 2 the relative weight wi is calculated using eq 1 1 w i w i i 1 n w i where wi relative weight wi weight of each parameter n total number of parameters 3 compute the quality rating scale qi as follows 2 q i c i s i 100 where qi quality rating ci concentration of each parameter in mg l si standard concentration for each parameter as given by bis 1991 4 si sub index for each parameter is calculated using eq 3 which is subsequently used to compute wqi using eq 4 as follows ramachandran et al 2021 3 s i i w i q i 4 w q i σ s i i where sii sub index of ith parameter qi rating based on the concentration of ith parameter 5 the values of wqi are further sub divided into five categories i e excellent low wqi good moderate poor and unsuitable high wqi table 5 the computed wqi for the study area varies greatly from excellent to unsuitable category water in both the seasons table 6 in pre monsoon season high wqi was found in 04 wells 02 nos of handpump and tubewells each which increased to 07 no of wells 54 in post monsoon season table 6 owing to the presence of high fe and mn content in shallow handpumps pond and few tubewells located in the sugarcane and rice fields the high wqi in post monsoon supports the observations that besides the low orp values in post monsoon season the agricultural activities use of excessive fertilizers and fungicides are also enhancing the concentration of fe and mn in the study area this is also confirmed by the presence of high fe and mn at the sampling sites with low to negative orp 4 6 societal relevance mn is a key micronutrient for living organisms including plants animals and humans however high intake of mn causes neurological disorders parkinsonism compulsive behaviors and delusions in humans beuter and edwards 1999 erikson et al 2005 guilarte 2010 bouchard et al 2011 prolonged intake of high mn is also associated with lung diseases indigestion low fetal birth weight and increased mortality rate of infant who 2004 hafeman et al 2007 zota et al 2009 the presence of high mn in water may also cause an increased bacterial growth non harmful to human health leading to development of slimy texture in the pipes the use of dithiocarbamate fungicide mancozeb which contains 16 of mn may have serious impact on human health water from the village pond which receives animal as well as human wastes is also used for irrigating the agricultural fields which can also affect the human health in long term several households in nathuri village and surrounding areas have abandoned shallow handpumps and are drawing water from deeper tubewells several effective methods for removing fe and mn from drinking water can be adopted such as reverse osmosis and distillation at the point of use aeration followed by filtration and frequent chlorination of water tanks in regions with elevated concentrations of mn in shallow aquifers drilling wells at deeper depths aquifers can also serve as an effective way to access good quality water intermediate and deep aquifers have high potential of having low mn contamination as evident in regions of bangladesh where shallow aquifers are contaminated hossain et al 2023 5 conclusions the present study assesses the quality of groundwater and surface water in the nathuri village located in saharanpur district of uttar pradesh india the area lies in the fertile alluvial plains of the upper yamuna basin groundwater is utilized by the farmers for irrigating the croplands another source of irrigation water is the village pond that stores rainwater and wastewater from domestic drains and is used to irrigate nearby agricultural fields the ionic composition of water is predominantly controlled by the rock weathering processes with ca mg hco3 type as the dominant hydrochemical facies dissolution of rocks is predominantly accelerated by the carbonic acid formed by the reaction of soil co2 pco2 and h2o among trace metals fe and mn concentration is high because of the dissolution of mn and fe containing minerals predominantly exaggerated by low to negative redox values since the study area lies in an agricultural belt the use of fertilizers and fungicides in the agricultural fields is common that plays an important role in enhancing the mn concentration in groundwater higher concentration of nh4 and so4 2 in samples collected from handpumps located near the pond and agricultural fields indicates the contamination of shallow aquifers due to anthropogenic sources viz leaching of domestic wastes fertilizers decomposition of organic matter etc the wqi of the region gets deteriorated from pre to post monsoon season because of the presence of high mn and fe since mn is a strong neurotoxin that affects neurological health and causes numerous other serious health issues water treatment prior to use for drinking is of utmost importance subsequently extensive and prolonged use of wastewater from ponds for irrigating the paddy and sugarcane fields can also adversely affect human health declaration of competing interest there is no conflict of interest with any person or

11651,the coastal aquifers of lekki peninsula lagos are increasingly threatened by saline water invasion in this study the characterization of the petrophysical properties of the coastal aquifers in lekki peninsular through analysis of geophysical logs was carried out the methodology involved editing interpolation depth shifting and normalization of gamma ray and resistivity logs from twelve water wells log analysis was employed to map aquiferous units and determine their petrophysical properties which include clay volume porosity permeability water resistivity total dissolved solid and water quality these properties were further subjected to cross plot analysis the results identified three aquifers aquifer 1 is mostly unconfined shallow phreatic aquifer characterized by 11 35 porosity the tds ranges from of 4 63 mgl 1 50 33 mgl 1 the intermediate aquifer 2 is characterized by significant thickness 25 75 m clay volume 0 22 0 54 excellent porosity 16 27 permeability 99 110

analysis shows 67 of wells that penetrated aquifer 2 encountered saline to brackish water while 40 found aquitard with poor petrophysical properties water wells in the study area should target aquifer

logs petrophysical properties aquifer dahomey basin saline water data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the increased demand for groundwater resources occasioned by climate change has led to more targeted studies of aquifers properties asry et al 2012 because more countries are found to obtain significant volume of their public water supplies from groundwater e g 30 in uk 50 in usa and 99 in denmark tebbuth 1998 all over the world the fresh water coaster aquifers are rapidly becoming endangered by saline water invasion due to expansion in population and urbanization and its cconsequent heavy abstraction of groundwater resource tirkey et al 2017 pareeket et al 2006 the incursion of saline water into coastal freshwater aquifers of lekki peninsular is an unsettling phenomenon which makes extraction of freshwater in the district a herculean one where freshwater aquifers are eventually located the uncertainty associated with the petrophysical properties of such aquifers may also jeopardize water abstraction in such instance the situation has become so precarious that hardly can a well be drilled in this peninsula which will not run into saline water oladapo et al 2014 characterization of aquifers in this coastal region is particularly important because their invasion by saline water make them susceptible to periodic shifting of freshwater saline water boundary barlow 2003 thought these periodic shifts may be a result of variation in climate fluctuations in sea level and over abstraction of groundwater the combination of these factors necessitate migration of sea water toward water wells in hydraulic contact with the ocean thereby shifting saline water freshwater landward buckley 2000 buckley et al 2001 mapping of aquifer can be done by geophysical methods such as seismic electrical resistivity geophysical logging etc among these methods borehole logging provides a continuous in situ depth record of formation properties including groundwater saturation and lithological changes traditional electrical sounding is often ineffective due to space constraint and non discriminatory resistivity responses of clay and saline water bearing aquifers geophysical logging in contrast requires minimal space and the acquired logs provide information on the subsurface lithology water quality fluid types and petrophysical properties although geophysical logging is commonly employed in hydrocarbon exploration it has also found usage in groundwater investigation kwander 1986 venoff 1966 the reason being that the physical attributes of hydrocarbon reservoirs such as porosity and resistivities typically investigated in hydrocarbon exploration are equally properties of interest for aquifers during groundwater investigation examples of logs that are traditionally measured in wells are the natural gamma ngam and electrical resistivity er logs a multi parameter sonde is typically employed for the measurement of the natural gamma ngam and electrical resistivity er logs 64 in the subsurface these geophysical logs are important in determination of aquifer matrix and their saturating fluid contents with their degree of salinity keys 1997 hearst et al 2000 buckley 2000 geophysical log interpretations are based on the signature of log response to the rock matrix and fluid content keys 1997 hearst et al 2000 ngam log is sensitive to radioactive isotopes in rocks such as uranium thorium and potassium making it useful for lithologic discrimination er on the other hand measures resistance to the flow of current within formations and is generally influenced by chemistry of the saturating fluid pore geometry and matrix materials mares et al 1994 keys 1997 groundwater bearing aquifers produce lower resistivity than dry formation while aquiferous units hosting freshwater produce higher resistivity response than their saline water bearing equivalents the use of geophysical logging tools in groundwater exploration has been on the ascendancy for the past decades it has found applications in fresh saline water interface mapping akinlalu and afolabi 2018 obakhrrne 2022

recommended geophysical logging as a customary procedure that should be applied in every groundwater exploration based on the results of their study lekki peninsular has no functional scheme for supply of portable water therefore the inhabitants have resulted to indiscriminate abstraction of groundwater through borehole drillings despite this unwholesome practice the paucity of potable water remains unabated because many of the wells have witnessed saline water invasion from the atlantic ocean aladejana et al 2020 2021 this study therefore utilized pre existing geophysical logs to provide detailed study of lithostratigraphic sequence fresh saline water distribution aquifers petrophysical properties and the vulnerability of the aquifers to contamination this study is novel in that relatively cheaper geophysical well logs instead of sedimentological analysis will be employed in characterization of aquifer petrophysical properties which impinges on aquifer yield and water quality the study will provide petrophysical and hydrogeological characterization of lekki aquifers and its implication for groundwater regulation development maintenance and protection the built up nature of the area indicates that conventional geophysical methods will not be adequate for groundwater exploration and randomly cited boreholes frequently result in failure likewise there is knowledge gaps on the petrophysical properties of the aquifers which this study will address in order to provide valuable insights on properties that influence water quality storage and transmissivity the theme of this article petrophysical and hydrogeological characterization of coastal aquifer using geophysical logs in lekki peninsula lagos nigeria could be applied globally for similar coastal aquifers 1 1 description of the study area lekki peninsula fig 1 is situated on the coast of atlantic ocean in lagos within the dahomey basin southwestern nigeria it covers about 450 km2 on its western flank are victoria island and ikoyi environs while the atlantic ocean is situated to its south and lagos and lekki lagoons to the north and east respectively it is bounded by longitudes 3 43 14 e and latitudes 6 29 36 n the stretch of the peninsula is roughly 80 km while the width averages 10 km fig 1 there are two wet seasons in the area april july and october november which accounts lowest amount of rainfall talabi 2014 the area is characterized by temperature that ranges from 13 9 c to 37 3 c and vegetation types that include swamp and dry lowland forest nwajide 2013 in addition to high population settlement lekki penninsula hosts to manufacturing business free trade zone and port activities 2 geological and hydrogeological setting according to omatsola and adegoke 1981 the cretaceous stratigraphy fig 2 of the dahomey basin is made up of abeokuta group which consists of ise afowo and araromi fomations the ise formation comprises of coarse conglomeratic sediments unconformably overlying the basement complex afowo is mainly sands and sandstone of marine origin often interbedded with shales and siltstone araromi formation is essentially shales and siltstone often interbedded with sand and limestone in the tertiary section are the ewekoro limestone akinbo and oshosun shales and the coastal plain sand of benin formation the succession is capped by the benin formation the benin formation is mainly sands and shales with some limestone which thicken towards the west as well as down dips to the coast oteri and atolagbe 2003 a comprehensive stratigraphic and structural geology of the area has be reported by jones and hockey 1964 adegoke 1969 omatsola and adegoke 1981 okosun 1990 billman 1992 among others earlier studies in lekki peninsula have shown that groundwater occurrence is related to sand aquifer intercalated with impermeable clay layers longe et al 1987 the aquifers are found in confined and unconfined state jones and hockey 1964 the thickness and sand ratio of the aquifer increase southward toward the coast longe et al 1987 three main hydrostratigraphic units are present in the basin the coastal plain sand ilaro and ewekoro formations and abeokuta formation the most often perforated aquifer is the multi storey coastal plain sand longe et al 1987 in lagos the duo of ilaro and ewekoro fomations are rarely exploited due to their overwhelming clayey shaly nature the abeokuta formation is strictly tapped by a few deep boreholes at depth of about 750 m in ikeja area oladapo et al 2014 2 1 methodology geophysical logs from twelve 12 water wells fig 3 were employed for this study gamma ray short normal and long normal resistivity logs were ran in these wells log editing interpolation depth shifting and normalization fig 4 were carried out on some of the logs before interpretation the gamma ray log was normalized to correct for poor tool calibration and borehole size this will ensure that the log readings are within a uniform scale normalization was carried out using the stretch and squeeze method 2 2 lithological identification and correlation the gamma ray was used to differentiate sand from shale using the threshold value of 75 api gamma ray response greater than 75 api indicates clay while lower gamma ray response is diagnostic of sand the correlation exercise was carried out by identifying a thick clay unit of about 60 m as marker bed and correlated across the wells other lithologies were also correlated with respect to the marker bed 2 3 total porosity in the absence of

water resistivity rw was calculated using the ratio method this method utilized the resistivity of the flushed zone based on the following equation 10 r t r w r r x o r m f where ro is true resistivity of the formation rmf is the resistivity of the mud filtrate varies from 20 to 40 ωm and rxois the resistivity of the invaded zone the long and short normal resistivity measurements are usually used for ro and rxo respectively 2 8 water quality determination water quality was determined of the resistivity responses fresh water is characterized by relatively high resistivity values between 70 and 200 ohm m the brackish water has a resistivity value of 4 5 70 ohm m while the saline water is characterized by resistivity values 4 5 ohm m palacky 1987 2 9 calculation total dissolved

in any of the wells and appears to be pinching out to the west the base of the aquifer in the study area is between 29 m and 50 m from the surface this aquifer is an unconfined phreatic aquifer which permits direct infiltration of surface water the clay content in this aquifer varies from 7 in lekki 1 40 in hfp the clay volume in this shallow aquifer is high in hfp and lakowe logs ranges between 39 and 40 aquifer 1 is characterized by a porosity as high as 35 in the unconsolidated sands in the western axis and as low as 11 in the clayey sand in the eastern section the tds ranges from of 4 63 mgl 1 50 33 mgl 1 the net sand thickness could not be accurately determined for this shallow aquifer because of log data limitation within the shallow interval one of the four wells that penetrated aquifer 1 encountered saline water petrophysical properties of this aquifer are presented in table 2 3 2 2 aquifer 2 aquifer 2 fig 6 is a confined aquifer it is situated at depths ranging from 53 m to 132 m in the east and 44 m 148 m in the west it is separated from the aquifer 1 by thick clay up to 130 m aquifer 2 is significantly thick especially around lekki 1 lekki 2 and coop villa est wells where it attains 65 m thickness fig 7 this aquifer shows increasing clay volume towards north east fig 8 the porosity of this aquifer ranges from 16 to 27 and shows a general increase toward the northeast fig 9 this porosity values can be considered to be excellent aquifer 2 permeability fig 10 is very good ranging from 69 to 152 mdarcy generally the formation water resistivity fig 11 in aquifer 2 is fairly constant 6 1 9 9 ωm except around oko abe hfp and lekki 1 where water resistivity plunges to an average value of 0 7 ωm 3 2 3 aquifer 3 aquifer 3 fig 12 was penetrated by two deep

11651,the coastal aquifers of lekki peninsula lagos are increasingly threatened by saline water invasion in this study the characterization of the petrophysical properties of the coastal aquifers in lekki peninsular through analysis of geophysical logs was carried out the methodology involved editing interpolation depth shifting and normalization of gamma ray and resistivity logs from twelve water wells log analysis was employed to map aquiferous units and determine their petrophysical properties which include clay volume porosity permeability water resistivity total dissolved solid and water quality these properties were further subjected to cross plot analysis the results identified three aquifers aquifer 1 is mostly unconfined shallow phreatic aquifer characterized by 11 35 porosity the tds ranges from of 4 63 mgl 1 50 33 mgl 1 the intermediate aquifer 2 is characterized by significant thickness 25 75 m clay volume 0 22 0 54 excellent porosity 16 27 permeability 99 110

analysis shows 67 of wells that penetrated aquifer 2 encountered saline to brackish water while 40 found aquitard with poor petrophysical properties water wells in the study area should target aquifer

logs petrophysical properties aquifer dahomey basin saline water data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the increased demand for groundwater resources occasioned by climate change has led to more targeted studies of aquifers properties asry et al 2012 because more countries are found to obtain significant volume of their public water supplies from groundwater e g 30 in uk 50 in usa and 99 in denmark tebbuth 1998 all over the world the fresh water coaster aquifers are rapidly becoming endangered by saline water invasion due to expansion in population and urbanization and its cconsequent heavy abstraction of groundwater resource tirkey et al 2017 pareeket et al 2006 the incursion of saline water into coastal freshwater aquifers of lekki peninsular is an unsettling phenomenon which makes extraction of freshwater in the district a herculean one where freshwater aquifers are eventually located the uncertainty associated with the petrophysical properties of such aquifers may also jeopardize water abstraction in such instance the situation has become so precarious that hardly can a well be drilled in this peninsula which will not run into saline water oladapo et al 2014 characterization of aquifers in this coastal region is particularly important because their invasion by saline water make them susceptible to periodic shifting of freshwater saline water boundary barlow 2003 thought these periodic shifts may be a result of variation in climate fluctuations in sea level and over abstraction of groundwater the combination of these factors necessitate migration of sea water toward water wells in hydraulic contact with the ocean thereby shifting saline water freshwater landward buckley 2000 buckley et al 2001 mapping of aquifer can be done by geophysical methods such as seismic electrical resistivity geophysical logging etc among these methods borehole logging provides a continuous in situ depth record of formation properties including groundwater saturation and lithological changes traditional electrical sounding is often ineffective due to space constraint and non discriminatory resistivity responses of clay and saline water bearing aquifers geophysical logging in contrast requires minimal space and the acquired logs provide information on the subsurface lithology water quality fluid types and petrophysical properties although geophysical logging is commonly employed in hydrocarbon exploration it has also found usage in groundwater investigation kwander 1986 venoff 1966 the reason being that the physical attributes of hydrocarbon reservoirs such as porosity and resistivities typically investigated in hydrocarbon exploration are equally properties of interest for aquifers during groundwater investigation examples of logs that are traditionally measured in wells are the natural gamma ngam and electrical resistivity er logs a multi parameter sonde is typically employed for the measurement of the natural gamma ngam and electrical resistivity er logs 64 in the subsurface these geophysical logs are important in determination of aquifer matrix and their saturating fluid contents with their degree of salinity keys 1997 hearst et al 2000 buckley 2000 geophysical log interpretations are based on the signature of log response to the rock matrix and fluid content keys 1997 hearst et al 2000 ngam log is sensitive to radioactive isotopes in rocks such as uranium thorium and potassium making it useful for lithologic discrimination er on the other hand measures resistance to the flow of current within formations and is generally influenced by chemistry of the saturating fluid pore geometry and matrix materials mares et al 1994 keys 1997 groundwater bearing aquifers produce lower resistivity than dry formation while aquiferous units hosting freshwater produce higher resistivity response than their saline water bearing equivalents the use of geophysical logging tools in groundwater exploration has been on the ascendancy for the past decades it has found applications in fresh saline water interface mapping akinlalu and afolabi 2018 obakhrrne 2022 aquifer mapping in crystalline basement rocks nyako et al 2016 determination of aquifer petrophysical properties nguyen 2004 salem and el bayumy 2016 farrag et al 2018 groundwater salinity and total

recommended geophysical logging as a customary procedure that should be applied in every groundwater exploration based on the results of their study lekki peninsular has no functional scheme for supply of portable water therefore the inhabitants have resulted to indiscriminate abstraction of groundwater through borehole drillings despite this unwholesome practice the paucity of potable water remains unabated because many of the wells have witnessed saline water invasion from the atlantic ocean aladejana et al 2020 2021 this study therefore utilized pre existing geophysical logs to provide detailed study of lithostratigraphic sequence fresh saline water distribution aquifers petrophysical properties and the vulnerability of the aquifers to contamination this study is novel in that relatively cheaper geophysical well logs instead of sedimentological analysis will be employed in characterization of aquifer petrophysical properties which impinges on aquifer yield and water quality the study will provide petrophysical and hydrogeological characterization of lekki aquifers and its implication for groundwater regulation development maintenance and protection the built up nature of the area indicates that conventional geophysical methods will not be adequate for groundwater exploration and randomly cited boreholes frequently result in failure likewise there is knowledge gaps on the petrophysical properties of the aquifers which this study will address in order to provide valuable insights on properties that influence water quality storage and transmissivity the theme of this article petrophysical and hydrogeological characterization of coastal aquifer using geophysical logs in lekki peninsula lagos nigeria could be applied globally for similar coastal aquifers 1 1 description of the study area lekki peninsula fig 1 is situated on the coast of atlantic ocean in lagos within the dahomey basin southwestern nigeria it covers about 450 km2 on its western flank are victoria island and ikoyi environs while the atlantic ocean is situated to its south and lagos and lekki lagoons to the north and east respectively it is bounded by longitudes 3 43 14 e and latitudes 6 29 36 n the stretch of the peninsula is roughly 80 km while the width averages 10 km fig 1 there are two wet seasons in the area april july and october november which accounts lowest amount of rainfall talabi 2014 the area is characterized by temperature that ranges from 13 9 c to 37 3 c and vegetation types that include swamp and dry lowland forest nwajide 2013 in addition to high population settlement lekki penninsula hosts to manufacturing business free trade zone and port activities 2 geological and hydrogeological setting according to omatsola and adegoke 1981 the cretaceous stratigraphy fig 2 of the dahomey basin is made up of abeokuta group which consists of ise afowo and araromi fomations the ise formation comprises of coarse conglomeratic sediments unconformably overlying the basement complex afowo is mainly sands and sandstone of marine origin often interbedded with shales and siltstone araromi formation is essentially shales and siltstone often interbedded with sand and limestone in the tertiary section are the ewekoro limestone akinbo and oshosun shales and the coastal plain sand of benin formation the succession is capped by the benin formation the benin formation is mainly sands and shales with some limestone which thicken towards the west as well as down dips to the coast oteri and atolagbe 2003 a comprehensive stratigraphic and structural geology of the area has be reported by jones and hockey 1964 adegoke 1969 omatsola and adegoke 1981 okosun 1990 billman 1992 among others earlier studies in lekki peninsula have shown that groundwater occurrence is related to sand aquifer intercalated with impermeable clay layers longe et al 1987 the aquifers are found in confined and unconfined state jones and hockey 1964 the thickness and sand ratio of the aquifer increase southward toward the coast longe et al 1987 three main hydrostratigraphic units are present in the basin the coastal plain sand ilaro and ewekoro formations and abeokuta formation the most often perforated aquifer is the multi storey coastal plain sand longe et al 1987 in lagos the duo of ilaro and ewekoro fomations are rarely exploited due to their overwhelming clayey shaly nature the abeokuta formation is strictly tapped by a few deep boreholes at depth of about 750 m in ikeja area oladapo et al 2014 2 1 methodology geophysical logs from twelve 12 water wells fig 3 were employed for this study gamma ray short normal and long normal resistivity logs were ran in these wells log editing interpolation depth shifting and normalization fig 4 were carried out on some of the logs before interpretation the gamma ray log was normalized to correct for poor tool calibration and borehole size this will ensure that the log readings are within a uniform scale normalization was carried out using the stretch and squeeze method 2 2 lithological identification and correlation the gamma ray was used to differentiate sand from shale using the threshold value of 75 api gamma ray response greater than 75 api indicates clay while lower gamma ray response is diagnostic of sand the correlation exercise was carried out by identifying a thick clay unit of about 60 m as marker bed and correlated across the wells other lithologies were also correlated with respect to the marker bed 2 3 total porosity in the absence of

wheat straw biochar xrd x ray diffraction data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction arsenic is a highly mobile bioavailable persistent and toxic metal threatening indian sub continent china brazil middle east and the usa by causing multiple physiological and neurological ailments and results from non judicious activities like agro chemical application mining and semiconductor manufacturing bhattacharya et al 2021 kumari and bhattacharya 2023 roy et al 2023 singh et al 2015 the maximum permissible arsenic limits fixed by united states environmental protection agency in soil is 24 mg kg 1 and in water is 10 μg l 1 kumar et al 2021a groundwater is the primary drinking water source in major parts of the world and keeping it safe for consumption has been a priority for the water authorities kumar et al 2021b siddiq et al 2022 contamination of groundwater with arsenic is an emerging issue in south east asian region with 230 million people worldwide drinking arsenic contaminated groundwater apart from consuming arsenic loaded crops alidokht et al 2021 kumar et al 2021c tabassum et al 2019 it becomes crucial to minimize arsenic from the consumables to safeguard people from acute and chronic poisoning several methods have been used for remediation of arsenic contaminated groundwater including filtration reverse osmosis membrane separation precipitation ion exchange coagulation and adsorption cuong et al 2022 nicomel et al 2015 however most of the traditional methods are associated with high operational costs energy consumption disposal issues incomplete removal and chemical hazards kumar et al 2021a 2022b kumar and bhattacharya 2023a 2023b among the different remediation techniques for controlling metal loid pollution biochar based adsorption techniques have emerged as a suitable method for removing arsenic kumar and bhattacharya 2021 rajendran et al 2022 the preferability of biochar based removal arises from the cost effectiveness environment friendliness long term efficacy high adsorption capacity and potential for value added applicability such as soil amendment and carbon sequestration kumar et al 2023 biochar is a highly stable carbonaceous material obtained after thermal treatment of feedstocks like agricultural kitchen industrial or animal waste which enables management of waste and is used for mitigation of climate change production of energy fertilization of soil and removal of contaminants ibi 2015 kumar et al 2020 kumar and bhattacharya 2022 2021 the diverse applications are enabled by its high ph surface functionality water retention capacity surface area porosity and nutrient content while the thermal treatment techniques used for production of biochar include carbonization torrefaction gasification and pyrolysis kumar et al 2022a with the importance of safeguarding food security fodder supply for animals cattle and poultry and biodiversity levels across the globe waste biomasses were chosen in the present investigation including crop residues straws of wheat or triticum aestivum kitchen waste consisting of okra waste and peels of onion and potato leaf litter containing fallen leaves of sal or shorea robusta invasive plant lantana camara wet fruit waste peels of orange or citrus sinensis and dry fruit waste shells of walnut or juglans regia these waste were chosen in the present study because more than 100 million tonnes of wheat residue is generated in india annually bhuvaneshwari et al 2019 more than 65 million tonnes of kitchen waste is produced in india annually dora et al 2021 leaf litter problem has inflicted urban areas invasive plants have endangered integrity of various ecosystems ghosh et al 2020 and untreated fruit waste disposal emits tonnes of co2 and pollutes the environment jahanban esfahlan et al 2020 sial et al 2019 the high nutrient and ligno cellulosic content in these feedstocks present a huge potential for their valorization into biochar previously researchers have utilised biochar for removing arsenic from aqueous systems but arsenic pollution is not just limited to hydrosphere and pollution of the hydro geosphere is a threatening issue kumar et al 2022c shaikh et al 2022a tabassum et al 2019 arsenic immobilization via biochar application has received minimal consideration with studies indicating biochar mediated arsenic immobilization through physisorption h bonding electrostatic interaction surface sorption or diffusion and chemisorption ion exchange complexation precipitation or π π electron interaction hakeem et al 2022 kumar et al 2022b for example wheat straw based biochar removed 100 as from groundwater samples within 2 h tabassum et al 2019 while mno2 rice husk based biochar composite removed as iii and as v from groundwater with adsorption capacity of 40 8 and 48 2 mg g 1 respectively cuong et al 2022 therefore application of biochar could be a meritorious approach for immobilizing as iii however additional studies are needed to investigate the role of feedstock in influencing the biochar properties and arsenic removal efficacies correspondingly the present investigation utilises biochar prepared from various waste biomass feedstocks for cost effective eco efficient as iii removal along with environmental benefits offered via reducing waste biomass load preventing emitted greenhouse gases and the associated pollution the objectives include a production and characterization of biochar 500 c b optimization and comparative assessment of as iii immobilization via biochar application and c identification of mechanisms participating in removal of as iii 2 methodology acid washed glassware milli q water and 99 pure analytical grade reagents

adsorption at 196 c as given in table s1 with method previously described elsewhere igalavithana et al 2017 kumar et al 2021 2022b phzpc ph at zero point charge of different biochars was assessed via the method of balistrieri and murray 1981 where 0 1 g biochar was added to 50 ml 0 01 m nacl solutions in conical flasks by varying ph from 2 to 10 adjusted using hcl and koh and rotated for 48 h followed by recording final ph and plotting phinitial vs phfinal curve where the intersection point represented phzpc the as iii removal efficiencies and adsorption capacities were calculated using equations 1 and 2 parameter optimization was performed using formerly established methods kumar et al 2022c břendová et al 2015 where biochar was added to soil at varying application dose w w the soil biochar was further added to 100 ml as iii solution varying initial concentration ic at 1 20 w v ratio shaken for varying contact times at 100 rpm in varying solution temperatures centrifuged for 10

formulae for calculation of different types of isotherms kinetics and thermodynamics are given in table s2 to compare the as iii removal performance of different biochars partition coefficient was

biochars the yield of biochar production varies from 19 3 to 29 3 for the different biochars enabled by the differences in hemicellulose cellulose and lignin compositions in wheat straws kitchen wastes leaf litters invasive lantana orange peels and walnut shells as given in table 1 ayala et al 2021 bakker et al 2013 das and mondal 2016 kumar et al 2021a 2022b pirayesh et al 2012 szymanska chargot et al 2017 when the feedstock is exposed to thermal treatment hemicellulose cellulose and lignin components decompose at 200 315 c 315 400 c and 400 c respectively weber and quicker 2018 the biochars were produced with yields of 30 where higher lignin and ash contents in feedstock have been reported to favour higher yields of biochar produced kumar et al 2023 proximate analysis suggested 5 0 9 8 moisture 8 1 13 2 volatile matter 5 3 40 5 ash and 41 4 78 1 fixed carbon in the different biochars as shown in fig 1 a f the lower moisture and volatile matter contents were attributed to decomposition of a majority of feedstock components the relatively higher ash content results from presence of metals like calcium magnesium potassium silicon and sodium which forms metallic oxides and carbonates when subjugated to thermal treatment sadaka et al 2014 the removal of moisture and volatile matter during pyrolysis along with increased carbonization enabled higher fixed carbon content weber and quicker 2018 elemental analysis suggested high c content 45 7 86 in line with high fixed carbon content while lower n 0 1 1 6 h 1 6 2 9 o 5 5 21 4 and s 0 1 0 5 contents are associated with decomposition and volatilization of feedstock components as oxides or ammonia in the course of thermal treatment as shown in fig 2 a f li et al 2018 van krevelen plot h c ratio vs o c ratio confirmed that the prepared biochars lied in char range as shown in fig 2g with the exception of wasbc which lied in the range of coal attributable to the high c content 86 further low h c ratios and o c ratios for the biochars indicate high stability and low polarity respectively manna et al 2020 weber and quicker 2018 the biochars contained 0 12 mg kg 1 as 0 6 5 mg kg 1 co 9 5 73 5 mg kg 1 cr 2 5 48 mg kg 1 cu 3 52 mg kg 1 ni and 0 3 mg kg 1 pb as shown in fig 3 b which are potentially toxic elements below the permissible limits suggesting minimal risk of contamination after addition to soil bakshi et al 2018 moreover 0 7 4 6 g kg 1 fe 2 4 19 5 g kg 1 mg and 11 2 24 2 g kg 1 ca were present in sufficient quantities as shown in fig 3a suggesting their applicability as a soil fertility augmenting amendment fesem micrographs 5 000x 40 000 magnification clearly showed the presence of abundant differently sized pores on the heterogeneous surface of biochars as shown in fig 4 a f which results from removal of volatile matter and moisture components in feedstocks igalavithana et al 2017 mary et al 2016 bet analysis showed surface area in the range of 1 5 148 1 m2 g 1 pore volume in the range of 0 002 0 093 cm3 g 1 and pore size in the range of 1 26 7 83 nm for different biochars where higher feedstock c content and lower moisture volatile matter and ash content increased surface area of biochars manna et al 2020 ftir analysis was carried out to identify active functional groups and minerals on biochar surface and to understand as iii adsorption by comparing ftir spectrum before and after as iii adsorption as shown in fig 5 a the holocellulose and lignin components in different feedstocks provide hydroxyl and carbonyl groups to biochar verma and singh 2019 a large hump near 3200 3400 cm 1 corresponded to oh groups free as well as h bonded while peaks at 2357 1397 1185 1106 960 and 850 cm 1 indicated c o stretching co stretching cellulose derived pyranone stretching c h aliphatic stretching c o bending and c h aromatic stretching respectively kumar et al 2021a 2022b below 1000 cm 1 low intensity peaks of lignin derived methoxy groups and hemicellulose derived aliphatic c h and c o c groups were observed kumar and bhattacharya 2022 nanda et al 2013 cellulose derived peaks at 1120 and 1102 cm 1 corresponded to c o c symmetric stretching and c o stretching while lignin derived peaks at 1587 and 1475 cm 1 corresponded to cc aromatic stretching and at 814 856 and 1133 cm 1 corresponded to c h stretching of syringyl and guaiacyl lignin alfattani et al 2022 janu et al 2021 xrd analysis was performed to identify presence of minerals and monitor differences in crystalline and amorphous components in biochars before and after adsorption of as iii by comparing differences in 2θ peaks as shown in fig 5b a broad hump at 18 24 indicated amorphous nature of biochars attributable to decomposition of feedstock contents at high production temperatures 2θ peaks of sylvine 29 39 49 quartz 43 calcite 23 36 47 and graphite 27 were observed in the xrd diffraction patterns of different biochars also in good agreement with ftir spectra indicating the presence of calcite 876 and 781 cm 1 sylvine 600 cm 1 and quartz 475 and 803 cm 1 chowdhury et al 2021 fan et al 2003 michalak et al 2019 singh et al 2016 3 2 parameter optimization and comparative assessment the parameters ic dose contact time reaction temperature and ph were optimized to remove as iii efficiently using the different biochars as shown in fig 6 kumar and bhattacharya 2022 to optimize the experimental parameters a systematic approach was used where one parameter was varied while keeping the others constant and measuring the adsorption efficiency under each condition initial concentration of the pollutant in solution is an important parameter in adsorption experiment affecting the amount of pollutant that could be removed by biochar dose refers to the amount of biochar used in the adsorption experiment which could influence the surface area available for adsorption contact time between the adsorbent and the solution containing pollutant is another important parameter which determines the duration during which the adsorbent could interact with the pollutant thereby influencing the kinetics of adsorption solution temperature is also an important parameter as it could affect the chemical and physical properties of both the adsorbent and the pollutant the ph of the solution could affect the surface charge of adsorbents and hence their ability of attracting or repelling the pollutants the ph of the solution could be adjusted using acid or base solutions where different pollutants have different optimal ph values for adsorption the impact of ic was investigated by varying as iii concentration 0 1 14 mg l 1 keeping other parameters constant with a rise in as iii concentration increase in removal efficiencies and adsorption capacities was observed as shown in fig 6a enabled by high adsorbate concentration providing a driving force to overcome transfer barrier from liquid adsorbate to solid phase adsorbent and enhanced availability of active surface sites which facilitates easy interaction with adsorbate kumar et al 2021a the removal for different adsorbents was optimized at 6 mg l 1 for lcbc 77 6 0 4 removal efficiency 1 8 0 01 mg

0 01 mg g 1 above optimized adsorbate ic continual saturation of surface binding sites resulted in gradual decline in removal efficiency shaikh et al 2022a in a previous study arsenic sorption on perilla leaf biochar from groundwater samples increased from 0 01 to 3 20 mg g 1 with a rise in initial concentration niazi et al 2018 in light of importance of decreasing adsorbent cost and maintaining high removal efficiency the impact of adsorbent dose on as iii removal was analysed by varying it from 1 to 15 keeping other parameters constant removal efficiency increased with a rise in biochar application dose as shown in fig 6b enabled by a rise in active surface binding sites which optimized at 2 5 application dose in lcbc 77 5 0 3 and opbc 78 5 0 1 5 application dose in kwbc 75 3 0 1 llbc 77 5 0 1 and wasbc 88 4 0 1 and 7 5 application dose in wsbc 83 6 0 2 after optimization formation of clusters and partial agglomeration of biochar particles decreases available active sites and adsorbent area involved in removal thereby decreasing removal efficiency shaikh et al 2022a contrary to removal adsorption capacity reduced with a rise in dose in wsbc from 10 8 0 04 to 0 8 0 01 mg g 1 kwbc from 11 4 0 03 to 0 7 0 01 mg g 1 llbc from 11 2 0 08 to 0 7 0 01 mg g 1 lcbc from 8 9 0 03 to 0 6 0 01 mg g 1 opbc from 15 5 0 01 to 0 9 0 01 mg g 1 and wasbc from 14 1 0 01 to 0 9 0 01 mg g 1 attributed to a fixed dose of adsorbate interacting with increasing biochar dose kumar et al 2022b in a previous study similar trend was observed where maximum as iii removal 90 from groundwater samples was observed at 2 g l 1 verma and singh 2022 the influence of contact time was assessed by varying it temporally from 15 to 240 min keeping other parameters constant as shown in fig 6c initially a rapid increase in as iii removal results from initial abundance of active sites and large as iii diffusion on adsorbent surface forming inner sphere complexes huo et al 2021 kumar et al 2022b contact times optimized at 30 min for wasbc 88 8 0 1 removal efficiency 2 8 0 01 mg g 1 adsorption capacity 60 min for wsbc 83 7 0 1 1 8 0 01 mg g 1 and kwbc 76 7 0 2 2 5 0 01 mg g 1 and 90 min for llbc 83 4 0 3 2 7 0 01 mg g 1 lcbc 80 1 0 9 3 8 0 05 mg g 1 and opbc 80 7 0 2 6 459 0 01 mg g 1 in a previous study maximum as iii removal optimized at 240 min from groundwater samples verma and singh 2022 above optimized contact times saturation of active binding sites pore filling and repulsion between adsorbate molecules and adsorbent surface resulted in gradual decrease in removal efficiency and adsorption capacity kumar and bhattacharya 2022 mondal et al 2017 the influence of reaction temperature on as iii removal was analysed by varying it from 5 to 45 c keeping other parameters constant as shown in fig 6d removal efficiency increased with a rise in process temperature signifying the adsorption to be exothermic and optimized at 25 c for wsbc 83 7 0 5 removal efficiency 1 8 0 01 mg g 1 adsorption capacity kwbc 75 5 0 2 2 4 0 01 mg g 1 llbc 77 5 0 1 2 5 0 01 mg g 1 lcbc 77 5 1 1 3 7 0 05 mg g 1 opbc 78 5 0 1 6 3 0 01 mg g 1 and wasbc 88 4 0 1 2 9 0 01 mg g 1 a rise in solution temperature facilitated increase in kinetic energy enabling enhanced as iii diffusion from solution to adsorbent and as iii mobility augmenting enhanced interaction of active binding sites and as iii entry in pores of adsorbent however removal efficiency and adsorption capacity declined above 25 c attributable to diffusion of pre adsorbed as iii and formation of gaseous barrier between adsorbate adsorbent which blocks pores of adsorbent huo et al 2021 lastly realizing the importance of ph in affecting adsorbate speciation and charge on adsorbent surface impact of ph on as iii removal was assessed by varying it from 3 to 12 keeping other parameters constant as shown in fig 6e ahmad and mirza 2017 arsenic could exist as as iii aso3 3 haso3 2 h2aso and h3aso3 in reducing environments or as v aso4 3 haso4 2 h2aso4 and h3aso4 in oxidizing conditions asere et al 2017 optimum as iii removal efficiency and adsorption capacity was observed at ph 5 for wasbc 88 6 0

positively charged surface of biochar which enables electrostatic attraction of negatively charged as iii shaikh et al 2022b in a previous study perilla leaf biochar showed maximum arsenic removal 79 from groundwater samples at ph of 7 2 and declined above up to 60 above 7 2 niazi et al 2018 the equilibrium adsorption capacity could be used to compare the as iii removal potential of biochars considering equilibrium adsorption capacity the different biochars could be sorted as opbc 6 5 mg g 1 lcbc 3 9 mg g 1 wasbc 2 8 mg g 1 llbc 2 7 mg g 1 kwbc 2 5 mg g 1 wsbc 1 8 mg g 1 however initial as iii concentration affects maximum adsorption capacity significantly which could be a misrepresentation of the actual removal potential of biochars consequently partition coefficient was calculated to leverage the influence of varying conditions on the removal performance of different biochars and the following trend was obtained opbc 0 648 lcbc 0 647 wasbc 0 355 llbc 0 339 kwbc 0 315 wsbc 0 225 although the trend of removal performance of various biochars was same when they were sorted on the basis of adsorption capacity and partition coefficient it was observed that opbc and lcbc were the best as iii sorbents and demonstrated nearly identical removal performance the results corroborated with previous findings where biochars was used for removing various types of contaminants in a study maple leaf derived biochars prepared at 750 c was hydrophobic low h c and o c containing abundant calcite composition and rich in o containing functional groups acting as h bond acceptors kim et al 2020 the biochar showed high tetracycline adsorption enabled by hydrophobic interactions h bonding and metal complexation in another study pinecone biochar prepared at 750 c removed solvent black 3 azo dye and bisphenol a with adsorption capacity of 346 86 and 38 39 mg g 1 respectively enabled by h bonding hydrophobic and π π electron donor acceptor interactions kim et al 2020 elsewhere coconut oil modified pinewood biochar prepared at 700 c removed crude petroleum oil with adsorption capacity of 5 32 g g 1 enabled by surface hydrophobic interaction like π π donor acceptor interaction gurav et al 2021 in another investigation biochars prepared from poa pratensis bluegrass coffee residues grape pomace microalgae and rice husks were analysed for microcystin lr removal where bluegrass based biochar prepared at 750 c removed microcystin lr with maximum adsorption capacity of 2769 μg g 1 primarily assisted by surface complexation ion exchange electrostatic attraction and π π interaction song et al 2021 elsewhere microalgae spirulina based biochar prepared at 750 c removed tetracycline with maximum adsorption capacity of 132 8 mg g 1 enabled by functional groups c o c n and ch2 strong crystallization rhenanite hydroxyapatite and calcite and hydrophobicity choi et al 2020 3 3 identification of mechanisms involved in arsenic removal the experimental results were fit to langmuir freundlich dubinin radushkevich and temkin isotherm models to identify plausible mechanisms participating in as iii immobilization mondal et al 2017 freundlich isotherm model was observed to fit better compared to langmuir model r2 values given in table 2 suggesting greater role of multilayer as iii sorption while 1 nf adsorption intensity ranged from 1 to 10 denoting favourable as iii removal and freundlich constant kf was highest for wasbc denoting its highest removal efficiency tirkey et al 2018 high regression co efficient 0 97 0 99 for dubinin radushkevich isotherm model suggested participation of porous biochar structure in as iii removal along with es mean adsorption energy 8 kj mol 1 denoting involvement of physisorption kumar et al 2021a participation of physisorption in as iii removal was confirmed by good regression coefficient 0 85 0 89 for temkin model alam et al 2018 in a previous study langmuir and dubinin radushkevich models effectively suggested monolayer sorption and micro pore filling during as iii sorption on biochars from groundwater samples niazi et al 2018 the experimental data was also fit to pseudo first order pseudo second order and weber morris intra particle diffusion kinetic models as shown in table 2 to assess the rate of as iii removal tan and hameed 2017 based on the higher r2 values pseudo second order model was found to fit better when compared to pseudo first order model denoting crucial role of chemisorption in the removal and dependence of reaction rate on the square of remaining as iii concentration in a previous study also pseudo second order model fir better than pseudo first order model when biochar was used for removing as iii from groundwater samples verma and singh 2022 weber morris intra particle diffusion model showed good regression co efficient 0 86 0 98 where the straight line in graph plot evaded the origin suggesting participation of multiple rate controlling mechanisms boundary layer transfer diffusion in pores and sorption on binding sites as shown in fig 7 kumar et al 2021a lastly good regression eco efficient 0 81 0 99 for thermodynamic plotting as shown in table 2 indicated its appropriate fitting in the study lima et al 2020 the values for gibbs free energy δg enthalpy δh and entropy δs were negative denoting spontaneous and exothermic as iii sorption and crucial role for physisorption in removal kumar et al 2021a the exothermic nature of adsorption suggests that with the energy being released to the environment the biochar arsenic system becomes more stable further a negative entropy change denotes the system becoming more ordered which could be in contradiction to the second law of thermodynamics stating that total entropy of a closed system could never decrease over time however interactions between different components or formation of stable bonds or complexes in system could result in negative entropy during adsorption ftir spectra were also compared for pristine and as iii loaded biochars where after adsorption major differences in peaks were seen at 2357 and 800 1750 cm 1 corresponding to stretching bending of functional groups like c o and co denoting participation of these functional groups in binding of as iii to biochars kumar et al 2021a similarly xrd diffractograms were also compared for pristine and as iii loaded biochars and after binding of as iii decrease and or disappearance in peak intensity of sylvine quartz and calcite indicated electrostatic interaction of as iii with crystalline mineral components of biochar kumar and bhattacharya 2022 kumar et al 2021 4 conclusion application of biochar was a potentially useful method of immobilizing as iii biochars were produced with 19 3 29 3 yield were highly stable low h c and o c ratios and rich in pores they contained 46 86 carbon abundant minerals and surface functional groups which helped in as iii removal optimum as iii adsorption

g 1 for orange peel based biochar and 2 8 mg g 1 for walnut shell based biochar as iii removal involved numerous mechanisms including surface complexation multi layered surface sorption and h bonding suggested by superior fitting of freundlich isotherm denoting multi layered sorption pseudo second order and weber morris intra particle diffusion denoting chemisorption boundary layer diffusion and surface adsorption and changes in peak positions in ftir and xrd analysis supporting chemisorption involvement in as iii removal among different biochars wasbc showed maximum as iii removal efficiency 88 8 primarily enabled by high surface area 148 m2 g 1 while opbc demonstrated best adsorption performance adsorption capacity of 6 5 mg g 1 and partition co efficient of 0 648 primarily attributed to the participation of numerous surface functional groups in adsorption moreover wsbc commendable as iii removal efficiency of 83 7 could be recommended for large scale application to promote circular economy future studies could incorporate the removal of emerging contaminants micro plastics and other toxic metals from hydro geosphere systems using the different waste biomass derived biochars further physico chemical modification of adsorbents could be performed to boost the removal efficiency removal performance of biochars could be analysed in hydro geosphere systems exposed to extreme weather events especially in the context of increase in occurrence of climate change associated hazards moreover biochars could be modified magnetically in future studies to recover the applied

wheat straw biochar xrd x ray diffraction data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction arsenic is a highly mobile bioavailable persistent and toxic metal threatening indian sub continent china brazil middle east and the usa by causing multiple physiological and neurological ailments and results from non judicious activities like agro chemical application mining and semiconductor manufacturing bhattacharya et al 2021 kumari and bhattacharya 2023 roy et al 2023 singh et al 2015 the maximum permissible arsenic limits fixed by united states environmental protection agency in soil is 24 mg kg 1 and in water is 10 μg l 1 kumar et al 2021a groundwater is the primary drinking water source in major parts of the world and keeping it safe for consumption has been a priority for the water authorities kumar et al 2021b siddiq et al 2022 contamination of groundwater with arsenic is an emerging issue in south east asian region with 230 million people worldwide drinking arsenic contaminated groundwater apart from consuming arsenic loaded crops alidokht et al 2021 kumar et al 2021c tabassum et al 2019 it becomes crucial to minimize arsenic from the consumables to safeguard people from acute and chronic poisoning several methods have been used for remediation of arsenic contaminated groundwater including filtration reverse osmosis membrane separation precipitation ion exchange coagulation and adsorption cuong et al 2022 nicomel et al 2015 however most of the traditional methods are associated with high operational costs energy consumption disposal issues incomplete removal and chemical hazards kumar et al 2021a 2022b kumar and bhattacharya 2023a 2023b among the different remediation techniques for controlling metal loid pollution biochar based adsorption techniques have emerged as a suitable method for removing arsenic kumar and bhattacharya 2021 rajendran et al 2022 the preferability of biochar based removal arises from the cost effectiveness environment friendliness long term efficacy high adsorption capacity and potential for value added applicability such as soil amendment and carbon sequestration kumar et al 2023 biochar is a highly stable carbonaceous material obtained after thermal treatment of feedstocks like agricultural kitchen industrial or animal waste which enables management of waste and is used for mitigation of climate change production of energy fertilization of soil and removal of contaminants ibi 2015 kumar et al 2020 kumar and bhattacharya 2022 2021 the diverse applications are enabled by its high ph surface functionality water retention capacity surface area porosity and nutrient content while the thermal treatment techniques used for production of biochar include carbonization torrefaction gasification and pyrolysis kumar et al 2022a with the importance of safeguarding food security fodder supply for animals cattle and poultry and biodiversity levels across the globe waste biomasses were chosen in the present investigation including crop residues straws of wheat or triticum aestivum kitchen waste consisting of okra waste and peels of onion and potato leaf litter containing fallen leaves of sal or shorea robusta invasive plant lantana camara wet fruit waste peels of orange or citrus sinensis and dry fruit waste shells of walnut or juglans regia these waste were chosen in the present study because more than 100 million tonnes of wheat residue is generated in india annually bhuvaneshwari et al 2019 more than 65 million tonnes of kitchen waste is produced in india annually dora et al 2021 leaf litter problem has inflicted urban areas invasive plants have endangered integrity of various ecosystems ghosh et al 2020 and untreated fruit waste disposal emits tonnes of co2 and pollutes the environment jahanban esfahlan et al 2020 sial et al 2019 the high nutrient and ligno cellulosic content in these feedstocks present a huge potential for their valorization into biochar previously researchers have utilised biochar for removing arsenic from aqueous systems but arsenic pollution is not just limited to hydrosphere and pollution of the hydro geosphere is a threatening issue kumar et al 2022c shaikh et al 2022a tabassum et al 2019 arsenic immobilization via biochar application has received minimal consideration with studies indicating biochar mediated arsenic immobilization through physisorption h bonding electrostatic interaction surface sorption or diffusion and chemisorption ion exchange complexation precipitation or π π electron interaction hakeem et al 2022 kumar et al 2022b for example wheat straw based biochar removed 100 as from groundwater samples within 2 h tabassum et al 2019 while mno2 rice husk based biochar composite removed as iii and as v from groundwater with adsorption capacity of 40 8 and 48 2 mg g 1 respectively cuong et al 2022 therefore application of biochar could be a meritorious approach for immobilizing as iii however additional studies are needed to investigate the role of feedstock in influencing the biochar properties and arsenic removal efficacies correspondingly the present investigation utilises biochar prepared from various waste biomass feedstocks for cost effective eco efficient as iii removal along with environmental benefits offered via reducing waste biomass load preventing emitted greenhouse gases and the associated pollution the objectives include a production and characterization of biochar 500 c b optimization and comparative assessment of as iii immobilization via biochar application and c identification of mechanisms participating in removal of as iii 2 methodology acid washed glassware milli q water and 99 pure analytical grade reagents

adsorption at 196 c as given in table s1 with method previously described elsewhere igalavithana et al 2017 kumar et al 2021 2022b phzpc ph at zero point charge of different biochars was assessed via the method of balistrieri and murray 1981 where 0 1 g biochar was added to 50 ml 0 01 m nacl solutions in conical flasks by varying ph from 2 to 10 adjusted using hcl and koh and rotated for 48 h followed by recording final ph and plotting phinitial vs phfinal curve where the intersection point represented phzpc the as iii removal efficiencies and adsorption capacities were calculated using equations 1 and 2 parameter optimization was performed using formerly established methods kumar et al 2022c břendová et al 2015 where biochar was added to soil at varying application dose w w the soil biochar was further added to 100 ml as iii solution varying initial concentration ic at 1 20 w v ratio shaken for varying contact times at 100 rpm in varying solution temperatures centrifuged for 10

formulae for calculation of different types of isotherms kinetics and thermodynamics are given in table s2 to compare the as iii removal performance of different biochars partition coefficient was

biochars the yield of biochar production varies from 19 3 to 29 3 for the different biochars enabled by the differences in hemicellulose cellulose and lignin compositions in wheat straws kitchen wastes leaf litters invasive lantana orange peels and walnut shells as given in table 1 ayala et al 2021 bakker et al 2013 das and mondal 2016 kumar et al 2021a 2022b pirayesh et al 2012 szymanska chargot et al 2017 when the feedstock is exposed to thermal treatment hemicellulose cellulose and lignin components decompose at 200 315 c 315 400 c and 400 c respectively weber and quicker 2018 the biochars were produced with yields of 30 where higher lignin and ash contents in feedstock have been reported to favour higher yields of biochar produced kumar et al 2023 proximate analysis suggested 5 0 9 8 moisture 8 1 13 2 volatile matter 5 3 40 5 ash and 41 4 78 1 fixed carbon in the different biochars as shown in fig 1 a f the lower moisture and volatile matter contents were attributed to decomposition of a majority of feedstock components the relatively higher ash content results from presence of metals like calcium magnesium potassium silicon and sodium which forms metallic oxides and carbonates when subjugated to thermal treatment sadaka et al 2014 the removal of moisture and volatile matter during pyrolysis along with increased carbonization enabled higher fixed carbon content weber and quicker 2018 elemental analysis suggested high c content 45 7 86 in line with high fixed carbon content while lower n 0 1 1 6 h 1 6 2 9 o 5 5 21 4 and s 0 1 0 5 contents are associated with decomposition and volatilization of feedstock components as oxides or ammonia in the course of thermal treatment as shown in fig 2 a f li et al 2018 van krevelen plot h c ratio vs o c ratio confirmed that the prepared biochars lied in char range as shown in fig 2g with the exception of wasbc which lied in the range of coal attributable to the high c content 86 further low h c ratios and o c ratios for the biochars indicate high stability and low polarity respectively manna et al 2020 weber and quicker 2018 the biochars contained 0 12 mg kg 1 as 0 6 5 mg kg 1 co 9 5 73 5 mg kg 1 cr 2 5 48 mg kg 1 cu 3 52 mg kg 1 ni and 0 3 mg kg 1 pb as shown in fig 3 b which are potentially toxic elements below the permissible limits suggesting minimal risk of contamination after addition to soil bakshi et al 2018 moreover 0 7 4 6 g kg 1 fe 2 4 19 5 g kg 1 mg and 11 2 24 2 g kg 1 ca were present in sufficient quantities as shown in fig 3a suggesting their applicability as a soil fertility augmenting amendment fesem micrographs 5 000x 40 000 magnification clearly showed the presence of abundant differently sized pores on the heterogeneous surface of biochars as shown in fig 4 a f which results from removal of volatile matter and moisture components in feedstocks igalavithana et al 2017 mary et al 2016 bet analysis showed surface area in the range of 1 5 148 1 m2 g 1 pore volume in the range of 0 002 0 093 cm3 g 1 and pore size in the range of 1 26 7 83 nm for different biochars where higher feedstock c content and lower moisture volatile matter and ash content increased surface area of biochars manna et al 2020 ftir analysis was carried out to identify active functional groups and minerals on biochar surface and to understand as iii adsorption by comparing ftir spectrum before and after as iii adsorption as shown in fig 5 a the holocellulose and lignin components in different feedstocks provide hydroxyl and carbonyl groups to biochar verma and singh 2019 a large hump near 3200 3400 cm 1 corresponded to oh groups free as well as h bonded while peaks at 2357 1397 1185 1106 960 and 850 cm 1 indicated c o stretching co stretching cellulose derived pyranone stretching c h aliphatic stretching c o bending and c h aromatic stretching respectively kumar et al 2021a 2022b below 1000 cm 1 low intensity peaks of lignin derived methoxy groups and hemicellulose derived aliphatic c h and c o c groups were observed kumar and bhattacharya 2022 nanda et al 2013 cellulose derived peaks at 1120 and 1102 cm 1 corresponded to c o c symmetric stretching and c o stretching while lignin derived peaks at 1587 and 1475 cm 1 corresponded to cc aromatic stretching and at 814 856 and 1133 cm 1 corresponded to c h stretching of syringyl and guaiacyl lignin alfattani et al 2022 janu et al 2021 xrd analysis was performed to identify presence of minerals and monitor differences in crystalline and amorphous components in biochars before and after adsorption of as iii by comparing differences in 2θ peaks as shown in fig 5b a broad hump at 18 24 indicated amorphous nature of biochars attributable to decomposition of feedstock contents at high production temperatures 2θ peaks of sylvine 29 39 49 quartz 43 calcite 23 36 47 and graphite 27 were observed in the xrd diffraction patterns of different biochars also in good agreement with ftir spectra indicating the presence of calcite 876 and 781 cm 1 sylvine 600 cm 1 and quartz 475 and 803 cm 1 chowdhury et al 2021 fan et al 2003 michalak et al 2019 singh et al 2016 3 2 parameter optimization and comparative assessment the parameters ic dose contact time reaction temperature and ph were optimized to remove as iii efficiently using the different biochars as shown in fig 6 kumar and bhattacharya 2022 to optimize the experimental parameters a systematic approach was used where one parameter was varied while keeping the others constant and measuring the adsorption efficiency under each condition initial concentration of the pollutant in solution is an important parameter in adsorption experiment affecting the amount of pollutant that could be removed by biochar dose refers to the amount of biochar used in the adsorption experiment which could influence the surface area available for adsorption contact time between the adsorbent and the solution containing pollutant is another important parameter which determines the duration during which the adsorbent could interact with the pollutant thereby influencing the kinetics of adsorption solution temperature is also an important parameter as it could affect the chemical and physical properties of both the adsorbent and the pollutant the ph of the solution could affect the surface charge of adsorbents and hence their ability of attracting or repelling the pollutants the ph of the solution could be adjusted using acid or base solutions where different pollutants have different optimal ph values for adsorption the impact of ic was investigated by varying as iii concentration 0 1 14 mg l 1 keeping other parameters constant with a rise in as iii concentration increase in removal efficiencies and adsorption capacities was observed as shown in fig 6a enabled by high adsorbate concentration providing a driving force to overcome transfer barrier from liquid adsorbate to solid phase adsorbent and enhanced availability of active surface sites which facilitates easy interaction with adsorbate kumar et al 2021a the removal for different adsorbents was optimized at 6 mg l 1 for lcbc 77 6 0 4 removal efficiency 1 8 0 01 mg

0 01 mg g 1 above optimized adsorbate ic continual saturation of surface binding sites resulted in gradual decline in removal efficiency shaikh et al 2022a in a previous study arsenic sorption on perilla leaf biochar from groundwater samples increased from 0 01 to 3 20 mg g 1 with a rise in initial concentration niazi et al 2018 in light of importance of decreasing adsorbent cost and maintaining high removal efficiency the impact of adsorbent dose on as iii removal was analysed by varying it from 1 to 15 keeping other parameters constant removal efficiency increased with a rise in biochar application dose as shown in fig 6b enabled by a rise in active surface binding sites which optimized at 2 5 application dose in lcbc 77 5 0 3 and opbc 78 5 0 1 5 application dose in kwbc 75 3 0 1 llbc 77 5 0 1 and wasbc 88 4 0 1 and 7 5 application dose in wsbc 83 6 0 2 after optimization formation of clusters and partial agglomeration of biochar particles decreases available active sites and adsorbent area involved in removal thereby decreasing removal efficiency shaikh et al 2022a contrary to removal adsorption capacity reduced with a rise in dose in wsbc from 10 8 0 04 to 0 8 0 01 mg g 1 kwbc from 11 4 0 03 to 0 7 0 01 mg g 1 llbc from 11 2 0 08 to 0 7 0 01 mg g 1 lcbc from 8 9 0 03 to 0 6 0 01 mg g 1 opbc from 15 5 0 01 to 0 9 0 01 mg g 1 and wasbc from 14 1 0 01 to 0 9 0 01 mg g 1 attributed to a fixed dose of adsorbate interacting with increasing biochar dose kumar et al 2022b in a previous study similar trend was observed where maximum as iii removal 90 from groundwater samples was observed at 2 g l 1 verma and singh 2022 the influence of contact time was assessed by varying it temporally from 15 to 240 min keeping other parameters constant as shown in fig 6c initially a rapid increase in as iii removal results from initial abundance of active sites and large as iii diffusion on adsorbent surface forming inner sphere complexes huo et al 2021 kumar et al 2022b contact times optimized at 30 min for wasbc 88 8 0 1 removal efficiency 2 8 0 01 mg g 1 adsorption capacity 60 min for wsbc 83 7 0 1 1 8 0 01 mg g 1 and kwbc 76 7 0 2 2 5 0 01 mg g 1 and 90 min for llbc 83 4 0 3 2 7 0 01 mg g 1 lcbc 80 1 0 9 3 8 0 05 mg g 1 and opbc 80 7 0 2 6 459 0 01 mg g 1 in a previous study maximum as iii removal optimized at 240 min from groundwater samples verma and singh 2022 above optimized contact times saturation of active binding sites pore filling and repulsion between adsorbate molecules and adsorbent surface resulted in gradual decrease in removal efficiency and adsorption capacity kumar and bhattacharya 2022 mondal et al 2017 the influence of reaction temperature on as iii removal was analysed by varying it from 5 to 45 c keeping other parameters constant as shown in fig 6d removal efficiency increased with a rise in process temperature signifying the adsorption to be exothermic and optimized at 25 c for wsbc 83 7 0 5 removal efficiency 1 8 0 01 mg g 1 adsorption capacity kwbc 75 5 0 2 2 4 0 01 mg g 1 llbc 77 5 0 1 2 5 0 01 mg g 1 lcbc 77 5 1 1 3 7 0 05 mg g 1 opbc 78 5 0 1 6 3 0 01 mg g 1 and wasbc 88 4 0 1 2 9 0 01 mg g 1 a rise in solution temperature facilitated increase in kinetic energy enabling enhanced as iii diffusion from solution to adsorbent and as iii mobility augmenting enhanced interaction of active binding sites and as iii entry in pores of adsorbent however removal efficiency and adsorption capacity declined above 25 c attributable to diffusion of pre adsorbed as iii and formation of gaseous barrier between adsorbate adsorbent which blocks pores of adsorbent huo et al 2021 lastly realizing the importance of ph in affecting adsorbate speciation and charge on adsorbent surface impact of ph on as iii removal was assessed by varying it from 3 to 12 keeping other parameters constant as shown in fig 6e ahmad and mirza 2017 arsenic could exist as as iii aso3 3 haso3 2 h2aso and h3aso3 in reducing environments or as v aso4 3 haso4 2 h2aso4 and h3aso4 in oxidizing conditions asere et al 2017 optimum as iii removal efficiency and adsorption capacity was observed at ph 5 for wasbc 88 6 0

positively charged surface of biochar which enables electrostatic attraction of negatively charged as iii shaikh et al 2022b in a previous study perilla leaf biochar showed maximum arsenic removal 79 from groundwater samples at ph of 7 2 and declined above up to 60 above 7 2 niazi et al 2018 the equilibrium adsorption capacity could be used to compare the as iii removal potential of biochars considering equilibrium adsorption capacity the different biochars could be sorted as opbc 6 5 mg g 1 lcbc 3 9 mg g 1 wasbc 2 8 mg g 1 llbc 2 7 mg g 1 kwbc 2 5 mg g 1 wsbc 1 8 mg g 1 however initial as iii concentration affects maximum adsorption capacity significantly which could be a misrepresentation of the actual removal potential of biochars consequently partition coefficient was calculated to leverage the influence of varying conditions on the removal performance of different biochars and the following trend was obtained opbc 0 648 lcbc 0 647 wasbc 0 355 llbc 0 339 kwbc 0 315 wsbc 0 225 although the trend of removal performance of various biochars was same when they were sorted on the basis of adsorption capacity and partition coefficient it was observed that opbc and lcbc were the best as iii sorbents and demonstrated nearly identical removal performance the results corroborated with previous findings where biochars was used for removing various types of contaminants in a study maple leaf derived biochars prepared at 750 c was hydrophobic low h c and o c containing abundant calcite composition and rich in o containing functional groups acting as h bond acceptors kim et al 2020 the biochar showed high tetracycline adsorption enabled by hydrophobic interactions h bonding and metal complexation in another study pinecone biochar prepared at 750 c removed solvent black 3 azo dye and bisphenol a with adsorption capacity of 346 86 and 38 39 mg g 1 respectively enabled by h bonding hydrophobic and π π electron donor acceptor interactions kim et al 2020 elsewhere coconut oil modified pinewood biochar prepared at 700 c removed crude petroleum oil with adsorption capacity of 5 32 g g 1 enabled by surface hydrophobic interaction like π π donor acceptor interaction gurav et al 2021 in another investigation biochars prepared from poa pratensis bluegrass coffee residues grape pomace microalgae and rice husks were analysed for microcystin lr removal where bluegrass based biochar prepared at 750 c removed microcystin lr with maximum adsorption capacity of 2769 μg g 1 primarily assisted by surface complexation ion exchange electrostatic attraction and π π interaction song et al 2021 elsewhere microalgae spirulina based biochar prepared at 750 c removed tetracycline with maximum adsorption capacity of 132 8 mg g 1 enabled by functional groups c o c n and ch2 strong crystallization rhenanite hydroxyapatite and calcite and hydrophobicity choi et al 2020 3 3 identification of mechanisms involved in arsenic removal the experimental results were fit to langmuir freundlich dubinin radushkevich and temkin isotherm models to identify plausible mechanisms participating in as iii immobilization mondal et al 2017 freundlich isotherm model was observed to fit better compared to langmuir model r2 values given in table 2 suggesting greater role of multilayer as iii sorption while 1 nf adsorption intensity ranged from 1 to 10 denoting favourable as iii removal and freundlich constant kf was highest for wasbc denoting its highest removal efficiency tirkey et al 2018 high regression co efficient 0 97 0 99 for dubinin radushkevich isotherm model suggested participation of porous biochar structure in as iii removal along with es mean adsorption energy 8 kj mol 1 denoting involvement of physisorption kumar et al 2021a participation of physisorption in as iii removal was confirmed by good regression coefficient 0 85 0 89 for temkin model alam et al 2018 in a previous study langmuir and dubinin radushkevich models effectively suggested monolayer sorption and micro pore filling during as iii sorption on biochars from groundwater samples niazi et al 2018 the experimental data was also fit to pseudo first order pseudo second order and weber morris intra particle diffusion kinetic models as shown in table 2 to assess the rate of as iii removal tan and hameed 2017 based on the higher r2 values pseudo second order model was found to fit better when compared to pseudo first order model denoting crucial role of chemisorption in the removal and dependence of reaction rate on the square of remaining as iii concentration in a previous study also pseudo second order model fir better than pseudo first order model when biochar was used for removing as iii from groundwater samples verma and singh 2022 weber morris intra particle diffusion model showed good regression co efficient 0 86 0 98 where the straight line in graph plot evaded the origin suggesting participation of multiple rate controlling mechanisms boundary layer transfer diffusion in pores and sorption on binding sites as shown in fig 7 kumar et al 2021a lastly good regression eco efficient 0 81 0 99 for thermodynamic plotting as shown in table 2 indicated its appropriate fitting in the study lima et al 2020 the values for gibbs free energy δg enthalpy δh and entropy δs were negative denoting spontaneous and exothermic as iii sorption and crucial role for physisorption in removal kumar et al 2021a the exothermic nature of adsorption suggests that with the energy being released to the environment the biochar arsenic system becomes more stable further a negative entropy change denotes the system becoming more ordered which could be in contradiction to the second law of thermodynamics stating that total entropy of a closed system could never decrease over time however interactions between different components or formation of stable bonds or complexes in system could result in negative entropy during adsorption ftir spectra were also compared for pristine and as iii loaded biochars where after adsorption major differences in peaks were seen at 2357 and 800 1750 cm 1 corresponding to stretching bending of functional groups like c o and co denoting participation of these functional groups in binding of as iii to biochars kumar et al 2021a similarly xrd diffractograms were also compared for pristine and as iii loaded biochars and after binding of as iii decrease and or disappearance in peak intensity of sylvine quartz and calcite indicated electrostatic interaction of as iii with crystalline mineral components of biochar kumar and bhattacharya 2022 kumar et al 2021 4 conclusion application of biochar was a potentially useful method of immobilizing as iii biochars were produced with 19 3 29 3 yield were highly stable low h c and o c ratios and rich in pores they contained 46 86 carbon abundant minerals and surface functional groups which helped in as iii removal optimum as iii adsorption

g 1 for orange peel based biochar and 2 8 mg g 1 for walnut shell based biochar as iii removal involved numerous mechanisms including surface complexation multi layered surface sorption and h bonding suggested by superior fitting of freundlich isotherm denoting multi layered sorption pseudo second order and weber morris intra particle diffusion denoting chemisorption boundary layer diffusion and surface adsorption and changes in peak positions in ftir and xrd analysis supporting chemisorption involvement in as iii removal among different biochars wasbc showed maximum as iii removal efficiency 88 8 primarily enabled by high surface area 148 m2 g 1 while opbc demonstrated best adsorption performance adsorption capacity of 6 5 mg g 1 and partition co efficient of 0 648 primarily attributed to the participation of numerous surface functional groups in adsorption moreover wsbc commendable as iii removal efficiency of 83 7 could be recommended for large scale application to promote circular economy future studies could incorporate the removal of emerging contaminants micro plastics and other toxic metals from hydro geosphere systems using the different waste biomass derived biochars further physico chemical modification of adsorbents could be performed to boost the removal efficiency removal performance of biochars could be analysed in hydro geosphere systems exposed to extreme

nitrate should not exceed a concentration of 50 mg l hydrographical regions from portugal have specific regional water management plans under the supervision of the portuguese environmental agency pea agricultural diffuse source is mainly a consequence of excessive use of fertilizers that are leached or transported by runoff from livestock and agricultural activities particularly through the overapplication of agricultural n inputs this situation can lead to nitrate leaching to surface and groundwater wang et al 2019 and consequent higher water and soil nitrate contents the contribution

nvzs on the mainland distributed from north to south fig 1 a the esposende vila do conde nvz is one of these vulnerable zones located in the north of portugal fig 1b the esposende vila do conde nvz is in the coastal strip of northern portugal comprising the municipality of esposende and part of the municipalities of póvoa de varzim vila do conde and barcelos fig 1c the area contains a shallow

205 72 km2 located on the atlantic coast between douro and minho rivers bordered on the north by the neiva river and on the south by the ave river most of the area valley area is dominated by low slopes and elevations below 100 m strecht 2009 the study area is dominated by a temperate and humid climate with an average annual humidity of 80 and an average annual temperature between 14 and 16 c with sporadic frosts and fogs strong winds the annual average precipitation varies between 1000 and 1600 mm suggesting a dominant high evapotranspiration values madrp ministério da agricultura 2005 groundwater occurs predominantly in a shallow unconfined aquifer in detrital sand materials covered by permeable soils with good drainage and intercalated by impermeable shales and clays levels on the bottom the seasonal groundwater level varies between 50 and 80 cm depth during the winter and about 1 2 m from the surface during summer the groundwater depth variation depends mainly on the amount of water extracted for agricultural irrigation water abstraction from the aquifer system is obtained through shallow wells 3 8 m deep and some deeper holes fig 2 b the dominant groundwater aquifer recharge is associated with precipitation through the infiltration of water in the permeable top sandy layers reaching the bottom of the aquifer limited by impermeable clay levels locally the water reaches the aquifer level through cracks and rock fractures the area contains the largest aquifer system in mainland portugal and is dominated by intensive agricultural systems particularly dairy farming and greenhouse horticulture the application of organic and chemical fertilizers associated with intensive agricultural practices without an adequate management will promote the increase in groundwater nitrate concentration the soil characteristics influenced contaminants infiltration and transport the areas with the greatest risk of contamination are dominated by sandy soils this soil type with high permeability and a low water retention correspond to thin soils with a thickness less than 15 20 cm and poor in organic matter as well as soils with intensive crops and n fertilizers application the occurrence of these soils favors the process of water percolation resulting from irrigation and precipitation up to the saturation zone dragging with it the fertilizers added to the soil not assimilated by the crops otherwise the areas with a low level of contamination are composed by clayey soils corresponding to soils with reduced permeability and high water retention capacity

study aims to identify the environmental factors that contribute to increase nitrate groundwater content no3 50 mg l on the esposende vila do conde nvz which could reflect the efficiency of the cgap that have been implemented by farmers and or if will be necessary an adequate adjustment to the ap a complete study on the factors contributing to the high groundwater nitrate contents requires a continuous space time monitoring on the study area the monitoring of the esposende vila do conde nvz area was implemented considering the technical and scientific support of the national environment and infrastructure division of the directorate of agriculture and fisheries of the north drapn since 2007 until 2020 every year between september december a total of 1728 groundwater samples wells boreholes ponds and springs spatially distributed through the study area were selected and determined the groundwater nitrate contents fig 1c this groundwater points were analyzed by the drapn monitoring team s whit a portable expedited analysis equipment rqflex 10 plus for nitrate testing with an assessment range between 5 and 225 mg l no3 the defined methodology also includes a collection of questionnaires and field sheets data obtained with the farmers from the area to be included in a database after completed the annual monitoring period a technical assessment to the farms is carried out by drapn including a specific report to raise awareness and indicate procedures and suggestions that could improve the farmer s agricultural practices and groundwater management considering the measures established in the ap drapn direção regional agricultura pescas norte 2021 a database of this monitorization methodology is obtained including the information collected from various sources such are data from questionnaires and field sheets carried out by drapn technicians during the annual monitoring and different geographic data with information of soil type land use altimetry groundwater points distance through rivers and streams this information was processed together with literature data from dgadr 2019 report published maps land use and land cover 2018 digital terrain model and from portuguese parcel identification system isip ifap the collection and preparation of database includes different information from the study area on the determination of the dependent and independent variables affecting groundwater nitrate content furthermore after completed the database from the study area a relational analysis will be carried out consecutively including a database table which will allow the construction of dynamic tables considering the selected variables the obtained database table considers the transformation of quantitative variables into qualitative ones for example altimetry 31 m from a quantitative variable to a ordinal qualitative variable 30 40 m and the determination of an adequate measurement scale associated with each variable this was the case of variables as altimetry classes of 10 m 0 to 10m 10 to 20m etc distance to the nearest water line 0 to 50m 50 to 200m 200 to 400m 400m water point depth 0 to 5m 5 to 10m 10m and other quantitative variables a complete data analysis will be considered mainly based on variable descriptive statistics the linkage on tables with variables cross tabulation and a methodological independence chi square test applying adequate statistical software this methodology will allow to obtain relevant relations between dependent and independent variables on groundwater nitrate content and consequently the intensity of these relations fig 4 on the statistical test the null hypothesis h0 states that there is no association between the two variables each independent variable and the dependent one otherwise the alternative hypothesis h1 confirms that there is an association between the two tested variables thus in accordance with the obtained results it was possible to verify that a large part of the independent variables shows an association with the dependent variable groundwater nitrate content above the limit of 50 mg l no3 considering that whenever p value 0 05 the null hypothesis is rejected concluding that the tested independent variable will influence the groundwater nitrate contents the applied methodology on the effectiveness of mitigation measures in the esposende vila do conde nvz included the construction of a database considering the most relevant factors of the study area the relation between soil conditions and land use through applied agricultural practices the annual monitoring teams collect data and information about 1 the farmers fertilization and irrigation practices 2 the results of nitrates in groundwater points laboratory analysis from the farmers and

their activities and groundwater conservation 4 results and discussion groundwater from the coastal unconfined aquifer system of esposende vila do conde registered electrical conductivity values between 600 and 1200 μs cm with a ph near neutral to slightly alkaline most groundwater samples are classified as bicarbonate or calcium sulphated type however the marine influence and associated climate conditions contribute to the occurrence of sodium and chloride groundwater facies groundwater from esposende vila do conde aquifer has been classified as low alkalinity and a high salinization risk fonseca and lima 2011 the soil represents the fundamental element on the development of agricultural crops and the soil type will determine the capacity to provide essential nutrients for their growth and development perdigão 2019 madrp ministério da agricultura 1997 on the esposende vila do conde nvz the erodibility degree of soils and soil type will influence groundwater nitrate content groundwater sampling points located in areas with soils containing largest amount of sand arenosol present the highest maximum nitrate content no3 384 mg l in medium erodibility class and the highest average nitrate contents no3 94 8 mg l in medium erodibility class due to the high permeability and low retention capacity favoring percolation and mobility processes table 1 otherwise the very high erodibility soil class presents associated a low groundwater nitrate content no3 3 5 mg l table 1 although only few observations were considered these low groundwater nitrate contents are associated to leptosols which are composed by a larger percentage of clay material and a high erodibility groundwater samples collected in areas of arenosols and cambisols with a medium degree of erodibility present the higher average and maximum nitrate contents on the esposende vila do conde nvz as for fluviosols with a high erodibility degree agroconsultores and geometral 1995 which are common in areas close to rivers and streams groundwater shows a considerable average no3 53 7 mg l table 1 and maximum no3 134 mg l table 1 nitrate contents the obtained results suggest that in the areas located close to streams there is a confluence of nitrate contents suggesting the occurrence of a local nitrate contamination related to the no3 easy flow in groundwater and through the soil faster and easier in high permeability soils and in the direction of the main waterways there is a relation between groundwater nitrate content and land use and land cover occupation on the esposende vila do conde nvz table 2 most groundwater samples analyzed from wells boreholes and springs associated to agricultural activities registered the highest groundwater nitrate contents so groundwater contamination by nitrates is mainly associated to agricultural activities otherwise in the esposende vila do conde nvz higher groundwater nitrate contents also tend to occur associated to ponds from urban areas no3 51 mg l table 2 as other source of contamination as associated to the absence or poor basic sanitation services another evidence of the presence of other contamination sources in the study area is the occurrence of highest groundwater nitrate contents in groundwater sampling points associated to urban areas the agricultural sector adds pressure to groundwater resources especially in situations with excessive fertilizers application in agricultural activities this constitutes a relevant groundwater nitrate content influencing factor as it will cause an imbalance between plant needs and the nitrate content lost through runoff or leaching into the aquifer system the soil fitness from the esposende vila do conde nvz area could be classified as null to high influencing the groundwater nitrate content table 3 the obtained results indicate that the higher average groundwater nitrate contents are associated to agricultural soils with high suitability classes while the lower ones to soils less suitable for agricultural use the relation between groundwater nitrate contents and groundwater depth suggests that the highest groundwater nitrate contents are found in the lower deep water points table 4 according to this the wells corresponding to less deep waterpoints compared to the boreholes type tend to present the highest groundwater nitrate contents particularly in urban areas the higher groundwater nitrate content tends to be found on the groundwater points located on a greater distance to the surface water line distance to the water line 371 6 m table 5 on the study area soil mobility processes and nitrate leaching tend to increase with distance to the surface water line consequently groundwater flow to surface water and a dilution effect of nitrate contents occurs in the water reservoir the esposende vila do conde nvz contain different municipalities and associated slope classes generally groundwater nitrate contents monitored between 2007 and 2020 suggest that the municipality of barcelos present the lowest average groundwater nitrate content no3 46 9 mg l table 6 while in the municipality of póvoa de varzim recorded an average groundwater nitrate content of 83 5 mg no3 l corresponding to the highest value table 6 the municipality of póvoa de varzim with smaller altitude variations and considering that the soil slope will be a relevant factor on surface runoff influencing the percentage of infiltrated water and consequently the groundwater nitrate contents registered the higher average and maximum groundwater nitrate contents maximum no3 384 mg l average no3 83 5 mg mg l table 6 however on this municipality is predominant the occurrence of arenosols with associated higher groundwater nitrate contents and the predominance of a production agricultural system based on outdoor and greenhouse horticulture with a greater application of mineral fertilizers the slope factor indicates that the soils with a lower slope will have a lower surface runoff and consequently a higher nitrate infiltration into the soil which could be supported by the higher groundwater nitrate contents associated to soils with slopes below 6 and the lower nitrate contents related to soil slopes between 25 30 and 40 45 table 6 the dependent variable of this study will be represented by the nitrate concentration above nd limit 50 mg l no3 in groundwater sampling points while the independent variables will include a set of biophysical data and agricultural practices from the study area which allegedly contribute to groundwater nitrate contamination with the application of the chi square statistical test it will be possible to verify whether there is an association between the dependent variable groundwater point nitrate content above the limit of 50 mg l no 3 and the different independent variables identified and used verifying the possible presence or absence of any association as well as its degree of influence concerning the obtained groundwater nitrate contents table 7 this statistical test commonly used to determine relationships between variables allowed us to assess whether de observed category counts were significantly different from the expected count and therefore exist or not a relationship between two variables high nitrate content in groundwater and other physical or geographical variables the agriculture soil fitness is the analyzed independent variable that most contributes to the occurrence of nitrates in groundwater with approximately 40 table 5 however there are three independent variables without a direct influence on the groundwater nitrate content above the limit of 50 mg l no3 namely the amount of total n applied from organic sources and from effluents as well as the application of total organic n above 170 kg ha year fig 5 the fertilizers mineral and or organic are a major n flow in other portuguese nvzs representing on average 75 of the total n inputs mineral fertilizers have a higher share than manure n production for the early years however actually the situation was reversed a more moderate n input flow is provided by n contained in irrigation water mainly from nitrate rich groundwater aquifers the remaining n balance inputs are associated to atmospheric deposition biological fixation and residues from previous crops cameira et al 2019 the obtained results suggest that the implementation of the ap measures is not equally effective through all the portuguese nvz this confirms that national scale pressures cannot be used to identify and estimate the n loads in each specific nvz with the objective of identifying mitigation measures the spatial variability of the n surplus seems to be closely related with the specialization of the agricultural production in terms of crops livestock production within the nvzs cameira et al 2019 thus for the nvzs were identified opportunities for improved manure management namely the improvement of manure n availability supporting farmers fertilization decisions according to the cultures needs is essential to reduce excess of n this can be achieved by reforging producers organizations and consulting and by designing specific measure in the new common agricultural policy cap directed for nvz the cap s strategic plans indicate that assessment of specific objective 6 preserve landscapes and biodiversity should better identify the challenges related to water quality and necessary interventions emanating from other national instruments related to nvz european commission 2022 5 conclusions on the coast of portuguese particularly in areas in the masseiras a local traditional farming system from the north of portugal associated with a low deep of groundwater table located close to the root zone high permeability of the soils arenosols dug in the dune with the form of a bowl and an intensive use of mineral fertilizers represent the main vulnerability factors to groundwater pollution with nitrates from agricultural sources agriculture is the main responsible for the introduction of nitrates into groundwater particularly due to the increase of the global population and the consequent pressure on agricultural and food production to overcome this situation fertilizers are applied to crops sometimes in excessive amounts and out of the appropriate season considered as inappropriately measure the water soluble nitrate ion moves through the soil especially in sandy soils and consequently will be easily leached by water to the saturation zone the high nitrate groundwater contents on the aquifer of the esposende region has serious consequences on the human health of resident population due to an excessive intake of nitrates among the diseases most related to a high nitrate intake could be indicated the methemoglobin and gastric cancer world human organization who 2004 the results obtained on the esposende vila do conde nvz indicate that groundwater points located in artificial territories followed by groundwater points associated to agricultural areas present the highest average nitrate contents mainly associated to the decrease of surface water recharge areas increase of contaminant sources e g domestic septic tanks stables and inadequate agricultural practices the areas presenting a high soil fitness for agriculture generally with low slopes and located further away from a surface water line and or from wells in urban areas tend to present a greater propensity to obtain higher groundwater nitrate contents according to the studied statistical relation between groundwater nitrate content dependent variable no3 50 mg l and its variability with other variables characteristics from the esposende vila do conde nvz the agriculture soil fitness is the analyzed independent variable that most contributes to the occurrence of nitrates in groundwater with approximately 40 it should be noted that there are several variables that demonstrate explain the dependent variable however an exception was found on the groundwater points located on areas with application of total organic n and effluents above 170 kg ha year as well as on the national agricultural reserve ran area which has no direct influence on the groundwater nitrate content the dependent variable this probably absence of a causal relation between the total amount of applied organic n in soil and the registered groundwater nitrate content does not occur in the soil areas with the application of mineral n where is found a causal relation according to these results it will be relevant to reflect about the restriction or limitation to be mentioned on the ap for the esposende vila do conde nvz relative to the application of mineral n soil fertilizer instead of the organic one it will be necessary to confirm if the applied amount of n organic fertilizers will not be decisive to the high groundwater nitrate content occurrence in saturated zones but more dependent on where the fertilizer application is done however despite the global decrease in groundwater nitrate contents the measures remain insufficient and appropriate mitigation will be required to reduce groundwater contamination the obtained results could also help water management stakeholders to implement the nd and ap measures and to evaluate the suitability of those measures across the diverse range of agricultural management practices nevertheless the associated uncertainties should be reduced by complementing with assessment methods including more detailed nitrate source assessment in situ measurements and information and process modeling on the esposende vila do conde nvz area further mechanisms and comprehensive analysis of nitrate flows nutrient balances and losses are required to identify further areas of improvement and to increase n use efficiency in the nvzs it is essential to combine economic social and environmental factors in the application of a set of good agricultural practices allowing the preservation and the adequate management of groundwater quality and quantity and water resources in other portuguese nvzs the global risk index model were constructed as indicator for groundwater quality with a reasonable consistency between the global risk associated to agricultural activity and groundwater pollution status cameira et al 2021 this index shows that different parts of the territory within the same nvz could be exposed to different levels of n loading hazard and vulnerabilities influencing the risk of groundwater pollution with nitrates from agriculture activity thus a future work on the esposende vila do conde nvz will focus on this and mitigation measures must be reformulated and spatially targeted according with both the n hazard and the aquifer vulnerability declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

susceptibility to groundwater pollution which has been polluted by nitrates no3 from agricultural sources directive 91 676 eec in portugal the wfd was transposed to the portuguese legal framework with the water law law n 58 2005 and the nd by the decree law n 235 97 integrated water resources management is carried out at a regional level and identified portuguese nitrate vulnerable zones nvz were indicated in ordinance n 164 2010 the nvzs are designed as areas of land drainage into surface and groundwater vulnerable to pollution due to nitrogen n compounds from agricultural sources groundwater nitrate should not exceed a concentration of 50 mg l hydrographical regions from portugal have specific regional water management plans under the supervision of the portuguese environmental agency pea agricultural diffuse source is mainly a consequence of excessive use of fertilizers that are leached or transported by runoff from livestock and agricultural activities particularly through the overapplication of agricultural n inputs this situation can lead to nitrate leaching to surface and groundwater wang et al 2019 and consequent higher water and soil nitrate contents the contribution of nitrate contents from agricultural activities must be identified and located with precision and accuracy including a set of natural factors such as land use soil type topography and hydrogeological parameters cameira et al 2019 the groundwater pollution caused by nitrates is also a growing common problem worldwide kazakis et al 2020 and is the main challenge for groundwater dependent agricultural and drinking water supplies over the last 50 years almost portuguese groundwater nitrate contents are the result of human activities however agriculture is not the only sector responsible for the source of nutrients that lead to groundwater resources strecht 2009 the application of n fertilizers in the soil from fertilizers manure and or animal manure aims to favor the growth of crops however an over nutrients soil application results in an excessive groundwater nitrate content mainly due to leaching process prospered by irrigation water and runoff zhou 2015 beyond the excessive application of n and phosphate fertilizers intensive agriculture and extensive cattle raising as well as discharges to water lines and or wastewater treatment plants pig farms septic tanks are the

member states reports concerning the national water bodies status reveal that the applied measures remain insufficient in the europe bouraoui et al 2011 cameira et al 2019 thus it is essential to develop approaches to evaluate the effectiveness of the nd measures and practices upon groundwater resources particularly in nvzs including the identification of areas as a critical source of diffuse pollution the present research aims to provide information on the identification and contribution of environmental factors to the contaminant groundwater nitrate content no3 50 mg l in the selected nvz area of esposende vila do conde north portugal the area has an intensive agricultural practice with emphasis on dairy farming and greenhouse horticulture the applied methodology allows the identification of higher groundwater nitrate content considering a space time monitoring data combined with local pressure state and response indicators the obtained results will reflect the efficiency of applied mitigation measures groundwater management is crucial to prevent critical contaminantion levels 2 study area nvz of esposende vila do conde currently portugal has designated nine nvzs on the mainland distributed from north to south fig 1 a the esposende vila do conde nvz is one of these vulnerable zones located in the north of portugal fig 1b the esposende vila do conde nvz is in the coastal strip of northern portugal comprising the municipality of esposende and part of the municipalities of póvoa de varzim vila do conde and barcelos fig 1c the area contains a shallow

205 72 km2 located on the atlantic coast between douro and minho rivers bordered on the north by the neiva river and on the south by the ave river most of the area valley area is dominated by low slopes and elevations below 100 m strecht 2009 the study area is dominated by a temperate and humid climate with an average annual humidity of 80 and an average annual temperature between 14 and 16 c with sporadic frosts and fogs strong winds the annual average precipitation varies between 1000 and 1600 mm suggesting a dominant high evapotranspiration values madrp ministério da agricultura 2005 groundwater occurs predominantly in a shallow unconfined aquifer in detrital sand materials covered by permeable soils with good drainage and intercalated by impermeable shales and clays levels on the bottom the seasonal groundwater level varies between 50 and 80 cm depth during the winter and about 1 2 m from the surface during summer the groundwater depth variation depends mainly on the amount of water extracted for agricultural irrigation water abstraction from the aquifer system is obtained through shallow wells 3 8 m deep and some deeper holes fig 2 b the dominant groundwater aquifer recharge is associated with precipitation through the infiltration of water in the permeable top sandy layers reaching the bottom of the aquifer limited by impermeable clay levels locally the water reaches the aquifer level through cracks and rock fractures the area contains the largest aquifer system in mainland portugal and is dominated by intensive agricultural systems particularly dairy farming and greenhouse horticulture the application of organic and chemical fertilizers associated with intensive agricultural practices without an adequate management will promote the increase in groundwater nitrate concentration the soil characteristics influenced contaminants infiltration and transport the areas with the greatest risk of contamination are dominated by sandy soils this soil type with high permeability and a low water retention correspond to thin soils with a thickness less than 15 20 cm and poor in organic matter as well as soils with intensive crops and n fertilizers application the occurrence of these soils favors the process of water percolation resulting from irrigation and precipitation up to the saturation zone dragging with it the fertilizers added to the soil not assimilated by the crops otherwise the areas with a low level of contamination are composed by clayey soils corresponding to soils with reduced permeability and high water retention capacity

study aims to identify the environmental factors that contribute to increase nitrate groundwater content no3 50 mg l on the esposende vila do conde nvz which could reflect the efficiency of the cgap that have been implemented by farmers and or if will be necessary an adequate adjustment to the ap a complete study on the factors contributing to the high groundwater nitrate contents requires a continuous space time monitoring on the study area the monitoring of the esposende vila do conde nvz area was implemented considering the technical and scientific support of the national environment and infrastructure division of the directorate of agriculture and fisheries of the north drapn since 2007 until 2020 every year between september december a total of 1728 groundwater samples wells boreholes ponds and springs spatially distributed through the study area were selected and determined the groundwater nitrate contents fig 1c this groundwater points were analyzed by the drapn monitoring team s whit a portable expedited analysis equipment rqflex 10 plus for nitrate testing with an assessment range between 5 and 225 mg l no3 the defined methodology also includes a collection of questionnaires and field sheets data obtained with the farmers from the area to be included in a database after completed the annual monitoring period a technical assessment to the farms is carried out by drapn including a specific report to raise awareness and indicate procedures and suggestions that could improve the farmer s agricultural practices and groundwater management considering the measures established in the ap drapn direção regional agricultura pescas norte 2021 a database of this monitorization methodology is obtained including the information collected from various sources such are data from questionnaires and field sheets carried out by drapn technicians during the annual monitoring and different geographic data with information of soil type land use altimetry groundwater points distance through rivers and streams this information was processed together with literature data from dgadr 2019 report published maps land use and land cover 2018 digital terrain model and from portuguese parcel identification system isip ifap the collection and preparation of database includes different information from the study area on the determination of the dependent and independent variables affecting groundwater nitrate content furthermore after completed the database from the study area a relational analysis will be carried out consecutively including a database table which will allow the construction of dynamic tables considering the selected variables the obtained database table considers the transformation of quantitative variables into qualitative ones for example altimetry 31 m from a quantitative variable to a ordinal qualitative variable 30 40 m and the determination of an adequate measurement scale associated with each variable this was the case of variables as altimetry classes of 10 m 0 to 10m 10 to 20m etc distance to the nearest water line 0 to 50m 50 to 200m 200 to 400m 400m water point depth 0 to 5m 5 to 10m 10m and other quantitative variables a complete data analysis will be considered mainly based on variable descriptive statistics the linkage on tables with variables cross tabulation and a methodological independence chi square test applying adequate statistical software this methodology will allow to obtain relevant relations between dependent and independent variables on groundwater nitrate content and consequently the intensity of these relations fig 4 on the statistical test the null hypothesis h0 states that there is no association between the two variables each independent variable and the dependent one otherwise the alternative hypothesis h1 confirms that there is an association between the two tested variables thus in accordance with the obtained results it was possible to verify that a large part of the independent variables shows an association with the dependent variable groundwater nitrate content above the limit of 50 mg l no3 considering that whenever p value 0 05 the null hypothesis is rejected concluding that the tested independent variable will influence the groundwater nitrate contents the applied methodology on the effectiveness of mitigation measures in the esposende vila do conde nvz included the construction of a database considering the most relevant factors of the study area the relation between soil conditions and land use through applied agricultural practices the annual monitoring teams collect data and information about 1 the farmers fertilization and irrigation practices 2 the results of nitrates in groundwater points laboratory analysis from the farmers and 3 soil sampling a farmer s nd obligation analysis results the stakeholders farmers technicians and farming organizations are joined in two annual meetings a for farmers thar are selected for monitoring in that particular year and b for technicians and farming organizations do communicate the latest results improve nd compliance and listen to the stakeholder arguments and concerns about their activities and groundwater conservation 4 results and discussion groundwater from the coastal unconfined aquifer system of esposende vila do conde registered electrical conductivity values between 600 and 1200 μs cm with a ph near neutral to slightly alkaline most groundwater samples are classified as bicarbonate or calcium sulphated type however the marine influence and associated climate conditions contribute to the occurrence of sodium and chloride groundwater facies groundwater from esposende vila do conde aquifer has been classified as low alkalinity and a high salinization risk fonseca and lima 2011 the soil represents the fundamental element on the development of agricultural crops and the soil type will determine the capacity to provide essential nutrients for their growth and development perdigão 2019 madrp ministério da agricultura 1997 on the esposende vila do conde nvz the erodibility degree of soils and soil type will influence groundwater nitrate content groundwater sampling points located in areas with soils containing largest amount of sand arenosol present the highest maximum nitrate content no3 384 mg l in medium erodibility class and the highest average nitrate contents no3 94 8 mg l in medium erodibility class due to the high permeability and low retention capacity favoring percolation and mobility processes table 1 otherwise the very high erodibility soil class presents associated a low groundwater nitrate content no3 3 5 mg l table 1 although only few observations were considered these low groundwater nitrate contents are associated to leptosols which are composed by a larger percentage of clay material and a high erodibility groundwater samples collected in areas of arenosols and cambisols with a medium degree of erodibility present the higher average and maximum nitrate contents on the esposende vila do conde nvz as for fluviosols with a high erodibility degree agroconsultores and geometral 1995 which are common in areas close to rivers and streams groundwater shows a considerable average no3 53 7 mg l table 1 and maximum no3 134 mg l table 1 nitrate contents the obtained results suggest that in the areas located close to streams there is a confluence of nitrate contents suggesting the occurrence of a local nitrate contamination related to the no3 easy flow in groundwater and through the soil faster and easier in high permeability soils and in the direction of the main waterways there is a relation between groundwater nitrate content and land use and land cover occupation on the esposende vila do conde nvz table 2 most groundwater samples analyzed from wells boreholes and springs associated to agricultural activities registered the highest groundwater nitrate contents so groundwater contamination by nitrates is mainly associated to agricultural activities otherwise in the esposende vila do conde nvz higher groundwater nitrate contents also tend to occur associated to ponds from urban areas no3 51 mg l table 2 as other source of contamination as associated to the absence or poor basic sanitation services another evidence of the presence of other contamination sources in the study area is the occurrence of highest groundwater nitrate contents in groundwater sampling points associated to urban areas the agricultural sector adds pressure to groundwater resources especially in situations with excessive fertilizers application in agricultural activities this constitutes a relevant groundwater nitrate content influencing factor as it will cause an imbalance between plant needs and the nitrate content lost through runoff or leaching into the aquifer system the soil fitness from the esposende vila do conde nvz area could be classified as null to high influencing the groundwater nitrate content table 3 the obtained results indicate that the higher average groundwater nitrate contents are associated to agricultural soils with high suitability classes while the lower ones to soils less suitable for agricultural use the relation between groundwater nitrate contents and groundwater depth suggests that the highest groundwater nitrate contents are found in the lower deep water points table 4 according to this the wells corresponding to less deep waterpoints compared to the boreholes type tend to present the highest groundwater nitrate contents particularly in urban areas the higher groundwater nitrate content tends to be found on the groundwater points located on a greater distance to the surface water line distance to the water line 371 6 m table 5 on the study area soil mobility processes and nitrate leaching tend to increase with distance to the surface water line consequently groundwater flow to surface water and a dilution effect of nitrate contents occurs in the water reservoir the esposende vila do conde nvz contain different municipalities and associated slope classes generally groundwater nitrate contents monitored between 2007 and 2020 suggest that the municipality of barcelos present the lowest average groundwater nitrate content no3 46 9 mg l table 6 while in the municipality of póvoa de varzim recorded an average groundwater nitrate content of 83 5 mg no3 l corresponding to the highest value table 6 the municipality of póvoa de varzim with smaller altitude variations and considering that the soil slope will be a relevant factor on surface runoff influencing the percentage of infiltrated water and consequently the groundwater nitrate contents registered the higher average and maximum groundwater nitrate contents maximum no3 384 mg l average no3 83 5 mg mg l table 6 however on this municipality is predominant the occurrence of arenosols with associated higher groundwater nitrate contents and the predominance of a production agricultural system based on outdoor and greenhouse horticulture with a greater application of mineral fertilizers the slope factor indicates that the soils with a lower slope will have a lower surface runoff and consequently a higher nitrate infiltration into the soil which could be supported by the higher groundwater nitrate contents associated to soils with slopes below 6 and the lower nitrate contents related to soil slopes between 25 30 and 40 45 table 6 the dependent variable of this study will be represented by the nitrate concentration above nd limit 50 mg l no3 in groundwater sampling points while the independent variables will include a set of biophysical data and agricultural practices from the study area which allegedly contribute to groundwater nitrate contamination with the application of the chi square statistical test it will be possible to verify whether there is an association between the dependent variable groundwater point nitrate content above the limit of 50 mg l no 3 and the different independent variables identified and used verifying the possible presence or absence of any association as well as its degree of influence concerning the obtained groundwater nitrate contents table 7 this statistical test commonly used to determine relationships between variables allowed us to assess whether de observed category counts were significantly different from the expected count and therefore exist or not a relationship between two variables high nitrate content in groundwater and other physical or geographical variables the agriculture soil fitness is the analyzed independent variable that most contributes to the occurrence of nitrates in groundwater with approximately 40 table 5 however there are three independent variables without a direct influence on the groundwater nitrate content above the limit of 50 mg l no3 namely the amount of total n applied from organic sources and from effluents as well as the application of total organic n above 170 kg ha year fig 5 the fertilizers mineral and or organic are a major n flow in other portuguese nvzs representing on average 75 of the total n inputs mineral fertilizers have a higher share than manure n production for the early years however actually the situation was reversed a more moderate n input flow is provided by n contained in irrigation water mainly from nitrate rich groundwater aquifers the remaining n balance inputs are associated to atmospheric deposition biological fixation and residues from previous crops cameira et al 2019 the obtained results suggest that the implementation of the ap measures is not equally effective through all the portuguese nvz this confirms that national scale pressures cannot be used to identify and estimate the n loads in each specific nvz with the objective of identifying mitigation measures the spatial variability of the n surplus seems to be closely related with the specialization of the agricultural production in terms of crops livestock production within the nvzs cameira et al 2019 thus for the nvzs were identified opportunities for improved manure management namely the improvement of manure n availability supporting farmers fertilization decisions according to the cultures needs is essential to reduce excess of n this can be achieved by reforging producers organizations and consulting and by designing specific measure in the new common agricultural policy cap directed for nvz the cap s strategic plans indicate that assessment of specific objective 6 preserve landscapes and biodiversity should better identify the challenges related to water quality and necessary interventions emanating from other national instruments related to nvz european commission 2022 5 conclusions on the coast of portuguese particularly in areas in the masseiras a local traditional farming system from the north of portugal associated with a low deep of groundwater table located close to the root zone high permeability of the soils arenosols dug in the dune with the form of a bowl and an intensive use of mineral fertilizers represent the main vulnerability factors to groundwater pollution with nitrates from agricultural sources agriculture is the main responsible for the introduction of nitrates into groundwater particularly due to the increase of the global population and the consequent pressure on agricultural and food production to overcome this situation fertilizers are applied to crops sometimes in excessive amounts and out of the appropriate season considered as inappropriately measure the water soluble nitrate ion moves through the soil especially in sandy soils and consequently will be easily leached by water to the saturation zone the high nitrate groundwater contents on the aquifer of the esposende region has serious consequences on the human health of resident population due to an excessive intake of nitrates among the diseases most related to a high nitrate intake could be indicated the methemoglobin and gastric cancer world human organization who 2004 the results obtained on the esposende vila do conde nvz indicate that groundwater points located in artificial territories followed by groundwater points associated to agricultural areas present the highest average nitrate contents mainly associated to the decrease of surface water recharge areas increase of contaminant sources e g domestic septic tanks stables and inadequate agricultural practices the areas presenting a high soil fitness for agriculture generally with low slopes and located further away from a surface water line and or from wells in urban areas tend to present a greater propensity to obtain higher groundwater nitrate contents according to the studied statistical relation between groundwater nitrate content dependent variable no3 50 mg l and its variability with other variables characteristics from the esposende vila do conde nvz the agriculture soil fitness is the analyzed independent variable that most contributes to the occurrence of nitrates in groundwater with approximately 40 it should be noted that there are several variables that demonstrate explain the dependent variable however an exception was found on the groundwater points located on areas with application of total organic n and effluents above 170 kg ha year as well as on the national agricultural reserve ran area which has no direct influence on the groundwater nitrate content the dependent variable this probably absence of a causal relation between the total amount of applied organic n in soil and the registered groundwater nitrate content does not occur in the soil areas with the application of mineral n where is found a causal relation according to these results it will be relevant to reflect about the restriction or limitation to be mentioned on the ap for the esposende vila do conde nvz relative to the application of mineral n soil fertilizer instead of the organic one it will be necessary to confirm if the applied amount of n organic fertilizers will not be decisive to the high groundwater nitrate content occurrence in saturated zones but more dependent on where the fertilizer application is done however despite the global decrease in groundwater nitrate contents the measures remain insufficient and appropriate mitigation will be required to reduce groundwater contamination the obtained results could also help water management stakeholders to implement the nd and ap measures and to evaluate the suitability of those measures across the diverse range of agricultural management practices nevertheless the associated uncertainties should be reduced by complementing with assessment methods including more detailed nitrate source assessment in situ measurements and information and process modeling on the esposende vila do conde nvz area further mechanisms and comprehensive analysis of nitrate flows nutrient balances and losses are required to identify further areas of improvement and to increase n use efficiency in the nvzs it is essential to combine economic social and environmental factors in the application of a set of good agricultural practices allowing the preservation and the adequate management of groundwater quality and quantity and water resources in other portuguese nvzs the global risk index model were constructed as indicator for groundwater quality with a reasonable consistency between the global risk associated to agricultural activity and groundwater pollution status cameira et al 2021 this index shows that different parts of the territory within the same nvz could be exposed to different levels of n loading hazard and vulnerabilities influencing the risk of groundwater pollution with nitrates from agriculture activity thus a future work on the esposende vila do conde nvz will focus on this and mitigation measures must be reformulated and spatially targeted according with both the n hazard and the aquifer vulnerability declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgments the data used in this work is annually collected and analyzed by the directorate of agriculture and fisheries of the north and their staff and has insured the esposende vila do conde nvz monitorization and rural extension actions to farmer since 2007 their persistence and effort are essential to

11654,judicial use of submarine groundwater discharge sgd can be a potential water resource for countries facing water scarcity very few studies report the fluxes of sgd into the oceans especially from those countries that are located in the tropics and facing water scarcity another dimension of the sgd is its potential to control the biogeochemical cycles of nutrients and trace metals and the anthropogenic impact on the oceans this work attempts to give an overview of the challenges and limitations involved in achieving the above we have reviewed 1628 published literature that reported sgd in different contexts in the last 21 years the year 2000 to this date several studies exist in bits and pieces across the world s coastline with different methodologies adopted for identifying and quantifying the sgd this compilation has attempted to extract these findings and listed the challenges and limitations in estimating the sgd fluxes significant challenges in quantifying the discharge include inconsistent sampling strategies adopted by researchers uncertainties in modeling spatio temporal variations in discharge extreme weather conditions and difficulty in quantifying discharge at inaccessible areas mangroves large tidal flats etc some limitations discussed in this work include insufficient knowledge of coastal aquifer data geology and lack of historical hydrological data based on the critical analysis of the published literature we recommend a few solutions that can provide a better resolution in the quantification of sgd decision makers and water conservation professionals will benefit from this work as they can suitably plan the water management pollution control and sustainable extraction of the sgd we suggest strategies calling for assessments of sgd in areas of potentially significant discharge and developing new monitoring networks and strict policies for groundwater usage graphical abstract image 1 keywords challenges groundwater management limitations potable water source submarine groundwater discharge data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction throughout history a large part of civilization has evolved alongside the coast in modern times great metropolises like new york shanghai and chennai have developed due to the transport of commercial goods through the oceanic route and the strategic advantage of being in the coast these cities along with several others currently face potable water problems and are shifting focus on depleted groundwater resources as the current climate crisis worsens extreme weather conditions and scarcity of potable water will become frequent submarine groundwater discharge sgd offers a viable option in mitigating the situation for several years marine geologists and scientists have been trying to quantify the sources of this freshwater to the seawater selvam et al 2021 taniguchi et al 2019 it has only been in the 21st century that sgd has been regarded as an unappreciated water resource even in ancient times the occurrence of freshwater amidst the sea fascinated coastal communities several religious sites in the middle east and hawaii refer to this groundwater discharge as miracle water from heaven in several coastal communities of lebanon and syria in the past century sgd was used as a source of drinking water and transported to the local community centre by boats and plastic bottles many such practices can be found worldwide from australia to bahrain to hawaii moosdorf and oehler 2017 a need for research around sgd arises due to the multi faceted nature of the hydrological phenomenon it can enhance marine primary productivity and offer a medium to pollutants harming the marine ecosystem understanding the sources and the dynamics of the freshwater seawater interaction is also crucial to comprehending ocean nutrient and metal budgets we reviewed all the scientific research and review papers in this century n 1628 creating a vast database of 21st century literature focused on sgd leading to several interesting insights and discoveries this work will help the scientific community understand the challenges faced in previous studies and the limitations of currently available methods we also recommend region based management practices and implications to exploit the resource judiciously challenges are obstructions to the scientific method that can be improved upon or focus on neglected areas limitations are defined as obstructions to the research work that are too vast or impractical we classify our recommendations into technical and management aspects technical recommendations to help overcome the challenges faced by the researchers concerning identifying and quantifying sgd management recommendations to help the coastal communities and local stakeholders mitigate the drinking water crisis and protect the coastal ecosystem 2 impact of submarine groundwater discharge in the coastal environment the flow of sgd have varying effects on the ocean and the latter s response to nutrients delivered through sgd could increase or decrease the biological activity santos et al 2021 at some places the impact of sgd in the coastal environment is neutral unknown the positive negative and neutral impacts of sgd is given in fig 1 3 challenges 1 spatial and temporal variations one of the challenges in quantifying the sgd fluxes to the coast is the very high spatial and temporal variations of the seepage the flow of sgd is often patchy diffusive and temporally variable burnett et al 2006 fig 2 these variations are due to terrestrial hydraulic gradient seasonal changes in the groundwater table wave and tide induced pumping advection convection and shear santos et al 2012 the flow of sgd generally extends over a long distance however discharges through karstic aquifers occur as a point source georgiou 2014 post et al 2020 because of the concentrated seepage flux from karstic aquifers are easily identified and quantified throughout the world at sites where the discharge is patchy and diffusive methods like seepage meters are used to quantify the sgd fluxes taniguchi et al 2003 due to the nature and extent of the flow multiple seepage meters are required to quantify the accurate discharge rates burnett et al 2006 seepage measurements are carried out in a small area and the flux estimate is extrapolated to a larger region which may not provide the representative fluxes for the region to overcome this multiple seepage meters can be distributed throughout the study region but this method is labour intensive and impractical therefore at locations where the seepage is uniformly patchy and diffusive seepage meters can be used to estimate the seepage rates duque et al 2020 whereas at locations where seepage is non uniform radon mass balance can be used to estimate the total discharge at any site seepage meters have an advantage of estimating the sgd and to understand the small scale variability in the seepage 2 irregular sampling strategies quantifying riverine discharge of solutes and freshwater to the ocean has already been carried out for most rivers in the world devries et al 2014 these studies allow the researchers to understand global ocean biogeochemistry similarly global estimates of groundwater fluxes to the sea are essential to understand the role of sgd in ocean chemistry however due to the wide variety of sampling strategies available to quantify the sgd fluxes comparison or compilation of fluxes arrived by different methods can be difficult also fluxes are estimated in various units m3 day m3 m2 day year cm day and l day although some of these units can be converted and compared with others most of the fluxes could not be compared this is because the conversion requires several information of the study area which is generally not provided in the literature this makes comparing the values even more challenging for radon mass balance estimates the calculation used to quantify the fluxes differs from study to study also background radon activity in the inland and at the sea varies in every area with different geological formations meaning a higher background radon activity in coastal groundwater may record a high radon concentration in the sea even though the discharge is lower thus comparing the radon flux would not be enough to arrive at global sgd flux estimates most studies are done in point locations and the flux is quantified for that location since the seepage is highly spatially variable the discharge rates around the point location are considered unknown a few studies have overcome this by studying an extensive coastline identifying discharge zones and quantifying them anschutz et al 2016 therefore studying a large region and quantifying the fluxes for the entire region would help arrive at global sgd estimates faster 3 extreme weather conditions most sampling campaigns to quantify sgd fluxes are done in ideal calm weather conditions or after the coastal aquifer water levels are stabilized therefore the fluxes are quantified under the ideal flow conditions unlike riverine flow where the flux from an extreme storm event can be easily modeled using rainfall runoff methods sgd contribution is difficult to estimate because we lack an understanding of how the factors controlling the flow behave during extreme weather conditions although numerical simulations could provide some information on these processes we still lack the field data that confirms this behavior moore and wilson 2005 in regions where intermittent snowfall may contribute to aquifer recharge when it melts and is discharged as sgd mandal and zhang 2012 these areas are under threat due to global warming melting the snow and altering the freshwater and seawater interface extreme weather conditions jacob et al 2009 schubert et al 2014 schuler et al 2020 during the sampling may also affect the integrity of measurements for example seepage meters may be dislodged or the seepage bags could get affected by pressure exerted by the waves and currents burnett et al 2006 during radioisotope measurement rough sea conditions could increase the degassing of target isotopes in the atmosphere in this case the wind speed is measured during the measurement to nullify the effect george et al 2020 however the empirical equation to estimate the degassing is still being debated not perfect 4 delayed solute flux like surface estuaries subterranean estuaries ste cycle various nutrients and trace metals however we do not a have proper understanding of the solute exchange between freshwater and seawater a study carried out on the shores of cape cod ma usa found iron oxide deposits in the freshwater seawater interface of the ste charette and sholkovitz 2002 this iron was rock derived but precipitated in the ste when the oxygen rich seawater came in contact with the freshwater this precipitating iron also scavenges dissolved organic matter from the groundwater linkhorst et al 2017 and precipitated deposits are called iron curtain found to modulate the supply of dissolved organic matter to the sea other compounds like po4 3 are also adsorbed to the iron spiteri et al 2008 such precipitations continue forming during the dry seasons when the fresh saltwater interface grows due to water level drops in the coastal aquifers during wet seasons when the groundwater level increases in the coastal aquifers parts of precipitated compounds become mobile and reach the seawater linkhorst et al 2017 this delayed arrival of dissolved compounds reaching the sea could lead to higher concentrations of these compounds in seawater soon after the wet season the effects of these compounds in the sea could be wrongly attributed to other factors like rainfall runoff and riverine discharge however studying this can be challenging because it requires a quantification of groundwater discharge to the sea and a thorough assessment of inland aquifers and the mixing zone at regular intervals the contribution of these compounds elements at a delayed time is highly significant in some locations for instance the delayed arrival of radium and barium from the groundwater to the bay of bengal is comparable to the riverine contribution of radium and barium from the ganges brahmaputra river one of the world s most extensive river networks moore 1997 5 quantification of sgd from inaccessible locations mangroves large tidal flats coral reefs most studies carried out to quantify the sgd fluxes focus on a small area generally located at a major town city attraction due to the easy access to sampling very few studies are done in pristine locations and other ecosystems like mangroves and large tidal flats mangroves are known to regulate pco2 radon ammonium dissolved organic nitrogen manganese iron total dissolved nitrogen dissolved organic and inorganic carbon total dissolved phosphorus and ch4 gleeson et al 2013 macklin et al 2014 sadat noori et al 2017 sadat noori and glamore 2019 wadnerkar et al 2021 also mangrove ecosystems with high biological activity especially crab burrows could release more compounds than the ecosystems with less biological activity similarly tidal flats are known to regulate dissolved organic carbon dissolved hydrolyzable amino acids nitrates ammonium manganese co2 and iron beck et al 2017 2020 kim et al 2012 reckhardt et al 2015 santos et al 2015 sensitive and difficult to access areas like coral reef ecosystems backwaters fishponds and coastal wetlands are also known to regulate organic compounds paytan et al 2004 the released nutrients and organic compounds could support the microbenthic community and other biological activities adyasari et al 2020 utsunomiyaa et al 2015 therefore it is necessary to understand the process of controlling the solute fluxes through these ecosystems and its significance to global ocean biogeochemistry however access to these places can be complex and challenging especially for quantifying sgd through direct measurements like seepage meters 6 radon mass balance radon is enriched in groundwater by inherent geological deposits and is depleted in seawater this makes it an excellent tool for quantifying the sgd fluxes in coastal waters all radon mass balance methods use a mathematical equation to quantify the loss of radon to the atmosphere burnett et al 2006 this equation uses wind speed as a primary variable to estimate the mixing loss from the sea surface nightingale et al 2000 when the groundwater enriched with radon seeps into the seawater it immediately mixes with the seawater due to the convection caused by the density difference between the two waters prakash et al 2018 however the mixing could be slowed down if the groundwater is colder than seawater mccoy et al 2011 this temperature difference can retain the seepage water at the ocean floor until the seepage water and seawater reaches thermal equilibrium the effect is nullified in the shallow nearshore waters where tides and waves mix the seawater with the discharging groundwater however in shallow waters the degassing rate is higher due to the agitation in the water caused by tides and waves peterson et al 2009 most equations to estimate degassing do not consider the temperature and density differences between the seawater and seepage water which control the mixing effects like heavy winds and storm events before the sampling could also affect the mixing and accelerate the degassing of radon and can lower their concentrations in the sea martin et al 2007 4 limitations 1 seepage meters traditional seepage meters lee type are typically deployed in calm sea conditions iaea 2007 this makes it challenging to deploy the equipment to quantify the discharge especially in the nearshore areas where the seepage occurs cable and martin 2008 also traditional seepage meters can be affected in the seepage bags and tubing due to the rough sea conditions rosenberry 2008 rosenberry et al 2008 there are other kinds of seepage meters like heat pulse type seepage meters buoy type seepage meters dye displacement seepage meters tube seepage meters etc solder et al 2016 which can be deployed in rough sea conditions modern seepage meters can also collect and store the samples in individual sample containers at set intervals however these seepage meters are expensive and do not have high storage capacities and they have to be retrieved to collect the samples and replace new seepage bottles also collecting the samples from the seepage meters at frequent intervals is difficult therefore the traditional lee type seepage meter is still the most reliable for quantifying solute fluxes for seepage meters deployed in deeper waters trained divers are required garman et al 2011 some modern seepage meters come with an automatic logging facility where the seepage rates at certain time intervals are logged and the data can be sent through a transmitter mwashote et al 2010 this long term deployment of seepage meters at the ocean floor can dislodge or submerge sediment resuspension due to tides currents and eddies duque et al 2020 since seepage is patchy and diffusive in most locations multiple seepage meters are required to quantify the accurate discharge rates automatic seepage meters may help quantify the discharge rates with minimal human intervention however they are not cost effective therefore traditional seepage meters are the more viable in terms of cost and quantifying the solute fluxes 2 fresh and recirculated sgd fsgd and rsgd the contribution of solute fluxes through sgd is generally computed from samples collected through the seepage meter however seepage often occurs as brackish water due to tide and wave induced recirculation charette 2007 hermides et al 2020 this recirculated water is a mixture of fresh groundwater from the coastal aquifer with the infiltrated seawater thus the contribution of recirculated seawater in the seepage meter sample should be accounted for before estimating the nutrient solute budgets to the ocean failing to account the fresh and recirculated component could lead to unrepresentative volume and solute fluxes of sgd at the nearshore where terrestrial hydraulic gradients and tides control the flow fresh sgd contributes more during wet seasons and slowly declines towards the dry season the groundwater level lowers during the dry season and the resultant seepage water reflects the combination of freshwater and seawater this seepage is more a by product of the redox sensitive reactions in the subterranean estuary robinson et al 2007 this means some elements and compounds can be trapped or released from the ste the proportion of freshwater and seawater mixing and discharge can be differentiated by analyzing the electrical conductivity of the seepage water quantifying both freshwater and seawater end members the commonly used radon mass balance method is unable to differentiate between fresh and recirculated sgd this leads to the overestimation of nutrients derived through sgd using this method 3 thermal images density vs salinity vs temperature temperature indicates the presence of sgd at locations where the seawater and the discharging groundwater have temperature differences xing et al 2016 when the less dense groundwater discharges into the sea the freshwater rises and floats atop the seawater banks et al 1996 if this groundwater is warmer than the seawater the temperature difference can be picked up by thermal infrared sensors onboard satellites or unmanned aerial vehicles uav however if the temperature of the discharging groundwater is lower than the seawater it is discharging into the groundwater mixes with the bottom seawater and appears as a weak anomaly uavs are often preferred over satellite thermal images because of their higher spatial and spectral resolution and ability to image the study region at the preferred time unlike satellite images with poor temporal resolution 16 days interval for landsat 8 the average annual air temperature reflects the average groundwater temperature in surficial aquifers lasage et al 2008 therefore the viability of using thermal infrared images on an area can be assessed by comparing the difference between sea surface temperature sst and annual average air temperature this method cannot help identifying discharge from deeper confined aquifers because groundwater temperature in deeper aquifers cannot be determined remotely generally thermal images can identify a 2 c difference between seawater and discharging groundwater in calm sea conditions tamborski et al 2015 the rough sea conditions and high wind speeds on the coast could mix up the discharging sgd and seawater making it difficult to delineate the freshwater plume from the thermal images therefore a high volume of patchy and diffusive seepage spread over an extensive coastline can go unnoticed in thermal images rough sea conditions cloud cover atmospheric aerosol and humidity make the thermal images unsuitable for analysis fig 3 thermal images are also prone to the bay and bathymetry effect in the sea mallast et al 2013 affecting the signatures 4 lack of historical data historic estimates of sgd from the land to the sea have been done in some areas worldwide however loads of pollutants and nutrients discharged could never be estimated due to the lack of data these data include the land use and land cover variations in the coastal regions and the effects of the widespread use of fertilizers and pesticides groundwater chemistry and pollutants were also not documented in many coastal areas around the globe whales and other large marine organisms burial becomes a localized source of doc phosphate and ammonium in the groundwater or the seawater heiss 2020 the leachate plume from these burial sites could move towards the sea or inland depending on the hydraulic head difference between the groundwater and the seawater level when buried in shallow depths very close to the beach 25 m the leachate from the burial may attract sharks to the surf zone tucker et al 2019 since only a few incidents are reported and archived estimating solutes derived through the leachates to the sea is challenging similarly the presence of leach pits organic material burial landfill sites and other waste dump sites near the coast is not recorded to estimate the effect of these on the sea there s a dearth of data on emerging contaminants like pharmaceuticals and personal care products specifically designed to act on the living cells thus posing a threat to the ecosystem and human health a few studies have reported these contaminants presence through sgd in coastal waters mckenzie et al 2020 szymczycha et al 2012 2020 szymczycha et al 2020a b these contaminants are short lived and research has only recently been focused on detecting them in the environment therefore the impacts of these contaminants on the coastal ecosystem are unknown sgd may also cause algal blooms and fish kills in certain parts of the world liefer et al 2013 montiel et al 2019 in certain coastal waters sgd derived nutrient fluxes have led to high productivity fujita et al 2019 starke et al 2020 historical incidents of fish kills and increased productivity in the coastal waters may be attributed to sgd but the inferences are inconclusive due to the lack of past data 5 modeling uncertainties modeling the sgd along the coast has some advantages and disadvantages the advantage is its labor effectiveness and can be done in a laboratory disadvantages are that it requires more field data and accurate aquifer parameters to model discharge the most common uncertainty in all the models occurs when the results are extrapolated to a large area over a long time ci et al 2014 radon mass balance models are the most used to estimate the sgd fluxes in the sea uncertainties from these models include lack of background radon concentration in the ocean atmospheric degassing of radon and measurement of end member concentrations the presence of high waves and currents affects radon measurements in seawater and can influence the model results lineaments and other deep seated geological formations inland can increase the background measurements of radon in groundwater jacob et al 2009 and lead to underestimating sgd in coastal waters this can be avoided by averaging multiple radon activity values in the groundwater 6 duration of tides the duration and amplitude of tides vary drastically at different coastlines since tides and inland hydraulic gradients are the two major factors controlling the discharge the influence of different tides and tidal amplitudes at different locations have varying effects on discharge patterns yu et al 2019 this means a similar geological setup with different tidal conditions and slopes will have different discharge patterns and fluxes kuan et al 2019 similarly the freshwater seawater interface in the subterranean estuary and the flushing time and volume of recirculated seawater varies simulation based studies show the duration of tides and the specific storage of the aquifer control the total amount of recirculated discharge lee et al 2013 our current understanding of processes governing the duration of the tide and the residence time of recirculated seawater in a large tidal flat are still laboratory simulation based jiang et al 2014 mango et al 2004 therefore more field studies are needed to completely understand these processes and the quantum of discharge controlled by the kind of tides and tidal amplitudes 7 heterogeneity natural formations possess a considerable level of heterogeneity which means the coastal geological setup has discontinuities in them heiss et al 2020 quantification is made in a small area and the fluxes extrapolated throughout the study region debnath and mukherjee 2016 szymczycha et al 2012 may vary due to this natural heterogeneity for instance a discontinuous clay layer in the continental shelf may hinder freshwater flow to the sea also a fracture or a joint in the coastal hard rock formation could act as a conduit of freshwater into the coastal waters quantification of sgd has to be taken at more number of stations in areas where such heterogeneities exist to overcome the quantification errors this caution only applies to direct methods like seepage meters and porewater tracers indirect methods like radon temperature and other stable isotopes do not need a detailed geological setup of the study area since they measure the cumulative flux from the region to the coastal waters 8 si as sgd indicator siliceous phytoplankton dissolved silica has been used as a tracer for quantifying sgd in coastal water samples this is due to the enrichment of silica through long residence times of groundwater in coastal sandy aquifers there can be exceptions at some sites where siliceous phytoplankton are reported to consume the dissolved silica thus depleting the concentrations in seawater similarly other tracers are available to quantify the submarine groundwater discharge to the coastal waters nevertheless it is limited by the chemical reaction of these traces with seawater or the consumption of these nutrients by the primary productivity in the ocean 9 alternative methods small scale flows driven by advection convection gas bubble upwelling and sediment compaction occur at scales of millimeters to centimeters these flows constitute most of the recirculated sgd on a global scale since these flows occur everywhere at different magnitudes and on small scales it is difficult to quantify them methods like schlieren where the refractive properties of water used to detect fluid exchange and other multifunction sensors to study eddy correlation are available to identify and quantify the flux hu and hemond 2015 karpen et al 2004 the estimation of global fluxes through these methods may be challenging understanding the flow of sgd in deep sea conditions needs specialized equipment that operates under extreme pressure conditions gamma ray spectrometer operates in deep waters and pressures up to 456 105 pa and can measure the deep water sgd flows tsabaris et al 2008 mass balance estimate equations use the geometry and properties of geological materials in the coastal aquifer to quantify the sgd fluxes to the coast since coastal aquifers are not completely mapped in some parts of the world researchers delineate the aquifer from the geology of the study area this is not entirely accurate and can lead to errors in models 10 lakes inland water bodies not considered in modeling studies the source of sgd could either be meteoric recharge to the coastal unconfined aquifer or through surface water bodies like rivers estuaries ponds etc recent studies suggest that the discharging groundwater is a mix of rainfall recharge and effluent recharge from surface water bodies determining the source of groundwater discharged as sgd could help identify leaky surface water bodies and groundwater recharge to the water bodies determining the sources can be achieved by methods like stable isotope signature tracing determining source could also help track the exchange of pollutants between surface water and groundwater 5 recommendations 5 1 technical recommendations based on our review we recommend the following technical recommendations 1 cost efficient methodologies cost effective traces with high sample throughput could fuel research works throughout the globe and eventually help reach the global estimates of sgd similarly the usage of modern sensors and iot internet of things devices could reduce the manpower needed in the field 2 data sharing while quantifying the sgd fluxes multiple data on coastal aquifer parameters and geometry beach morphology ocean bathymetry and geochemistry are collected from the field this data includes dimension of aquifers length and width of the intertidal zone geochemical data etc we recommend that these data be available to researchers the public and decision makers this will enable researchers working on sgd to compare and reanalyze the data this would help the decision makers for better water resource management 3 bridging the gap between field and modeling studies a few studies have reported sgd flux through modeling and field techniques from the same locations however the quantified fluxes from the different approaches usually do not match and have significant differences between them narrowing these flux differences between the approaches by fine tuning the model is required for the long term estimates of sgd to the ocean 4 estimation of rsgd from arid coastlines shorelines next to arid regions and deserts where fresh sgd is not probable zhou et al 2019 recirculated sgd can be effectively quantified using the tidal prism approach in the laboratory these shorelines usually do not have a defined road network for regular field visits hence the tidal prism is the most affordable and can eliminate field visit costs 5 land use and land cover estimates land cover changes due to rapid urbanization may cause impermeability and reduce the recharge rates to the coastal aquifer rufí salís et al 2019 due to the infiltration and surface runoff ratio significant errors may arise in estimates that use outdated projected land use land cover statistics therefore updated land use and land cover statistics must be used in mass balance estimates for sgd 5 2 management recommendations we suggest strategies calling for assessments of sgd in areas of potentially significant discharge and the development of new monitoring networks including creating a regional groundwater management council for sustainable exploitation and solving local groundwater related issues 1 sgd in several instances causes severe problems for large scale constructions such as undersea tunnels and undersea storage facilities as seen in western japan thus regular monitoring of its impact is recommended 2 current knowledge suggests that sgd could increase or decrease the primary productivity of the coastal waters for instance sgd derived nutrients to the coastal waters have been found to promote coral reef production coral bleaching sustaining primary productivity in times of no river flow etc in contrast sgd is also a source of pollutants to the sea and causes coral bleaching in some places wang et al 2014 because of these highly variable effects of sgd on the coastal waters researchers suggest constant monitoring of both the nutrients and pollutant flux through groundwater discharge to the coastal waters impacted regions hawaii usa various bays in china like sanya and australia 3 draining coastal wetlands for agricultural cattle and development purposes could lead to inputs of acidic groundwater to coastal waterbodies therefore land cover changes and subsequent alterations to the coastal catchment should also be monitored to manage nutrients pollutants arriving at the coast effectively impacted regions new south wales and sydney australia 4 toxins like endocrine disrupting chemicals and pharmaceuticals and personal care products discharged by sgd can cause tumors congenital disabilities and other developmental disorders to the fish in coastal waters these fishes when consumed can also cause similar disorders in humans nutrients when discharged through sgd can trigger toxic algal blooms this can cause severe health problems in humans sgd can also discharge fecal derived bacteria into the coastal waters which can cause skin irritations and gastrointestinal illnesses several environmental protection agencies worldwide have regulations for monitoring and controlling these toxins in coastal waters however the regulations are enforced only at an essential point of interest like beaches and harbors only a limited range of toxins and pollutants are measured increasing population and changes in land use near the coastal aquifers can release pollutants to the groundwater and coasts therefore frequent monitoring of coastal groundwater and seawater is necessary for all the regions of the world impacted regions liazhou bay and other bays in china hong kong hawaii usa mediterranean coast 5 unlike terrestrial aquifers coastal aquifers are hydraulically connected to the sea this makes them susceptible to seawater intrusion gryben herzberg s relation states that every meter of groundwater available above the mean sea level will have 40 m of fresh groundwater beneath so a decline of 0 1 m of groundwater in the coastal aquifer could shift the freshwater seawater interface by 4 m once the interface moves it may take several years to freshen the groundwater in coastal aquifers therefore strict regulatory practices are warranted in coastal aquifers to prevent saltwater intrusion which inhibits fresh groundwater availability to the coastal community impacted regions bays in china florida usa japan and korea 6 ecologically sensitive areas like mangroves tidal flats and coral reefs are sensitive to small changes in their ecosystem these regions also cycle and trap organic materials chemical elements and vital nutrients therefore these regions and other protected coastal ecosystems should be monitored for sgd derived nutrients and pollution impacted regions maowei sea and yellow sea china florida and hawaii usa australia 7 in cities where water resources are quickly running out sgd can be monitored to find the optimal pumping rate from the coastal aquifers this can help judiciously utilize the groundwater resources without saltwater intrusion and help monitor the arrival of pollutants to the sea in the process impacted regions shanghai chennai cape town and new york 8 sgd driven nutrient fluxes to the oligotrophic oceans from volcanic islands with highly permeable rocks are critical to the global ocean nutrient budgets sgd can be used in such islands and regions as a potential source of drinking water instead of deep groundwater we recommend the local government and stakeholders invest in the infrastructure and policies for the same impacted regions jeju island japan islands in western japan korea and indonesia 9 in japan and korea phytoplankton enriched by sgd transported nutrients increases oyster and shellfish production a phenomenon being exploited by the locals to create a coastal economy around aquaculture whereas in the mediterranean due to mining activities sgd act as a pollutant and the effects of metals on phytoplankton and fishes in aquaculture farms need to be monitored impacted regions japan korea north western mediterranean area 10 in the mediterranean sgd is known to input high concentrations of trace metals and other organic and inorganic compounds however researchers warn that the high concentrations found in seawater should not be directly attributed to sgd instead the concentrations must be verified at a seepage point at varying intervals a thorough investigation of all the probable causes of these high concentrations must be carried out to provide conclusive suggestions impacted regions spain croatia western mediterranean bays 6 conclusions fresh groundwater discharge to the sea is inevitable affecting both the inland and coastal waters our review summarizes the challenges and limitations in quantifying this discharge and provides an overview of its potential as a water resource significant challenges in quantifying the discharge include inconsistent sampling strategies and using different units to quantify the discharge uncertainties in modeling spatio temporal variations in discharge and difficulty in quantifying discharge at inaccessible areas mangroves large tidal flats and coral reefs some limitations discussed in this work are insufficient knowledge of coastal aquifer data geology and lack of historical hydrological data the indistinguishability of rsgd from fsgd the vulnerability of instruments like seepage meters to extreme weather conditions and modeling uncertainties are the other limitations we suggest strategies and focus areas where sgd can affect the economy or the health of the local communities while calling for strict policies for groundwater exploitation this work will help understand the challenges and limitations of the current scientific practices helping in overcoming them to get an accurate estimate of global sgd flux we believe sgd will play an essential role in the management of our coastal and marine ecosystems against the

manuscript 
11654,judicial use of submarine groundwater discharge sgd can be a potential water resource for countries facing water scarcity very few studies report the fluxes of sgd into the oceans especially from those countries that are located in the tropics and facing water scarcity another dimension of the sgd is its potential to control the biogeochemical cycles of nutrients and trace metals and the anthropogenic impact on the oceans this work attempts to give an overview of the challenges and limitations involved in achieving the above we have reviewed 1628 published literature that reported sgd in different contexts in the last 21 years the year 2000 to this date several studies exist in bits and pieces across the world s coastline with different methodologies adopted for identifying and quantifying the sgd this compilation has attempted to extract these findings and listed the challenges and limitations in estimating the sgd fluxes significant challenges in quantifying the discharge include inconsistent sampling strategies adopted by researchers uncertainties in modeling spatio temporal variations in discharge extreme weather conditions and difficulty in quantifying discharge at inaccessible areas mangroves large tidal flats etc some limitations discussed in this work include insufficient knowledge of coastal aquifer data geology and lack of historical hydrological data based on the critical analysis of the published literature we recommend a few solutions that can provide a better resolution in the quantification of sgd decision makers and water conservation professionals will benefit from this work as they can suitably plan the water management pollution control and sustainable extraction of the sgd we suggest strategies calling for assessments of sgd in areas of potentially significant discharge and developing new monitoring networks and strict policies for groundwater usage graphical abstract image 1 keywords challenges groundwater management limitations potable water source submarine groundwater discharge data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction throughout history a large part of civilization has evolved alongside the coast in modern times great metropolises like new york shanghai and chennai have developed due to the transport of commercial goods through the oceanic route and the strategic advantage of being in the coast these cities along with several others currently face potable water problems and are shifting focus on depleted groundwater resources as the current climate crisis worsens extreme weather conditions and scarcity of potable water will become frequent submarine groundwater discharge sgd offers a viable option in mitigating the situation for several years marine geologists and scientists have been trying to quantify the sources of this freshwater to the seawater selvam et al 2021 taniguchi et al 2019 it has only been in the 21st century that sgd has been regarded as an unappreciated water resource even in ancient times the occurrence of freshwater amidst the sea fascinated coastal communities several religious sites in the middle east and hawaii refer to this groundwater discharge as miracle water from heaven in several coastal communities of lebanon and syria in the past century sgd was used as a source of drinking water and transported to the local community centre by boats and plastic bottles many such practices can be found worldwide from australia to bahrain to hawaii moosdorf and oehler 2017 a need for research around sgd arises due to the multi faceted nature of the hydrological phenomenon it can enhance marine primary productivity and offer a medium to pollutants harming the marine ecosystem understanding the sources and the dynamics of the freshwater seawater interaction is also crucial to comprehending ocean nutrient and metal budgets we reviewed all the scientific research and review papers in this century n 1628 creating a vast database of 21st century literature focused on sgd leading to several interesting insights and discoveries this work will help the scientific community understand the challenges faced in previous studies and the limitations of currently available methods we also recommend region based management practices and implications to exploit the resource judiciously challenges are obstructions to the scientific method that can be improved upon or focus on neglected areas limitations are defined as obstructions to the research work that are too vast or impractical we classify our recommendations into technical and management aspects technical recommendations to help overcome the challenges faced by the researchers concerning identifying and quantifying sgd management recommendations to help the coastal communities and local stakeholders mitigate the drinking water crisis and protect the coastal ecosystem 2 impact of submarine groundwater discharge in the coastal environment the flow of sgd have varying effects on the ocean and the latter s response to nutrients delivered through sgd could increase or decrease the biological activity santos et al 2021 at some places the impact of sgd in the coastal environment is neutral unknown the positive negative and neutral impacts of sgd is given in fig 1 3 challenges 1 spatial and temporal variations one of the challenges in quantifying the sgd fluxes to the coast is the very high spatial and temporal variations of the seepage the flow of sgd is often patchy diffusive and temporally variable burnett et al 2006 fig 2 these variations are due to terrestrial hydraulic gradient seasonal changes in the groundwater table wave and tide induced pumping advection convection and shear santos et al 2012 the flow of sgd generally extends over a long distance however discharges through karstic aquifers occur as a point source georgiou 2014 post et al 2020 because of the concentrated seepage flux from karstic aquifers are easily identified and quantified throughout the world at sites where the discharge is patchy and diffusive methods like seepage meters are used to quantify the sgd fluxes taniguchi et al 2003 due to the nature and extent of the flow multiple seepage meters are required to quantify the accurate discharge rates burnett et al 2006 seepage measurements are carried out in a small area and the flux estimate is extrapolated to a larger region which may not provide the representative fluxes for the region to overcome this multiple seepage meters can be distributed throughout the study region but this method is labour intensive and impractical therefore at locations where the seepage is uniformly patchy and diffusive seepage meters can be used to estimate the seepage rates duque et al 2020 whereas at locations where seepage is non uniform radon mass balance can be used to estimate the total discharge at any site seepage meters have an advantage of estimating the sgd and to understand the small scale variability in the seepage 2 irregular sampling strategies quantifying riverine discharge of solutes and freshwater to the ocean has already been carried out for most rivers in the world devries et al 2014 these studies allow the researchers to understand global ocean biogeochemistry similarly global estimates of groundwater fluxes to the sea are essential to understand the role of sgd in ocean chemistry however due to the wide variety of sampling strategies available to quantify the sgd fluxes comparison or compilation of fluxes arrived by different methods can be difficult also fluxes are estimated in various units m3 day m3 m2 day year cm day and l day although some of these units can be converted and compared with others most of the fluxes could not be compared this is because the conversion requires several information of the study area which is generally not provided in the literature this makes comparing the values even more challenging for radon mass balance estimates the calculation used to quantify the fluxes differs from study to study also background radon activity in the inland and at the sea varies in every area with different geological formations meaning a higher background radon activity in coastal groundwater may record a high radon concentration in the sea even though the discharge is lower thus comparing the radon flux would not be enough to arrive at global sgd flux estimates most studies are done in point locations and the flux is quantified for that location since the seepage is highly spatially variable the discharge rates around the point location are considered unknown a few studies have overcome this by studying an extensive coastline identifying discharge zones and quantifying them anschutz et al 2016 therefore studying a large region and quantifying the fluxes for the entire region would help arrive at global sgd estimates faster 3 extreme weather conditions most sampling campaigns to quantify sgd fluxes are done in ideal calm weather conditions or after the coastal aquifer water levels are stabilized therefore the fluxes are quantified under the ideal flow conditions unlike riverine flow where the flux from an extreme storm event can be easily modeled using rainfall runoff methods sgd contribution is difficult to estimate because we lack an understanding of how the factors controlling the flow behave during extreme weather conditions although numerical simulations could provide some information on these processes we still lack the field data that confirms this behavior moore and wilson 2005 in regions where intermittent snowfall may contribute to aquifer recharge when it melts and is discharged as sgd mandal and zhang 2012 these areas are under threat due to global warming melting the snow and altering the freshwater and seawater interface extreme weather conditions jacob et al 2009 schubert et al 2014 schuler et al 2020 during the sampling may also affect the integrity of measurements for example seepage meters may be dislodged or the seepage bags could get affected by pressure exerted by the waves and currents burnett et al 2006 during radioisotope measurement rough sea conditions could increase the degassing of target isotopes in the atmosphere in this case the wind speed is measured during the measurement to nullify the effect george et al 2020 however the empirical equation to estimate the degassing is still being debated not perfect 4 delayed solute flux like surface estuaries subterranean estuaries ste cycle various nutrients and trace metals however we do not a have proper understanding of the solute exchange between freshwater and seawater a study carried out on the shores of cape cod ma usa found iron oxide deposits in the freshwater seawater interface of the ste charette and sholkovitz 2002 this iron was rock derived but precipitated in the ste when the oxygen rich seawater came in contact with the freshwater this precipitating iron also scavenges dissolved organic matter from the groundwater linkhorst et al 2017 and precipitated deposits are called iron curtain found to modulate the supply of dissolved organic matter to the sea other compounds like po4 3 are also adsorbed to the iron spiteri et al 2008 such precipitations continue forming during the dry seasons when the fresh saltwater interface grows due to water level drops in the coastal aquifers during wet seasons when the groundwater level increases in the coastal aquifers parts of precipitated compounds become mobile and reach the seawater linkhorst et al 2017 this delayed arrival of dissolved compounds reaching the sea could lead to higher concentrations of these compounds in seawater soon after the wet season the effects of these compounds in the sea could be wrongly attributed to other factors like rainfall runoff and riverine discharge however studying this can be challenging because it requires a quantification of groundwater discharge to the sea and a thorough assessment of inland aquifers and the mixing zone at regular intervals the contribution of these compounds elements at a delayed time is highly significant in some locations for instance the delayed arrival of radium and barium from the groundwater to the bay of bengal is comparable to the riverine contribution of radium and barium from the ganges brahmaputra river one of the world s most extensive river networks moore 1997 5 quantification of sgd from inaccessible locations mangroves large tidal flats coral reefs most studies carried out to quantify the sgd fluxes focus on a small area generally located at a major town city attraction due to the easy access to sampling very few studies are done in pristine locations and other ecosystems like mangroves and large tidal flats mangroves are known to regulate pco2 radon ammonium dissolved organic nitrogen manganese iron total dissolved nitrogen dissolved organic and inorganic carbon total dissolved phosphorus and ch4 gleeson et al 2013 macklin et al 2014 sadat noori et al 2017 sadat noori and glamore 2019 wadnerkar et al 2021 also mangrove ecosystems with high biological activity especially crab burrows could release more compounds than the ecosystems with less biological activity similarly tidal flats are known to regulate dissolved organic carbon dissolved hydrolyzable amino acids nitrates ammonium manganese co2 and iron beck et al 2017 2020 kim et al 2012 reckhardt et al 2015 santos et al 2015 sensitive and difficult to access areas like coral reef ecosystems backwaters fishponds and coastal wetlands are also known to regulate organic compounds paytan et al 2004 the released nutrients and organic compounds could support the microbenthic community and other biological activities adyasari et al 2020 utsunomiyaa et al 2015 therefore it is necessary to understand the process of controlling the solute fluxes through these ecosystems and its significance to global ocean biogeochemistry however access to these places can be complex and challenging especially for quantifying sgd through direct measurements like seepage meters 6 radon mass balance radon is enriched in groundwater by inherent geological deposits and is depleted in seawater this makes it an excellent tool for quantifying the sgd fluxes in coastal waters all radon mass balance methods use a mathematical equation to quantify the loss of radon to the atmosphere burnett et al 2006 this equation uses wind speed as a primary variable to estimate the mixing loss from the sea surface nightingale et al 2000 when the groundwater enriched with radon seeps into the seawater it immediately mixes with the seawater due to the convection caused by the density difference between the two waters prakash et al 2018 however the mixing could be slowed down if the groundwater is colder than seawater mccoy et al 2011 this temperature difference can retain the seepage water at the ocean floor until the seepage water and seawater reaches thermal equilibrium the effect is nullified in the shallow nearshore waters where tides and waves mix the seawater with the discharging groundwater however in shallow waters the degassing rate is higher due to the agitation in the water caused by tides and waves peterson et al 2009 most equations to estimate degassing do not consider the temperature and density differences between the seawater and seepage water which control the mixing effects like heavy winds and storm events before the sampling could also affect the mixing and accelerate the degassing of radon and can lower their concentrations in the sea martin et al 2007 4 limitations 1 seepage meters traditional seepage meters lee type are typically deployed in calm sea conditions iaea 2007 this makes it challenging to deploy the equipment to quantify the discharge especially in the nearshore areas where the seepage occurs cable and martin 2008 also traditional seepage meters can be affected in the seepage bags and tubing due to the rough sea conditions rosenberry 2008 rosenberry et al 2008 there are other kinds of seepage meters like heat pulse type seepage meters buoy type seepage meters dye displacement seepage meters tube seepage meters etc solder et al 2016 which can be deployed in rough sea conditions modern seepage meters can also collect and store the samples in individual sample containers at set intervals however these seepage meters are expensive and do not have high storage capacities and they have to be retrieved to collect the samples and replace new seepage bottles also collecting the samples from the seepage meters at frequent intervals is difficult therefore the traditional lee type seepage meter is still the most reliable for quantifying solute fluxes for seepage meters deployed in deeper waters trained divers are required garman et al 2011 some modern seepage meters come with an automatic logging facility where the seepage rates at certain time intervals are logged and the data can be sent through a transmitter mwashote et al 2010 this long term deployment of seepage meters at the ocean floor can dislodge or submerge sediment resuspension due to tides currents and eddies duque et al 2020 since seepage is patchy and diffusive in most locations multiple seepage meters are required to quantify the accurate discharge rates automatic seepage meters may help quantify the discharge rates with minimal human intervention however they are not cost effective therefore traditional seepage meters are the more viable in terms of cost and quantifying the solute fluxes 2 fresh and recirculated sgd fsgd and rsgd the contribution of solute fluxes through sgd is generally computed from samples collected through the seepage meter however seepage often occurs as brackish water due to tide and wave induced recirculation charette 2007 hermides et al 2020 this recirculated water is a mixture of fresh groundwater from the coastal aquifer with the infiltrated seawater thus the contribution of recirculated seawater in the seepage meter sample should be accounted for before estimating the nutrient solute budgets to the ocean failing to account the fresh and recirculated component could lead to unrepresentative volume and solute fluxes of sgd at the nearshore where terrestrial hydraulic gradients and tides control the flow fresh sgd contributes more during wet seasons and slowly declines towards the dry season the groundwater level lowers during the dry season and the resultant seepage water reflects the combination of freshwater and seawater this seepage is more a by product of the redox sensitive reactions in the subterranean estuary robinson et al 2007 this means some elements and compounds can be trapped or released from the ste the proportion of freshwater and seawater mixing and discharge can be differentiated by analyzing the electrical conductivity of the seepage water quantifying both freshwater and seawater end members the commonly used radon mass balance method is unable to differentiate between fresh and recirculated sgd this leads to the overestimation of nutrients derived through sgd using this method 3 thermal images density vs salinity vs temperature temperature indicates the presence of sgd at locations where the seawater and the discharging groundwater have temperature differences xing et al 2016 when the less dense groundwater discharges into the sea the freshwater rises and floats atop the seawater banks et al 1996 if this groundwater is warmer than the seawater the temperature difference can be picked up by thermal infrared sensors onboard satellites or unmanned aerial vehicles uav however if the temperature of the discharging groundwater is lower than the seawater it is discharging into the groundwater mixes with the bottom seawater and appears as a weak anomaly uavs are often preferred over satellite thermal images because of their higher spatial and spectral resolution and ability to image the study region at the preferred time unlike satellite images with poor temporal resolution 16 days interval for landsat 8 the average annual air temperature reflects the average groundwater temperature in surficial aquifers lasage et al 2008 therefore the viability of using thermal infrared images on an area can be assessed by comparing the difference between sea surface temperature sst and annual average air temperature this method cannot help identifying discharge from deeper confined aquifers because groundwater temperature in deeper aquifers cannot be determined remotely generally thermal images can identify a 2 c difference between seawater and discharging groundwater in calm sea conditions tamborski et al 2015 the rough sea conditions and high wind speeds on the coast could mix up the discharging sgd and seawater making it difficult to delineate the freshwater plume from the thermal images therefore a high volume of patchy and diffusive seepage spread over an extensive coastline can go unnoticed in thermal images rough sea conditions cloud cover atmospheric aerosol and humidity make the thermal images unsuitable for analysis fig 3 thermal images are also prone to the bay and bathymetry effect in the sea mallast et al 2013 affecting the signatures 4 lack of historical data historic estimates of sgd from the land to the sea have been done in some areas worldwide however loads of pollutants and nutrients discharged could never be estimated due to the lack of data these data include the land use and land cover variations in the coastal regions and the effects of the widespread use of fertilizers and pesticides groundwater chemistry and pollutants were also not documented in many coastal areas around the globe whales and other large marine organisms burial becomes a localized source of doc phosphate and ammonium in the groundwater or the seawater heiss 2020 the leachate plume from these burial sites could move towards the sea or inland depending on the hydraulic head difference between the groundwater and the seawater level when buried in shallow depths very close to the beach 25 m the leachate from the burial may attract sharks to the surf zone tucker et al 2019 since only a few incidents are reported and archived estimating solutes derived through the leachates to the sea is challenging similarly the presence of leach pits organic material burial landfill sites and other waste dump sites near the coast is not recorded to estimate the effect of these on the sea there s a dearth of data on emerging contaminants like pharmaceuticals and personal care products specifically designed to act on the living cells thus posing a threat to the ecosystem and human health a few studies have reported these contaminants presence through sgd in coastal waters mckenzie et al 2020 szymczycha et al 2012 2020 szymczycha et al 2020a b these contaminants are short lived and research has only recently been focused on detecting them in the environment therefore the impacts of these contaminants on the coastal ecosystem are unknown sgd may also cause algal blooms and fish kills in certain parts of the world liefer et al 2013 montiel et al 2019 in certain coastal waters sgd derived nutrient fluxes have led to high productivity fujita et al 2019 starke et al 2020 historical incidents of fish kills and increased productivity in the coastal waters may be attributed to sgd but the inferences are inconclusive due to the lack of past data 5 modeling uncertainties modeling the sgd along the coast has some advantages and disadvantages the advantage is its labor effectiveness and can be done in a laboratory disadvantages are that it requires more field data and accurate aquifer parameters to model discharge the most common uncertainty in all the models occurs when the results are extrapolated to a large area over a long time ci et al 2014 radon mass balance models are the most used to estimate the sgd fluxes in the sea uncertainties from these models include lack of background radon concentration in the ocean atmospheric degassing of radon and measurement of end member concentrations the presence of high waves and currents affects radon measurements in seawater and can influence the model results lineaments and other deep seated geological formations inland can increase the background measurements of radon in groundwater jacob et al 2009 and lead to underestimating sgd in coastal waters this can be avoided by averaging multiple radon activity values in the groundwater 6 duration of tides the duration and amplitude of tides vary drastically at different coastlines since tides and inland hydraulic gradients are the two major factors controlling the discharge the influence of different tides and tidal amplitudes at different locations have varying effects on discharge patterns yu et al 2019 this means a similar geological setup with different tidal conditions and slopes will have different discharge patterns and fluxes kuan et al 2019 similarly the freshwater seawater interface in the subterranean estuary and the flushing time and volume of recirculated seawater varies simulation based studies show the duration of tides and the specific storage of the aquifer control the total amount of recirculated discharge lee et al 2013 our current understanding of processes governing the duration of the tide and the residence time of recirculated seawater in a large tidal flat are still laboratory simulation based jiang et al 2014 mango et al 2004 therefore more field studies are needed to completely understand these processes and the quantum of discharge controlled by the kind of tides and tidal amplitudes 7 heterogeneity natural formations possess a considerable level of heterogeneity which means the coastal geological setup has discontinuities in them heiss et al 2020 quantification is made in a small area and the fluxes extrapolated throughout the study region debnath and mukherjee 2016 szymczycha et al 2012 may vary due to this natural heterogeneity for instance a discontinuous clay layer in the continental shelf may hinder freshwater flow to the sea also a fracture or a joint in the coastal hard rock formation could act as a conduit of freshwater into the coastal waters quantification of sgd has to be taken at more number of stations in areas where such heterogeneities exist to overcome the quantification errors this caution only applies to direct methods like seepage meters and porewater tracers indirect methods like radon temperature and other stable isotopes do not need a detailed geological setup of the study area since they measure the cumulative flux from the region to the coastal waters 8 si as sgd indicator siliceous phytoplankton dissolved silica has been used as a tracer for quantifying sgd in coastal water samples this is due to the enrichment of silica through long residence times of groundwater in coastal sandy aquifers there can be exceptions at some sites where siliceous phytoplankton are reported to consume the dissolved silica thus depleting the concentrations in seawater similarly other tracers are available to quantify the submarine groundwater discharge to the coastal waters nevertheless it is limited by the chemical reaction of these traces with seawater or the consumption of these nutrients by the primary productivity in the ocean 9 alternative methods small scale flows driven by advection convection gas bubble upwelling and sediment compaction occur at scales of millimeters to centimeters these flows constitute most of the recirculated sgd on a global scale since these flows occur everywhere at different magnitudes and on small scales it is difficult to quantify them methods like schlieren where the refractive properties of water used to detect fluid exchange and other multifunction sensors to study eddy correlation are available to identify and quantify the flux hu and hemond 2015 karpen et al 2004 the estimation of global fluxes through these methods may be challenging understanding the flow of sgd in deep sea conditions needs specialized equipment that operates under extreme pressure conditions gamma ray spectrometer operates in deep waters and pressures up to 456 105 pa and can measure the deep water sgd flows tsabaris et al 2008 mass balance estimate equations use the geometry and properties of geological materials in the coastal aquifer to quantify the sgd fluxes to the coast since coastal aquifers are not completely mapped in some parts of the world researchers delineate the aquifer from the geology of the study area this is not entirely accurate and can lead to errors in models 10 lakes inland water bodies not considered in modeling studies the source of sgd could either be meteoric recharge to the coastal unconfined aquifer or through surface water bodies like rivers estuaries ponds etc recent studies suggest that the discharging groundwater is a mix of rainfall recharge and effluent recharge from surface water bodies determining the source of groundwater discharged as sgd could help identify leaky surface water bodies and groundwater recharge to the water bodies determining the sources can be achieved by methods like stable isotope signature tracing determining source could also help track the exchange of pollutants between surface water and groundwater 5 recommendations 5 1 technical recommendations based on our review we recommend the following technical recommendations 1 cost efficient methodologies cost effective traces with high sample throughput could fuel research works throughout the globe and eventually help reach the global estimates of sgd similarly the usage of modern sensors and iot internet of things devices could reduce the manpower needed in the field 2 data sharing while quantifying the sgd fluxes multiple data on coastal aquifer parameters and geometry beach morphology ocean bathymetry and geochemistry are collected from the field this data includes dimension of aquifers length and width of the intertidal zone geochemical data etc we recommend that these data be available to researchers the public and decision makers this will enable researchers working on sgd to compare and reanalyze the data this would help the decision makers for better water resource management 3 bridging the gap between field and modeling studies a few studies have reported sgd flux through modeling and field techniques from the same locations however the quantified fluxes from the different approaches usually do not match and have significant differences between them narrowing these flux differences between the approaches by fine tuning the model is required for the long term estimates of sgd to the ocean 4 estimation of rsgd from arid coastlines shorelines next to arid regions and deserts where fresh sgd is not probable zhou et al 2019 recirculated sgd can be effectively quantified using the tidal prism approach in the laboratory these shorelines usually do not have a defined road network for regular field visits hence the tidal prism is the most affordable and can eliminate field visit costs 5 land use and land cover estimates land cover changes due to rapid urbanization may cause impermeability and reduce the recharge rates to the coastal aquifer rufí salís et al 2019 due to the infiltration and surface runoff ratio significant errors may arise in estimates that use outdated projected land use land cover statistics therefore updated land use and land cover statistics must be used in mass balance estimates for sgd 5 2 management recommendations we suggest strategies calling for assessments of sgd in areas of potentially significant discharge and the development of new monitoring networks including creating a regional groundwater management council for sustainable exploitation and solving local groundwater related issues 1 sgd in several instances causes severe problems for large scale constructions such as undersea tunnels and undersea storage facilities as seen in western japan thus regular monitoring of its impact is recommended 2 current knowledge suggests that sgd could increase or decrease the primary productivity of the coastal waters for instance sgd derived nutrients to the coastal waters have been found to promote coral reef production coral bleaching sustaining primary productivity in times of no river flow etc in contrast sgd is also a source of pollutants to the sea and causes coral bleaching in some places wang et al 2014 because of these highly variable effects of sgd on the coastal waters researchers suggest constant monitoring of both the nutrients and pollutant flux through groundwater discharge to the coastal waters impacted regions hawaii usa various bays in china like sanya and australia 3 draining coastal wetlands for agricultural cattle and development purposes could lead to inputs of acidic groundwater to coastal waterbodies therefore land cover changes and subsequent alterations to the coastal catchment should also be monitored to manage nutrients pollutants arriving at the coast effectively impacted regions new south wales and sydney australia 4 toxins like endocrine disrupting chemicals and pharmaceuticals and personal care products discharged by sgd can cause tumors congenital disabilities and other developmental disorders to the fish in coastal waters these fishes when consumed can also cause similar disorders in humans nutrients when discharged through sgd can trigger toxic algal blooms this can cause severe health problems in humans sgd can also discharge fecal derived bacteria into the coastal waters which can cause skin irritations and gastrointestinal illnesses several environmental protection agencies worldwide have regulations for monitoring and controlling these toxins in coastal waters however the regulations are enforced only at an essential point of interest like beaches and harbors only a limited range of toxins and pollutants are measured increasing population and changes in land use near the coastal aquifers can release pollutants to the groundwater and coasts therefore frequent monitoring of coastal groundwater and seawater is necessary for all the regions of the world impacted regions liazhou bay and other bays in china hong kong hawaii usa mediterranean coast 5 unlike terrestrial aquifers coastal aquifers are hydraulically connected to the sea this makes them susceptible to seawater intrusion gryben herzberg s relation states that every meter of groundwater available above the mean sea level will have 40 m of fresh groundwater beneath so a decline of 0 1 m of groundwater in the coastal aquifer could shift the freshwater seawater interface by 4 m once the interface moves it may take several years to freshen the groundwater in coastal aquifers therefore strict regulatory practices are warranted in coastal aquifers to prevent saltwater intrusion which inhibits fresh groundwater availability to the coastal community impacted regions bays in china florida usa japan and korea 6 ecologically sensitive areas like mangroves tidal flats and coral reefs are sensitive to small changes in their ecosystem these regions also cycle and trap organic materials chemical elements and vital nutrients therefore these regions and other protected coastal ecosystems should be monitored for sgd derived nutrients and pollution impacted regions maowei sea and yellow sea china florida and hawaii usa australia 7 in cities where water resources are quickly running out sgd can be monitored to find the optimal pumping rate from the coastal aquifers this can help judiciously utilize the groundwater resources without saltwater intrusion and help monitor the arrival of pollutants to the sea in the process impacted regions shanghai chennai cape town and new york 8 sgd driven nutrient fluxes to the oligotrophic oceans from volcanic islands with highly permeable rocks are critical to the global ocean nutrient budgets sgd can be used in such islands and regions as a potential source of drinking water instead of deep groundwater we recommend the local government and stakeholders invest in the infrastructure and policies for the same impacted regions jeju island japan islands in western japan korea and indonesia 9 in japan and korea phytoplankton enriched by sgd transported nutrients increases oyster and shellfish production a phenomenon being exploited by the locals to create a coastal economy around aquaculture whereas in the mediterranean due to mining activities sgd act as a pollutant and the effects of metals on phytoplankton and fishes in aquaculture farms need to be monitored impacted regions japan korea north western mediterranean area 10 in the mediterranean sgd is known to input high concentrations of trace metals and other organic and inorganic compounds however researchers warn that the high concentrations found in seawater should not be directly attributed to sgd instead the concentrations must be verified at a seepage point at varying intervals a thorough investigation of all the probable causes of these high concentrations must be carried out to provide conclusive suggestions impacted regions spain croatia western mediterranean bays 6 conclusions fresh groundwater discharge to the sea is inevitable affecting both the inland and coastal waters our review summarizes the challenges and limitations in quantifying this discharge and provides an overview of its potential as a water resource significant challenges in quantifying the discharge include inconsistent sampling strategies and using different units to quantify the discharge uncertainties in modeling spatio temporal variations in discharge and difficulty in quantifying discharge at inaccessible areas mangroves large tidal flats and coral reefs some limitations discussed in this work are insufficient knowledge of coastal aquifer data geology and lack of historical hydrological data the indistinguishability of rsgd from fsgd the vulnerability of instruments like seepage meters to extreme weather conditions and modeling uncertainties are the other limitations we suggest strategies and focus areas where sgd can affect the economy or the health of the local communities while calling for strict policies for groundwater exploitation this work will help understand the challenges and limitations of the current scientific practices helping in overcoming them to get an accurate estimate of global sgd flux we believe sgd will play an essential role in the management of our coastal and marine ecosystems against the
