7255,for forecasting monthly precipitation in an arid region the feed forward back propagation radial basis function and generalized regression artificial neural networks anns are used in this study the ann models are improved after incorporation of a markov chain based algorithm mc anns with which the percentage of dry months is forecasted perfectly thus generation of any non physical negative precipitation is eliminated due to the fact that recorded precipitation time series are usually shorter than the length needed for a proper calibration of ann models synthetic monthly precipitation data are generated by thomas fiering model to further improve the performance of forecasting for case studies from jordan it is seen that only a slightly better performance is achieved with the use of mc and synthetic data a conditional statement is therefore established and imbedded into the ann models after the incorporation of mc and support of synthetic data to substantially improve the ability of the models for forecasting monthly precipitation in arid regions keywords arid region artificial neural networks intermittent precipitation markov chain synthetic data thomas fiering model 1 introduction precipitation a driven factor of the hydrological cycle is an important component of practical water resources problems water resources development projects become much more dependent on precipitation in arid and semi arid regions as it is the unique source of water owing to the fact that surface water courses either do not exist or they are generally intermittent or ephemeral in such regions thus precipitation heavily contributes the groundwater storage the sole water income of dry climates as a result of this fact analysis and forecasting of precipitation ahead of time has always been an important problem in hydrological studies models using the previously recorded precipitation data i e precipitation history of the site under consideration in their input vector are beneficial when a simple model in terms of input data is needed to forecast future precipitation for this purpose the pioneering time series models the autoregressive integrated moving average arima techniques box and jenkins 1970 were popularly used during the 1970s delleur and kavvas 1978 whereas their periodic or seasonal versions are still prevalent soltani et al 2007 among the more recent soft computational technology anns are useful tools in hydrological meteorological and climatological practices jain et al 1999 sivakumar et al 2002 sudheer 2005 jayawardena et al 2006 zanetti et al 2007 aytek et al 2008 although concerns and criticisms regarding their applications in hydrology remain constant aksoy et al 2007 2008 koutsoyiannis 2007 there are many studies regarding ann application in semi arid regions to deal with several components of hydrological cycle evaporation evapotranspiration infiltration groundwater and runoff riad et al 2004 nourani et al 2008 rezaeian zadeh et al 2013 besides these studies nourani et al 2012 investigated the ability of ann models to estimate missing data of rain gauges in the ardabel plane in northwestern iran however when the general situation is considered ann application on arid region precipitation is very limited for jordan it is more scarce a few example to be mentioned with case studies from jordan has been made available by freiwan and cigizoglu 2005 dahamsheh and aksoy 2009 and aksoy and dahamsheh 2009 compared to the aforementioned special case studies for forecasting precipitation in jordan the present study considers a comprehensive ann modeling approach expected to be applicable to other cases from arid and semi arid parts in the world for this aim the feed forward back propagation ffbp radial basis function rbf and generalized regression gr ann models were developed for three meteorological stations in jordan the models were combined with markov chain mc and supported with synthetic precipitation data generated by thomas fiering tf model also a conditional statement was incorporated into the models to further improve their ability in forecasting precipitation for the sake of comparability the developed ann models use the same input vector for the three meteorological stations although it is clear that better models can always be obtained for each type of anns and for each case study owing to the black box structure of the modelling approach 2 study area and data jordan extends over an area of approximately 90 000 km2 in the semi arid to arid climatic region in the middle east it is a country that suffers from the water scarcity and its uneven distribution water shortage in the country is exacerbated by its high population growth socio economic development and continuous degradation in water quality more than 90 of the country receives an annual total precipitation less than 200 mm on average of which exceeding 90 evaporates back to the atmosphere therefore the total water demand in the country is much higher than the safe yield of all available groundwater and surface water resources including important water basins such as azraq that suffer from the depletion of groundwater level and eventually become completely dry al kharabsheh 2000 jordan has four climatological regions fig 1 the ghor jordan valley mountains hilly region the badia desert region and the aqaba gulf located in the western part of the country the ghor is the world s lowest valley it extends from the north to the south for about 400 km with a width varying from 10 km in the north to 30 km in the south the elevation in the ghor changes from 400 m below the mean sea level m s l up to 170 m below m s l its climate is classified as tropical which is very hot in summer and warm in winter with an annual precipitation of 150 250 mm to the east of the ghor is the mountainous region that extends from north to south with elevation reaching up to 1150 m above m s l its climate is rather mild in summer and cold in winter the annual precipitation changes between 300 and 600 mm to the east of the mountainous region is the badia a semi desert plateau which is characterized by dry hot summer and relatively cold dry winter with a precipitation of 40 100 mm over a year the aqaba region the most southern part in the country is characterized by a very hot summer and a warm winter with an annual precipitation not exceeding 50 mm three meteorological stations baqura amman and safawi operated by the jordan meteorological department were used in this study the stations were chosen such that they cover three climatological regions in jordan and that they also have long periods of records the aqaba climatological region was excluded since precipitation in this region is almost negligible fig 1 shows the layout of the stations over the country while statistical characteristics of the data are presented in table 1 the highest amount of precipitation is observed in baqura followed by amman due to its location in the desert safawi receives the least amount of annual total precipitation about 70 mm being more variable precipitation in the stations has a skewed frequency distribution the range between the minimum and the maximum precipitation is the highest for baqura and the lowest for safawi when the ratio between maximum and minimum precipitation is considered safawi is found the most variable station table 2 shows that monthly precipitation in the seven month dry period extending from april to october both inclusive remains well under the long term average four months june september within this period are completely dry with no precipitation at all when precipitation less than 1 mm per month is ignored even though the standard deviation shows similar patterns to the monthly total precipitation throughout the year it is seen that the dry period has more variable and more skewed precipitation at the three stations each month has been dry at least once during the 63 year observation period in safawi where 46 8 of the months receive no precipitation a pre treatment of the data set against homogeneity and presence of trend shows that precipitation in the three meteorological stations is homogeneous and has no trend at 95 of significance level there are no missing data in the time series thus the time series need no treatment for generating any missing data dahamsheh and aksoy 2007 3 methods ann models have been important tools in hydrology and water resources related research studies asce task committee 2000a b they are data based models which work empirically with infinite number of choices for their input output variables therefore various choices are tried to reach the required architecture in the ann modeling efforts ann models used in this study have already been well established and documented in the literature haykin 1999 thus they are not repeated herein but only briefed as follows 3 1 feed forward back propagation ffbp ann the ffbp ann consists of three or more layers input layer hidden layer s and output layer each with a certain number of neurons in the ffbp ann model number of neurons in the input and output layers is taken equal to the number of input independent and output dependent variables respectively while the number of neurons in the hidden layer is subject to a trial and error procedure with which the error between the observed variable and the model output is minimized using a proper function f the input variables x i i 1 n are processed in the hidden layer as 1 z j f i 1 n x i w ij b j j 1 h where wij is the weight of the connection from the ith input neuron to the jth hidden neuron and bj is the bias for the jth hidden neuron in this study one hidden layer was chosen it is noted from eq 1 that h neurons exist in the hidden layer the outputs of the hidden layer zj j 1 h are transformed to the final output by 2 y k f j 1 h z j w jk b k k 1 m where wjk is the weight of the connection from the jth hidden neuron to the kth output neuron and bk is the bias for the kth output neuron it is noted from eq 2 that m neurons exist in the output layer more information on this particular neural network model can be obtained from rumelhart et al 1986 3 2 radial basis function rbf ann the rbf ann consists of three layers input pattern and output in the pattern layer a radial basis function is fixed to transform the input vector x in a nonlinear fashion on a new vector as 3 z j ϕ x j 1 h and to produce the output of the model by 4 y k j 1 h z j w jk b k k 1 m more information on this particular neural network model is available in broomhead and lowe 1988 3 3 generalized regression gr ann the gr ann consists of four layers input pattern summation and output the input layer is made of input vectors each unit in the input layer is connected to the pattern layer the summation layer has two neurons called the s summation and d summation the final layer covers the output vector obtained for each input vector x i i 1 p where p is the number of elements in the training patterns the output is then given by 5 y i x i 1 p w i exp d x x i i 1 p exp d x x i where wi is the weight of the connection between the ith unit in the pattern layer and the s summation neuron d is a function also known as the gaussian d function used to pass the input layer units to the pattern layer more information on this particular neural network model can be found from specth 1991 4 model development and calibration the idea behind the modelling approach in this study is to forecast one month ahead precipitation in one single meteorological station by using characteristics of the previously recorded precipitation data in the same station one of the most important steps in developing a satisfactory ann forecasting model is the selection of appropriate input variables also important is the number of neurons in each layer as mentioned above to be determined by a trial and error effort the use of an ann model for forecasting time series implies that the input neurons are connected to a number of past observed values to identify the process at the future time steps it should be emphasized that it is aimed at identifying common input variables to approach the best fit curve for the three types of anns for the sake of comparability in the calibration of ann models appropriate input vector number of neurons type of activation functions spread coefficients when applicable etc are decided in this study different combinations of input vectors were constructed by maximizing the determination coefficient r 2 and minimizing the root mean square error rmse calculated for each case from the observed and forecasted precipitation as 6 r 2 i 1 n p o i p o p f i p f i 1 n p o i p o 2 i 1 n p f i p f 2 2 7 rmse i 1 n p o i p f i 2 n where pf i and po i show respectively the forecasted and observed total precipitation in month i which goes up to the total number of months n also the unit slope and zero intercept were aimed at the best fit line of the scatter diagram established between the observed and the forecasted precipitation time series antecedent precipitation was used to construct an appropriate input layer of the forecasting model in this study as precipitation is a periodic process a periodic component was also considered among the input variables which is calculated by 8 p t sin 2 π t 12 cos 2 π t 12 where t is number assigned to the month of the year i e t 1 for january and t 12 for december different combinations of input variables were investigated a long list of combinations of input variables was tested to construct the models for the three stations studied herein in the trial and error of the selection of the input variables it was seen that the model performance increased significantly with each additional antecedent precipitation and the periodic component after several combinations tested finally the best trained model was obtained when the precipitation of one two and twelve previous months xt 1 xt 2 xt 12 were used in the input vector together with the periodic component pt as 9 x t f x t 1 x t 2 x t 12 p t this has been the case for the three meteorological stations studied another point revealed by the trial and error efforts is that inclusion of the previous year s precipitation was indispensable in order to train the model sufficiently as briefed earlier in the case of ffbp ann the number of input and output variables directly gives the number of neurons in the input and output layers respectively however in order to decide on the number of neurons in the hidden layer of each model tested the number of neurons was changed from n to 2n where n is the number of input variables in this study before using in the training process data sets were non dimensionalized as 10 x n x 0 x min x max x min where xn and xo represent the non dimensional and original training data and xmin and xmax correspond to the minimum and maximum values in the original training data in this study the ann models were run for the monthly precipitation data of the baqura amman and safawi meteorological stations in jordan fig 1 monthly data of the first 28 73 and 53 years i e 336 876 and 636 months of the respective station were used to calibrate the models for the three stations the last ten years 120 months covering the common period of 1996 2005 were used for validating the models minimum rmse and maximum r2 were obtained when 7 7 and 5 neurons in the hidden layer were used for baqura amman and safawi stations respectively the final ffbp ann models were decided to have the structure of 4 7 1 for baqura and amman and 4 5 1 for safawi the sigmoid function was used as the activation function between the hidden and output layers both the input and output of the model were scaled appropriately to fall within the function limits zero to one the ffbp ann was trained by using the levenberg marquardt training algorithm while training the networks the number of epochs was kept at 25 an epoch being the number of times the algorithm sees the training input and or output vectors for the calculation of new weights and biases sinha et al 2010 the adaptive scalar that controls the learning process was set to 0 001 for the rbf ann model the best fit structure was obtained when 26 38 and 37 neurons in the pattern layer were used for baqura amman and safawi respectively the final structure of the rbf ann models became 4 26 1 for baqura 4 38 1 for amman and 4 37 1 for safawi the spread parameter was found to be equal to 5 decided by trial and error for the selected stations similarly the gr ann structure was established as 4 x 1 for the three stations the spread parameter for the selected stations was found to be equal to 0 06 in the rbf and gr anns the gaussian activation function was used for the pattern layers and the linear function for the output layers the model input and output were scaled appropriately to fall within the function limit zero to one as in the other types of ann models the models developed and calibrated as above are called regular ann models in this study the best calibration was obtained for the ffbp ann among the three ann models another important observation was that the wetter the region the better the calibration in other words better forecasts were obtained in wet stations baqura and amman and worse results in the dry station safawi 5 model improvement and calibration 5 1 regular model preliminary modelling efforts on the amman meteorological station using the ffbp ann have shown that construction of an ann model and selection of proper inputs are tremendously important and time consuming dahamsheh and aksoy 2009 upon selecting the input variables further modelling studies using data from baqura and safawi stations were performed the rbf and gr ann models were also run for the three precipitation data amman baqura and safawi thus the total number of case studies are nine three case studies for each of the three models detailed in aksoy and dahamsheh 2009 results of the case studies of the regular models in this study were not found as good as advertised in the usual ann practice probably due to two facts i a coarse time interval e g month is used and ii a two phase data intermittency in arid region precipitation is applied therefore it is concluded that use of additional tools as explained below are needed to improve the models for making better forecasts 5 2 markov chain incorporated model in the regular ann models negative values were generated for precipitation in summer months aksoy and dahamsheh 2009 which were all replaced with zero to avoid the physical unjustification as an improvement to overcome this difficulty markov chain mc was incorporated into the regular ann models this provides the model the ability of forecasting months with and without precipitation by preventing generation of negative precipitation this is called markov chain incorporated ann mc ann model as presented in dahamsheh and aksoy 2014 in the mc ann model it is first checked with the mc part of the model if precipitation is observed or not in a particular month of the year i e if a given month is wet or dry when the mc part of the model forecasts a dry month a zero precipitation is assigned to this particular month when a wet month is forecasted by the mc part of the model the ann part of the model is run to assign a non zero value for precipitation in the month a two state 1 0 mc can ideally be used for forecasting the state of the month wet and dry where 1 stands for a wet month and 0 for a dry month the transition probability matrix of the 1 0 markov chain can be given as 11 p i j p 11 p 10 p 01 p 00 where p ij shows the probability matrix of transition from a month with state i to a month with state j probability of transition from state i to state j can be calculated as 12 p ij n ij j n ij i j 0 1 where nij is the total number of months with state j following a month with state i the probabilities are determined for each month of the year because of seasonal effects the sum of each row in the probability matrix satisfies 13 j p ij 1 thus the number of parameters required is two resulting in 24 parameters in total at monthly basis calibration of mc by using the calibration data set covers the determination of mc transition probabilities presented in table 3 are transition probabilities calculated considering the monthly total precipitation of each station dash in september for amman means that this particular month has never been wet during the calibration period similarly the period from january to march has never been dry the same interpretation is valid for other stations at the calibration stage of the mc ann models it was observed that none of the models were improved substantially compared to the regular ann models although the problem of the physically unjustifiable negative precipitation was removed only a very minor improvement was obtained in the performance of the models for all case studies not only because of the lower performance but also due to the fact that existing data sets are usually much shorter than required and as indicated by cigizoglu 2003 longer data might improve the ability of the ann modeling tool a synthetic data generation mechanism was proposed in the model improvement as explained in the following sub section 5 3 synthetic data supported model in order to extend the length of input data synthetic monthly precipitation with similar statistical characteristics of the observed monthly precipitation time series were generated by the thomas and fiering 1962 model which has the general expression of 14 x i 1 x j 1 b j x i x j t i s j 1 1 r j 2 in which xi is the interested variable precipitation in this study of month i x j average precipitation in month j bj regression coefficient ti normally distributed number with zero mean and unit variance sj standard deviation of month j and ri the correlation coefficient the regression coefficient is defined by 15 b j r j s j 1 s j for each month of the year one thomas fiering model was established 12 models in total each model with three parameters which are the average standard deviation and correlation coefficient as can be seen from eq 14 the data were normalized by taking the square root of each observation before the models are established statistical characteristics average standard deviation skewness coefficient the first order auto correlation coefficient maximum and minimum precipitation of the observed and simulated precipitation time series have shown that the average was generated perfectly also standard deviation was found very close to the observed value even the skewness coefficient could be considered well preserved the autocorrelation coefficient was found similar to its observed counterpart during summer months in particular maxima and minima in winter months were higher than the observed values while they fit during spring summer and autumn as a final statement on the synthetic precipitation data it can be said that the synthetic data generated by the thomas fiering model is statistically acceptable and can be used for the calibration of the ann models in this study the synthetic precipitation data were used together with the observed data of each station until 1995 inclusive for the calibration of the mc incorporated ann models in the calibration the weights in the layers of the model were determined to end up with the mc incorporated ann model supported with synthetic data smc ann although an increase was expected in their performances with longer input data none of the smc ann models performed substantially better than the mc ann models in either of the nine case studies only a very minor improvement was observed in the performance of the models which can be considered null it was thought that the performance of the models was less influenced by the input data length but more by the model structure needing further improvement this was considered by taking a conditional statement into account in the model structure as explained in the following sub section 5 4 conditional model in jordan the within year periodical change in precipitation is typical to a northern hemisphere arid region where precipitation decreases from winter to summer increases from autumn to winter and is zero during summer months any precipitation model which does not consider the periodicity either under or over estimates precipitation that has been the case in this study for the regular ann models as well as their versions improved with the mc incorporation or supported with synthetic data one solution to overcome this difficulty could be the use of a model for each month of the year which will then have practical concerns due to high number of parameters to be estimated at monthly time scale in this study a model to be generalized for the whole year was considered from which a lower performance might be expected compared to a set of models to be constructed for each month the low performance of the regular ann models and the minor increase in the performance of their versions improved with mc incorporation and synthetic data support have been the motivation of this study to further improve the models particularly underestimation of higher precipitation is remarkable in the models it is seen that the models are able to reach up to a maximum level much lower than the observed maximum in other words the observed maxima can hardly be exceeded by the models this is mainly connected to the above periodicity which has not been considered in the models it was therefore thought that a conditional statement could work well to take the periodicity into account for the improvement of the models an empirically derived conditional statement was found effective in increasing the performance of the models substantially for the three case studies it takes the seasonality in the precipitation into account and reduces the higher effect of lower precipitation that prevents forecasting maxima and the higher effect of higher precipitation that prevents forecasting minima the model in which such a conditional statement is used was called mc incorporated and synthetic data supported conditional ann model smc cann that runs as in the flowchart in fig 2 in the smc cann model precipitation of the current month is forecasted with providing inputs in eq 9 into the model it is checked if the forecasted precipitation of the current month is higher or not than the precipitation of either two previous months the statement can be given in mathematical form as 16 x t 1 x t x t 1 0 x t 2 x t x t 2 0 for t which means precipitation in the previous two months are taken zero in the model when the condition x t 1 x t or x t 2 x t is satisfied the forecasting is repeated for any month t satisfying the condition by taking precipitation zero in two preceding months as stated in eq 16 the conditional statement decreases the weight of the preceding two months when x t 1 x t or x t 2 x t while the weight of other independent variables xt 12 and pt in eq 9 increases in estimating xt precipitation in the current month the weight of the independent variables in the ann models changes accordingly by using the conditional statement the use of the conditional statement allows the model to approach the receding precipitation period from winter to summer by lowering the effect of the high precipitation months preceding the month to be forecasted similarly the increasing period of precipitation is better captured by decreasing the weight of preceding months with low precipitation in the autumn winter period this allows the model to capture maximum values of precipitation the mc incorporated and synthetic data supported ffbp smc ffbp ann model was calibrated under the conditional statement to be called the mc incorporated synthetic data supported conditional ffbp smc cffbp ann model for the amman meteorological station the best model outputs were obtained when six neurons were taken in the hidden layer of the ann network of 4 6 1 for safawi and baqura 7 neurons were found better to propose the architecture of 4 7 1 the models have one output precipitation for the three meteorological stations results of the nine case studies were finally found good at the calibration stage this has been achieved with forecasting precipitation well approaching the observed precipitation therefore the conditional mc incorporated ann models supported by synthetic data are proposed for monthly precipitation forecasting in arid regions such as jordan in middle east 6 validation of the models and additional performance criteria monthly data of the last 120 months 10 years extending over the common period of 1996 2005 of the three stations were used for the validation of the ann models performance criteria considered for the validation of the models are the determination coefficient r 2 in eq 6 to be maximized and the root mean square error rmse in eq 7 to be minimized also the unit slope and zero intercept were aimed at the best fit line of the scatter diagram established between the observed and the forecasted precipitation for more details results of the ann models were presented in plots by using additional performance criteria explained as follows the 10 year 120 month time series of the observed and forecasted monthly total precipitation were presented to simply compare the observed and the forecasted monthly total precipitation in order to understand how the proposed model performs throughout the validation period the residual time series was also obtained in this study the residual was defined as 17 r p f p o this simply corresponds to the difference between the forecasted and observed monthly total precipitation pf and po respectively as long as the residual time series has a similar variation throughout the validation period it is said that the model has the same performance let us say at the end of the validation period that the model generates a residual time series with a higher variability than that at the beginning this means the model could make more reliable forecasts at the beginning of the validation period than at the end in other words the reliability of the model is reduced with time in the validation period it might also be interesting to know in which month the model performs well for this purpose monthly mean residuals were plotted both the absolute and relative errors were calculated absolute value of the error is important to show the fluctuation of the forecasted values from their observed counterparts the relative error is required in order to see if the model under or over estimates however such a graph is not dimensionless and hence not comparable between months of the year therefore the dimensionless version of the residual was calculated by dividing the mean residual with the mean value of the total precipitation of each month in dry months with no precipitation the dimensionless residual was not calculated finally the diagram of the observed and the forecasted precipitation was given to show how the observed versus the forecasted precipitation scatter around the 1 1 perfect line the best fit line of the forecast was also given on the scatter diagram all these additional performance criteria were used for the analysis and discussion of results given in the following section 7 results of validation and discussion validation of the regular ann models is detailed below after which the step by step improved versions are displayed for the baqura meteorological station case study results of the regular ffbp rbf and gr ann models for baqura the wettest station are respectively presented in figs 3 5 compared to the rbf and gr ann models it is seen from fig 3 that the ffbp ann model performs better in capturing the maximum values negative values are rare and small in quantity it should also be noticed that in the ffbp ann model the slope of the best fit line is higher and the intercept is lower than that obtained with the rbf and gr ann models figs 3 5 the monthly mean residual is found to be less fluctuating and the dimensionless residual is much smaller when september with monthly mean total precipitation of 0 02 mm is ignored fig 3d very similar but slightly worse results than the ffbp were obtained with the rbf ann model fig 4 the worst results of the three competing models were found in the case of gr ann with which the residual range approached 400 mm and the mean absolute error exceeded 40 mm fig 5 the gr ann model is the worst particularly in the summer season during which relatively good performances were obtained by the ffbp and rbf ann models however this model is advantageous over the ffbp and rbf models because it does not generate the physically meaningless negative precipitation forecasts in table 4 results obtained from the validation of the regular ann models are presented the ffbp model seems to be better than the other two models for the two wet stations baqura and amman while the rbf model performs better for safawi the dry station the ffbp and rbf models compete for the best however even though it is not a concrete conclusion an in depth look at the results of these two models shows that the rbf model performs better than the ffbp model for low precipitation the models are not satisfactory particularly in approaching the maxima observed in the time series this has been the main drawback of previous models developed by freiwan and cigizoglu 2005 dahamsheh and aksoy 2009 and aksoy and dahamsheh 2009 forecasts of freiwan and cigizoglu 2005 were strictly limited to a threshold that was much lower than the observed maximum thus maxima in the precipitation were considerably underestimated also dahamsheh and aksoy 2009 was not successful in approaching the maxima although compared to freiwan and cigizoglu 2005 slightly better results were obtained this problem has been paid an important and particular attention by aksoy and dahamsheh 2009 in the development of the model architecture such that higher maxima can be obtained however results were still not perfect as a continuation of the mentioned efforts this study as well cannot be considered fully successful in that sense when the regular ann models are used without additional tools therefore a step by step improvement is suggested in this study to forecast the maxima as high as their observed values first ann models were incorporated with markov chains for this aim the performance criteria of the mc incorporated ann models is given in figs 6 8 from which it is seen that the mc ffbp and mc rbf ann models are as good as each other while both are clearly better than the mc gr ann model in replicating the observed precipitation time series the mc ffbp is slightly better than the mc rbf an argument to support this statement is that the slope of the best fit line is closer to one and the intercept is closer to zero in the mc ffbp model in fig 6 than the rbf in fig 7 also maximum values were relatively better captured by the ffbp than the rbf it is noted that highest maxima were generated by the mc gr model fig 8a but not in an appropriate time similar results were obtained for the baqura station while results for the other station safawi were not that satisfactory this is important to note again that the performance of the ann models becomes worse with the aridity of the region studied e g forecast for the safawi station is the worst due to its location in the desert region of the country as summarized in table 5 although it is not very satisfactory it is seen that the best performance criteria were captured by the mc ffbp ann model the mc rbf ann model had almost the same performance comparison of the mc incorporated models with the regular models shows that the increase in the performance is null the only improvement achieved is the determination of dry months with no precipitation preventing the model to generate non physical negative precipitation although they were rare in number and small in quantity based on all these findings it should be emphasized that none of the models were found to be outstanding in forecasting the observed monthly total precipitation therefore a further improvement was adopted in the model the mc incorporated ann models were supported with synthetic data the performance criteria of the mc incorporated ann models supported with synthetic data are given in figs 9 11 in fig 9a it is seen that the smc ffbp ann model is better in forecasting lower precipitation than higher precipitation although positive residuals in fig 9b demonstrate that precipitation is generally overestimated however when high values peaks of precipitation are concerned the model underestimates mean absolute error and mean relative error in fig 9c show that the forecasted precipitation is higher than the observed values throughout the year except for summer months in the period from june to september it is seen that the forecasted precipitation is close to the observed precipitation mean absolute error in fig 9c shows that error in the forecast of the winter precipitation is higher the dimensionless version of the error in fig 9d points may with the highest error while other months of the year have lower values of error between the forecasted and observed precipitation relative to the monthly average precipitation the scatter diagram finally demonstrates that lower precipitation was found higher and higher precipitation lower in general fig 9e the synthetic data supported mc incorporated rbf smc rbf ann model is not good in forecasting high precipitation fig 10a in general lower precipitation is overestimated while underestimated higher precipitation is foreseen fig 10b mean errors in fig 10c show that precipitation is overestimated in rainy seasons from june to september precipitation is forecasted at the same order with observation although mean absolute error looks high in winter fig 10c the dimensionless error shows that the error is not that big indeed fig 10d by looking at the scatter diagram in fig 10e it is seen that lower precipitation is overestimated while higher precipitation is underestimated as in the previous model fig 11 shows clearly that the smc gr ann model is less successful than the smc ffbp and smc rbf ann models relatively higher residuals lower slope and higher intercept in the best fit curve show the less successful performance of this particular model compared to the other two based on the performance criteria calculated in table 6 it is seen that the smc ffbp is the best among the models supported by the synthetic data based on comparison of table 6 with table 5 it is seen that support given by the synthetic data to the mc incorporated models does not provide a substantial improvement to the forecasting ability of the models i e the additional data used in the calibration of the models do not improve forecasting ability of the models this has been the case for the three ann models finally when the performance of the mc incorporated and synthetic data supported conditional ann smc cann models is concerned figs 12 14 are provided results of the smc cffbp ann model are shown in fig 12 which depicts that the model is very successful compared to its previous versions particularly in approaching the maximum and minimum values of precipitation the closeness of the best fit line of the scatter diagram between the observed and forecasted precipitation to the 1 1 line shows how successful the model is in forecasting in the rbf case under the same inputs xt 1 xt 2 xt 12 pt the spread coefficient was taken as 5 when three neurons were used in the hidden layer to obtain the 4 3 1 model in the same manner models with structures of 4 27 1 and 4 13 1 with the best spread coefficients 5 and 13 were obtained for the safawi and baqura stations respectively it is seen that the smc crbf ann model is capable to provide good results in approaching the maximum and minimum precipitation fig 13 although scattered in a wide range it is noticed that the maximum precipitation was well captured by the model again using the same inputs for the three stations the best model was constructed with a spread coefficient 0 02 for the smc cgr ann model it is seen that the smc cgr ann model is good enough in forecasting the high and low values of precipitation fig 14 the best fit line to the scatter diagram is very close to the perfect fit line the outputs of the smc cffbp ann models show clearly that the models have tremendously overcome the difficulty in approaching the minimum and maximum precipitation values errors were reduced considerably although mean error demonstrates that the precipitation is generally overestimated the scatter diagram of the three models indicates that the variability in the scattering is not that big and the best fit line well approached the 1 1 perfect fit line when table 7 is considered the smc cffbp ann model is found the best among the three models used for the three case studies it is worthy to mention that the rbf with its improved version competes with the ffbp in baqura the wet region however it should be mentioned that it lost its advantageous performance in the dry region safawi when it is used in the regular form without improvement fig 15 summarizes the performance of the three models and their improved versions on the three meteorological stations the performance criteria were all sketched to understand how the models performed better with each improvement the regular ann model denoted as model 1 is given first after which the mc incorporated ann mc ann model model 2 synthetic data supported and mc incorporated ann smc ann model model 3 and the synthetic data supported and mc incorporated conditional ann smc cann model model 4 is given it is seen from all performance criteria in fig 15 that model 2 performs slightly better than model 1 and model 3 better than model 2 however the increase in the performance of model 4 is substantial this statement can be linked to the increase in the determination coefficient and the slope of the best fit line and to the decrease in the rmse and the intercept of the best fit line this is a fact for all models all case studies and performance criteria in short the conditional statement improved the models one among the possible reasons for not obtaining outputs at the desired level of accuracy might be the intermittent structure of the precipitation zero values in the precipitation time series often prevent the models to produce high values of precipitation when two data sets coming from two populations zero and non zero with different characteristics from each other are considered together in one dataset improvement to ann models applied in this study is composed of a combined series of methods including markov chain synthetic time series and a case specific conditional statement this is a hybridization procedure that has been useful in forecasting monthly intermittent precipitation in three meteorological stations in an arid region with a possible generalization potential after further case studies for different conditions are performed alternative hybrid models can be discovered to improve the forecasting ability of the models wavelet incorporated ann model of nourani et al 2009 can be mentioned as an example among many existing in the literature 8 conclusions based on results of the study following conclusions may be drawn 1 ann models are constructed based on a trial and error procedure therefore none of the ann models in this study turns out to be the best choice as there may always exist better models with another architecture different activation functions or spread coefficients when applicable 2 higher variability of precipitation in arid regions prevents ann models to perform well in other words increasing variability reduces the success of the models in approaching the observed precipitation sequence therefore intermittent monthly precipitation data of semi arid and arid regions should be analyzed with more care than perennial precipitation time series of humid regions 3 some of potential limitations of the models discussed herein can be eliminated and improvements in the model performance can be achieved by monthly analysis monthly models can be proposed at the expense of increase in model parameters weights and biases dry and wet periods in the year can be modeled separately if a parsimonious model is desired and if the monthly analysis is therefore found too costly in terms of model parameters the observed data can simply be divided into two portions for instance over and under the long term average precipitation to be taken as a threshold models can then be constructed separately for each portion 4 some helping tools should be incorporated into the forecasting models if it becomes necessary to analyze the intermittent monthly precipitation within the year as a whole for instance mcs are used in this study together with anns good results with forecasting the occurrence and non occurrence of precipitation were obtained and negative precipitation forecasted by ann models was eliminated 5 data required for the calibration of ann models can be extended by means of synthetic data generation methods existing in stochastic hydrology this might be helpful in improving the performance of the models which have been better trained with longer data however not substantially better results are obtained when mc and synthetic data are used to improve the ann models for forecasting the arid region precipitation 6 as a final effort to improve the model performance an empirical statement conditioning on the precipitation is considered the statement reduces the weight of lower precipitation on higher precipitation and the weight of higher precipitation on lower precipitation this allows the model to much better forecast precipitation in an arid region 
7255,for forecasting monthly precipitation in an arid region the feed forward back propagation radial basis function and generalized regression artificial neural networks anns are used in this study the ann models are improved after incorporation of a markov chain based algorithm mc anns with which the percentage of dry months is forecasted perfectly thus generation of any non physical negative precipitation is eliminated due to the fact that recorded precipitation time series are usually shorter than the length needed for a proper calibration of ann models synthetic monthly precipitation data are generated by thomas fiering model to further improve the performance of forecasting for case studies from jordan it is seen that only a slightly better performance is achieved with the use of mc and synthetic data a conditional statement is therefore established and imbedded into the ann models after the incorporation of mc and support of synthetic data to substantially improve the ability of the models for forecasting monthly precipitation in arid regions keywords arid region artificial neural networks intermittent precipitation markov chain synthetic data thomas fiering model 1 introduction precipitation a driven factor of the hydrological cycle is an important component of practical water resources problems water resources development projects become much more dependent on precipitation in arid and semi arid regions as it is the unique source of water owing to the fact that surface water courses either do not exist or they are generally intermittent or ephemeral in such regions thus precipitation heavily contributes the groundwater storage the sole water income of dry climates as a result of this fact analysis and forecasting of precipitation ahead of time has always been an important problem in hydrological studies models using the previously recorded precipitation data i e precipitation history of the site under consideration in their input vector are beneficial when a simple model in terms of input data is needed to forecast future precipitation for this purpose the pioneering time series models the autoregressive integrated moving average arima techniques box and jenkins 1970 were popularly used during the 1970s delleur and kavvas 1978 whereas their periodic or seasonal versions are still prevalent soltani et al 2007 among the more recent soft computational technology anns are useful tools in hydrological meteorological and climatological practices jain et al 1999 sivakumar et al 2002 sudheer 2005 jayawardena et al 2006 zanetti et al 2007 aytek et al 2008 although concerns and criticisms regarding their applications in hydrology remain constant aksoy et al 2007 2008 koutsoyiannis 2007 there are many studies regarding ann application in semi arid regions to deal with several components of hydrological cycle evaporation evapotranspiration infiltration groundwater and runoff riad et al 2004 nourani et al 2008 rezaeian zadeh et al 2013 besides these studies nourani et al 2012 investigated the ability of ann models to estimate missing data of rain gauges in the ardabel plane in northwestern iran however when the general situation is considered ann application on arid region precipitation is very limited for jordan it is more scarce a few example to be mentioned with case studies from jordan has been made available by freiwan and cigizoglu 2005 dahamsheh and aksoy 2009 and aksoy and dahamsheh 2009 compared to the aforementioned special case studies for forecasting precipitation in jordan the present study considers a comprehensive ann modeling approach expected to be applicable to other cases from arid and semi arid parts in the world for this aim the feed forward back propagation ffbp radial basis function rbf and generalized regression gr ann models were developed for three meteorological stations in jordan the models were combined with markov chain mc and supported with synthetic precipitation data generated by thomas fiering tf model also a conditional statement was incorporated into the models to further improve their ability in forecasting precipitation for the sake of comparability the developed ann models use the same input vector for the three meteorological stations although it is clear that better models can always be obtained for each type of anns and for each case study owing to the black box structure of the modelling approach 2 study area and data jordan extends over an area of approximately 90 000 km2 in the semi arid to arid climatic region in the middle east it is a country that suffers from the water scarcity and its uneven distribution water shortage in the country is exacerbated by its high population growth socio economic development and continuous degradation in water quality more than 90 of the country receives an annual total precipitation less than 200 mm on average of which exceeding 90 evaporates back to the atmosphere therefore the total water demand in the country is much higher than the safe yield of all available groundwater and surface water resources including important water basins such as azraq that suffer from the depletion of groundwater level and eventually become completely dry al kharabsheh 2000 jordan has four climatological regions fig 1 the ghor jordan valley mountains hilly region the badia desert region and the aqaba gulf located in the western part of the country the ghor is the world s lowest valley it extends from the north to the south for about 400 km with a width varying from 10 km in the north to 30 km in the south the elevation in the ghor changes from 400 m below the mean sea level m s l up to 170 m below m s l its climate is classified as tropical which is very hot in summer and warm in winter with an annual precipitation of 150 250 mm to the east of the ghor is the mountainous region that extends from north to south with elevation reaching up to 1150 m above m s l its climate is rather mild in summer and cold in winter the annual precipitation changes between 300 and 600 mm to the east of the mountainous region is the badia a semi desert plateau which is characterized by dry hot summer and relatively cold dry winter with a precipitation of 40 100 mm over a year the aqaba region the most southern part in the country is characterized by a very hot summer and a warm winter with an annual precipitation not exceeding 50 mm three meteorological stations baqura amman and safawi operated by the jordan meteorological department were used in this study the stations were chosen such that they cover three climatological regions in jordan and that they also have long periods of records the aqaba climatological region was excluded since precipitation in this region is almost negligible fig 1 shows the layout of the stations over the country while statistical characteristics of the data are presented in table 1 the highest amount of precipitation is observed in baqura followed by amman due to its location in the desert safawi receives the least amount of annual total precipitation about 70 mm being more variable precipitation in the stations has a skewed frequency distribution the range between the minimum and the maximum precipitation is the highest for baqura and the lowest for safawi when the ratio between maximum and minimum precipitation is considered safawi is found the most variable station table 2 shows that monthly precipitation in the seven month dry period extending from april to october both inclusive remains well under the long term average four months june september within this period are completely dry with no precipitation at all when precipitation less than 1 mm per month is ignored even though the standard deviation shows similar patterns to the monthly total precipitation throughout the year it is seen that the dry period has more variable and more skewed precipitation at the three stations each month has been dry at least once during the 63 year observation period in safawi where 46 8 of the months receive no precipitation a pre treatment of the data set against homogeneity and presence of trend shows that precipitation in the three meteorological stations is homogeneous and has no trend at 95 of significance level there are no missing data in the time series thus the time series need no treatment for generating any missing data dahamsheh and aksoy 2007 3 methods ann models have been important tools in hydrology and water resources related research studies asce task committee 2000a b they are data based models which work empirically with infinite number of choices for their input output variables therefore various choices are tried to reach the required architecture in the ann modeling efforts ann models used in this study have already been well established and documented in the literature haykin 1999 thus they are not repeated herein but only briefed as follows 3 1 feed forward back propagation ffbp ann the ffbp ann consists of three or more layers input layer hidden layer s and output layer each with a certain number of neurons in the ffbp ann model number of neurons in the input and output layers is taken equal to the number of input independent and output dependent variables respectively while the number of neurons in the hidden layer is subject to a trial and error procedure with which the error between the observed variable and the model output is minimized using a proper function f the input variables x i i 1 n are processed in the hidden layer as 1 z j f i 1 n x i w ij b j j 1 h where wij is the weight of the connection from the ith input neuron to the jth hidden neuron and bj is the bias for the jth hidden neuron in this study one hidden layer was chosen it is noted from eq 1 that h neurons exist in the hidden layer the outputs of the hidden layer zj j 1 h are transformed to the final output by 2 y k f j 1 h z j w jk b k k 1 m where wjk is the weight of the connection from the jth hidden neuron to the kth output neuron and bk is the bias for the kth output neuron it is noted from eq 2 that m neurons exist in the output layer more information on this particular neural network model can be obtained from rumelhart et al 1986 3 2 radial basis function rbf ann the rbf ann consists of three layers input pattern and output in the pattern layer a radial basis function is fixed to transform the input vector x in a nonlinear fashion on a new vector as 3 z j ϕ x j 1 h and to produce the output of the model by 4 y k j 1 h z j w jk b k k 1 m more information on this particular neural network model is available in broomhead and lowe 1988 3 3 generalized regression gr ann the gr ann consists of four layers input pattern summation and output the input layer is made of input vectors each unit in the input layer is connected to the pattern layer the summation layer has two neurons called the s summation and d summation the final layer covers the output vector obtained for each input vector x i i 1 p where p is the number of elements in the training patterns the output is then given by 5 y i x i 1 p w i exp d x x i i 1 p exp d x x i where wi is the weight of the connection between the ith unit in the pattern layer and the s summation neuron d is a function also known as the gaussian d function used to pass the input layer units to the pattern layer more information on this particular neural network model can be found from specth 1991 4 model development and calibration the idea behind the modelling approach in this study is to forecast one month ahead precipitation in one single meteorological station by using characteristics of the previously recorded precipitation data in the same station one of the most important steps in developing a satisfactory ann forecasting model is the selection of appropriate input variables also important is the number of neurons in each layer as mentioned above to be determined by a trial and error effort the use of an ann model for forecasting time series implies that the input neurons are connected to a number of past observed values to identify the process at the future time steps it should be emphasized that it is aimed at identifying common input variables to approach the best fit curve for the three types of anns for the sake of comparability in the calibration of ann models appropriate input vector number of neurons type of activation functions spread coefficients when applicable etc are decided in this study different combinations of input vectors were constructed by maximizing the determination coefficient r 2 and minimizing the root mean square error rmse calculated for each case from the observed and forecasted precipitation as 6 r 2 i 1 n p o i p o p f i p f i 1 n p o i p o 2 i 1 n p f i p f 2 2 7 rmse i 1 n p o i p f i 2 n where pf i and po i show respectively the forecasted and observed total precipitation in month i which goes up to the total number of months n also the unit slope and zero intercept were aimed at the best fit line of the scatter diagram established between the observed and the forecasted precipitation time series antecedent precipitation was used to construct an appropriate input layer of the forecasting model in this study as precipitation is a periodic process a periodic component was also considered among the input variables which is calculated by 8 p t sin 2 π t 12 cos 2 π t 12 where t is number assigned to the month of the year i e t 1 for january and t 12 for december different combinations of input variables were investigated a long list of combinations of input variables was tested to construct the models for the three stations studied herein in the trial and error of the selection of the input variables it was seen that the model performance increased significantly with each additional antecedent precipitation and the periodic component after several combinations tested finally the best trained model was obtained when the precipitation of one two and twelve previous months xt 1 xt 2 xt 12 were used in the input vector together with the periodic component pt as 9 x t f x t 1 x t 2 x t 12 p t this has been the case for the three meteorological stations studied another point revealed by the trial and error efforts is that inclusion of the previous year s precipitation was indispensable in order to train the model sufficiently as briefed earlier in the case of ffbp ann the number of input and output variables directly gives the number of neurons in the input and output layers respectively however in order to decide on the number of neurons in the hidden layer of each model tested the number of neurons was changed from n to 2n where n is the number of input variables in this study before using in the training process data sets were non dimensionalized as 10 x n x 0 x min x max x min where xn and xo represent the non dimensional and original training data and xmin and xmax correspond to the minimum and maximum values in the original training data in this study the ann models were run for the monthly precipitation data of the baqura amman and safawi meteorological stations in jordan fig 1 monthly data of the first 28 73 and 53 years i e 336 876 and 636 months of the respective station were used to calibrate the models for the three stations the last ten years 120 months covering the common period of 1996 2005 were used for validating the models minimum rmse and maximum r2 were obtained when 7 7 and 5 neurons in the hidden layer were used for baqura amman and safawi stations respectively the final ffbp ann models were decided to have the structure of 4 7 1 for baqura and amman and 4 5 1 for safawi the sigmoid function was used as the activation function between the hidden and output layers both the input and output of the model were scaled appropriately to fall within the function limits zero to one the ffbp ann was trained by using the levenberg marquardt training algorithm while training the networks the number of epochs was kept at 25 an epoch being the number of times the algorithm sees the training input and or output vectors for the calculation of new weights and biases sinha et al 2010 the adaptive scalar that controls the learning process was set to 0 001 for the rbf ann model the best fit structure was obtained when 26 38 and 37 neurons in the pattern layer were used for baqura amman and safawi respectively the final structure of the rbf ann models became 4 26 1 for baqura 4 38 1 for amman and 4 37 1 for safawi the spread parameter was found to be equal to 5 decided by trial and error for the selected stations similarly the gr ann structure was established as 4 x 1 for the three stations the spread parameter for the selected stations was found to be equal to 0 06 in the rbf and gr anns the gaussian activation function was used for the pattern layers and the linear function for the output layers the model input and output were scaled appropriately to fall within the function limit zero to one as in the other types of ann models the models developed and calibrated as above are called regular ann models in this study the best calibration was obtained for the ffbp ann among the three ann models another important observation was that the wetter the region the better the calibration in other words better forecasts were obtained in wet stations baqura and amman and worse results in the dry station safawi 5 model improvement and calibration 5 1 regular model preliminary modelling efforts on the amman meteorological station using the ffbp ann have shown that construction of an ann model and selection of proper inputs are tremendously important and time consuming dahamsheh and aksoy 2009 upon selecting the input variables further modelling studies using data from baqura and safawi stations were performed the rbf and gr ann models were also run for the three precipitation data amman baqura and safawi thus the total number of case studies are nine three case studies for each of the three models detailed in aksoy and dahamsheh 2009 results of the case studies of the regular models in this study were not found as good as advertised in the usual ann practice probably due to two facts i a coarse time interval e g month is used and ii a two phase data intermittency in arid region precipitation is applied therefore it is concluded that use of additional tools as explained below are needed to improve the models for making better forecasts 5 2 markov chain incorporated model in the regular ann models negative values were generated for precipitation in summer months aksoy and dahamsheh 2009 which were all replaced with zero to avoid the physical unjustification as an improvement to overcome this difficulty markov chain mc was incorporated into the regular ann models this provides the model the ability of forecasting months with and without precipitation by preventing generation of negative precipitation this is called markov chain incorporated ann mc ann model as presented in dahamsheh and aksoy 2014 in the mc ann model it is first checked with the mc part of the model if precipitation is observed or not in a particular month of the year i e if a given month is wet or dry when the mc part of the model forecasts a dry month a zero precipitation is assigned to this particular month when a wet month is forecasted by the mc part of the model the ann part of the model is run to assign a non zero value for precipitation in the month a two state 1 0 mc can ideally be used for forecasting the state of the month wet and dry where 1 stands for a wet month and 0 for a dry month the transition probability matrix of the 1 0 markov chain can be given as 11 p i j p 11 p 10 p 01 p 00 where p ij shows the probability matrix of transition from a month with state i to a month with state j probability of transition from state i to state j can be calculated as 12 p ij n ij j n ij i j 0 1 where nij is the total number of months with state j following a month with state i the probabilities are determined for each month of the year because of seasonal effects the sum of each row in the probability matrix satisfies 13 j p ij 1 thus the number of parameters required is two resulting in 24 parameters in total at monthly basis calibration of mc by using the calibration data set covers the determination of mc transition probabilities presented in table 3 are transition probabilities calculated considering the monthly total precipitation of each station dash in september for amman means that this particular month has never been wet during the calibration period similarly the period from january to march has never been dry the same interpretation is valid for other stations at the calibration stage of the mc ann models it was observed that none of the models were improved substantially compared to the regular ann models although the problem of the physically unjustifiable negative precipitation was removed only a very minor improvement was obtained in the performance of the models for all case studies not only because of the lower performance but also due to the fact that existing data sets are usually much shorter than required and as indicated by cigizoglu 2003 longer data might improve the ability of the ann modeling tool a synthetic data generation mechanism was proposed in the model improvement as explained in the following sub section 5 3 synthetic data supported model in order to extend the length of input data synthetic monthly precipitation with similar statistical characteristics of the observed monthly precipitation time series were generated by the thomas and fiering 1962 model which has the general expression of 14 x i 1 x j 1 b j x i x j t i s j 1 1 r j 2 in which xi is the interested variable precipitation in this study of month i x j average precipitation in month j bj regression coefficient ti normally distributed number with zero mean and unit variance sj standard deviation of month j and ri the correlation coefficient the regression coefficient is defined by 15 b j r j s j 1 s j for each month of the year one thomas fiering model was established 12 models in total each model with three parameters which are the average standard deviation and correlation coefficient as can be seen from eq 14 the data were normalized by taking the square root of each observation before the models are established statistical characteristics average standard deviation skewness coefficient the first order auto correlation coefficient maximum and minimum precipitation of the observed and simulated precipitation time series have shown that the average was generated perfectly also standard deviation was found very close to the observed value even the skewness coefficient could be considered well preserved the autocorrelation coefficient was found similar to its observed counterpart during summer months in particular maxima and minima in winter months were higher than the observed values while they fit during spring summer and autumn as a final statement on the synthetic precipitation data it can be said that the synthetic data generated by the thomas fiering model is statistically acceptable and can be used for the calibration of the ann models in this study the synthetic precipitation data were used together with the observed data of each station until 1995 inclusive for the calibration of the mc incorporated ann models in the calibration the weights in the layers of the model were determined to end up with the mc incorporated ann model supported with synthetic data smc ann although an increase was expected in their performances with longer input data none of the smc ann models performed substantially better than the mc ann models in either of the nine case studies only a very minor improvement was observed in the performance of the models which can be considered null it was thought that the performance of the models was less influenced by the input data length but more by the model structure needing further improvement this was considered by taking a conditional statement into account in the model structure as explained in the following sub section 5 4 conditional model in jordan the within year periodical change in precipitation is typical to a northern hemisphere arid region where precipitation decreases from winter to summer increases from autumn to winter and is zero during summer months any precipitation model which does not consider the periodicity either under or over estimates precipitation that has been the case in this study for the regular ann models as well as their versions improved with the mc incorporation or supported with synthetic data one solution to overcome this difficulty could be the use of a model for each month of the year which will then have practical concerns due to high number of parameters to be estimated at monthly time scale in this study a model to be generalized for the whole year was considered from which a lower performance might be expected compared to a set of models to be constructed for each month the low performance of the regular ann models and the minor increase in the performance of their versions improved with mc incorporation and synthetic data support have been the motivation of this study to further improve the models particularly underestimation of higher precipitation is remarkable in the models it is seen that the models are able to reach up to a maximum level much lower than the observed maximum in other words the observed maxima can hardly be exceeded by the models this is mainly connected to the above periodicity which has not been considered in the models it was therefore thought that a conditional statement could work well to take the periodicity into account for the improvement of the models an empirically derived conditional statement was found effective in increasing the performance of the models substantially for the three case studies it takes the seasonality in the precipitation into account and reduces the higher effect of lower precipitation that prevents forecasting maxima and the higher effect of higher precipitation that prevents forecasting minima the model in which such a conditional statement is used was called mc incorporated and synthetic data supported conditional ann model smc cann that runs as in the flowchart in fig 2 in the smc cann model precipitation of the current month is forecasted with providing inputs in eq 9 into the model it is checked if the forecasted precipitation of the current month is higher or not than the precipitation of either two previous months the statement can be given in mathematical form as 16 x t 1 x t x t 1 0 x t 2 x t x t 2 0 for t which means precipitation in the previous two months are taken zero in the model when the condition x t 1 x t or x t 2 x t is satisfied the forecasting is repeated for any month t satisfying the condition by taking precipitation zero in two preceding months as stated in eq 16 the conditional statement decreases the weight of the preceding two months when x t 1 x t or x t 2 x t while the weight of other independent variables xt 12 and pt in eq 9 increases in estimating xt precipitation in the current month the weight of the independent variables in the ann models changes accordingly by using the conditional statement the use of the conditional statement allows the model to approach the receding precipitation period from winter to summer by lowering the effect of the high precipitation months preceding the month to be forecasted similarly the increasing period of precipitation is better captured by decreasing the weight of preceding months with low precipitation in the autumn winter period this allows the model to capture maximum values of precipitation the mc incorporated and synthetic data supported ffbp smc ffbp ann model was calibrated under the conditional statement to be called the mc incorporated synthetic data supported conditional ffbp smc cffbp ann model for the amman meteorological station the best model outputs were obtained when six neurons were taken in the hidden layer of the ann network of 4 6 1 for safawi and baqura 7 neurons were found better to propose the architecture of 4 7 1 the models have one output precipitation for the three meteorological stations results of the nine case studies were finally found good at the calibration stage this has been achieved with forecasting precipitation well approaching the observed precipitation therefore the conditional mc incorporated ann models supported by synthetic data are proposed for monthly precipitation forecasting in arid regions such as jordan in middle east 6 validation of the models and additional performance criteria monthly data of the last 120 months 10 years extending over the common period of 1996 2005 of the three stations were used for the validation of the ann models performance criteria considered for the validation of the models are the determination coefficient r 2 in eq 6 to be maximized and the root mean square error rmse in eq 7 to be minimized also the unit slope and zero intercept were aimed at the best fit line of the scatter diagram established between the observed and the forecasted precipitation for more details results of the ann models were presented in plots by using additional performance criteria explained as follows the 10 year 120 month time series of the observed and forecasted monthly total precipitation were presented to simply compare the observed and the forecasted monthly total precipitation in order to understand how the proposed model performs throughout the validation period the residual time series was also obtained in this study the residual was defined as 17 r p f p o this simply corresponds to the difference between the forecasted and observed monthly total precipitation pf and po respectively as long as the residual time series has a similar variation throughout the validation period it is said that the model has the same performance let us say at the end of the validation period that the model generates a residual time series with a higher variability than that at the beginning this means the model could make more reliable forecasts at the beginning of the validation period than at the end in other words the reliability of the model is reduced with time in the validation period it might also be interesting to know in which month the model performs well for this purpose monthly mean residuals were plotted both the absolute and relative errors were calculated absolute value of the error is important to show the fluctuation of the forecasted values from their observed counterparts the relative error is required in order to see if the model under or over estimates however such a graph is not dimensionless and hence not comparable between months of the year therefore the dimensionless version of the residual was calculated by dividing the mean residual with the mean value of the total precipitation of each month in dry months with no precipitation the dimensionless residual was not calculated finally the diagram of the observed and the forecasted precipitation was given to show how the observed versus the forecasted precipitation scatter around the 1 1 perfect line the best fit line of the forecast was also given on the scatter diagram all these additional performance criteria were used for the analysis and discussion of results given in the following section 7 results of validation and discussion validation of the regular ann models is detailed below after which the step by step improved versions are displayed for the baqura meteorological station case study results of the regular ffbp rbf and gr ann models for baqura the wettest station are respectively presented in figs 3 5 compared to the rbf and gr ann models it is seen from fig 3 that the ffbp ann model performs better in capturing the maximum values negative values are rare and small in quantity it should also be noticed that in the ffbp ann model the slope of the best fit line is higher and the intercept is lower than that obtained with the rbf and gr ann models figs 3 5 the monthly mean residual is found to be less fluctuating and the dimensionless residual is much smaller when september with monthly mean total precipitation of 0 02 mm is ignored fig 3d very similar but slightly worse results than the ffbp were obtained with the rbf ann model fig 4 the worst results of the three competing models were found in the case of gr ann with which the residual range approached 400 mm and the mean absolute error exceeded 40 mm fig 5 the gr ann model is the worst particularly in the summer season during which relatively good performances were obtained by the ffbp and rbf ann models however this model is advantageous over the ffbp and rbf models because it does not generate the physically meaningless negative precipitation forecasts in table 4 results obtained from the validation of the regular ann models are presented the ffbp model seems to be better than the other two models for the two wet stations baqura and amman while the rbf model performs better for safawi the dry station the ffbp and rbf models compete for the best however even though it is not a concrete conclusion an in depth look at the results of these two models shows that the rbf model performs better than the ffbp model for low precipitation the models are not satisfactory particularly in approaching the maxima observed in the time series this has been the main drawback of previous models developed by freiwan and cigizoglu 2005 dahamsheh and aksoy 2009 and aksoy and dahamsheh 2009 forecasts of freiwan and cigizoglu 2005 were strictly limited to a threshold that was much lower than the observed maximum thus maxima in the precipitation were considerably underestimated also dahamsheh and aksoy 2009 was not successful in approaching the maxima although compared to freiwan and cigizoglu 2005 slightly better results were obtained this problem has been paid an important and particular attention by aksoy and dahamsheh 2009 in the development of the model architecture such that higher maxima can be obtained however results were still not perfect as a continuation of the mentioned efforts this study as well cannot be considered fully successful in that sense when the regular ann models are used without additional tools therefore a step by step improvement is suggested in this study to forecast the maxima as high as their observed values first ann models were incorporated with markov chains for this aim the performance criteria of the mc incorporated ann models is given in figs 6 8 from which it is seen that the mc ffbp and mc rbf ann models are as good as each other while both are clearly better than the mc gr ann model in replicating the observed precipitation time series the mc ffbp is slightly better than the mc rbf an argument to support this statement is that the slope of the best fit line is closer to one and the intercept is closer to zero in the mc ffbp model in fig 6 than the rbf in fig 7 also maximum values were relatively better captured by the ffbp than the rbf it is noted that highest maxima were generated by the mc gr model fig 8a but not in an appropriate time similar results were obtained for the baqura station while results for the other station safawi were not that satisfactory this is important to note again that the performance of the ann models becomes worse with the aridity of the region studied e g forecast for the safawi station is the worst due to its location in the desert region of the country as summarized in table 5 although it is not very satisfactory it is seen that the best performance criteria were captured by the mc ffbp ann model the mc rbf ann model had almost the same performance comparison of the mc incorporated models with the regular models shows that the increase in the performance is null the only improvement achieved is the determination of dry months with no precipitation preventing the model to generate non physical negative precipitation although they were rare in number and small in quantity based on all these findings it should be emphasized that none of the models were found to be outstanding in forecasting the observed monthly total precipitation therefore a further improvement was adopted in the model the mc incorporated ann models were supported with synthetic data the performance criteria of the mc incorporated ann models supported with synthetic data are given in figs 9 11 in fig 9a it is seen that the smc ffbp ann model is better in forecasting lower precipitation than higher precipitation although positive residuals in fig 9b demonstrate that precipitation is generally overestimated however when high values peaks of precipitation are concerned the model underestimates mean absolute error and mean relative error in fig 9c show that the forecasted precipitation is higher than the observed values throughout the year except for summer months in the period from june to september it is seen that the forecasted precipitation is close to the observed precipitation mean absolute error in fig 9c shows that error in the forecast of the winter precipitation is higher the dimensionless version of the error in fig 9d points may with the highest error while other months of the year have lower values of error between the forecasted and observed precipitation relative to the monthly average precipitation the scatter diagram finally demonstrates that lower precipitation was found higher and higher precipitation lower in general fig 9e the synthetic data supported mc incorporated rbf smc rbf ann model is not good in forecasting high precipitation fig 10a in general lower precipitation is overestimated while underestimated higher precipitation is foreseen fig 10b mean errors in fig 10c show that precipitation is overestimated in rainy seasons from june to september precipitation is forecasted at the same order with observation although mean absolute error looks high in winter fig 10c the dimensionless error shows that the error is not that big indeed fig 10d by looking at the scatter diagram in fig 10e it is seen that lower precipitation is overestimated while higher precipitation is underestimated as in the previous model fig 11 shows clearly that the smc gr ann model is less successful than the smc ffbp and smc rbf ann models relatively higher residuals lower slope and higher intercept in the best fit curve show the less successful performance of this particular model compared to the other two based on the performance criteria calculated in table 6 it is seen that the smc ffbp is the best among the models supported by the synthetic data based on comparison of table 6 with table 5 it is seen that support given by the synthetic data to the mc incorporated models does not provide a substantial improvement to the forecasting ability of the models i e the additional data used in the calibration of the models do not improve forecasting ability of the models this has been the case for the three ann models finally when the performance of the mc incorporated and synthetic data supported conditional ann smc cann models is concerned figs 12 14 are provided results of the smc cffbp ann model are shown in fig 12 which depicts that the model is very successful compared to its previous versions particularly in approaching the maximum and minimum values of precipitation the closeness of the best fit line of the scatter diagram between the observed and forecasted precipitation to the 1 1 line shows how successful the model is in forecasting in the rbf case under the same inputs xt 1 xt 2 xt 12 pt the spread coefficient was taken as 5 when three neurons were used in the hidden layer to obtain the 4 3 1 model in the same manner models with structures of 4 27 1 and 4 13 1 with the best spread coefficients 5 and 13 were obtained for the safawi and baqura stations respectively it is seen that the smc crbf ann model is capable to provide good results in approaching the maximum and minimum precipitation fig 13 although scattered in a wide range it is noticed that the maximum precipitation was well captured by the model again using the same inputs for the three stations the best model was constructed with a spread coefficient 0 02 for the smc cgr ann model it is seen that the smc cgr ann model is good enough in forecasting the high and low values of precipitation fig 14 the best fit line to the scatter diagram is very close to the perfect fit line the outputs of the smc cffbp ann models show clearly that the models have tremendously overcome the difficulty in approaching the minimum and maximum precipitation values errors were reduced considerably although mean error demonstrates that the precipitation is generally overestimated the scatter diagram of the three models indicates that the variability in the scattering is not that big and the best fit line well approached the 1 1 perfect fit line when table 7 is considered the smc cffbp ann model is found the best among the three models used for the three case studies it is worthy to mention that the rbf with its improved version competes with the ffbp in baqura the wet region however it should be mentioned that it lost its advantageous performance in the dry region safawi when it is used in the regular form without improvement fig 15 summarizes the performance of the three models and their improved versions on the three meteorological stations the performance criteria were all sketched to understand how the models performed better with each improvement the regular ann model denoted as model 1 is given first after which the mc incorporated ann mc ann model model 2 synthetic data supported and mc incorporated ann smc ann model model 3 and the synthetic data supported and mc incorporated conditional ann smc cann model model 4 is given it is seen from all performance criteria in fig 15 that model 2 performs slightly better than model 1 and model 3 better than model 2 however the increase in the performance of model 4 is substantial this statement can be linked to the increase in the determination coefficient and the slope of the best fit line and to the decrease in the rmse and the intercept of the best fit line this is a fact for all models all case studies and performance criteria in short the conditional statement improved the models one among the possible reasons for not obtaining outputs at the desired level of accuracy might be the intermittent structure of the precipitation zero values in the precipitation time series often prevent the models to produce high values of precipitation when two data sets coming from two populations zero and non zero with different characteristics from each other are considered together in one dataset improvement to ann models applied in this study is composed of a combined series of methods including markov chain synthetic time series and a case specific conditional statement this is a hybridization procedure that has been useful in forecasting monthly intermittent precipitation in three meteorological stations in an arid region with a possible generalization potential after further case studies for different conditions are performed alternative hybrid models can be discovered to improve the forecasting ability of the models wavelet incorporated ann model of nourani et al 2009 can be mentioned as an example among many existing in the literature 8 conclusions based on results of the study following conclusions may be drawn 1 ann models are constructed based on a trial and error procedure therefore none of the ann models in this study turns out to be the best choice as there may always exist better models with another architecture different activation functions or spread coefficients when applicable 2 higher variability of precipitation in arid regions prevents ann models to perform well in other words increasing variability reduces the success of the models in approaching the observed precipitation sequence therefore intermittent monthly precipitation data of semi arid and arid regions should be analyzed with more care than perennial precipitation time series of humid regions 3 some of potential limitations of the models discussed herein can be eliminated and improvements in the model performance can be achieved by monthly analysis monthly models can be proposed at the expense of increase in model parameters weights and biases dry and wet periods in the year can be modeled separately if a parsimonious model is desired and if the monthly analysis is therefore found too costly in terms of model parameters the observed data can simply be divided into two portions for instance over and under the long term average precipitation to be taken as a threshold models can then be constructed separately for each portion 4 some helping tools should be incorporated into the forecasting models if it becomes necessary to analyze the intermittent monthly precipitation within the year as a whole for instance mcs are used in this study together with anns good results with forecasting the occurrence and non occurrence of precipitation were obtained and negative precipitation forecasted by ann models was eliminated 5 data required for the calibration of ann models can be extended by means of synthetic data generation methods existing in stochastic hydrology this might be helpful in improving the performance of the models which have been better trained with longer data however not substantially better results are obtained when mc and synthetic data are used to improve the ann models for forecasting the arid region precipitation 6 as a final effort to improve the model performance an empirical statement conditioning on the precipitation is considered the statement reduces the weight of lower precipitation on higher precipitation and the weight of higher precipitation on lower precipitation this allows the model to much better forecast precipitation in an arid region 
7256,recent studies based on gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite mission suggested that groundwater has increased in central and southern parts of india however surface water which is an equally important source of water in these semi arid areas has not been studied yet in the present study the study areas were outlined based on trends in grace data followed by trend identification in surface water storages and checking the hypothesis of causality surface water extent swe and surface soil moisture ssm derived from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis and advanced microwave scanning radiometer earth observing system amsr e respectively are selected as proxies of surface water storage sws besides swe and ssm trend test was performed for grace derived terrestrial water storage tws for the study areas named as r1 r2 gor1 and kor1 granger causality test is used to test the hypothesis that rainfall is a causal factor of the inter annual variability of swe ssm and tws positive trends were observed in tws for r1 r2 and gor1 whereas swe and ssm show increasing trends for all the study regions results suggest that rainfall is the granger causal of all the storage variables for r1 and r2 the regions exhibiting the most significant positive trends in tws keywords grace terrestrial water storage positive trend rainfall deficit 1 introduction advances in satellite remote sensing have enhanced our understanding of the hydrologic cycle satellite derived global datasets of rainfall evapotranspiration soil moisture snow cover etc are now available at appreciable spatial and temporal resolution a valuable addition to the plethora of these earth observing satellites is the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite mission launched in march 2002 tapley et al 2004 it provides unprecedented data of terrestrial water storage tws defined as the total of all surface and subsurface water storages including snow and ice derived from the minute changes in the earth s gravitational field grace based tws variability helps the characterization of water storage variability at global syed et al 2008 and river basin kim et al 2009 scales grace data have been used to study seasonal and interannual variability of tws for large areas such as the amazon river basin alsdorf et al 2010 xavier et al 2010 eurasian arctic region landerer et al 2010 the himalayas moiwo et al 2011 west africa grippa et al 2011 and australia forootan et al 2012 in recent times grace data has also been used for a number of hydrologic studies such as drought assessment thomas et al 2014 yi and wen 2016 evapotranspiration estimation brena naranjo et al 2014 syed et al 2014 flood forecasting reager et al 2014 runoff estimation sneeuw et al 2014 and improvement of hydrologic models doll et al 2014 grace data has been of paramount importance in identification of trend in tws and its various components specifically groundwater storage using this data large depletions were reported in various parts of usa such as the sacramento and san joaquin river basins 30 mm yr california s central valley 20 mm yr and high plains aquifer 25 mm yr brena naranjo et al 2014 famiglietti et al 2011 scanlon et al 2012a b depleting groundwater levels were also reported in other parts of the world like the bengal basin of bangladesh shamsudduha et al 2012 and ganga brahmaputra meghna river basin khandu et al 2016 in south asia transboundary river basins in the middle east joodaki et al 2014 voss et al 2013 northern china huang et al 2015 and southern murray darling river basin in australia chen et al 2016 the common cause attributed to these decreasing trends in groundwater was overexploitation wada et al 2010 estimated that groundwater abstraction increased globally from 312 km3 yr 1960 to 734 km3 yr 2000 resulting in the increasing rate of depletion another study which analyzed 37 of the world s largest aquifer systems using grace data and subsequently quantified their water stress revealed that only 13 were unstressed while the rest were being used at a rate greater than the natural replenishment rate richey et al 2015 considerable magnitude of ground water depletion has also been reported in various parts of india the rate of groundwater depletion over punjab rajasthan and haryana due to increasing usage of groundwater for irrigation was reported to be 40 mm yr rodell et al 2009 and this decline was reported to be continuing chen et al 2014 long et al 2016 trend analysis of grace derived tws data over india found the groundwater depletion rate to be 34 km3 yr in the ganga brahmaputra river basin also claimed to be caused due to exploitation tiwari et al 2009 contrary to the depleting groundwater levels in the northern part of india increasing groundwater trends were reported in central and southern parts of india with various studies attributing the increase to numerous factors soni and syed 2015 reported positive trend in groundwater storage gws over the krishna and godavari river basins demonstrating correlation of groundwater with climatic indices asoka et al 2017 demonstrated increasing trends in groundwater derived from grace as well as in situ well observations over large parts of southern india and attributed the changes largely to inter annual variability of rainfall bhanja et al 2017 made similar claims about increasing trends in tws over southern parts of india although they attributed the cause to the change in groundwater management strategy the present study proposes a methodology to outline the areas of increasing trends in tws to estimate the magnitude of trend along with the associated uncertainty for the period 2002 2014 furthermore this study checks the hypothesis that inter annual tws variability is dependent on rainfall for all the outlined areas of interest compared to groundwater potential utilizable surface water forms the major portion of the total water potential for the southern river basins in india such as godavari and krishna moreover krishna and godavari river basins have the highest surface water storage sws capacity of 41 8 km3 and 25 12 km3 respectively amongst all the indian river basins gaur and amerasinghe 2011 consequently the investigation of surface water storage is a matter of great interest from both hydrology and water management point of view the present study uses ssm and swe as proxies to estimate and investigate trends in sws for all the outlined study regions normalized difference water index ndwi mcfeeters 1996 estimated based on modis reflectance data was used to define the surface water extent while ssm from amsr e was used to study the moisture content of the top soil layer of all the outlined study regions granger causality test granger 1969 was used to test the hypotheses of rainfall being the causal factor of tws swe and ssm although introduced in econometrics the test has also been used in various fields of geosciences such as climate change attanasio et al 2012 elsner 2006 anthropogenic effects on climate attanasio 2012 kaufmann et al 2007 and vegetation studies jiang et al 2015 kaufmann et al 2003 in contrast to most of the previous studies of trend in india which use correlation analysis to identify the cause of the increasing trends the use of granger causality test is an improvement to summarize the objectives of the present study are i delineation of areas exhibiting a positive trend using grid wise identification and estimation of trend in grace derived tws all over india ii identification and estimation of trend in tws swe and ssm in the delineated regions and remaining parts of godavari and krishna river basins iii testing the hypothesis that rainfall is a causative factor effecting these three storages in all the areas of interest using granger causality test 2 data the datasets used for the present study are i grace tws data ii ssm derived from amsr e iii modis reflectance data iv rainfall data obtained from indian meteorological department imd v evapotranspiration data obtained from modis and vi river discharge obtained from central water commission cwc brief description of each dataset is provided in the section below and in table 1 all the variables considered in the present study are spatially averaged for each study area to obtain a representative time series 2 1 grace derived tws data in the present work rl05 level 3 global data set publicly available at the jet propulsion laboratory s tellus website landerer and swenson 2012 was used the level 3 gridded tws data set is available in terms of centimeters of equivalent water thickness ewt it was derived from level 2 data available in the form of spherical harmonic coefficients using the methodology suggested by wahr et al 1998 and corrected for errors as outlined by swenson and wahr 2006 the multiplicative gain factors provided as gridded estimates along with the tws values are used to restore the signals attenuated due to the application of filters used to remove the systematic and random errors out of the three data sets derived from three different sources the csr center for space research at university of texas austin data was used 2 2 surface soil moisture gridded ssm data derived from passive microwave remote sensing data of amsr e sensor is made available using a forward radiative transfer model land parameter retrieval model lprm owe et al 2008 lprm amsr e data was used for the present study as a recent study karthikeyan and kumar 2016 showed that it performs well for indian conditions the amsr e lprm v002 a level 3 gridded dataset available daily for the ascending and descending vrije universiteit amsterdam and nasa gsfc 2011 passes was used to estimate monthly average ssm as an average of both the passes 2 3 reflectance data modis reflectance data myd09a1 available for bands 1 7 was used to estimate ndwi for calculating swe for the present study version 5 modis aqua surface reflectance product of band 2 and band 4 ornl daac 2008 were used each pixel of which has the best possible observation within an 8 day period selected on the basis of high observation coverage low view angle the absence of clouds or cloud shadow and aerosols 2 4 precipitation imd is the principal department responsible for all meteorological observation communication forecasting and research activities for the benefit of several activities such as agriculture irrigation water management fishing shipping aviation and many other activities in india the recent gridded dataset pai et al 2014 prepared from rainfall records of 6995 rain gauge stations distributed across india was used in this study monthly rainfall time series was generated by aggregating the daily rainfall values 2 5 evapotranspiration the modis sensor onboard nasa s terra and aqua satellites observes a wide range of terrestrial atmospheric and oceanic parameters the land data products of modis include surface reflectance land surface temperature land cover vegetation indices and evapotranspiration the mod16a2 global evapotranspiration product was used for the present study the algorithm used to prepare the dataset uses modis land cover albedo leaf area index and enhanced vegetation index and a few daily meteorological forcings mu et al 2011 2 6 discharge cwc is the premier department in india envisaged with the responsibilities of initiation coordination and consultation of schemes for control conservation and utilization of water resources throughout the country it is responsible for collection compilation storage and retrieval of hydrological data along with overall planning and development of river basins including hydrological studies the daily discharge data available at india wris website cwc isro 2009 for the godavari and krishna river basins was used to calculate the monthly inflow and outflow volumes 3 methods the methodologies used for this study include trend detection and estimation uncertainty estimation of trends and granger causality test the following section provides description of the methodologies as used in this study 3 1 trend analysis most studies using grace data to identify increasing or decreasing trend in tws or groundwater have used linear regression least square fit for trend analysis chen et al 2016 famiglietti et al 2011 huang et al 2015 scanlon et al 2012b velicogna et al 2012 voss et al 2013 the inherent assumptions of normal distribution and independence for linear regression are major limitations of this parametric approach recently multiple linear regression was utilized to isolate linear trend and seasonal component from the time series and mann kendall test was used to test statistical significance of the linear trend khandu et al 2016 mann kendall test kendall 1962 mann 1945 is a non parametric rank based test free from the assumption of normal distribution but requires the assumption of independence seasonal kendall test is a modified version of the mann kendall test which takes care of the seasonality present in a hydrologic time series by dividing the time series into 12 blocks representing each month although this test is quite suitable for hydrologic time series with inherent seasonality the underlying assumption of independence still exists modified seasonal mann kendall msmk test for trend hirsch and slack 1984 proposed a method of estimation of the covariance when the samples are not independent hence msmk test which is free of the assumption of normality and independence is most suited for time series with prominent inherent seasonality in this study msmk test was used to identify the existence of trend and to estimate its statistical significance the trend magnitude was calculated using the theil sen s slope estimator sen 1968 thiel 1950 this method calculates the slope between each pair of data points in the time series and the median of these slope values forms the theil sen s slope estimate this non parametric method is insensitive to outliers and robust is case of skewed and heteroskedastic data 3 2 uncertainty estimation grace derived tws estimates have two major sources of errors i the leakage of unwanted signal from outside the region of interest into the study region known as leakage error swenson and wahr 2002 and ii error in satellite measurement known as measurement error swenson et al 2003 the jet propulsion laboratory s tellus website landerer and swenson 2012 swenson 2017 provides two additional gridded datasets as estimates of measurement and leakage errors in units of centimeter of equivalent water thickness for the same 1 1 grids as grace tws data to estimate the errors associated with the tws time series of each regions of interest the error covariance was considered as the errors of nearby pixels are correlated in this study the total monthly error estimate for a region was calculated as 1 σ total σ measurement 2 σ leakage 2 where σ total represents the monthly error in tws estimate and σ leakage and σ measurement are the leakage and measurement errors respectively this monthly error in tws was propagated to all derived quantities by means of error propagation while the error in trend magnitude was estimated using monte carlo simulation 10 000 time series of tws were generated by adding 10 000 normally distributed random numbers for each data point thus 10 000 estimates of theil sen s slope were obtained and the mean was considered as the slope value and the standard deviation as the error estimate 3 3 granger causality test granger causality test is a hypothesis testing strategy used to check if the time series of a variable x has the ability to predict another variable y when the historical time series of y is also used for prediction thus the test constitutes of construction of two vector autoregressive var models known as the unrestricted and restricted model defined as follows unrestricted model y t a 0 i 1 n a i y t i i 1 n b t i x t i restricted model y t a 0 i 1 n a i y t i a causal relationship is inferred if there is statistically significant increase in the explanatory power of the unrestricted model compared to the restricted model the null hypothesis tested to draw the inference is b i 0 against the alternate hypothesis b i 0 for all i generally using a wald test however in most of the real life situations the problem is not so straight forward and may include complexities such as the non stationarity of the time series and co integration in the present study toda and yamamoto 1995 procedure of testing granger causality was used which takes care of non stationarity of time series following are the steps involved for the same i the time series of both the predictor x and predictand y variables were tested for their order of integration using anderson darling ad test and kwiatkowski phillips schmidt shin kpss test let the maximum order of integration out of the two time series be m ii var models considering maximum lag of 1 6 months were set up irrespective of the order of integration the appropriate var model selected based on the akaike information criterion aic was checked for serial correlation in the residuals using breusch godfrey bg test and durbin watson dw test iii let the maximum lag of the var model selected in the previous step be p for both the predictor and predictand variable another m additional lag terms for both the variables were added to the model to take care for the integration iv the wald test was performed for the final var model with p m terms to test the null hypothesis that the coefficients of the first p lagged terms of the predictor variable to be equal to zero 4 results 4 1 delineation and description of study area as mentioned in the previous section msmk test was used for identification and testing of the statistical significance of trend in grace derived gridded tws time series and theil sen s slope was used to estimate the trend magnitude fig 1 a shows areas of increasing trend of tws in the west central and south eastern parts of india having trend magnitude as high as 20 mm yr over a few grids as a first step these two apparently distinct regions of positive trend were outlined shown in fig 1 a b and d using a two fold measure viz value of trend over a threshold of 6 mm yr and 85 statistical significance the south eastern region includes considerable area of both krishna and godavari river basins and will be referred to as region 1 r1 in further discussions after outlining r1 large areas of these two river basins lie outside the positive trend region fig 1 d as godavari and krishna are the major sources of water in southern and central india it would also be interesting to study variations of tws ssm and swe in these two rivers basins outside r1 and find how they evolve in time these two regions will be referred to as krishna outside region 1 kor1 and godavari outside region 1 gor1 the west central region majorly encompasses the west flowing rivers of india narmada tapi mahi and parts of sabarmati and parts of two sub basins of ganga upper chambal and kali sindh parbati this region will be referred to as region 2 r2 r1 has an area of 181 000 km2 and includes most parts of the indian state of telangana some coastal districts of andhra pradesh and some parts of maharashtra chhattisgarh and karnataka along with the cities of hyderabad and vijayawada r2 has an area of 266 000 km2 and includes large parts of the indian states of madhya pradesh maharashtra gujarat and a small part of rajasthan fig 1 b godavari and krishna river basins outside r1 i e gor1 and kor1 have areas 248 000 km2 and 216 000 km2 respectively although grace data have even been used to detect tws variations over much smaller regions like the california central valley 52 000 km2 famiglietti et al 2011 scanlon et al 2012a b in the present study the area of all the four study regions matches the typical grace footprint 200 000 km2 longuevergne et al 2010 yeh et al 2006 instead of a river basin based approach a region based approach was adopted in the present study which takes into account the heterogeneity of trend in tws over the godavari and krishna river basins and the relatively small size of the narmada tapi and mahi river basins godavari is the second largest river in india area 340 000 km2 followed by the krishna area 280 000 km2 and together form the major source of surface water in peninsular india originating in the western ghats mountain range both these rivers flow east to finally drain into the bay of bengal and are sustained by the rainfall received during the south west monsoon the annual average rainfall received by the godavari and krishna are 1100 mm and 860 mm respectively with a spatial variability in the rainfall patterns over both the basins the maximum rainfall occurs in the western ghats 1000 3000 mm yr the middle belt is much dry receiving 600 mm of rainfall or less annually and the eastern parts especially near the coast is again wet a major part of these two river basins 60 of godavari and 75 of krishna is agricultural land the west central region comprises of the west flowing rivers viz narmada area 98 000 km2 tapi area 65 000 km2 and mahi area 34 000 km2 all these rivers originate in the indian state of madhya pradesh flow through the valleys formed by the aravalli vindhya and satpura mountain ranges finally draining into the arabian sea these basins have a humid and tropical climate with 90 of the rainfall occurring during the monsoon season june to september agricultural land is also the major land use land cover for these river basins accounting for 60 of the combined basin area 4 2 assessment of grace derived tws the ability of gravity measurements of grace satellites to estimate tws in the study areas and its level of accuracy needs to be ascertained before the investigation of tws trends the tws time series were derived for all the four regions and the associated errors were calculated along with et rainfall and total streamflow inflow and outflow inflow for region1 was the total discharge measured by gauges 1 8 and the total outflow was the total discharge measured at gauges 9 and 10 fig 1d the discharge outflow calculated for gor1 was the total discharge measured by gauges 1 5 and that for kor1 was the total discharge measured by gauges 6 8 fig 1 c monthly terrestrial water storage change twsc was derived from grace tws according to the following equation 2 tws c t t w s t t w s t 1 here t denotes a particular month and t 1 the previous month twsc for each month was then compared with δs estimated using the following mass balance equation 3 δ s p e t q in q out here δs is the change in total water storage in a month p is monthly precipitation et is monthly evapotranspiration and qin qout are total monthly inflow outflow respectively grace derived twsc was observed in agreement with δs for all the four study regions across the time period of the study fig 2 r1 and r2 exhibited correlation of 0 73 and 0 82 respectively with their respective nrmse rmse values as 0 16 6 63 cm and 0 14 5 74 cm for gor1 and kor1 the annual cycle of twsc and δs time series appeared to be out of phase by a month this observed disparity may be attributed to the use of only streamflow in channel discharge measured at gauging stations in the mass balance equation whereas the total inflow and outflow in eq 1 in principle includes all the surface and groundwater fluxes and not only the streamflow previous studies have also reported such phase lag in annual cycle where streamflow measurements have been compared with grace derived total basin discharge syed et al 2005 a difference between δs estimate and twsc was also observed in case of gor1 and kor1 correlation of 0 82 for gor1 and 0 56 for kor1 the larger discrepancy in case of kor1 as compared to gor1 could possibly be due to of higher percentage of groundwater flow being part of the total discharge the presence of large number of surface water reservoirs in the krishna river basin gaur and amerasinghe 2011 which restricts the streamflow and contributes to groundwater storage and consequently discharge base flow is probably responsible for the observation 4 3 estimation of swe swe used as a proxy for surface water was defined as the total surface area in square kilometers covered by water swe was estimated based on modis derived ndwi defined by mcfeeters 1996 as ndwi r green r nir r green r nir where rgreen and rnir are the reflectance of the green and near infrared nir bands respectively the value of ndwi varies from 1 to 1 by definition but water surfaces has a value more than zero consequently zero ndwi value was used as a threshold to identify water surfaces i e the pixels having ndwi greater than or equal to zero were considered as water pixels and add up to the total surface water extent of the study area the swe time series for each study region was calculated at the 8 day interval same as the modis reflectance data which was then converted to monthly time series by averaging 4 4 trend analysis and causality test trend analysis of tws swe and ssm time series was performed for all the four regions using msmk test for trend detection and theil sen s slope for estimation of trend magnitude msmk trend test of tws suggested that statistically significant positive trend exists for r1 r2 and gor1 fig 3 with the highest trend magnitude observed for r2 table 2 whereas there was no significant trend found in tws over kor1 as discussed earlier the error estimates of trend were calculated using monte carlo simulation the results also suggested that trend in tws vary in magnitude over godavari river basin and is restricted to a portion of krishna basin this demonstrates the heterogeneous nature of trend in tws over krishna and godavari river basins increasing trends in swe and ssm were also detected over all the four study regions figs 4 and 5 the highest trend magnitude of swe and ssm were observed for r2 and kor1 respectively table 2 the increase in tws ssm and swe observed for the study regions were investigated further to determine the causal factor of the increase it was hypothesized that rainfall was the common cause resulting in increasing trends in tws ssm and swe toda and yamamoto 1995 procedure of granger causality test as described in methods section was used to check for the causality rainfall was found to be granger causal of tws in all the four regions the var models selected for the tests in r1 r2 gor1 and kor1 had maximum lag 4 3 6 and 4 respectively results suggest that rainfall was also a granger causal of swe in r1 r2 and gor1 the var models selected for the tests in the above regions have maximum lag 2 2 and 1 respectively however granger causality test suggested that rainfall is a granger causal of ssm for only r1 and r2 with their respective var models having the maximum lag as 3 and 1 respectively a summary of the granger causality test is provided in table 3 5 discussion and conclusion the regions of increasing tws in the southeastern and west central part of india were outlined and identified as r1 and r2 respectively along with gor1 and kor1 water budget study over these four study areas provided confidence in the usage of grace derived tws to study hydrological changes the average increases in tws over r1 and r2 were estimated to be 8 42 1 48 mm yr and 9 59 0 96 mm yr respectively using theil sen slope estimate according to the trend estimates within the study period of 13 years tws of r1 r2 and gor1 increased by 20 km3 34 km3 and 16 km3 of water respectively in these years volumes much larger that the capacity of even tehri dam 3 5 km3 the largest dam in india positive trends were observed in swe and ssm for all the four study regions indicating a gain in surface water storage which forms a large portion of the utilizable water in these areas the magnitude of trend in swe of r2 was observed to be the highest and almost three times that of the other study regions although trend magnitude of ssm was similar for all four regions highest magnitude was observed for kor1 the trend magnitude of tws was also the highest for r2 the granger causality test conducted for the deseasonalized time series of tws and rainfall suggested that interannual variability in rainfall pattern was evidently the cause of the interannual variability in tws rainfall was also found to be the granger causal of swe in r1 r2 and gor1 whereas in case of ssm rainfall is granger causal for r1 and r2 thus it can be summarized that the positive trends in sws along with tws over r1 and r2 is caused due to the interannual variability in rainfall clearly indicating that r1 and r2 are areas heavily dependent on rainfall as mentioned earlier major portion of the rainfall received in these regions is during the months of june to september as the indian summer monsoon rainfall ismr consequently interannual variability in ismr must be a large contributing factor in determining the interannual variability of rainfall in these areas ismr has a long term all india average value of 852 mm and a standard deviation of 84 7 mm about 10 of the mean year having rainfall more than 10 of the mean is considered a rainfall excess or flood year while a year with rainfall less than 10 of the mean is considered a rainfall deficit or drought year according to ismr values 2002 2004 and 2009 were rainfall deficit or meteorological drought years the year 2002 experienced the third most severe droughts in india in the last 100 years experiencing a deficit of 21 5 of ismr with 56 deficit for the month of july bhat 2006 hence the recovery from the extreme drought conditions is probably one of the factors dictating the increase in water storage in these areas finally it appears that terrestrial water storage in the form of surface water reservoirs soil moisture or groundwater in the indian river basins south of the ganga river basin is very vulnerable to the rainfall deficit in these areas water availability is heavily dependent on the ismr in contrast to ganga brahmaputra and indus river basins covering the northern part of india which have a perennial source of water in the form of melting snow from himalayas a prime concern lies in the increasing frequency of meteorological droughts in india with water shortage becoming an increasing problem in the southern and central part of india the solution of such problems lies in proper water resources

7256,recent studies based on gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite mission suggested that groundwater has increased in central and southern parts of india however surface water which is an equally important source of water in these semi arid areas has not been studied yet in the present study the study areas were outlined based on trends in grace data followed by trend identification in surface water storages and checking the hypothesis of causality surface water extent swe and surface soil moisture ssm derived from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis and advanced microwave scanning radiometer earth observing system amsr e respectively are selected as proxies of surface water storage sws besides swe and ssm trend test was performed for grace derived terrestrial water storage tws for the study areas named as r1 r2 gor1 and kor1 granger causality test is used to test the hypothesis that rainfall is a causal factor of the inter annual variability of swe ssm and tws positive trends were observed in tws for r1 r2 and gor1 whereas swe and ssm show increasing trends for all the study regions results suggest that rainfall is the granger causal of all the storage variables for r1 and r2 the regions exhibiting the most significant positive trends in tws keywords grace terrestrial water storage positive trend rainfall deficit 1 introduction advances in satellite remote sensing have enhanced our understanding of the hydrologic cycle satellite derived global datasets of rainfall evapotranspiration soil moisture snow cover etc are now available at appreciable spatial and temporal resolution a valuable addition to the plethora of these earth observing satellites is the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite mission launched in march 2002 tapley et al 2004 it provides unprecedented data of terrestrial water storage tws defined as the total of all surface and subsurface water storages including snow and ice derived from the minute changes in the earth s gravitational field grace based tws variability helps the characterization of water storage variability at global syed et al 2008 and river basin kim et al 2009 scales grace data have been used to study seasonal and interannual variability of tws for large areas such as the amazon river basin alsdorf et al 2010 xavier et al 2010 eurasian arctic region landerer et al 2010 the himalayas moiwo et al 2011 west africa grippa et al 2011 and australia forootan et al 2012 in recent times grace data has also been used for a number of hydrologic studies such as drought assessment thomas et al 2014 yi and wen 2016 evapotranspiration estimation brena naranjo et al 2014 syed et al 2014 flood forecasting reager et al 2014 runoff estimation sneeuw et al 2014 and improvement of hydrologic models doll et al 2014 grace data has been of paramount importance in identification of trend in tws and its various components specifically groundwater storage using this data large depletions were reported in various parts of usa such as the sacramento and san joaquin river basins 30 mm yr california s central valley 20 mm yr and high plains aquifer 25 mm yr brena naranjo et al 2014 famiglietti et al 2011 scanlon et al 2012a b depleting groundwater levels were also reported in other parts of the world like the bengal basin of bangladesh shamsudduha et al 2012 and ganga brahmaputra meghna river basin khandu et al 2016 in south asia transboundary river basins in the middle east joodaki et al 2014 voss et al 2013 northern china huang et al 2015 and southern murray darling river basin in australia chen et al 2016 the common cause attributed to these decreasing trends in groundwater was overexploitation wada et al 2010 estimated that groundwater abstraction increased globally from 312 km3 yr 1960 to 734 km3 yr 2000 resulting in the increasing rate of depletion another study which analyzed 37 of the world s largest aquifer systems using grace data and subsequently quantified their water stress revealed that only 13 were unstressed while the rest were being used at a rate greater than the natural replenishment rate richey et al 2015 considerable magnitude of ground water depletion has also been reported in various parts of india the rate of groundwater depletion over punjab rajasthan and haryana due to increasing usage of groundwater for irrigation was reported to be 40 mm yr rodell et al 2009 and this decline was reported to be continuing chen et al 2014 long et al 2016 trend analysis of grace derived tws data over india found the groundwater depletion rate to be 34 km3 yr in the ganga brahmaputra river basin also claimed to be caused due to exploitation tiwari et al 2009 contrary to the depleting groundwater levels in the northern part of india increasing groundwater trends were reported in central and southern parts of india with various studies attributing the increase to numerous factors soni and syed 2015 reported positive trend in groundwater storage gws over the krishna and godavari river basins demonstrating correlation of groundwater with climatic indices asoka et al 2017 demonstrated increasing trends in groundwater derived from grace as well as in situ well observations over large parts of southern india and attributed the changes largely to inter annual variability of rainfall bhanja et al 2017 made similar claims about increasing trends in tws over southern parts of india although they attributed the cause to the change in groundwater management strategy the present study proposes a methodology to outline the areas of increasing trends in tws to estimate the magnitude of trend along with the associated uncertainty for the period 2002 2014 furthermore this study checks the hypothesis that inter annual tws variability is dependent on rainfall for all the outlined areas of interest compared to groundwater potential utilizable surface water forms the major portion of the total water potential for the southern river basins in india such as godavari and krishna moreover krishna and godavari river basins have the highest surface water storage sws capacity of 41 8 km3 and 25 12 km3 respectively amongst all the indian river basins gaur and amerasinghe 2011 consequently the investigation of surface water storage is a matter of great interest from both hydrology and water management point of view the present study uses ssm and swe as proxies to estimate and investigate trends in sws for all the outlined study regions normalized difference water index ndwi mcfeeters 1996 estimated based on modis reflectance data was used to define the surface water extent while ssm from amsr e was used to study the moisture content of the top soil layer of all the outlined study regions granger causality test granger 1969 was used to test the hypotheses of rainfall being the causal factor of tws swe and ssm although introduced in econometrics the test has also been used in various fields of geosciences such as climate change attanasio et al 2012 elsner 2006 anthropogenic effects on climate attanasio 2012 kaufmann et al 2007 and vegetation studies jiang et al 2015 kaufmann et al 2003 in contrast to most of the previous studies of trend in india which use correlation analysis to identify the cause of the increasing trends the use of granger causality test is an improvement to summarize the objectives of the present study are i delineation of areas exhibiting a positive trend using grid wise identification and estimation of trend in grace derived tws all over india ii identification and estimation of trend in tws swe and ssm in the delineated regions and remaining parts of godavari and krishna river basins iii testing the hypothesis that rainfall is a causative factor effecting these three storages in all the areas of interest using granger causality test 2 data the datasets used for the present study are i grace tws data ii ssm derived from amsr e iii modis reflectance data iv rainfall data obtained from indian meteorological department imd v evapotranspiration data obtained from modis and vi river discharge obtained from central water commission cwc brief description of each dataset is provided in the section below and in table 1 all the variables considered in the present study are spatially averaged for each study area to obtain a representative time series 2 1 grace derived tws data in the present work rl05 level 3 global data set publicly available at the jet propulsion laboratory s tellus website landerer and swenson 2012 was used the level 3 gridded tws data set is available in terms of centimeters of equivalent water thickness ewt it was derived from level 2 data available in the form of spherical harmonic coefficients using the methodology suggested by wahr et al 1998 and corrected for errors as outlined by swenson and wahr 2006 the multiplicative gain factors provided as gridded estimates along with the tws values are used to restore the signals attenuated due to the application of filters used to remove the systematic and random errors out of the three data sets derived from three different sources the csr center for space research at university of texas austin data was used 2 2 surface soil moisture gridded ssm data derived from passive microwave remote sensing data of amsr e sensor is made available using a forward radiative transfer model land parameter retrieval model lprm owe et al 2008 lprm amsr e data was used for the present study as a recent study karthikeyan and kumar 2016 showed that it performs well for indian conditions the amsr e lprm v002 a level 3 gridded dataset available daily for the ascending and descending vrije universiteit amsterdam and nasa gsfc 2011 passes was used to estimate monthly average ssm as an average of both the passes 2 3 reflectance data modis reflectance data myd09a1 available for bands 1 7 was used to estimate ndwi for calculating swe for the present study version 5 modis aqua surface reflectance product of band 2 and band 4 ornl daac 2008 were used each pixel of which has the best possible observation within an 8 day period selected on the basis of high observation coverage low view angle the absence of clouds or cloud shadow and aerosols 2 4 precipitation imd is the principal department responsible for all meteorological observation communication forecasting and research activities for the benefit of several activities such as agriculture irrigation water management fishing shipping aviation and many other activities in india the recent gridded dataset pai et al 2014 prepared from rainfall records of 6995 rain gauge stations distributed across india was used in this study monthly rainfall time series was generated by aggregating the daily rainfall values 2 5 evapotranspiration the modis sensor onboard nasa s terra and aqua satellites observes a wide range of terrestrial atmospheric and oceanic parameters the land data products of modis include surface reflectance land surface temperature land cover vegetation indices and evapotranspiration the mod16a2 global evapotranspiration product was used for the present study the algorithm used to prepare the dataset uses modis land cover albedo leaf area index and enhanced vegetation index and a few daily meteorological forcings mu et al 2011 2 6 discharge cwc is the premier department in india envisaged with the responsibilities of initiation coordination and consultation of schemes for control conservation and utilization of water resources throughout the country it is responsible for collection compilation storage and retrieval of hydrological data along with overall planning and development of river basins including hydrological studies the daily discharge data available at india wris website cwc isro 2009 for the godavari and krishna river basins was used to calculate the monthly inflow and outflow volumes 3 methods the methodologies used for this study include trend detection and estimation uncertainty estimation of trends and granger causality test the following section provides description of the methodologies as used in this study 3 1 trend analysis most studies using grace data to identify increasing or decreasing trend in tws or groundwater have used linear regression least square fit for trend analysis chen et al 2016 famiglietti et al 2011 huang et al 2015 scanlon et al 2012b velicogna et al 2012 voss et al 2013 the inherent assumptions of normal distribution and independence for linear regression are major limitations of this parametric approach recently multiple linear regression was utilized to isolate linear trend and seasonal component from the time series and mann kendall test was used to test statistical significance of the linear trend khandu et al 2016 mann kendall test kendall 1962 mann 1945 is a non parametric rank based test free from the assumption of normal distribution but requires the assumption of independence seasonal kendall test is a modified version of the mann kendall test which takes care of the seasonality present in a hydrologic time series by dividing the time series into 12 blocks representing each month although this test is quite suitable for hydrologic time series with inherent seasonality the underlying assumption of independence still exists modified seasonal mann kendall msmk test for trend hirsch and slack 1984 proposed a method of estimation of the covariance when the samples are not independent hence msmk test which is free of the assumption of normality and independence is most suited for time series with prominent inherent seasonality in this study msmk test was used to identify the existence of trend and to estimate its statistical significance the trend magnitude was calculated using the theil sen s slope estimator sen 1968 thiel 1950 this method calculates the slope between each pair of data points in the time series and the median of these slope values forms the theil sen s slope estimate this non parametric method is insensitive to outliers and robust is case of skewed and heteroskedastic data 3 2 uncertainty estimation grace derived tws estimates have two major sources of errors i the leakage of unwanted signal from outside the region of interest into the study region known as leakage error swenson and wahr 2002 and ii error in satellite measurement known as measurement error swenson et al 2003 the jet propulsion laboratory s tellus website landerer and swenson 2012 swenson 2017 provides two additional gridded datasets as estimates of measurement and leakage errors in units of centimeter of equivalent water thickness for the same 1 1 grids as grace tws data to estimate the errors associated with the tws time series of each regions of interest the error covariance was considered as the errors of nearby pixels are correlated in this study the total monthly error estimate for a region was calculated as 1 σ total σ measurement 2 σ leakage 2 where σ total represents the monthly error in tws estimate and σ leakage and σ measurement are the leakage and measurement errors respectively this monthly error in tws was propagated to all derived quantities by means of error propagation while the error in trend magnitude was estimated using monte carlo simulation 10 000 time series of tws were generated by adding 10 000 normally distributed random numbers for each data point thus 10 000 estimates of theil sen s slope were obtained and the mean was considered as the slope value and the standard deviation as the error estimate 3 3 granger causality test granger causality test is a hypothesis testing strategy used to check if the time series of a variable x has the ability to predict another variable y when the historical time series of y is also used for prediction thus the test constitutes of construction of two vector autoregressive var models known as the unrestricted and restricted model defined as follows unrestricted model y t a 0 i 1 n a i y t i i 1 n b t i x t i restricted model y t a 0 i 1 n a i y t i a causal relationship is inferred if there is statistically significant increase in the explanatory power of the unrestricted model compared to the restricted model the null hypothesis tested to draw the inference is b i 0 against the alternate hypothesis b i 0 for all i generally using a wald test however in most of the real life situations the problem is not so straight forward and may include complexities such as the non stationarity of the time series and co integration in the present study toda and yamamoto 1995 procedure of testing granger causality was used which takes care of non stationarity of time series following are the steps involved for the same i the time series of both the predictor x and predictand y variables were tested for their order of integration using anderson darling ad test and kwiatkowski phillips schmidt shin kpss test let the maximum order of integration out of the two time series be m ii var models considering maximum lag of 1 6 months were set up irrespective of the order of integration the appropriate var model selected based on the akaike information criterion aic was checked for serial correlation in the residuals using breusch godfrey bg test and durbin watson dw test iii let the maximum lag of the var model selected in the previous step be p for both the predictor and predictand variable another m additional lag terms for both the variables were added to the model to take care for the integration iv the wald test was performed for the final var model with p m terms to test the null hypothesis that the coefficients of the first p lagged terms of the predictor variable to be equal to zero 4 results 4 1 delineation and description of study area as mentioned in the previous section msmk test was used for identification and testing of the statistical significance of trend in grace derived gridded tws time series and theil sen s slope was used to estimate the trend magnitude fig 1 a shows areas of increasing trend of tws in the west central and south eastern parts of india having trend magnitude as high as 20 mm yr over a few grids as a first step these two apparently distinct regions of positive trend were outlined shown in fig 1 a b and d using a two fold measure viz value of trend over a threshold of 6 mm yr and 85 statistical significance the south eastern region includes considerable area of both krishna and godavari river basins and will be referred to as region 1 r1 in further discussions after outlining r1 large areas of these two river basins lie outside the positive trend region fig 1 d as godavari and krishna are the major sources of water in southern and central india it would also be interesting to study variations of tws ssm and swe in these two rivers basins outside r1 and find how they evolve in time these two regions will be referred to as krishna outside region 1 kor1 and godavari outside region 1 gor1 the west central region majorly encompasses the west flowing rivers of india narmada tapi mahi and parts of sabarmati and parts of two sub basins of ganga upper chambal and kali sindh parbati this region will be referred to as region 2 r2 r1 has an area of 181 000 km2 and includes most parts of the indian state of telangana some coastal districts of andhra pradesh and some parts of maharashtra chhattisgarh and karnataka along with the cities of hyderabad and vijayawada r2 has an area of 266 000 km2 and includes large parts of the indian states of madhya pradesh maharashtra gujarat and a small part of rajasthan fig 1 b godavari and krishna river basins outside r1 i e gor1 and kor1 have areas 248 000 km2 and 216 000 km2 respectively although grace data have even been used to detect tws variations over much smaller regions like the california central valley 52 000 km2 famiglietti et al 2011 scanlon et al 2012a b in the present study the area of all the four study regions matches the typical grace footprint 200 000 km2 longuevergne et al 2010 yeh et al 2006 instead of a river basin based approach a region based approach was adopted in the present study which takes into account the heterogeneity of trend in tws over the godavari and krishna river basins and the relatively small size of the narmada tapi and mahi river basins godavari is the second largest river in india area 340 000 km2 followed by the krishna area 280 000 km2 and together form the major source of surface water in peninsular india originating in the western ghats mountain range both these rivers flow east to finally drain into the bay of bengal and are sustained by the rainfall received during the south west monsoon the annual average rainfall received by the godavari and krishna are 1100 mm and 860 mm respectively with a spatial variability in the rainfall patterns over both the basins the maximum rainfall occurs in the western ghats 1000 3000 mm yr the middle belt is much dry receiving 600 mm of rainfall or less annually and the eastern parts especially near the coast is again wet a major part of these two river basins 60 of godavari and 75 of krishna is agricultural land the west central region comprises of the west flowing rivers viz narmada area 98 000 km2 tapi area 65 000 km2 and mahi area 34 000 km2 all these rivers originate in the indian state of madhya pradesh flow through the valleys formed by the aravalli vindhya and satpura mountain ranges finally draining into the arabian sea these basins have a humid and tropical climate with 90 of the rainfall occurring during the monsoon season june to september agricultural land is also the major land use land cover for these river basins accounting for 60 of the combined basin area 4 2 assessment of grace derived tws the ability of gravity measurements of grace satellites to estimate tws in the study areas and its level of accuracy needs to be ascertained before the investigation of tws trends the tws time series were derived for all the four regions and the associated errors were calculated along with et rainfall and total streamflow inflow and outflow inflow for region1 was the total discharge measured by gauges 1 8 and the total outflow was the total discharge measured at gauges 9 and 10 fig 1d the discharge outflow calculated for gor1 was the total discharge measured by gauges 1 5 and that for kor1 was the total discharge measured by gauges 6 8 fig 1 c monthly terrestrial water storage change twsc was derived from grace tws according to the following equation 2 tws c t t w s t t w s t 1 here t denotes a particular month and t 1 the previous month twsc for each month was then compared with δs estimated using the following mass balance equation 3 δ s p e t q in q out here δs is the change in total water storage in a month p is monthly precipitation et is monthly evapotranspiration and qin qout are total monthly inflow outflow respectively grace derived twsc was observed in agreement with δs for all the four study regions across the time period of the study fig 2 r1 and r2 exhibited correlation of 0 73 and 0 82 respectively with their respective nrmse rmse values as 0 16 6 63 cm and 0 14 5 74 cm for gor1 and kor1 the annual cycle of twsc and δs time series appeared to be out of phase by a month this observed disparity may be attributed to the use of only streamflow in channel discharge measured at gauging stations in the mass balance equation whereas the total inflow and outflow in eq 1 in principle includes all the surface and groundwater fluxes and not only the streamflow previous studies have also reported such phase lag in annual cycle where streamflow measurements have been compared with grace derived total basin discharge syed et al 2005 a difference between δs estimate and twsc was also observed in case of gor1 and kor1 correlation of 0 82 for gor1 and 0 56 for kor1 the larger discrepancy in case of kor1 as compared to gor1 could possibly be due to of higher percentage of groundwater flow being part of the total discharge the presence of large number of surface water reservoirs in the krishna river basin gaur and amerasinghe 2011 which restricts the streamflow and contributes to groundwater storage and consequently discharge base flow is probably responsible for the observation 4 3 estimation of swe swe used as a proxy for surface water was defined as the total surface area in square kilometers covered by water swe was estimated based on modis derived ndwi defined by mcfeeters 1996 as ndwi r green r nir r green r nir where rgreen and rnir are the reflectance of the green and near infrared nir bands respectively the value of ndwi varies from 1 to 1 by definition but water surfaces has a value more than zero consequently zero ndwi value was used as a threshold to identify water surfaces i e the pixels having ndwi greater than or equal to zero were considered as water pixels and add up to the total surface water extent of the study area the swe time series for each study region was calculated at the 8 day interval same as the modis reflectance data which was then converted to monthly time series by averaging 4 4 trend analysis and causality test trend analysis of tws swe and ssm time series was performed for all the four regions using msmk test for trend detection and theil sen s slope for estimation of trend magnitude msmk trend test of tws suggested that statistically significant positive trend exists for r1 r2 and gor1 fig 3 with the highest trend magnitude observed for r2 table 2 whereas there was no significant trend found in tws over kor1 as discussed earlier the error estimates of trend were calculated using monte carlo simulation the results also suggested that trend in tws vary in magnitude over godavari river basin and is restricted to a portion of krishna basin this demonstrates the heterogeneous nature of trend in tws over krishna and godavari river basins increasing trends in swe and ssm were also detected over all the four study regions figs 4 and 5 the highest trend magnitude of swe and ssm were observed for r2 and kor1 respectively table 2 the increase in tws ssm and swe observed for the study regions were investigated further to determine the causal factor of the increase it was hypothesized that rainfall was the common cause resulting in increasing trends in tws ssm and swe toda and yamamoto 1995 procedure of granger causality test as described in methods section was used to check for the causality rainfall was found to be granger causal of tws in all the four regions the var models selected for the tests in r1 r2 gor1 and kor1 had maximum lag 4 3 6 and 4 respectively results suggest that rainfall was also a granger causal of swe in r1 r2 and gor1 the var models selected for the tests in the above regions have maximum lag 2 2 and 1 respectively however granger causality test suggested that rainfall is a granger causal of ssm for only r1 and r2 with their respective var models having the maximum lag as 3 and 1 respectively a summary of the granger causality test is provided in table 3 5 discussion and conclusion the regions of increasing tws in the southeastern and west central part of india were outlined and identified as r1 and r2 respectively along with gor1 and kor1 water budget study over these four study areas provided confidence in the usage of grace derived tws to study hydrological changes the average increases in tws over r1 and r2 were estimated to be 8 42 1 48 mm yr and 9 59 0 96 mm yr respectively using theil sen slope estimate according to the trend estimates within the study period of 13 years tws of r1 r2 and gor1 increased by 20 km3 34 km3 and 16 km3 of water respectively in these years volumes much larger that the capacity of even tehri dam 3 5 km3 the largest dam in india positive trends were observed in swe and ssm for all the four study regions indicating a gain in surface water storage which forms a large portion of the utilizable water in these areas the magnitude of trend in swe of r2 was observed to be the highest and almost three times that of the other study regions although trend magnitude of ssm was similar for all four regions highest magnitude was observed for kor1 the trend magnitude of tws was also the highest for r2 the granger causality test conducted for the deseasonalized time series of tws and rainfall suggested that interannual variability in rainfall pattern was evidently the cause of the interannual variability in tws rainfall was also found to be the granger causal of swe in r1 r2 and gor1 whereas in case of ssm rainfall is granger causal for r1 and r2 thus it can be summarized that the positive trends in sws along with tws over r1 and r2 is caused due to the interannual variability in rainfall clearly indicating that r1 and r2 are areas heavily dependent on rainfall as mentioned earlier major portion of the rainfall received in these regions is during the months of june to september as the indian summer monsoon rainfall ismr consequently interannual variability in ismr must be a large contributing factor in determining the interannual variability of rainfall in these areas ismr has a long term all india average value of 852 mm and a standard deviation of 84 7 mm about 10 of the mean year having rainfall more than 10 of the mean is considered a rainfall excess or flood year while a year with rainfall less than 10 of the mean is considered a rainfall deficit or drought year according to ismr values 2002 2004 and 2009 were rainfall deficit or meteorological drought years the year 2002 experienced the third most severe droughts in india in the last 100 years experiencing a deficit of 21 5 of ismr with 56 deficit for the month of july bhat 2006 hence the recovery from the extreme drought conditions is probably one of the factors dictating the increase in water storage in these areas finally it appears that terrestrial water storage in the form of surface water reservoirs soil moisture or groundwater in the indian river basins south of the ganga river basin is very vulnerable to the rainfall deficit in these areas water availability is heavily dependent on the ismr in contrast to ganga brahmaputra and indus river basins covering the northern part of india which have a perennial source of water in the form of melting snow from himalayas a prime concern lies in the increasing frequency of meteorological droughts in india with water shortage becoming an increasing problem in the southern and central part of india the solution of such problems lies in proper water resources

overland flow were selected to verify these two schemes in case 1 a steady rainfall was imposed on the study area during the whole period in case 2 two rainfall intensities and bed slope were involved in case 3 the models were tested by temporal variation in rainfall in the final case these two schemes were tested with different slopes and spatially varying rainfall intensities the simulated results were compared to analytical solutions experimental values the results of the dw and kw models and the sve 4 1 case 1 this case was conducted in a 21 945 m long channel and the slope was 0 04 a uniform rainfall intensity 2 58233 10 5 m s was imposed on this area and the duration was 1200 s the manning equation was applied for computing roughness and its coefficient was 0 5 s m 1 3 the bounce back and zero gradient boundary conditions were applied to the inlet and outlet respectively the spatial and temporal increments were δ x 0 01 m and δ t 0 01 s the relaxation time is 0 51 it can be seen in fig 1 the results of the two lbm schemes demonstrated a good agreement with the analytical values the line graph of runoff rose gradually from 0 to 2 5 m s before reaching a stable status at about 840 s however between 720 and 840 s the simulated values were slightly smaller than the analytical ones the runoff value at the stable state was 2 59 10 5 m s 0 39 less than the analytical solution 2 58 10 5 m s in addition compared to the kw and dw models the results of lbm were more close to those of the kw model the trend of the curve also fit the experimental data provided by morgali and linsley 1965 at t 1200 s the average reynolds number at exit node re is 570 19 and the average froude number at exit node is 0 06 the lattice boltzmann schemes demonstrated a good accuracy of calculation 4 2 case 2 this model was set up in a two dimensional channel with three scenarios kirstetter et al 2016 the length and width were 4 04 m and 1 m and the bed slope was 0 02 0 05 and 0 02 for each scenario respectively in these scenarios the rainfall intensity was 6 95 10 6 6 95 10 6 and 1 389 10 5 m s respectively and the duration was 599 s the spatial and temporal increments were δ x 0 01 m and δ t 0 015 s the manning coefficient was n 0 025 s m 1 3 the bounce back condition was applied to the inlet and the zero gradient boundary condition was set at the exit a no slip boundary is used the relaxation time is 0 6 in fig 2 there was a steady increase in water depth and velocity along the coordinate axis it can be found that there was a good agreement between the simulated results and the experimental values the results of the lbm schemes were slightly higher than kirstetter s results kirstetter et al 2016 which may be a result of the different settings for the boundary conditions in the three scenarios the simulated results were well matched with the experimental data with respect to the water depth while the simulated values were a bit larger in regard to velocity the reynolds number of each scenario at exit node t 599 s is 25 16 27 47 51 79 and the froude number is 0 71 0 78 0 74 respectively 4 3 case 3 the models were tested by temporal variation of rainfall in this case three scenarios were set up with respect to the chezy coefficient c z slope and rainfall intensity govindaraju et al 1990 as presented in table 1 this model was run on a 21 945 meter length plane the initial water depth and velocity were zero the bounce back and zero gradient boundary conditions were used at the entrance and exit respectively the spatial and temporal steps were δ x 0 005 m and δ t 0 001 s the relaxation time is 0 6 the rainfall was imposed on the whole area with a variable intensity the results obtained were compared with that of the dw model the kw model and the full sve in fig 3 a the curves of the four models dw sve equation scheme and equilibrium scheme showed similar trends over the period the runoff increased gradually and was stable at about 1 4 10 5 m s until the rain ended at 2400 s subsequently the runoff slowly declined to around 0 5 10 5 m s the maximum value of the lbm was 1 35 10 5 m s slightly lower than that of sve 1 4 10 5 m s while the runoff at 4800 s of lbm 4 6 10 6 m s was slightly higher than that of sve 3 7 10 6 m s there was a relatively big difference between the simulation results of the kw model and the other four models which indicated its inaccuracy due to neglecting the pressure term in the shallow water equations a good agreement of the simulated results can be seen in the different models in fig 3 b there was a rapid increase in runoff from 0 to 2 8 10 5 m s over the first 1200 s this number declined steadily to 1 5 10 5 m s and then demonstrated an upward trend after peaking at 2 8 10 5 m s at 2400 s the runoff declined to 0 m s at the end of this period although the decrease slowed over the last 1200 s in fig 3 c it can be seen that the runoff kept changing with the rainfall intensity form the beginning to 600 s the value increased dramatically from 0 to 2 83 10 5 m s followed by a decrease to 1 44 10 5 m s at 1200 s the curve then increased again to 2 83 10 5 m s at 1800 s however it dropped to 1 40 10 5 m s when the rain stopped and was reduced to almost 0 m s by the end of the simulation the results of the equation scheme and equilibrium scheme show little difference and are close to those of the diffusion model the simulation results via the sve showed a slight difference at certain points although they agreed well with the other results in scenarios 1 3 the average values of the reynolds number are 150 66 167 58 165 71 and the average values of the froude number are 0 01 0 10 0 09 at exit node respectively 4 4 case 4 in this case different slopes and spatially varying rain intensities were studied the total length of the plane was 24 m divided into three parts of equal length with different slopes 0 020 0 015 and 0 010 from upslope to downslope respectively the rain intensity was 1 081 10 3 6 39 10 4 and 8 00 10 4 m s corresponding to these three sections respectively the duration of rainfall was 10 s the mesh size was δ x 0 01 m and time step was δ t 0 01 s the manning coefficient was n 0 009 s m 1 3 the bounce back and zero gradient boundary conditions were used at the entry and exit respectively the relaxation time is 1 the average value of the reynolds number is 4119 6 and the average value of the froude number is 0 68 at exit node the hydrograph was compared to the analytical solution and experimental values provided in iwagaki 1955 the results simulated by the equation scheme and the equilibrium scheme demonstrated good agreement with the data obtained by iwagaki as shown in fig 4 in the first 20 s there was very little difference between these three results after 22 s the experimental value jumped to 7 53 10 3 m 2 s while the analytical solution increased to 6 91 10 3 m 2 s and the equation scheme gave 6 40 10 3 m 2 s the runoff value of these three approaches then dropped slowly to 3 48 10 4 m 2 s 7 84 10 4 m 2 s and 1 17 10 3 m 2 s respectively overall the equation scheme and the equilibrium scheme agreed well with the analytical solution the stability of these two schemes were tested fig 5 the results showed that the stability varied with the τ value when τ 0 618987 re 131200 the reasonable results could not be obtained by either schemes while τ increases into the range of 0 618987 0 618998 only the equation scheme is able to generate reasonable results and both schemes work well for τ 0 618998 re 4196 3 this shows the better stability of equation scheme in this case it was necessary to perform the sensitivity test of the τ value because the average reynolds number at the exit node was over 4000 and this suggests the flow is turbulent under this circumstance the simulated results were sensitive to the value of τ in fig 6 the simulated runoff of both schemes was obtained according to different τ value there is little difference between the simulated results of both schemes when τ 1 the runoff curve was consistent with the analytical solution when τ is reduced by 10 and 20 the time averaged value of the runoff decreased 0 07 and 0 11 respectively while τ is raised by 10 and 20 it also leads to a decrease of 0 03 and 0 07 in the time averaged value of the runoff respectively 5 conclusion in this study the lbm for rain induced overland flow was developed in two ways the equation scheme and equilibrium scheme four numerical cases with different types of rainfall intensities rainfall durations bed slopes and bottom resistances were employed to test the proposed schemes the reasonable range of the τ value in the numerical tests is τ 0 618998 i e re 4196 3 within which the results are insensitive to τ by comparing the simulated results with that of different models it was demonstrated that both schemes could deal with variation in rainfall and showed a good accuracy in rain induced overland flow modeling however the equation scheme is preferred in practice on account of that rainfall is physically always a durative quantity and takes place during the streaming step and

overland flow were selected to verify these two schemes in case 1 a steady rainfall was imposed on the study area during the whole period in case 2 two rainfall intensities and bed slope were involved in case 3 the models were tested by temporal variation in rainfall in the final case these two schemes were tested with different slopes and spatially varying rainfall intensities the simulated results were compared to analytical solutions experimental values the results of the dw and kw models and the sve 4 1 case 1 this case was conducted in a 21 945 m long channel and the slope was 0 04 a uniform rainfall intensity 2 58233 10 5 m s was imposed on this area and the duration was 1200 s the manning equation was applied for computing roughness and its coefficient was 0 5 s m 1 3 the bounce back and zero gradient boundary conditions were applied to the inlet and outlet respectively the spatial and temporal increments were δ x 0 01 m and δ t 0 01 s the relaxation time is 0 51 it can be seen in fig 1 the results of the two lbm schemes demonstrated a good agreement with the analytical values the line graph of runoff rose gradually from 0 to 2 5 m s before reaching a stable status at about 840 s however between 720 and 840 s the simulated values were slightly smaller than the analytical ones the runoff value at the stable state was 2 59 10 5 m s 0 39 less than the analytical solution 2 58 10 5 m s in addition compared to the kw and dw models the results of lbm were more close to those of the kw model the trend of the curve also fit the experimental data provided by morgali and linsley 1965 at t 1200 s the average reynolds number at exit node re is 570 19 and the average froude number at exit node is 0 06 the lattice boltzmann schemes demonstrated a good accuracy of calculation 4 2 case 2 this model was set up in a two dimensional channel with three scenarios kirstetter et al 2016 the length and width were 4 04 m and 1 m and the bed slope was 0 02 0 05 and 0 02 for each scenario respectively in these scenarios the rainfall intensity was 6 95 10 6 6 95 10 6 and 1 389 10 5 m s respectively and the duration was 599 s the spatial and temporal increments were δ x 0 01 m and δ t 0 015 s the manning coefficient was n 0 025 s m 1 3 the bounce back condition was applied to the inlet and the zero gradient boundary condition was set at the exit a no slip boundary is used the relaxation time is 0 6 in fig 2 there was a steady increase in water depth and velocity along the coordinate axis it can be found that there was a good agreement between the simulated results and the experimental values the results of the lbm schemes were slightly higher than kirstetter s results kirstetter et al 2016 which may be a result of the different settings for the boundary conditions in the three scenarios the simulated results were well matched with the experimental data with respect to the water depth while the simulated values were a bit larger in regard to velocity the reynolds number of each scenario at exit node t 599 s is 25 16 27 47 51 79 and the froude number is 0 71 0 78 0 74 respectively 4 3 case 3 the models were tested by temporal variation of rainfall in this case three scenarios were set up with respect to the chezy coefficient c z slope and rainfall intensity govindaraju et al 1990 as presented in table 1 this model was run on a 21 945 meter length plane the initial water depth and velocity were zero the bounce back and zero gradient boundary conditions were used at the entrance and exit respectively the spatial and temporal steps were δ x 0 005 m and δ t 0 001 s the relaxation time is 0 6 the rainfall was imposed on the whole area with a variable intensity the results obtained were compared with that of the dw model the kw model and the full sve in fig 3 a the curves of the four models dw sve equation scheme and equilibrium scheme showed similar trends over the period the runoff increased gradually and was stable at about 1 4 10 5 m s until the rain ended at 2400 s subsequently the runoff slowly declined to around 0 5 10 5 m s the maximum value of the lbm was 1 35 10 5 m s slightly lower than that of sve 1 4 10 5 m s while the runoff at 4800 s of lbm 4 6 10 6 m s was slightly higher than that of sve 3 7 10 6 m s there was a relatively big difference between the simulation results of the kw model and the other four models which indicated its inaccuracy due to neglecting the pressure term in the shallow water equations a good agreement of the simulated results can be seen in the different models in fig 3 b there was a rapid increase in runoff from 0 to 2 8 10 5 m s over the first 1200 s this number declined steadily to 1 5 10 5 m s and then demonstrated an upward trend after peaking at 2 8 10 5 m s at 2400 s the runoff declined to 0 m s at the end of this period although the decrease slowed over the last 1200 s in fig 3 c it can be seen that the runoff kept changing with the rainfall intensity form the beginning to 600 s the value increased dramatically from 0 to 2 83 10 5 m s followed by a decrease to 1 44 10 5 m s at 1200 s the curve then increased again to 2 83 10 5 m s at 1800 s however it dropped to 1 40 10 5 m s when the rain stopped and was reduced to almost 0 m s by the end of the simulation the results of the equation scheme and equilibrium scheme show little difference and are close to those of the diffusion model the simulation results via the sve showed a slight difference at certain points although they agreed well with the other results in scenarios 1 3 the average values of the reynolds number are 150 66 167 58 165 71 and the average values of the froude number are 0 01 0 10 0 09 at exit node respectively 4 4 case 4 in this case different slopes and spatially varying rain intensities were studied the total length of the plane was 24 m divided into three parts of equal length with different slopes 0 020 0 015 and 0 010 from upslope to downslope respectively the rain intensity was 1 081 10 3 6 39 10 4 and 8 00 10 4 m s corresponding to these three sections respectively the duration of rainfall was 10 s the mesh size was δ x 0 01 m and time step was δ t 0 01 s the manning coefficient was n 0 009 s m 1 3 the bounce back and zero gradient boundary conditions were used at the entry and exit respectively the relaxation time is 1 the average value of the reynolds number is 4119 6 and the average value of the froude number is 0 68 at exit node the hydrograph was compared to the analytical solution and experimental values provided in iwagaki 1955 the results simulated by the equation scheme and the equilibrium scheme demonstrated good agreement with the data obtained by iwagaki as shown in fig 4 in the first 20 s there was very little difference between these three results after 22 s the experimental value jumped to 7 53 10 3 m 2 s while the analytical solution increased to 6 91 10 3 m 2 s and the equation scheme gave 6 40 10 3 m 2 s the runoff value of these three approaches then dropped slowly to 3 48 10 4 m 2 s 7 84 10 4 m 2 s and 1 17 10 3 m 2 s respectively overall the equation scheme and the equilibrium scheme agreed well with the analytical solution the stability of these two schemes were tested fig 5 the results showed that the stability varied with the τ value when τ 0 618987 re 131200 the reasonable results could not be obtained by either schemes while τ increases into the range of 0 618987 0 618998 only the equation scheme is able to generate reasonable results and both schemes work well for τ 0 618998 re 4196 3 this shows the better stability of equation scheme in this case it was necessary to perform the sensitivity test of the τ value because the average reynolds number at the exit node was over 4000 and this suggests the flow is turbulent under this circumstance the simulated results were sensitive to the value of τ in fig 6 the simulated runoff of both schemes was obtained according to different τ value there is little difference between the simulated results of both schemes when τ 1 the runoff curve was consistent with the analytical solution when τ is reduced by 10 and 20 the time averaged value of the runoff decreased 0 07 and 0 11 respectively while τ is raised by 10 and 20 it also leads to a decrease of 0 03 and 0 07 in the time averaged value of the runoff respectively 5 conclusion in this study the lbm for rain induced overland flow was developed in two ways the equation scheme and equilibrium scheme four numerical cases with different types of rainfall intensities rainfall durations bed slopes and bottom resistances were employed to test the proposed schemes the reasonable range of the τ value in the numerical tests is τ 0 618998 i e re 4196 3 within which the results are insensitive to τ by comparing the simulated results with that of different models it was demonstrated that both schemes could deal with variation in rainfall and showed a good accuracy in rain induced overland flow modeling however the equation scheme is preferred in practice on account of that rainfall is physically always a durative quantity and takes place during the streaming step and

7258,managed aquifer recharge mar is increasingly used as a water management tool to enhance water availability and to improve water quality until now however the risk of fluoride release during mar with low ionic strength injectate has not been recognised or examined in this study we analyse and report the mobilisation of fluoride up to 58 µm and filterable reactive phosphorus frp up to 55 µm during a field groundwater replenishment experiment in which highly treated deionised wastewater average tds 33 mg l was injected into a siliciclastic cretaceous aquifer in the field experiment maximum concentrations which coincided with a rise in ph exceeded background groundwater concentrations by an average factor of 3 6 for fluoride and 24 for frp the combined results from the field experiment a detailed mineralogical characterisation and geochemical modelling suggested carbonate rich fluorapatite cfa ca10 po4 5 co3 f f2 to be the most likely source of fluoride and phosphate release an anoxic batch experiment with powdered cfa rich nodules sourced from the target aquifer and aqueous solutions of successively decreasing ionic strength closely replicated the field observed fluoride and phosphate behaviour based on the laboratory experiment and geochemical modelling we hypothesise that the release of fluoride and phosphate results from the incongruent dissolution of cfa and the simultaneous formation of a depleted layer that has hydrated di basic calcium phosphate cahpo4 nh2o composition at the cfa water interface disequilibrium caused by calcium removal following breakthrough of the deionised injectate triggered the release of fluoride and phosphate given the increasing use of highly treated deionised water for mar and the ubiquitous presence of cfa and fluorapatite ca10 po4 6f2 in aquifer settings worldwide the risk of fluoride and phosphate release needs to be considered in the mar design process keywords managed aquifer recharge fluoride phosphate carbonate rich fluorapatite deionised wastewater 1 introduction globally but especially in arid and semiarid regions managed aquifer recharge mar is an increasingly used water management tool it involves infiltration or direct injection of water into suitable aquifers to improve and secure long term water supplies casanova et al 2016 dillon and arshad 2016 in most applications of mar the infiltration or injection of various water types e g surface water purified wastewater stormwater runoff typically creates a geochemical disequilibrium that triggers a wide range of water rock interactions descourvieres et al 2010a fakhreddine et al 2015 mcnab et al 2009 treumann et al 2014 vanderzalm et al 2010 wallis et al 2011 for selected sedimentary aquifer types this re equilibration can induce the risk of mobilising geogenic fluoride gaus et al 2002 while concentrations of fluoride 0 5 mg l 26 µm in drinking water are considered beneficial to human and animal health concentrations 1 5 mg l 79 µm can lead to dental fluorosis and in extreme cases skeletal fluorosis edmunds and smedley 2013 fantong et al 2010 who 2017 while high concentrations of dissolved fluoride are not commonly associated with sedimentary aquifers elevated fluoride concentrations have been associated with the presence of fluorite caf2 in chalk aquifers gaus et al 2002 malcuit et al 2014 anion exchange with fluoride bearing phyllosilicates edmunds and smedley 2013 guo et al 2007 and the biologically and or chemically derived fluoride bearing phosphate minerals fluorapatite fap ca10

fluoride concentrations have been commonly associated with the presence of fluorite as well as primary rock forming fap fluoride bearing phyllosilicates and hornblende edmunds and smedley 2013 fantong et al 2010 rafique et al 2015 raju 2017 cfa also referred to as francolite in economic deposits predominantly forms in marine environments under reducing conditions especially where there is upwelling ruttenberg 2003 kholodov 2014 it is however also known to form in freshwater lacustrine environments föllmi 1996 kholodov 2014 bone hydroxyapatite ca10 po4 6 oh 2 as well as muscle tissue can re mineralise as cfa keenan 2016 recent studies have shown that during the mesozoic marine and land vertebrates incorporated extensive amounts of fap into tooth material enameloid and dentin whereas at present only the enameloid in cartilaginous fish e g sharks is fap while all other vertebrate groups have hydroxyapatite tooth material lübke et al 2015 therefore the age and depositional history of the sedimentary aquifers may influence the amount of biogenic fluoride bearing phosphate minerals that are present and whether fluoride may be mobilised during mar cfa is a variety of fap with a stable defect consisting of a planar carbonate group and fluoride ion pairing that replaces up to approximately 1 4 phosphate tetrahedra per unit cell within the apatite structure hexagonal p63 m space group dorozhkin 2015 hughes and rakovan 2002 mcclellan 1980 yi et al 2013 calcium atoms in the fap structure exist in two different coordinations 9 fold and 7 fold with oxygen atoms from the phosphate tetrahedral and fluoride ions occurring in structural channels chaïrat et al 2007b dorozhkin 2012 carbonate ions in cfa can also occur in the main structural channels as well as pair with fluoride in phosphate site yi et al 2013 the apatite structure in general allows a multitude of substitutions hughes and rakovan 2002 jarvis et al 1994 pan and fleet 2002 the substitutions in cfa especially the main carbonate defect limit the size to which cfa crystals can grow usually to 0 3 2 μm in size mcclellan and lehr 1969 the dissolution mechanism of calcium apatite is complex and is still not fully understood see for example the reviews by dorozhkin 2002 and dorozhkin 2012 cfa and fap are sparingly soluble under circumneutral ph conditions and have solubility products that vary with ph chaïrat et al 2007a jahnke 1984 experimental studies have demonstrated that dissolution of cfa and fap in low ionic strength water and at circumneutral phs is initially incongruent whereby the ratios of fluoride to phosphate and calcium to phosphate exceed the stoichiometric ratios existing in the mineral bengtsson et al 2009 chaïrat et al 2007b guidry and mackenzie 2003 zhu et al 2009 based on experiments using fap zhu et al 2009 found that the preferential release of phosphate and fluoride accompanied by a rapid rise in solution ph dissolution of fap has been proposed to start as a rapid proton exchange reaction whereby h is adsorbed onto the apatite surface triggering the combined released of fluoride and weakly coordinated calcium this results in the formation of a leached layer of dicalcium phosphate dcp cahpo4 nh2o composition at the fap surface chaïrat et al 2007a zhu et al 2009 attributed the observed early preferential release of phosphate to dissolution of crystal edges and corners jahnke 1984 also found that during the initial dissolution of synthetic cfa carbonate ions were also likely to be released preferentially after the initial incongruent stage the dissolution of cfa and fap gradually becomes stoichiometric chaïrat et al 2007b guidry and mackenzie 2003 the stoichiometric dissolution occurs when equilibrium is reached where the rate of release of weakly coordinated calcium internally from the bulk mineral as h ions traverse the leached surface layer equals the rate of release of more strongly coordinated calcium at the surface layer solution boundary chaïrat et al 2007b the rate of stoichiometric dissolution of cfa and fap is relatively slow near and above ph 7 and increases with decreasing ph under acidic conditions chaïrat et al 2007b guidry and mackenzie 2003 aquifers in equilibrium with fluoride bearing phosphate minerals do not necessarily contain high concentrations of fluoride in groundwater for example travi 1993 noted that groundwater in contact with cfa deposits in north west tunisia contained low fluoride concentrations most likely due to the high dissolved calcium concentrations that persist as a result of the presence of gypsum caso4 2h2o in the aquifer however fluoride mobilisation may occur where dissolved calcium concentrations are low for example travi 1993 noted elevated fluoride concentrations in cfa containing aquifers in senegal with low calcium concentrations high fluoride concentrations have also been reported for aquifers containing cfa and trace phosphate minerals where calcium has been removed from groundwater as a result of calcite precipitation abu jabal et al 2014 kumar et al 2018 rafique et al 2015 or cation exchange edmunds and smedley 2013 these naturally occurring water rock interactions illustrate the potential for fluoride mobilisation to occur during mar in cases where the injectate contains lower concentrations of calcium than the native groundwater ngw to our knowledge the risk of fluoride and phosphate release from aquifers during mar with low ionic strength water has neither been recognised nor examined in this study we report for the first time fluoride and phosphate release during a large scale closely monitored field experiment in which deionised wastewater was injected into a cretaceous siliciclastic aquifer with low background fluoride concentration combining field observations with supporting laboratory experiments and geochemical modelling we identify the trace cfa phases in this aquifer and reveal the mechanisms that control fluoride release 2 material and methods 2 1 site characteristics and field injection experiment a comprehensive field scale injection experiment was conducted between november 2010 and september 2014 to investigate the feasibility of recharging highly treated wastewater into the cretaceous siliciclastic leederville aquifer of the perth basin western australia fig 1 seibert et al 2014 2016 the highly treated wastewater was injected through a single injection well screened between 123 7 and 224 4 m below ground level bgl fig 2 the targeted injection interval comprised the wanneroo member of the leederville formation which is locally confined above by the silty sands silts and clays of the pinjar member and below by both the mariginiup member and the south perth shale descourvieres et al 2011 leyland 2011 the leederville formation sediments consist of interbedded sand clay and silt layers that were deposited in a marginal marine setting leyland 2011 sand layers are subarkosic and composed mostly of quartz 64 and k feldspars 27 while silt and clay beds contain kaolinite 24 54 k feldspar 20 29 and quartz 18 40 descourvieres et al 2011 trace minerals which have been detected include pyrite lignite siderite muscovite and biotite pre treatment of the wastewater involved ultra filtration reverse osmosis and ultra violet disinfection resulting in oxic deionised wastewater higginson and martin 2012 over the trial period a total of 3 90 106 m3 of this pre treated wastewater was injected at an average injection rate of 2800 m3 d the spreading of the injectant was monitored through an extensive groundwater sampling program through 20 monitoring wells and time lapse temperature logging the 20 monitoring wells were arranged in 5 multilevel well clusters at radial distances of 20 60 120 180 and 240 m from the injection well figs 1 and 2 groundwater quality evolution in all 20 monitoring wells was monitored throughout the trial for a broad range of water quality indicators including ph redox potential dissolved oxygen alkalinity major ions nutrients heavy metals metalloids and organic substances all water quality samples were stored on ice immediately following collection and submitted for analysis the same day ngw conditions were established at all monitoring wells through repeated groundwater quality sampling commencing approximately 2 years prior to the start of injection additionally injectant samples were taken monthly from the post treatment reservoir tank shortly before injection and analysed in a similar fashion detailed descriptions of the sampling and analytical procedures are given in water corporation 2009 time lapse temperature and induction logging of the monitoring wells and subsequent solute and heat transport modelling demonstrated that flow and transport occurred preferentially in the interlayered sand beds seibert et al 2014 previous column experiments and reactive transport modelling identified pyrite oxidation as a key reaction that occurred when the injectant displaced the highly reducing ngw particularly in the vicinity of the injection well descourvieres et al 2010a b seibert et al 2016 acidity generated from pyrite oxidation was found to be buffered by a combination of proton exchange on cation exchange sites and to a lesser extent the dissolution of trace carbonate minerals ankerite and siderite as well as dissolution of glauconite and chlorite seibert et al 2016 fluoride and phosphate pulses were observed during breakthrough of the injected pre treated wastewater 2 2 characterisation of carbonate fluorapatite contained in the leederville formation sediments to identify potential sources of fluoride and phosphate compositional and mineralogical analyses were conducted on the leederville formation sediments from core material collected from a bore 525 m to the north of the injection well several apatite rich nodules were recovered the interval in which the nodules were found was 112 2 m bgl within fine grained leederville formation sediments polished carbon coated sections of these nodules were analysed using a jeol jsm 7001f emission scanning electron microscope sem with a bruker quantax 400 energy dispersive spectroscopy elemental mapping system high resolution images of the nodule sections were obtained using a tescan vega3 and fei various sem compositional analyses of individual micron sized grains within a selected nodule were undertaken using a jeol jxa 8500f electron microprobe equipped with five wavelength dispersive spectrometers and two energy dispersive spectrometers the analyses were performed on surfaces polished to a 1 µm diamond finish the electron probe micro analyser was operated at an accelerating voltage of 10 kv beam current of 5 na and the beam was defocused to 2 µm the relatively low voltage of 10 kv was chosen to reduce the interaction volume as the cfa was fine grained the suite of elements analysed included ca p f al cl s fe na and si to minimise damage to the sample and mitigate migration of light elements under the electron beam counting times were set to 4 s for ca and p 6 s for f and 10 s for the other elements standards used were fap ca 5 po4 3 f berlinite alpo4 sylvite kcl pyrite fes 2 hematite fe 2o3 albite naalsi3o8 and wollastonite casio3 all elements analysed were corrected for atomic number absorption and fluorescence using the citzaf phi rho z correction procedure armstrong 1995 with oxygen calculated by stoichiometry and carbon calculated by difference additionally the nodules were characterised using both fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and x ray diffraction xrd ftir spectra were collected using a vertex 70 fourier transform infrared spectrometer and hyperion 3000 microscope bruker the microscope was operated in attenuated total reflectance mode using a liquid nitrogen cooled mercury cadmium telluride detector measurements were made with a 20 objective and an area of 30 30 µm was sampled spectra were collected between 4000 and 600 cm 1 using 64 scans a resolution of 2 cm 1 and air was used as the background the ftir peak assignments are based on various references antonakos et al 2007 yi et al 2013 zhu et al 2009 xrd spectra of the nodules were collected using a panalytical x pert pro xrd system see supporting information for details the diffraction patterns were matched against the icdd pdf database using the panalytical x pert highscore plus software 2 3 anoxic batch experiment sampling and analyses to investigate whether fluoride and phosphate in the groundwater at the field site were released specifically from cfa two sets of batch experiments were performed in duplication under anoxic condition that approximately mimicked the geochemical condition during the field injection trial in the experiment artificial groundwater in equilibrium with cfa was gradually replaced with artificial deionised injectate dei water and the solutions were sampled and monitored for compositional changes artificial stock solutions representative of the ngw and the dei were prepared using analytical grade reagents and ultrapure water the compositions of the ngw and dei stock solutions were based on the groundwater composition at the base of the injection interval and the average pre treated wastewater composition respectively table 1 higginson and martin 2012 the ngw solution consisted of 426 mg l na 73 mg l hco3 47 mg l so4 2 and 580 mg l cl ionic strength i 17 35 mm while the dei solution consisted of 12 1 mg l na 17 6 mg l hco3 and 8 7 mg l cl i 0 53 mm five solution mixtures were then made by mixing the stock solutions by volume as 100 ngw 75 ngw 25 dei 50 ngw 50 dei 25 ngw 75 dei and 100 dei all solutions were de oxygenated by purging with nitrogen gas n2 before use a large cfa rich nodule was collected from the same interval from which the nodule used for the microprobe compositional analysis was sourced this nodule was ground into a fine powder using an agate mortar a portion of the powder was analysed for elemental composition by x ray fluorescence xrf with a panalytical axios advanced wavelength dispersive system see supporting information for details the remainder of the powder was used for the batch experiments two cfa powder samples sample 1 weighing 0 989 g and sample 2 weighing 0 962 g were placed in two 15 ml polypropylene centrifuge vials to each of which 10 ml of the 100 ngw solution was added the ph was measured using a tps 90fl mv multi parameter instrument with an intermediate junction ph electrode ij 44c ionode to remove the acidity generated by pyrite oxidation during exposure of the nodule to air the ph was adjusted from around ph 4 using naoh to a ph similar to the ngw vial 1 ph 7 09 and vial 2 ph 7 23 the ph adjusted solid solution mixtures were purged with n2 for 30 min the vials were centrifuged at 3316g for 10 min before the supernatant was decanted and replaced with 10 ml of de oxygenated 100 ngw solution the head space in the vials were replaced with n2 capped and transferred to an anoxic chamber coy laboratory products where the solid solution mixtures were equilibrated for 124 days during the 124 day equilibration period the mixtures were periodically shaken by hand after 124 days the ph of the solid solution mixtures was measured in the anoxic chamber the sealed vials were removed from the chamber centrifuged for 10 min at 3316g and then transferred back to the chamber the supernatant was decanted and filtered to 0 45 µm cellulose acetate membrane whatman puradisc fp 30 and the solids were then treated with 10 ml of de oxygenated 75 ngw 25 dei solution the capped vials were removed from the chamber and placed on an end over end mixer for 60 min before being centrifuged at 3316g for 10 min the vials were then returned to the chamber where the ph was measured and the supernatant was decanted and filtered 0 45 µm this procedure was repeated three times for the remaining mixtures during which the ngw fraction was succesively reduced the solution samples were analysed for ca2 mg2 na k cl so4 2 f and po4 3 concentrations using a dionex ics 3000 ion chromatography system cations were analysed using ionpac cs16 analytical and guard columns with an eluent of 30 mm methanesulfonic acid at a flow rate of 1 2 ml min anions were analysed using ionpac as18 analytical and guard columns in gradient mode with eluent concentrations increasing from 12 to 45 mm potassium hydroxide at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min the f and po4 3 concentrations were determined using the method of standard additions ultrapure water milli q was used to prepare standards and dilute samples instrument drift was corrected for by the addition of an internal standard lithium fluoride 20 mg l for determination of ions except for f and po4 3 bicarbonate hco3 was measured separately by titration using a hanna hi 3811 total alkalinity kit the ngw dei solution mixtures were used in these analyses as blanks 2 4 geochemical modelling of pre injection native groundwater and anoxic batch experiment saturation indices sis for a suite of potentially labile fluoride and phosphate bearing phases were calculated with phreeqc parkhurst 2015 under pre injection native conditions the standard phreeqc dat database was modified to include additional fluoride and phosphate minerals and calcium phosphate salts as well as revised equilibrium constants from the literature sis were calculated at 25 c consistent with the ngw temperature of 25 3 0 8 c n 88 in total 88 groundwater compositions from 20 monitoring wells were analysed geochemical modelling of the anoxic batch experiment was undertaken with phreeqc to test the proposed conceptual model of the processes controlling fluoride and phosphate release with decreasing ionic strength in the reaction network cfa dissolution was modelled as an exchange reaction in which cfa dissolution and the formation of hydrated di basic calcium phosphate dcp cahpo4 nh2o at the water mineral interface occur simultaneously in response to proton attack i e changes in ph the anoxic batch experiment was modelled as a sequence of mixing events and the corresponding adjustments of the water sediment equilibria the initial exchanger composition prior to the mixing dilution events was determined through equilibration with the solution composition that was determined after the initial 124 day equilibration period with 100 ngw decanting and replacing the solution with the 75 ngw 25 dei mixture was modelled by mixing the ngw dei solutions 95 of the total volume with the residual porewater 5 of the total volume while maintaining equilibrium with the exchange sites and selected minerals the above step was repeated for 50 ngw 50 dei 25 ngw 75 dei and 100 dei 3 results 3 1 pre injection native groundwater the ngw in the leederville aquifer consisted of na cl to na cl hco3 type water with a tds that increased with depth ranging from 400 to 1100 mg l and low fluoride and phosphorus concentrations of both 0 3 mg l table 1 the sis calculated for the pre injection native conditions indicated that the groundwater was under saturated with respect to all fluoride and phosphate bearing mineral phases fig 3 among the fluoride and phosphate bearing minerals investigated the surface layer that has a dcp composition at the fap water interface hereinafter referred to as dcp surface chaïrat et al 2007a was the phase that was closest to equilibrium with the ngw median si 1 07 range 1 42 to 0 18 the groundwater showed to be more under saturated with respect to the fap bulk mineral median si 1 69 range 4 16 to 2 54 than with respect to the dcp surface this may be indicative of the presence of fap or cfa at the study site the si for cfa was calculated using the solubility product for cfa with a composition of one carbonate ion per unit cell content jahnke 1984 however jahnke 1984 showed that the solubility product varies significantly with carbonate content since the composition of cfa was not known a priori it was not possible to determine how close the bulk mineral of cfa is to equilibrium a number of groundwater samples show sis near zero for vivianite fe3 po4 2 8h2o median si 2 60 range 4 15 to 0 40 suggesting that this iron phosphate mineral might locally prevail within the aquifer fluorite the presence of which is a common cause of elevated fluoride concentration in groundwater was always under saturated median si 3 26 range 4 32 to 2 70 and is presumably absent the median si for the carbonate mineral siderite feco3 was 0 09 range 0 59 to 0 39 and therefore close to saturation this is consistent with its previous detection in fine grained leederville formation sediments descourvieres et al 2011 a number of other carbonate minerals were under saturated calcite median si 1 58 dolomite median si 2 88 ankerite median si 3 12 along with gypsum median si 3 01 as discussed in more detail in seibert et al 2016 3 2 fluoride and phosphate breakthrough behaviour during the field experiment during the field injection experiment highly treated wastewater was injected the pre treatment resulted in deionised water with low dissolved solids concentration tds of 33 2 10 9 mg l and relatively high dissolved oxygen concentration of 8 3 0 5 mg l table 1 higginson and martin 2012 arrival times of the injectate as indicated by the decrease in the concentration of the conservative solute chloride increased with distance from the injection well and varied with depth figs 4 and 5 at 20 m from the injection well the fastest complete breakthrough of chloride occurred after 21 days at monitoring well by11 while at 240 m the fastest complete breakthrough occurred after 1155 days at monitoring well by17 pulses of increased fluoride and phosphate concentration were observed upon breakthrough of the injectate as indicated by cl at most monitoring locations fig 4 generally increased fluoride concentrations occurred slightly before increased phosphate concentrations observed peak concentrations of fluoride ranged from 12 μm to 58 μm exceeding background concentrations by a factor of 3 6 1 2 n 20 observed peak concentrations of phosphate measured as filterable reactive phosphorus frp ranged from 3 9 μm to 55 μm exceeding background concentrations by a factor of 24 1 16 2 n 20 concentrations of phosphate were consistently lower than fluoride concentration with the ratio of phosphate to fluoride concentrations being 0 82 0 22 n 20 with increasing distance from the injection well the observed pulses of fluoride and phosphate generally became broader while also increasing in amplitude figs 4 and 5 a few selected monitoring bores located at 20 m from the injection well e g by11 by08 and by06 showed a small sustained increase in fluoride while the phosphate pulse declined rapidly fig 4 with continued injection fluoride and phosphate decreased to background concentrations with the phosphate concentrations declining faster than the fluoride concentrations a rise in ph from around 0 2 to 1 0 ph units also occurred upon breakthrough of the dei figs 4 and 5 the rise in ph in proximal bores i e where breakthrough was fast was generally followed by a slow decrease in ph more distal bores on the other hand showed a sustained elevated ph post breakthrough fig 4 during the period when elevated fluoride 0 020 0 058 mm occurred the ph ranged from 6 6 to 7 7 for all monitoring bores 7 12 0 21 n 240 during the period when elevated fluoride and phosphate concentrations occurred dissolved calcium concentrations were low or decreasing while sodium concentrations increased fig 5j k therefore na ca ratios were elevated relative to the native ratios that prevailed prior to injection synchronous with the decrease in fluoride and phosphate concentrations the na ca ratios declined to approximately stable values that however were lower than the native ratios fig 5g i an increase in bicarbonate concentrations relative to chloride also occurred upon the breakthrough of the dei during the field experiment fig 5d f the sis for dcp surface showed close to equilibrium conditions throughout the experiment fig 5m o the sis for fap on the other hand indicate a temporary oversaturation while fluoride and phosphate concentrations were elevated the sis for fap and dcp surface decreased post breakthrough while fluoride and phosphate concentrations declined fig 5m 5n fap precipitation during the period of fap oversaturation was presumably insignificant due to slow kinetics and nucleation considerations cappellen and berner 1991 the sis for many other fluoride and phosphate bearing minerals calcium phosphate salts and carbonate minerals suggested under saturation except for some isolated values for vivianite β tricalcium phosphate β tcp and hydroxyapatite during the occurrence of phosphate peak concentrations and for gypsum during the initial stages of breakthrough of the dei fig s3 3 3 habit and composition of the apatite rich nodules descourvieres et al 2011 showed that total phosphorus concentration in the aquifer sediments over the injection interval ranged between 0 01 and 0 29 wt p2o5 0 047 0 049 wt n 40 this suggested that phosphate minerals are only present in trace amounts and that consequently it would be difficult to find individual mineral grains from sediment samples see pe piper and dolansky 2005 however several dark micaceous fine grained 0 3 3 cm apatite rich nodules were recovered within fine grained leederville formation sediments the sem images showed that apatite occurs as aggregates of micron sized crystallites that form an infilling cement between grains of other minerals such as quartz k feldspar and kaolinite fig 6 this is consistent with the habit and crystal size of cfa mcclellan and lehr 1969 pyrite and carbon clasts commonly occur in association with the apatite cement the assemblage of minerals associated with cfa is suggestive of a biogenic origin for cfa from the remineralisation of bone and tissue in an anoxic environment kholodov 2014 high concentrations of barium 443 mg kg and strontium 345 mg kg found in the cfa nodule table s1 which substitute for calcium in the apatite structure pan and fleet 2002 and are known to concentrate in bones trueman and tuross 2002 also suggest a biogenic origin compositional analysis of selected apatite crystallites using electron microprobe show a compositional variation between crystallites table 2 the co3 was initially calculated based on the formula ca fe al na 10 po 4 6 x co 3 f x f oh 2 with x depending on the amount of phosphate the oh was then calculated to balance f all elements were iteratively matrix corrected with the pap matrix correction algorithm implemented in strata pouchou 1993 a representative unit cell formula for cfa from the leederville formation sediments based on the francolite model of mcclellan 1980 was found to be ca 9 75 na 0 25 po 4 5 37 co 3 f 0 55 f 1 82 oh 0 18 it was assumed that trace s fe al and si present was due to trace pyrite and kaolinite present within the 2 µm microprobe beam size because the ratios of these elements were consistent with these minerals the determined composition has a relatively low carbonate content but is within the range of cfa compositions typically reported from around the world guidry and mackenzie 2003 infrared spectra collected on a selected cfa rich nodule revealed a number of intense ir absorption bands at 3333 1609 1460 1400 and 1100 950 cm 1 fig s1 these four bands are characteristic of hydroxyl oh stretching vibration water oh bending vibration carbonate co3 2 stretching vibration and phosphate po4 3 stretching vibration species respectively the oh peak at 3333 cm 1 was relatively broad and is typical of a hydroxyl group that has formed hydrogen bonds h bonds some weak bands were observed in the ir spectra between 3700 and 3600 cm 1 which can be attributed to hydroxyl groups that are not involved in h bonds or surface oh groups and may also arise from a minor amount of kaolinite that was present compared to previous ftir studies on fluorapatite antonakos et al 2007 yi et al 2013 the oh bending vibration at 1609 cm 1 was much more intense suggesting that the cfa form our study site has a higher degree of hydration 3 4 anoxic batch experiment the phosphorus content of the powdered nodule used in the anoxic batch experiment was found to be 8 73 wt p2o5 as determined by xrf if assuming that all the phosphorus is present as cfa then 24 4 by weight of the nodule is cfa other minerals present in the cfa rich nodule include quartz k feldspar pyrite kaolin chlorite and gypsum as identified by xrd fig s2 the cfa rich powder was equilibrated with the ngw solution for 124 days after which the dissolved concentrations of fluoride and phosphate were below the detection limits i e below 3 µm in the case of fluoride and 2 µm in the case of phosphate table 3 and fig 7 the dissolved calcium concentrations however were very high with the average concentration being 1 4 mm given that no calcium was present in the artificial ngw solution the elevated calcium concentrations may have been caused by the presence of secondary gypsum caso4 2h2o in the nodule and by cation exchange the high calcium concentrations suppressed cfa dissolution and resulted in very low fluoride and phosphate concentrations in the ngw solution however fluoride and subsequently phosphate were released when the cfa rich powder was brought in contact with successively increasing proportions of dei fig 7a when the 75 ngw 25 dei mixture was added dissolved fluoride concentration increased to 7 µm concentrations increased further to 20 5 µm in the 50 ngw 50 dei mixture and reached a maximum of 45 µm in the 100 dei solution in contrast dissolved phosphate concentrations remained low until contact with the 100 dei solution where it reached 27 µm the ph increased with each successive mixture from ph 5 8 after the initial 124 day equilibration period to ph 7 4 in the 100 dei mixture with the latter being similar to the ph observed during the field trial fig 7b bicarbonate concentrations also rose during the later stages of the anoxic batch experiment fig 7b calcium concentrations decreased rapidly after the first mixing step followed by a gradual decline fig 7c sodium and chloride concentrations decreased approximately linearly the sis for the dcp surface indicated close to equilibrium conditions fig 7c 3 5 modelling of the anoxic batch experiment the geochemical mixing and reaction model for the anoxic batch experiment closely replicated the experimental data fig 7 most notably the modelling results replicate the observed successive increases in fluoride and phosphate concentrations in response to the sequentially decreased ionic strength to obtain a good agreement between the simulated and observed fluoride and phosphate concentrations it was important that the simulated ph closely matched the observed ph the ph was well matched when a proton exchange reaction was included in the model which agrees well with the previous study of seibert et al 2016 who suggested that proton buffering was the main buffering mechanism at the study site the best match between simulations and observations was obtained when a cation exchange capacity of 75 mmol l was used including exchange sites in the simulations was also essential to replicate the observed calcium concentrations fig 7c 4 discussion 4 1 conceptual model for fluoride and phosphate release during mar overall the results of the si calculations for the ngw the anoxic batch experiment and geochemical modelling of the experiment jointly indicate that cfa with a dcp surface is the most likely fluoride and phosphate bearing mineral in the studied aquifer while cfa is the most likely source of phosphate and fluoride the molar ratio of dissolved phosphate to fluoride that was observed during the field injection experiment 0 82 0 22 n 20 and also in the anoxic batch experiment 0 59 0 12 n 2 were inconsistent with a simple stoichiometric dissolution of cfa stoichiometric dissolution would have led to a higher phosphate to fluoride ratio i e 2 1 for the estimated cfa composition we therefore hypothesise that incongruous dissolution of cfa occurred initiated by a proton attack that released calcium and fluoride and therefore resulted in a ca f depleted layer on the cfa surface that has a dcp composition similar to the mechanism proposed by chaïrat et al 2007b the observed ph during the period of fluoride and phosphate release range between 6 6 and 7 7 figs 4 5 and 7 is always below ph 8 4 the point of zero charge of cfa from the literature perrone et al 2002 and consistent with proton attack being the main dissolution mechanism for the estimated cfa composition the initial rapid proton exchange reaction that forms a depleted layer that has dcp composition can be described as 1 ca 9 75 na 0 25 po 4 5 37 co 3 f 0 55 f 1 82 oh 0 18 5 37 h nh 2 o ca 5 37 h 5 37 po 5 37 nh 2 o 4 38 ca 2 0 25 na 0 55 co 3 2 2 37 f 0 180 h in conjunction with the rapid exchange reaction dissolved ca and phosphate concentrations are also affected by equilibrium with the dcp surface chaïrat et al 2007b guidry and mackenzie 2003 2 ca 5 37 h 5 37 po 4 5 37 nh 2 o 5 37 ca 2 5 37 hpo 4 2 nh 2 o contact between cfa rich sediments and low ionic strength water results in the dissolution of cfa and subsequently the release of calcium fluoride and phosphate as well as bicarbonate fluoride and phosphate are not released according to the stoichiometric ratio because phosphate is also involved in the equilibrium reactions with the depleted dcp surface that controls the apparent solubility of cfa chaïrat et al 2007a zhu et al 2009 the recession of fluoride and phosphate release coincided with an increase in the groundwater calcium concentrations which appears to have prevented any further dissolution of cfa fig 5j k low concentrations of calcium observed during the period of elevated fluoride and phosphate concentration most likely resulted from a number of mechanisms including i mostly cation exchange reactions resulting from the compositional change induced by the injectate and ii although to a lesser degree the formation of the dcp surface and sorption to gain further mechanistic insights into the reactive processes various calcium and sodium ratios are plotted for by13 fig 8 the initial na ca ratio was 23 10 1 05 n 15 at equilibrium under ngw conditions fig 8c after breakthrough of the dei the na ca ratio initially increased to 100 these values apart from an initial single anomalously high value were however lower than the ratio in the dei which was 180 table 1 the na ca ratio then decreased with the receding fluoride and phosphate pulses before attaining a new lower equilibrium value of 17 0 0 78 n 8 under the then prevailing lower ionic strength conditions fig 8a c the general trend of post breakthrough decreasing na ca ratios is consistent with a net sodium exchange for calcium on the exchange sites the exchangeable sodium ratio esr na ca mg 0 5 where square brackets represent activities appelo and postma 2005 shows stable values under ngw conditions 8 65 0 33 n 15 fig 8d esr values decreased during the period of elevated fluoride and phosphate concentrations before stabilising at a new equilibrium value 1 79 0 04 n 8 after fluoride and phosphate concentrations have receded fig 8a d the trend of decreasing esr is consistent with a net increase of divalent calcium and magnesium on the exchange sites during the shift to low ionic strength conditions this general behaviour is replicated by the geochemical model that relied on two key processes ion exchange and dissolution of cfa due to the poor mineral buffering capacity and the low reactivity of the sediments the overall hydrochemical evolution including ph was strongly affected by ion exchange the prevailing ph then influenced the rate of cfa dissolution while the prevailing ca concentration controlled the dissolved phosphate concentrations 4 2 anticipated long term behaviour during the investigated field experiment the elevated fluoride and phosphate concentrations showed to be temporary and fluoride did not exceed the who drinking water guideline value of 1 5 mg l 79 µm fig 4 with a continued injection the pulses of elevated fluoride and phosphate will migrate further into the aquifer along the edge of the radially growing injection plume of deionised wastewater i e the locations where low calcium concentrations persist in the absence of any attenuation reaction the fluoride and phosphate pulses at the injectate plume front would be expected to grow with continued injection however increased mixing and dispersion as well as adsorption onto kaolinite cochiara and phillips 2008 edzwald et al 1976 and iron and aluminium oxides goldberg and sposito 1984 are likely to attenuate fluoride and phosphate concentrations 5 conclusions this study investigated the processes controlling the fate of fluoride and phosphate during groundwater replenishment of a cretaceous siliciclastic deep aquifer with recycled highly treated wastewater trace cfa was found to be the most likely source of the temporarily elevated fluoride and phosphate concentrations during the field injection experiment complementary anoxic batch experiments with powdered cfa rich nodules sourced from the target aquifer reproduced the field observed fluoride and phosphate behaviour when high ionic strength water was successively displaced by low ionic strength water the identified conceptual model for phosphate and fluoride release that was derived from the field and laboratory investigations involves the following steps dei successively displaces ngw near the injection well during breakthrough of the injectate a strong decrease in calcium concentrations that resulted from the combination of groundwater compositional change and cation exchange favoured the transient release of fluoride and phosphate from cfa phosphate concentrations remained controlled by equilibrium with a depleted layer of dicalcium phosphate composition at the cfa water interface a rebound of groundwater ca concentrations from exchange sites prevented the further dissolution of cfa which resulted in a steady decline of fluoride and phosphate concentrations while groundwater fluoride and phosphate concentrations receded at all locations that were monitored during the injection experiment in a full scale replenishment scheme the pulses of elevated fluoride and phosphate concentrations may keep growing radially with continued injection co located with the injection plume front however the release will be ultimately balanced by adsorption onto sediment surfaces such as the positive edges of kaolinite and amorphous iron and aluminium oxides chemically and or biologically derived cfa and fap are ubiquitous in aquifers settings worldwide especially in marine and mesozoic sediments during mar with low ionic strength water in such settings the potential for the release of fluoride and phosphate needs to be carefully considered the mechanism of fluoride and phosphate release due to incongruous dissolution of cfa where disequilibrium caused by calcium removal triggers anomalously high fluoride and phosphate concentrations may also be relevant in many sedimentary aquifers containing cfa or fap furthermore in the absence of other sources dissolution of primary rock forming fap mediated by low calcium concentration may also explain high fluoride concentrations 1 mg l in

7258,managed aquifer recharge mar is increasingly used as a water management tool to enhance water availability and to improve water quality until now however the risk of fluoride release during mar with low ionic strength injectate has not been recognised or examined in this study we analyse and report the mobilisation of fluoride up to 58 µm and filterable reactive phosphorus frp up to 55 µm during a field groundwater replenishment experiment in which highly treated deionised wastewater average tds 33 mg l was injected into a siliciclastic cretaceous aquifer in the field experiment maximum concentrations which coincided with a rise in ph exceeded background groundwater concentrations by an average factor of 3 6 for fluoride and 24 for frp the combined results from the field experiment a detailed mineralogical characterisation and geochemical modelling suggested carbonate rich fluorapatite cfa ca10 po4 5 co3 f f2 to be the most likely source of fluoride and phosphate release an anoxic batch experiment with powdered cfa rich nodules sourced from the target aquifer and aqueous solutions of successively decreasing ionic strength closely replicated the field observed fluoride and phosphate behaviour based on the laboratory experiment and geochemical modelling we hypothesise that the release of fluoride and phosphate results from the incongruent dissolution of cfa and the simultaneous formation of a depleted layer that has hydrated di basic calcium phosphate cahpo4 nh2o composition at the cfa water interface disequilibrium caused by calcium removal following breakthrough of the deionised injectate triggered the release of fluoride and phosphate given the increasing use of highly treated deionised water for mar and the ubiquitous presence of cfa and fluorapatite ca10 po4 6f2 in aquifer settings worldwide the risk of fluoride and phosphate release needs to be considered in the mar design process keywords managed aquifer recharge fluoride phosphate carbonate rich fluorapatite deionised wastewater 1 introduction globally but especially in arid and semiarid regions managed aquifer recharge mar is an increasingly used water management tool it

et al 2010 rafique et al 2015 raju 2017 cfa also referred to as francolite in economic deposits predominantly forms in marine environments under reducing conditions especially where there is upwelling ruttenberg 2003 kholodov 2014 it is however also known to form in freshwater lacustrine environments föllmi 1996 kholodov 2014 bone hydroxyapatite ca10 po4 6 oh 2 as well as muscle tissue can re mineralise as cfa keenan 2016 recent studies have shown that during the mesozoic marine and land vertebrates incorporated extensive amounts of fap into tooth material enameloid and dentin whereas at present only the enameloid in cartilaginous fish e g sharks is fap while all other vertebrate groups have hydroxyapatite tooth material lübke et al 2015 therefore the age and depositional history of the sedimentary aquifers may influence the amount of biogenic fluoride bearing phosphate minerals that are present and whether fluoride may be mobilised during mar cfa is a variety of fap with a stable defect consisting of a planar carbonate group and fluoride ion pairing that replaces up to approximately 1 4 phosphate tetrahedra per unit cell within the apatite structure hexagonal p63 m space group dorozhkin 2015 hughes and rakovan 2002 mcclellan 1980 yi et al 2013 calcium atoms in the fap structure exist in two different coordinations 9 fold and 7 fold with oxygen atoms from the phosphate tetrahedral and fluoride ions occurring in structural channels chaïrat et al 2007b dorozhkin 2012 carbonate ions in cfa can also occur in the main structural channels as well as pair with fluoride in phosphate site yi et al 2013 the apatite structure in general allows a multitude of substitutions hughes and rakovan 2002 jarvis et al 1994 pan and fleet 2002 the substitutions in cfa especially the main carbonate defect limit the size to which cfa crystals can grow usually to 0 3 2 μm in size mcclellan and lehr 1969 the dissolution mechanism of calcium apatite is complex and is still not fully understood see for example the reviews by dorozhkin 2002 and dorozhkin 2012 cfa and fap are sparingly soluble under circumneutral ph conditions and have solubility products that vary with ph chaïrat et al 2007a jahnke 1984 experimental studies have demonstrated that dissolution of cfa and fap in low ionic strength water and at circumneutral phs is initially incongruent whereby the ratios of fluoride to phosphate and calcium to phosphate exceed the stoichiometric ratios existing in the mineral bengtsson et al 2009 chaïrat et al 2007b guidry and mackenzie 2003 zhu et al 2009 based on experiments using fap zhu et al 2009 found that the preferential release of phosphate and fluoride accompanied by a rapid rise in solution ph dissolution of fap has been proposed to start as a rapid proton exchange reaction whereby h is adsorbed onto the apatite surface triggering the combined released of fluoride and weakly coordinated calcium this results in the formation of a leached layer of dicalcium phosphate dcp cahpo4 nh2o composition at the fap surface chaïrat et al 2007a zhu et al 2009 attributed the observed early preferential release of phosphate to dissolution of crystal edges and corners jahnke 1984 also found that during the initial dissolution of synthetic cfa carbonate ions were also likely to be released preferentially after the initial incongruent stage the dissolution of cfa and fap gradually becomes stoichiometric chaïrat et al 2007b guidry and mackenzie 2003 the stoichiometric dissolution occurs when equilibrium is reached where the rate of release of weakly coordinated calcium internally from the bulk mineral as h ions traverse the leached surface layer equals the rate of release of more strongly coordinated calcium at the surface layer solution boundary chaïrat et al 2007b the rate of stoichiometric dissolution of cfa and fap is relatively slow near and above ph 7 and increases with decreasing ph under acidic conditions chaïrat et al 2007b guidry and mackenzie 2003 aquifers in equilibrium with fluoride bearing phosphate minerals do not necessarily contain high concentrations of fluoride in groundwater for example travi 1993 noted that groundwater in contact with cfa deposits in north west tunisia contained low fluoride concentrations most likely due to the high dissolved calcium concentrations that persist as a result of the presence of gypsum caso4 2h2o in the aquifer however fluoride mobilisation may occur where dissolved calcium concentrations are low for example travi 1993 noted elevated fluoride concentrations in cfa containing aquifers in senegal with low calcium concentrations high fluoride concentrations have also been reported for aquifers containing cfa and trace phosphate minerals where calcium has been removed from groundwater as a result of calcite precipitation abu jabal et al 2014 kumar et al 2018 rafique et al 2015 or cation exchange edmunds and smedley 2013 these naturally occurring water rock interactions illustrate the potential for fluoride mobilisation to occur during mar in cases where the injectate contains lower concentrations of calcium than the native groundwater ngw to our knowledge the risk of fluoride and phosphate release from aquifers during mar with low ionic strength water has neither been recognised nor examined in this study we report for the first time fluoride and phosphate release during a large scale closely monitored field experiment in which deionised wastewater was injected into a cretaceous siliciclastic aquifer with low background fluoride concentration combining field observations with supporting laboratory experiments and geochemical modelling we identify the trace cfa phases in this aquifer and reveal the mechanisms that control fluoride release 2 material and methods 2 1 site characteristics and field injection experiment a comprehensive field scale injection experiment was conducted between november 2010 and september 2014 to investigate the feasibility of recharging highly treated wastewater into the cretaceous siliciclastic leederville aquifer of the perth basin western australia fig 1 seibert et al 2014 2016 the highly treated wastewater was injected through a single injection well screened between 123 7 and 224 4 m below ground level bgl fig 2 the targeted injection interval comprised the wanneroo member of the leederville formation which is locally confined above by the silty sands silts and clays of the pinjar member and below by both the mariginiup member and the south perth shale descourvieres et al

composed mostly of quartz 64 and k feldspars 27 while silt and clay beds contain kaolinite 24 54 k feldspar 20 29 and quartz 18 40 descourvieres et al 2011 trace minerals which have been detected include pyrite lignite siderite muscovite and biotite pre treatment of the wastewater involved ultra filtration reverse osmosis and ultra violet disinfection resulting in oxic deionised wastewater higginson and martin 2012 over the trial period a total of 3 90 106 m3 of this pre treated wastewater was injected at an average injection rate of 2800 m3 d the spreading of the injectant was monitored through an extensive groundwater sampling program through 20 monitoring wells and time lapse temperature logging the 20 monitoring wells were arranged in 5 multilevel well clusters at radial distances of 20 60 120 180 and 240 m from the injection well figs 1 and 2 groundwater quality evolution in all 20 monitoring wells was monitored throughout the trial for a broad range of water quality indicators including ph redox potential dissolved oxygen alkalinity major ions nutrients heavy metals metalloids and organic substances all water quality samples were stored on ice immediately following collection and submitted for analysis the same day ngw conditions were established at all monitoring wells through repeated groundwater quality sampling commencing approximately 2 years prior to the start of injection additionally injectant samples were taken monthly from the post treatment reservoir tank shortly before injection and analysed in a similar fashion detailed descriptions of the sampling and analytical procedures are given in water corporation 2009 time lapse temperature and induction logging of the monitoring wells and subsequent solute and heat transport modelling demonstrated that flow and transport occurred preferentially in the interlayered sand beds seibert et al 2014 previous column experiments and reactive transport modelling identified pyrite oxidation as a key reaction that occurred when the injectant displaced the highly reducing ngw particularly in the vicinity of the injection well descourvieres et al 2010a b seibert et al 2016 acidity generated from pyrite oxidation was found to be buffered by a combination of proton exchange on cation exchange sites and to a lesser extent the dissolution of trace carbonate minerals ankerite and siderite as well as dissolution of glauconite and chlorite seibert et al 2016 fluoride and phosphate pulses were observed during breakthrough of the injected pre treated wastewater 2 2 characterisation of carbonate fluorapatite contained in the leederville formation sediments to identify potential sources of fluoride and phosphate compositional and mineralogical analyses were conducted on the leederville formation sediments from core material collected from a bore 525 m to the north of the injection well several apatite rich nodules were recovered the interval in which the nodules were found was 112 2 m bgl within fine grained leederville formation sediments polished carbon coated sections of these nodules were analysed using a jeol jsm 7001f emission scanning electron microscope sem with a bruker quantax 400 energy dispersive spectroscopy elemental mapping system high resolution images of the nodule sections were obtained using a tescan vega3 and fei various sem compositional analyses of individual micron sized grains within a selected nodule were undertaken using a jeol jxa 8500f electron microprobe equipped with five wavelength dispersive spectrometers and two energy dispersive spectrometers the analyses were performed on surfaces polished to a 1 µm diamond finish the electron probe micro analyser was operated at an accelerating voltage of 10 kv beam current of 5 na and the beam was defocused to 2 µm the relatively low voltage of 10 kv was chosen to reduce the interaction volume as the cfa was fine grained the suite of elements analysed included ca p f al cl s fe na and si to minimise damage to the sample and mitigate migration of light elements under the electron beam counting times were set to 4 s for ca and p 6 s for f and 10 s for the other elements standards used were fap ca 5 po4 3 f berlinite alpo4 sylvite kcl pyrite fes 2 hematite fe 2o3 albite naalsi3o8 and wollastonite casio3 all elements analysed were corrected for atomic number absorption and fluorescence using the citzaf phi rho z correction procedure armstrong 1995 with oxygen calculated by stoichiometry and carbon calculated by difference additionally the nodules were characterised using both fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and x ray diffraction xrd ftir spectra were collected using a vertex 70 fourier transform infrared spectrometer and hyperion 3000 microscope bruker the microscope was operated in attenuated total reflectance mode using a liquid nitrogen cooled mercury cadmium telluride detector measurements were made with a 20 objective and an area of 30 30 µm was sampled spectra were collected between 4000 and 600 cm 1 using 64 scans a resolution of 2 cm 1 and air was used as the background the ftir peak assignments are based on various references antonakos et al 2007 yi et al 2013 zhu et al 2009 xrd spectra of the nodules were collected using a panalytical x pert pro xrd system see supporting information for details the diffraction patterns were matched against the icdd pdf database using the panalytical x pert highscore plus software 2 3 anoxic batch experiment sampling and analyses to investigate whether fluoride and phosphate in the groundwater at the field site were released specifically from cfa two sets of batch experiments were performed in duplication under anoxic condition that approximately mimicked the geochemical condition during the field injection trial in the experiment artificial groundwater in equilibrium with cfa was gradually replaced with artificial deionised injectate dei water and the solutions were sampled and monitored for compositional changes artificial stock solutions representative of the ngw and the dei were prepared using analytical grade reagents and ultrapure water the compositions of the ngw and dei stock solutions were based on the groundwater composition at the base of the injection interval and the average pre treated wastewater composition respectively table 1 higginson and martin 2012 the ngw solution consisted of 426 mg l na 73 mg l hco3 47 mg l so4 2 and 580 mg l cl ionic strength i 17 35 mm while the dei solution consisted of 12 1 mg l na 17 6 mg l hco3 and 8 7 mg l cl i 0 53 mm five solution mixtures were then made by mixing the stock solutions by volume as 100 ngw 75 ngw 25 dei 50 ngw 50 dei 25 ngw 75 dei and 100 dei all solutions were de oxygenated by purging with nitrogen gas n2 before use a large cfa rich nodule was collected from the same interval from which the nodule used for the microprobe compositional analysis was sourced this nodule was ground into a fine powder using an agate mortar a portion of the powder was analysed for elemental composition by x ray fluorescence xrf with a panalytical axios advanced wavelength dispersive system see supporting information for details the remainder of the powder was used for the batch experiments two cfa powder samples sample 1 weighing 0 989 g and sample 2 weighing 0 962 g were placed in two 15 ml polypropylene centrifuge vials to each of which 10 ml of the 100 ngw solution was added the ph was measured using a tps 90fl mv multi parameter instrument with an intermediate junction ph electrode ij 44c ionode to remove the acidity generated by pyrite oxidation during exposure of the nodule to air the ph was adjusted from around ph 4 using naoh to a ph similar to the ngw vial 1 ph 7 09 and vial 2 ph 7 23 the ph adjusted solid solution mixtures were purged with n2 for 30 min the vials were centrifuged at 3316g for 10 min before the supernatant was decanted and replaced with 10 ml of de oxygenated 100 ngw solution the head space in the vials were replaced with n2 capped and transferred to an anoxic chamber coy laboratory products where the solid solution mixtures were equilibrated for 124 days during the 124 day equilibration period the mixtures were periodically shaken by hand after 124 days the ph of the solid solution mixtures was measured in the anoxic chamber the sealed vials were removed from the chamber centrifuged for 10 min at 3316g and then transferred back to the chamber the supernatant was decanted and filtered to 0 45 µm cellulose acetate membrane whatman puradisc fp 30 and the solids were then treated with 10 ml of de oxygenated 75 ngw 25 dei solution the capped vials were removed from the chamber and placed on an end over end mixer for 60 min before being centrifuged at 3316g for 10 min the vials were then returned to the chamber where the ph was measured and the supernatant was decanted and filtered 0 45 µm this procedure was repeated three times for the remaining mixtures during which the ngw fraction was succesively reduced the solution samples were analysed for ca2 mg2 na k cl so4 2 f and po4 3 concentrations using a dionex ics 3000 ion chromatography system cations were analysed using ionpac cs16 analytical and guard columns with an eluent of 30 mm methanesulfonic acid at a flow rate of 1 2 ml min anions were analysed using ionpac as18 analytical and guard columns in gradient mode with eluent concentrations increasing from 12 to 45 mm potassium hydroxide at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min the f and po4 3 concentrations were determined using the method of standard additions ultrapure water milli q was used to prepare standards and dilute samples instrument drift was corrected for by the addition of an internal standard lithium fluoride 20 mg l for determination of ions except for f and po4 3 bicarbonate hco3 was measured separately by titration using a hanna hi 3811 total alkalinity kit the ngw dei solution mixtures were used in these analyses as blanks 2 4 geochemical modelling of pre injection native groundwater and anoxic batch experiment saturation indices sis for a suite of potentially labile fluoride and phosphate bearing phases were calculated with phreeqc parkhurst 2015 under pre injection native conditions the standard phreeqc dat database was modified to include additional fluoride and phosphate minerals and calcium phosphate salts as well as revised equilibrium constants from the literature sis were calculated at 25 c consistent with the ngw temperature of 25 3 0 8 c n 88 in total 88 groundwater compositions from 20 monitoring wells were analysed geochemical modelling of the anoxic batch experiment was undertaken with phreeqc to test the proposed conceptual model of the processes controlling fluoride and phosphate release with decreasing ionic strength in the reaction network cfa dissolution was modelled as an exchange reaction in which cfa dissolution and the formation of hydrated di basic calcium phosphate dcp cahpo4 nh2o at the water mineral interface occur simultaneously in response to proton attack i e changes in ph the anoxic batch experiment was modelled as a sequence of mixing events and the corresponding adjustments of the water sediment equilibria the initial exchanger composition prior to the mixing dilution events was determined through equilibration with the solution composition that was determined after the initial 124 day equilibration period with 100 ngw decanting and replacing the solution with the 75 ngw 25 dei mixture was modelled by mixing the ngw dei solutions 95 of the total volume with the residual porewater 5 of the total volume while maintaining equilibrium with the exchange sites and selected minerals the above step was repeated for 50 ngw 50 dei 25 ngw 75 dei and 100 dei 3 results 3 1 pre injection native groundwater the ngw in the leederville aquifer consisted of na cl to na cl hco3 type water with a tds that increased with depth ranging from 400 to 1100 mg l and low fluoride and phosphorus concentrations of both 0 3 mg l table 1 the sis calculated for the pre injection native conditions indicated that the groundwater was under saturated with respect to all fluoride and phosphate bearing mineral phases fig 3 among the fluoride and phosphate bearing minerals investigated the surface layer that has a dcp composition at the fap water interface hereinafter referred to as dcp surface chaïrat et al 2007a was the phase that was closest to equilibrium with the ngw median si 1 07 range 1 42 to 0 18 the groundwater showed to be more under saturated with respect to the fap bulk mineral median si 1 69 range 4 16 to 2 54 than with respect to the dcp surface this may be indicative of the presence of fap or cfa at the study site the si for cfa was calculated using the solubility product for cfa with a composition of one carbonate ion per unit cell content jahnke 1984 however jahnke 1984 showed that the solubility product varies significantly with carbonate content since the composition of cfa was not known a priori it was not possible to determine how close the bulk mineral of cfa is to equilibrium a number of groundwater samples show sis near zero for vivianite fe3 po4 2 8h2o median si 2 60 range 4 15 to 0 40 suggesting that this iron phosphate mineral might locally prevail within the aquifer fluorite the presence of which is a common cause of elevated fluoride concentration in groundwater was always under saturated median si 3 26 range 4 32 to 2 70 and is presumably absent the median si for the carbonate mineral siderite feco3 was 0 09 range 0 59 to 0 39 and therefore close to saturation this is consistent with its previous detection in fine grained leederville formation sediments descourvieres et al 2011 a number of other carbonate minerals were under saturated calcite median si 1 58 dolomite median si 2 88 ankerite median si 3 12 along with gypsum median si 3 01 as discussed in more detail in seibert et al 2016 3 2 fluoride and phosphate breakthrough behaviour during the field experiment during the field injection experiment highly treated wastewater was injected the pre treatment resulted in deionised water with low dissolved solids concentration tds of 33 2 10 9 mg l and relatively high dissolved oxygen concentration of 8 3 0 5 mg l table 1 higginson and martin 2012 arrival times of the injectate as indicated by the decrease in the concentration of the conservative solute chloride increased with distance from the injection well and varied with depth figs 4 and 5 at 20 m from the injection well the fastest complete breakthrough of chloride occurred after 21 days at monitoring well by11 while at 240 m the fastest complete breakthrough occurred after 1155 days at monitoring well by17 pulses of increased fluoride and phosphate concentration were observed upon breakthrough of the injectate as indicated by cl at most monitoring locations fig 4 generally increased fluoride concentrations occurred slightly before increased phosphate concentrations observed peak concentrations of fluoride ranged from 12 μm to 58 μm exceeding background concentrations by a factor of 3 6 1 2 n 20 observed peak concentrations of phosphate measured as filterable reactive phosphorus frp ranged from 3 9 μm to 55 μm exceeding background concentrations by a factor of 24 1 16 2 n 20 concentrations of phosphate were consistently lower than fluoride concentration with the ratio of phosphate to fluoride concentrations being 0 82 0 22 n 20 with increasing distance from the injection well the observed pulses of fluoride and phosphate generally became broader while also increasing in amplitude figs 4 and 5 a few selected monitoring bores located at 20 m from the injection well e g by11 by08 and by06 showed a small sustained increase in fluoride while the phosphate pulse declined rapidly fig 4 with continued injection fluoride and phosphate decreased to background concentrations with the phosphate concentrations declining faster than the fluoride concentrations a rise in ph from around 0 2 to 1 0 ph units also occurred upon breakthrough of the dei figs 4 and 5 the rise in ph in proximal bores i e where breakthrough was fast was generally followed by a slow decrease in ph more distal bores on the other hand showed a sustained elevated ph post breakthrough fig 4 during the period when elevated fluoride 0 020 0 058 mm occurred the ph ranged from 6 6 to 7 7 for all monitoring bores 7 12 0 21 n 240 during the period when elevated fluoride and phosphate concentrations occurred dissolved calcium concentrations were low or decreasing while sodium concentrations increased fig 5j k therefore na ca ratios were elevated relative to the native ratios that prevailed prior to injection synchronous with the decrease in fluoride and phosphate concentrations the na ca ratios declined to approximately stable values that however were lower than the native ratios fig 5g i an increase in bicarbonate concentrations relative to chloride also occurred upon the breakthrough of the dei during the field experiment fig 5d f the sis for dcp surface showed close to equilibrium conditions throughout the experiment fig 5m o the sis for fap on the other hand indicate a temporary oversaturation while fluoride and phosphate concentrations were elevated the sis for fap and dcp surface decreased post breakthrough while fluoride and phosphate concentrations declined fig 5m 5n fap precipitation during the period of fap oversaturation was presumably insignificant due to slow kinetics and nucleation considerations cappellen and berner 1991 the sis for many other fluoride and phosphate bearing minerals calcium phosphate salts and carbonate minerals suggested under saturation except for some isolated values for vivianite β tricalcium phosphate β tcp and hydroxyapatite during the occurrence of phosphate peak concentrations and for gypsum during the initial stages of breakthrough of the dei fig s3 3 3 habit and composition of the apatite rich nodules descourvieres et al 2011 showed that total phosphorus concentration in the aquifer sediments over the injection interval ranged between 0 01 and 0 29 wt p2o5 0 047 0 049 wt n 40 this suggested that phosphate minerals are only present in trace amounts and that consequently it would be difficult to find individual mineral grains from sediment samples see pe piper and dolansky 2005 however several dark micaceous fine grained 0 3 3 cm apatite rich nodules were recovered within fine grained leederville formation sediments the sem images showed that apatite occurs as aggregates of micron sized crystallites that form an infilling cement between grains of other minerals such as quartz k feldspar and kaolinite fig 6 this is consistent with the habit and crystal size of cfa mcclellan and lehr 1969 pyrite and carbon clasts commonly occur in association with the apatite cement the assemblage of minerals associated with cfa is suggestive of a biogenic origin for cfa from the remineralisation of bone and tissue in an anoxic environment kholodov 2014 high concentrations of barium 443 mg kg and strontium 345 mg kg found in the cfa nodule table s1 which substitute for calcium in the apatite structure pan and fleet 2002 and are known to concentrate in bones trueman and tuross 2002 also suggest a biogenic origin compositional analysis of selected apatite crystallites using electron microprobe show a compositional variation between crystallites table 2 the co3 was initially calculated based on the formula ca fe al na 10 po 4 6 x co 3 f x f oh 2 with x depending on the amount of phosphate the oh was then calculated to balance f all elements were iteratively matrix corrected with the pap matrix correction algorithm implemented in strata pouchou 1993 a representative unit cell formula for cfa from the leederville formation sediments based on the francolite model of mcclellan 1980 was found to be ca 9 75 na 0 25 po 4 5 37 co 3 f 0 55 f 1 82 oh 0 18 it was assumed that trace s fe al and si present was due to trace pyrite and kaolinite present within the 2 µm microprobe beam size because the ratios of these elements were consistent with these minerals the determined composition has a relatively low carbonate content but is within the range of cfa compositions typically reported from around the world guidry and mackenzie 2003 infrared spectra collected on a selected cfa rich nodule revealed a number of intense ir absorption bands at 3333 1609 1460 1400 and 1100 950 cm 1 fig s1 these four bands are characteristic of hydroxyl oh stretching vibration water oh bending vibration carbonate co3 2 stretching vibration and phosphate po4 3 stretching vibration species respectively the oh peak at 3333 cm 1 was relatively broad and is typical of a hydroxyl group that has formed hydrogen bonds h bonds some weak bands were observed in the ir spectra between 3700 and 3600 cm 1 which can be attributed to hydroxyl groups that are not involved in h bonds or surface oh groups and may also arise from a minor amount of kaolinite that was present compared to previous ftir studies on fluorapatite antonakos et al 2007 yi et al 2013 the oh bending vibration at 1609 cm 1 was much more intense suggesting that the cfa form our study site has a higher degree of hydration 3 4 anoxic batch experiment the phosphorus content of the powdered nodule used in the anoxic batch experiment was found to be 8 73 wt p2o5 as determined by xrf if assuming that all the phosphorus is present as cfa then 24 4 by weight of the nodule is cfa other minerals present in the cfa rich nodule include quartz k feldspar pyrite kaolin chlorite and gypsum as identified by xrd fig s2 the cfa rich powder was equilibrated with the ngw solution for 124 days after which the dissolved concentrations of fluoride and phosphate were below the detection limits i e below 3 µm in the case of fluoride and 2 µm in the case of phosphate table 3 and fig 7 the dissolved calcium concentrations however were very high with the average concentration being 1 4 mm given that no calcium was present in the artificial ngw solution the elevated calcium concentrations may have been caused by the presence of secondary gypsum caso4 2h2o in the nodule and by cation exchange the high calcium concentrations suppressed cfa dissolution and resulted in very low fluoride and phosphate concentrations in the ngw solution however fluoride and subsequently phosphate were released when the cfa rich powder was brought in contact with successively increasing proportions of dei fig 7a when the 75 ngw 25 dei mixture was added dissolved fluoride concentration increased to 7 µm concentrations increased further to 20 5 µm in the 50 ngw 50 dei mixture and reached a maximum of 45 µm in the 100 dei solution in contrast dissolved phosphate concentrations remained low until contact with the 100 dei solution where it reached 27 µm the ph increased with each successive mixture from ph 5 8 after the initial 124 day equilibration period to ph 7 4 in the 100 dei mixture with the latter being similar to the ph observed during the field trial fig 7b bicarbonate concentrations also rose during the later stages of the anoxic batch experiment fig 7b calcium concentrations decreased rapidly after the first mixing step followed by a gradual decline fig 7c sodium and chloride concentrations decreased approximately linearly the sis for the dcp surface indicated close to equilibrium conditions fig 7c 3 5 modelling of the anoxic batch experiment the geochemical mixing and reaction model for the anoxic batch experiment closely replicated the experimental data fig 7 most notably the modelling results replicate the observed successive increases in fluoride and phosphate concentrations in response to the sequentially decreased ionic strength to obtain a good agreement between the simulated and observed fluoride and phosphate concentrations it was important that the simulated ph closely matched the observed ph the ph was well matched when a proton exchange reaction was included in the model which agrees well with the previous study of seibert et al 2016 who suggested that proton buffering was the main buffering mechanism at the study site the best match between simulations and observations was obtained when a cation exchange capacity of 75 mmol l was used including exchange sites in the simulations was also essential to replicate the observed calcium concentrations fig 7c 4 discussion 4 1 conceptual model for fluoride and phosphate release during mar overall the results of the si calculations for the ngw the anoxic batch experiment and geochemical modelling of the experiment jointly indicate that cfa with a dcp surface is the most likely fluoride and phosphate bearing mineral in the studied aquifer while cfa is the most likely source of phosphate and fluoride the molar ratio of dissolved phosphate to fluoride that was observed during the field injection experiment 0 82 0 22 n 20 and also in the anoxic batch experiment 0 59 0 12 n 2 were inconsistent with a simple stoichiometric dissolution of cfa stoichiometric dissolution would have led to a higher phosphate to fluoride ratio i e 2 1 for the estimated cfa composition we therefore hypothesise that incongruous dissolution of cfa occurred initiated by a proton attack that released calcium and fluoride and therefore resulted in a ca f depleted layer on the cfa surface that has a dcp composition similar to the mechanism proposed by chaïrat et al 2007b the observed ph during the period of fluoride and phosphate release range between 6 6 and 7 7 figs 4 5 and 7 is always below ph 8 4 the point of zero charge of cfa from the literature perrone et al 2002 and consistent with proton attack being the main dissolution mechanism for the estimated cfa composition the initial rapid proton exchange reaction that forms a depleted layer that has dcp composition can be described as 1 ca 9 75 na 0 25 po 4 5 37 co 3 f 0 55 f 1 82 oh 0 18 5 37 h nh 2 o ca 5 37 h 5 37 po 5 37 nh 2 o 4 38 ca 2 0 25 na 0 55 co 3 2 2 37 f 0 180 h in conjunction with the rapid exchange reaction dissolved ca and phosphate concentrations are also affected by equilibrium with the dcp surface chaïrat et al 2007b guidry and mackenzie 2003 2 ca 5 37 h 5 37 po 4 5 37 nh 2 o 5 37 ca 2 5 37 hpo 4 2 nh 2 o contact between cfa rich sediments and low ionic strength water results in the dissolution of cfa and subsequently the release of calcium fluoride and phosphate as well as bicarbonate fluoride and phosphate are not released according to the stoichiometric ratio because phosphate is also involved in the equilibrium reactions with the depleted dcp surface that controls the apparent solubility of cfa chaïrat et al 2007a zhu et al 2009 the recession of fluoride and phosphate release coincided with an increase in the groundwater calcium concentrations which appears to have prevented any further dissolution of cfa fig 5j k low concentrations of calcium observed during the period of elevated fluoride and phosphate concentration most likely resulted from a number of mechanisms including i mostly cation exchange reactions resulting from the compositional change induced by the injectate and ii although to a lesser degree the formation of the dcp surface and sorption to gain further mechanistic insights into the reactive processes various calcium and sodium ratios are plotted for by13 fig 8 the initial na ca ratio was 23 10 1 05 n 15 at equilibrium under ngw conditions fig 8c after breakthrough of the dei the na ca ratio initially increased to 100 these values apart from an initial single anomalously high value were however lower than the ratio in the dei which was 180 table 1 the na ca ratio then decreased with the receding fluoride and phosphate pulses before attaining a new lower equilibrium value of 17 0 0 78 n 8 under the then prevailing lower ionic strength conditions fig 8a c the general trend of post breakthrough decreasing na ca ratios is consistent with a net sodium exchange for calcium on the exchange sites the exchangeable sodium ratio esr na ca mg 0 5 where square brackets represent activities appelo and postma 2005 shows stable values under ngw conditions 8 65 0 33 n 15 fig 8d esr values decreased during the period of elevated fluoride and phosphate concentrations before stabilising at a new equilibrium value 1 79 0 04 n 8 after fluoride and phosphate concentrations have receded fig 8a d the trend of decreasing esr is consistent with a net increase of divalent calcium and magnesium on the exchange sites during the shift to low ionic strength conditions this general behaviour is replicated by the geochemical model that relied on two key processes ion exchange and dissolution of cfa due to the poor mineral buffering capacity and the low reactivity of the sediments the overall hydrochemical evolution including ph was strongly affected by ion exchange the prevailing ph then influenced the rate of cfa dissolution while the prevailing ca concentration controlled the dissolved phosphate concentrations 4 2 anticipated long term behaviour during the investigated field experiment the elevated fluoride and phosphate concentrations showed to be temporary and fluoride did not exceed the who drinking water guideline value of 1 5 mg l 79 µm fig 4 with a continued injection the pulses of elevated fluoride and phosphate will migrate further into the aquifer along the edge of the radially growing injection plume of deionised wastewater i e the locations where low calcium concentrations persist in the absence of any attenuation reaction the fluoride and phosphate pulses at the injectate plume front would be expected to grow with continued injection however increased mixing and dispersion as well as adsorption onto kaolinite cochiara and phillips 2008 edzwald et al 1976 and iron and aluminium oxides goldberg and sposito 1984 are likely to attenuate fluoride and phosphate concentrations 5 conclusions this study investigated the processes controlling the fate of fluoride and phosphate during groundwater replenishment of a cretaceous siliciclastic deep aquifer with recycled highly treated wastewater trace cfa was found to be the most likely source of the temporarily elevated fluoride and phosphate concentrations during the field injection experiment complementary anoxic batch experiments with powdered cfa rich nodules sourced from the target aquifer reproduced the field observed fluoride and phosphate behaviour when high ionic strength water was successively displaced by low ionic strength water the identified conceptual model for phosphate and fluoride release that was derived from the field and laboratory investigations involves the following steps dei successively displaces ngw near the injection well during breakthrough of the injectate a strong decrease in calcium concentrations that resulted from the combination of groundwater compositional change and cation exchange favoured the transient release of fluoride and phosphate from cfa phosphate concentrations remained controlled by equilibrium with a depleted layer of dicalcium phosphate composition at the cfa water interface a rebound of groundwater ca concentrations from exchange sites prevented the further dissolution of cfa which resulted in a steady decline of fluoride and phosphate concentrations while groundwater fluoride and phosphate concentrations receded at all locations that were monitored during the injection experiment in a full scale replenishment scheme the pulses of elevated fluoride and phosphate concentrations may keep growing radially with continued injection co located with the injection plume front however the release will be ultimately balanced by adsorption onto sediment surfaces such as the positive edges of kaolinite and amorphous iron and aluminium oxides chemically and or biologically derived cfa and fap are ubiquitous in aquifers settings worldwide especially in marine and mesozoic sediments during mar with low ionic strength water in such settings the potential for the release of fluoride and phosphate needs to be carefully considered the mechanism of fluoride and phosphate release due to incongruous dissolution of cfa where disequilibrium caused by calcium removal triggers anomalously high fluoride and phosphate concentrations may also be relevant in many sedimentary aquifers containing cfa or fap furthermore in the absence of other sources dissolution of primary rock forming fap mediated by low calcium concentration may also explain high fluoride concentrations 1 mg l in

7259,research on water cooperation in the eastern nile basin has focused on expanding policy and diplomacy tools for a better allocation of transboundary water resources confined to the river regional cooperation on water and related sectors such as energy and land expands the bargaining and areas for mutual gain and thus enhances cooperation perspectives this paper looks at the contribution and the potential benefits of a regional cooperation approach to addressing the underlying challenges of water diplomacy such as complexity and distrust it also promotes the understanding of river basins as a resource basin of integrated and linked resource use issues not always related to the river flow the paper provides an analysis of priority issues for water energy food nexus in regional cooperation in the eastern nile basin this basin represents an illustrative case for regional cooperation and increased integration due to multiple comparative advantages inherent in the uneven endowments of water energy and arable land resources and to varying levels of economic and technological advancement among the three riparian countries egypt sudan and ethiopia the paper also analyzes institutional arrangements on a regional scale and elaborates on the inherent trade offs associated with them keywords regional water cooperation water diplomacy water energy food nexus transboundary water governance eastern nile basin 1 introduction cooperation among key riparian states egypt ethiopia and sudan in the eastern nile basin is now more critical than ever for resolving emerging conflicts around issues such as hydropower and providing resources for growing populations and economies such cooperation has become more complex in light of growing national and economic aspirations since the independence from colonial powers wolf and newton 2009 cascão 2008 nicol and cascao 2011 furthermore stresses such as climate change population growth and depleted and or degraded water resources caused by poor management are causing instabilities and water use conflicts as is the case with other transboundary basins in africa chikozho 2014 being the largest basin in africa the history of transboundary water management in the nile has involved various economic political social and environmental factors that have determined cooperation legacies paisley and henshaw 2013 despite various attempts the water conflict is as yet not resolved as nobody has managed to accommodate egypt s concerns about unfavourable outcomes of dams constructed upstream and ethiopia s recurrent uncertainties regarding recurrent droughts habteyes et al 2015 the conflict over river development and hydropower underpins the need for multifaceted approaches to enhance cooperation and context fit solutions that consider the overall environmental hydrological political economic and social circumstances of a specific basin the governance of transboundary basins has historically been state centric and confined to water related issues and to basin boundaries since there is no unique solution to bringing about immediate transboundary cooperation a multifaceted approach and experimentation with issues and actors is needed a focus on adaptive governance with public involvement and multiple stakeholder participation is necessary to overcome certain issues and failures akamani and wilson 2011 in the context of the nile basin institutional arrangements for water allocation should be complemented by other softer measures to build capacities promote technical cooperation favor political stability and stimulate participatory processes habteyes et al 2015 paisley and henshaw 2013 in this sense cooperation in the nile basin has evolved to incorporate more issues and softer approaches see part 4 1 recently the integrated management paradigm of the water energy food nexus wef nexus has provided an opportunity to expand the debate on transboundary basin cooperation to include new issues academic literature on the wef nexus has provided multiple useful tools for integrated analysis of natural resources including on a river basin scale al saidi and elagib 2017 major concerns in transboundary basins are sometimes not related to water availability and depending on the basin stakeholders might regard issues such as nutrients or sedimentation as more important lawford et al 2013 through a wef nexus perspective benefit sharing options can be extended to key sectors such as agriculture and energy thus providing additional mechanisms for conflict resolution and basin development jalivov et al 2015 in the blue nile basin for example linking operation policies of dams such as the grand ethiopian renaissance dam gerd to irrigation and energy demands downstream provides beneficial opportunities for co management and coordination tan et al 2017 a multi issue analysis of transboundary river basin issues can help improve transboundary cooperation and provide additional tools for water diplomacy keskinen et al 2016 and keskinen and varis 2016 have already showed in the case of large asian rivers how a water energy food perspective complements traditional water focused transboundary approaches and enriches the transboundary context with new tools approaches and actors in the eastern nile basin a wef nexus approach is not only relevant at the basin scale but is also viable on national and regional scales al saidi et al 2017 introduced the resource use profiles of the three countries and analyzed the sectors and the potentials for cooperation on a regional level as we begin to appreciate the merits of expanding the transboundary debate in the eastern nile basin there is a need to advance knowledge on benefit sharing and cooperation options beyond water issues and the basin boundaries a regional and cross sectoral approach can move cooperation beyond the binary thinking in terms cooperation conflict or nationalism solidarity and the current debate on mutual benefits from flow modification such as the construction of the gerd e g habteyes et al 2015 whittington et al 2014 this paper aims to analyze cooperation issues and institutional arrangements for future cooperation beyond the basin scale first on cooperation issues it maps key water energy and food related issues and highlights some priority issues based on key experts survey and workshops urgent as well as politically feasible issues are therefore proposed later the development process of institutional arrangements is explained and some arrangements are discussed using conceptualizations of the adequate level of institutional integration in the eastern nile 2 beyond water diplomacy resource basins and regional cooperation water diplomacy as a term summarizes endeavours by academics and practitioners to contribute to peaceful cooperation and conflict resolution among water users on different scales there is no common definition of this term in literature although two common premises for the different approaches exist 1 the centrality of states river basins and water issues and 2 the instrumental multi approach character of facilitating cooperation first state centric water sharing conflicts are central see petersen perlman et al 2017 while the water basin can be seen as the basic analysis unit in this sense concepts of water diplomacy seek to help national states achieve mutually beneficial agreements through non violent measures often in transboundary contexts hydro hegemonic states threaten peace and incite conflicts warner and zeitoun 2008 while hydro diplomacy via international transboundary river agreements can reverse this equation kraska 2009 there are various theories behind hydro hegemony and the perceived causes normative roles and appropriate remedies see warner et al 2017 whether water diplomacy hydro diplomacy or hydro hegemony such concepts are grounded in a water perspective to which all cooperation issues relate in contrast concepts such as benefit sharing conceal the centrality of water issues behind the theoretical construct of benefits these benefits are outputs of water use that can be negotiated and shared instead of having disputes over water quantities sadoff and grey 2005 alam et al 2009 if we reflect on the essence of this idea the emphasis on benefits rather than water is quite valuable in fact this perspective of benefit sharing leaves the door open for determining the origins of the benefits in theory these benefits can be from direct or indirect water use they also can arise from the river basin or in the river basin at the same time in comparison to water diplomacy benefit sharing has the same premise of being a tool that itself entails a repository of technical tools to facilitate water cooperation water diplomacy and benefit sharing are conceived as multi track and interdisciplinary approaches to bringing about transboundary cooperation huntjens and de man 2014 huntjens et al 2016 unece 2015 through negotiations and networks of states communities and beneficiaries water diplomacy is translated into beneficial agreements and thus enhanced cooperation islam and susskind 2012 islam and repella 2015 it helps resolve disputes and acts to prevent such conflicts through the promotion of rules of international law he 2015 the perspective of the wef nexus in transboundary contexts shifts the focus further away from water issues than the concepts of water diplomacy or even benefit sharing do this is the key difference between these concepts at the same time the wef nexus shares the second premise of water diplomacy in the sense that different interdisciplinary tools promote cooperation negotiations benefits assessments integrated analyses regulations laws multi stakeholder platforms etc fig 1 shows the merits of a wef nexus perspective in expanding cooperation issues at different scales and beyond the traditional transboundary water basin approach on a basin level an integrated perspective on the totality of natural resources water energy and land is used in nexus debates for the analysis of benefits and the development of cooperation mechanisms such as cross sectoral projects or encouraging trade within the basin as a result the water basin as the case with the overemphasized blue nile slips out of focus instead as a suitable term for the wef nexus at a basin level one can think of water basins as resource basins a resource basin can be understood as a water basin where all water values direct and indirect are analyzed and other natural resources energy and land connected to the basin rivers or certain groundwater bodies or to other water bodies within the basin boundaries are considered for basin development and cooperation among users in this sense a resource basin is merely a spatial unit alluding to the importance of river basin boundaries as fictive socio political boundaries within which river based as well as non river based development conflicts and negotiations take place we argue that thinking of water basins as resource basins can help approximate to the wef nexus idea on a basin level and it adds cooperation issues and negotiation leverage by comparison in the case of bilateral integration cooperation on the water energy and food issues is more formal and binding the issues expand to include inter country trade bilateral agreements and the exchange of technology and knowledge in accordance with international diplomacy and legal rules in fact bilateral and regional integrations in wef nexus issues are understood here as a higher level of harmonization and cooperation which can greatly help to promote regional cooperation on water or wef nexus issues the role of integration arrangements in helping transboundary water cooperation and in general regional cooperation on common pool resources has been discussed by schiff and winters 2002 and qaddumi 2008 in our conceptualization regional integration is the most all encompassing form since it entails a high level of economic and institutional integration at the same time it is more economically beneficial and effective to address common future challenges for the wider eastern nile basin such as stressors from climate and regional change finally in order to obtain a concrete picture of possible cooperation issues at any spatial scale using a wef nexus perspective an issue mapping matrix was developed table 1 a c it was filled and synthesized during workshops in 2016 with students from a wef nexus graduate class together with five experts from the nile nexus group at the institute for technology in the tropics and subtropics at th koeln university of applied sciences in cologne germany issues are mapped that cross different resource types whether at a national regional or basin scale and are not confined to the river waters these issue mapping exercises represent a first step in the prioritization of cooperation issues which is explained in the next section 3 priority issues for basin wide and regional cooperation 3 1 methods in order to investigate future priority issues related to water energy and food security and transboundary cooperation among eastern nile riparian countries we implemented an online based survey and carried face to face interviews with 28 key experts from egypt 10 sudan 10 and ethiopia 8 during research visits to the three countries in 2016 the semi structured interviews during the field visits aimed at acquiring qualitative data that helped in designing the survey the experts are prominent experts working in ministries 14 research institutes or universities 8 the eastern nile technical regional office 3 the egyptian embassy in ethiopia 1 or as independent consultants 2 input from key experts was used together with the above mentioned issue mapping exercises for the survey design these experts were also asked about their evaluation of the cooperation potential of certain issues and the viability of a wef nexus approach to enhance transboundary cooperation both within the nile basin and also on a regional level later an online based survey was conducted alongside survey questions on the prioritization of cooperation issues questions were developed to gain insights into the current cooperation challenges and the evaluation of current cooperative institutional arrangements the survey was sent only to key experts using the authors professional networks including key experts interviewed thirty seven partly or fully filled surveys were returned of which 15 were from eastern nile countries and the rest from other mostly european experts finally it is worthwhile to note that the survey and interviews focused by design on potentials for regional cooperation and wef based cooperation and only indirectly referred to gerd while moving issues beyond river utilization and the gerd debate might coincide with egypt s position this is unintentional and the paper does not seek to question the contribution of gerd in the current political debates nor the rights and political views of riparian countries 3 2 results cooperation priorities and challenges the survey first assessed the perception of the importance of overarching cooperation areas in the uses of the resources water energy and food table 2 largely based on a reformulation of issues in table 1 as focus areas for cooperation issues the aim was to investigate which sectors and sub sectors hold the highest potential while water and land were higher rated particularly trade efficiency and resource protection the 27 respondents had favourable opinion of all issues except for a seemingly divided opinion on renewables solar thermal and wind and small scale hydropower in fact the perception of interviewed experts converges on this large scale hydropower projects grid integration and energy trade are more viable for cooperation since other types are rather for domestic production water use efficiency for example is highly important for agricultural development in the region in this regard egypt has relatively well performing irrigation systems with internationally one of the highest water use efficiencies for crops like cotton and wheat al zayed et al 2015 on the other hand sudan s poor irrigation systems are causing poor yields due to water inefficiency poor canal maintenance and lack of water sudan s irrigated agriculture is stagnating while it irrigates only 1 of its arable land awulachew et al 2012 table 3 presents results from an exercise designed in order to identify the most beneficial and viable cooperation priorities the survey participants of which 27 completed this part were presented with 17 cooperation issues these issues were selected using most recurrent cooperation issues in interviews as well as during the issue mapping workshops the selection includes future oriented issues with cooperation potential for example the sediments issue was discarded as some experts considered the maintenance of channels and dams a core national task further most experts attested significant future benefits from the gerd in addressing sediments in the survey exercise of the 17 issues only five could be chosen in each category without ranking between the five selected e g select five issues that you consider the least vulnerable to climate change etc this constituted a game where respondents choose 5 issues in 10 rounds of 5 positive questions e g most feasible and 5 negative ones e g least feasible this game was designed in order not to overwhelm respondents by rating each issue on each category and to avoid redundant information if respondents were allowed to select a large number favorites further choosing best and worst five issues on each of the five criteria allows to identify inconsistencies and controversial issues in the aggregated results table 3 presents the results which are depicted here using the following coding for issues receiving more than 50 of total votes for those between 30 and 50 and for those between 15 and 30 for example wastewater reuse with in the criteria high adaptive capacity for climate change means that it received 15 30 of the total 135 votes of all 27 respondents each giving 5 votes as a consequence a very good option for cooperation is the one that receives a large amount of pluses with few or no minuses results on the most prioritized issues show that only a small number of issues are commonly agreed upon as being beneficial as well as viable technical cooperation food and energy trade eco tourism mechanization in agriculture and water resources protection are perceived to be some of the best options in terms of being low cost politically feasible and suitable for addressing the regional common challenge of climate change and variability which is arguably one of the most important contemporary regional challenges swain 2011 barnes 2017 interestingly the selected issues are not directly connected to the river flow they represent regional or bilateral issues rather than water basin ones issues such as water re use and treatment desalination biofuels and groundwater are seen as difficult to tackle and resolve in cooperation negotiations at the same time opinions on issues like hydropower or rainwater harvesting seem to be divided for example rainwater harvesting is perceived to be vulnerable to climate variability although it was considered as a priority for cooperation on many other aspects in fact this issue is highly interesting for the region due to the decent amount of precipitation however the major challenge here is the uneven distribution and the decrease of rainfall towards the north since the main run off producing areas are in the ethiopian highlands and the south west of sudan a climate vulnerable region nbi 2012 table 4 summarizes the answers of 21 respondents to statements assessing the perception of the need for enhancing legislations and agreements transboundary institutions and cooperation here the overall results show that experts look positively on the established legislations and institutions for transboundary cooperation in the nile despite some ineffectiveness the majority of participants disagree that there are already many cooperative mechanisms or that they are not working on the other hand there is a clear majority in favor of additional cooperative arrangements of a binding nature in order to overcome a perceived difficult legacy of conflict and to some extent regional rivalry finally table 5 depicts standardized results on questions regarding cooperation challenges 20 respondents ranked six recurrent challenge categories from 1 to 5 1 being not important and 5 being very important the most relevant challenges identified were trust and political will conflict legacy regional tensions and a sense of unfairness especially for pre 1990 agreements result in distrust and cooperation derails yihdego and rieu clarke 2016 suggested that post 1990 frameworks like the nbi might be more aligned with fairness and distributive justice principles while a basin wide or regional approach to cooperation with participation of non state actors at multiple levels can help rectify power imbalances and improve fairness this is the same perception as that of most of the key experts interviewed who emphasize the value of broad cooperation and also agree that financial resources and knowledge are less of a challenge rather they represent opportunities for collaboration for instance sudan and ethiopia have started to develop early warning and forecasting systems through a joint project with partial participation from egypt harmonization of data infrastructure can allow easy communication and knowledge transfer among riparian countries 4 transformation of issues into institutional arrangements 4 1 issue expansion in the cooperation process the perception of key stakeholders on cooperation priorities reveals that emerging issues such as trade technical and financial cooperation and transboundary investments in conservation and mechanization are well received in the region if broader issues are included they can increase the bargaining area in negotiations and eventually lead to additional mutual gains there are plenty of specific topics under the above mentioned broad cooperation priorities al saidi et al 2017 reviewed specific wef nexus topics which are based on the distinct comparative advantages inherent in the difference between the resource endowments of the eastern nile countries other studies have also demonstrated how a wef nexus perspective can highlight neglected issues in transboundary basins such as the mekong basin dore et al 2012 the euphrates tigris basin kibaroglu and gursoy 2015 the syr darya basin strasser et al 2016 or other large basins in asia keskinen et al 2016 expanding transboundary cooperation means incorporating regional issues whether by integrating resource use issues within the basin boundaries river basin as a socio political resource basin or between states state based bilateral and regional cooperation emergent regional issues can be embedded in the different phases of the cooperation process such cooperation processes are depicted in fig 2 by extending the cooperation continuum into international rivers sadoff and grey 2005 to highlight key functions of each phase and what each phase entails in terms of typical cooperation actions we highlight functions related to the development and revision of institutional arrangements i e policies agreements laws rules practices etc such arrangements are based on certain visions or regimes for governing previously prioritized transboundary issues for example water issues might be best tackled at the river basin level through a river basin organization rbo while trade climate change and the promotion of renewables might require a regional governance approach furthermore polycentric or multi level governance can be preferred for conservation and restoration issues as well as addressing the use of biofuels and their effects on land degradation once issues are prioritized and governance approaches are negotiated actual cooperation can begin by formalizing arrangements and the process of institutionalization i e ensuring that institutional arrangements will be accepted and translated into social and resource use change during their implementation sufficient resources and monitoring are necessary and lessons learnt need to lead to new issues for future reforms and transboundary negotiations it is important that the development of suitable governance approaches as a basis for institutional choice begins early on immediately following an initial phase focusing on the promotion and assessments of cooperation benefits in this preparatory phase diplomacy and trust building are highly important as they help promote the idea of benefit sharing and its values susskind and islam 2012 these cooperation benefits can be broad and arise at the river basin or any other regional scale sadoff and grey 2002 and can be easily integrated into the various methods of benefits assessment unece 2015 4 2 level of institutional integration for many decades transboundary cooperation in the nile has been oriented towards the issue of the utilization of nile waters in an equitable and sustainable manner table 6 summarizes major transboundary cooperation milestones all of which are practically river basin driven despite the incorporation into them of a few overarching development aspects especially after the establishment of the nile basin initiative nbi however the history of cooperation conflicts agreements and political power in the nile has been dominated by the river control see tesfaye 2014 metawie 2004 the establishment of nbi in 1999 marked an important milestone since it sought to outline mutual benefits and a basin wide collaboration framework for example the shared vision program svp promoted data sharing pilot projects as best practices for sustainable development knowledge infrastructure and regional power trade a bigger and more relevant initiative for the ideas of benefit sharing and regionalism was the 2005 launched joint multipurpose program jmp which entailed large investments in basin development such as improving storage or hydropower use however this promising program represented a donor driven add on mechanism it did not institutionalize beyond the basin or regional cooperation approaches while water sharing remained the dominant topic in the negotiation track in fact with no new broader institutional arrangements in place since the water driven nbi act of 2002 nile issues have continued to be resolved through an ad hoc issue based cooperation driven by facts on the ground and the absence of a basin wide perspective with the nile being managed as a collection of connected but independent river reaches and sub basins hilhorst 2016 the jmp failed in 2012 after egypt s opposition to the proposed focus of investments in the blue nile basin at the same time sectoral infrastructure projects such as power transmission between sudan and ethiopia continued bilaterally with donor funds but formally under the auspices of the nbi despite the lack of institutionalized mechanisms behind the jmp its collapse might be regrettable especially for egypt who witnessed the rising geopolitical ambitions of ethiopia and sudan challenge its water hegemony and the unilateral move of ethiopia to construct the gerd as a result a new era of cooperation begun see cascão and nicol 2016 nicol and cascao 2011 cascão 2008 the gerd era means a return to single issues and allocation conflicts but also offers new opportunities for technical cooperation hydrosolidarity and the joint exploitation of development spillovers yihdego et al 2016 abdelhady et al 2015 at the same time failure of cooperation on the gerd can seriously threaten benefit sharing let alone regionalism while egypt is under pressure to advance its water policies and exploit additional resources yihdego et al 2017 tawfik 2016 yet some scholars are optimistic about the prospects of cooperation on the gerd especially in light of the 2015 principles agreement between ethiopia egypt and sudan see salman 2013 2016 the agreement included a commitment to regional integration but did not offer any specific regional topics rather focusing on many points related to the construction of the gerd incorporating further issues into future transboundary institutional arrangements in the eastern nile basin might require developing additional institutional arrangements and utilizing opportunities provided by international law fig 3 shows the trade offs regarding the optimal level of institutional integration the hard or legal based approach entails various instruments such as substantive and procedural rules bilateral and multilateral agreements regional organizations etc e g belinskij 2015 he 2015 it results in increased formality of cooperation but a higher level of trust at the same time it increases institutional complexity and also coordination cost two issues that often undermine the institutional effectiveness of the established governance regimes wallis and ison 2011 further abebe 2014 questions whether a legal resolution based on international law can work in the absence of a central enforcement mechanism instead an economic approach that minimizes transaction costs and establishes property and liability rules in order to balance states preferences can be more helpful in fact egypt still regards the nile as its historic right but might be willing to accept a smaller share in exchange for beneficial agreements on trade and technical cooperation regional cooperation can help accommodate increasing internal pressures such as growing populations and unemployment in any case cooperation arrangements must strike a balance between formality transaction costs and the issue complexity the cooperation and diplomacy status quo is based on one issue river flow utilization soft measures such as diplomacy and non binding agreements the formalization of transboundary water cooperation through a rbo which can enhance trust and cooperation is under discussion a further development of this transboundary cooperation to include formal institutional arrangements for regional and bilateral cooperation can be mutually beneficial 5 discussion of regional cooperation options in the eastern nile basin the highlighted emerging issues related to water energy and land resources have risen from recent pressures such as increased river basin development external risks such as climate change or variability and technological advances in agriculture conservation and renewables further the global economic actors push to exploit local resources in africa in order to increase water energy and food outputs while african states are utilizing this opportunity to redefine their national politics verhoeven 2013 in the past the hegemonic position of egypt was associated with the favouritism of historic agreements but also with superior adaptive capacity e g diversified economy and virtual water to withstand the asymmetric endowment of surface and soil water allan 2009 recently however sudan and ethiopia are using their comparative advantages e g surface water in ethiopia and arable land in sudan to challenge egypt s hegemony increased land and energy investments from local and foreign actors helped the two countries cement their national ambitions but also strained transboundary water relations see sandstorm et al 2016 while ethiopia opted to take a major unilateral step in order to boost its economy by constructing the gerd using own funds sudan does not see itself obliged to stick to the historic pact with egypt regardless of its national interests this new basin dynamics does not provide evident coalitions and incites a broad thinking in terms of what is best for the region while preserving national interests and sovereignty the academic argument for moving beyond sharing the benefits from the direct use of transboundary rivers towards a regional perspective using the lens of transboundary natural resources has been around for some time now e g sadoff and grey 2002 schiff and winters 2002 qaddumi 2008 in the eastern nile regional cooperation can address common challenges and capitalize on development opportunities while breaking the zero sum mentality of river basin negotiations options to do this in terms of the set of institutional arrangements depend on the negotiated political vision for the region and consequently the adopted regional governance regime arguably these options range between the four poles depicted in fig 4 integration entails formal i e based on international law institutional arrangements that achieve a profound level of harmonization regional integration arrangements rias are established among states to advance regional integration regional cooperation e g on water issues can however advance without regional arrangements e g nile or indus basins therefore regional integration is seen as separate from cooperation while integration can be a facilitating factor for cooperation by widening the issues and thereby the bargaining arena or helping develop effective enforcement of sectoral agreements schiff and winters 2002 on the other hand qaddumi 2008 sees a stronger influence of integration on cooperation since regional integration can be an instrumental factor in bringing about cooperation on issues such as transboundary water management e g the rhine commission the bottom line is that cooperation entails more informality and less complexity in terms of binding institutional arrangements the other poles of cooperation are the state or basin levels for example eastern nile countries can incorporate new issues using bilateral or multilateral agreements on issues not confined to river these agreements can result in sector based cooperation or a deeper integration as an economic community on the basin level the new issues can be embedded in current transboundary water basin cooperation arrangements e g enhancing nexus issues alternatively the countries can adopt a stronger approach of integration that considers the totality and interlinks between natural resources within the basin thus perceiving the basin an economic and socio political entity resource basin options for regional cooperation or regional integration might be determined in the end by the two factors of geopolitics and the aforementioned trade offs of enhanced institutional integration examples from transboundary cooperation in the african context can provide some orientation in eastern africa the 1996 founded intergovernmental authority on development igad is a regional economic community comprising five nbi states including ethiopia and sudan but not egypt as a successor to a drought focused regional organization its vision is closely linked to environmental issues and in practice highly influenced by nile conflicts economic integration free trade and infrastructure development are aims of igad however members prioritize security concerns while they observe the growing influence of ethiopian interests on the organization and the region at large with suspicion byiers 2016 egypt has occasionally expressed interest in joining igad something that presumably depends on the outcome of the regional hydro rivalry joining igad might make a regional economic community for the eastern nile unnecessary one should note that egypt has tried to build such a community in the form of the undugu group which ethiopia did not join however the group was conceived to be an instrument by egypt to maintain its status quo interests with ethiopia as a rising hydropower both countries might reconsider this option after all in the post gerd era both egypt and ethiopia will still be confronted with rising populations of mostly young people eager to find jobs and use opportunities provided by peaceful relations e g trade in food energy or technology at the same time a new community implies more coordination costs and institutional complexity while it might be an altogether difficult option due to weak cultural and geographical ties on the other hand egypt might opt for strengthening bilateral and or multilateral ties with sudan and ethiopia or advance the development of a rbo as a successor to the nbi there have been recent indications of increased cooperation between egypt and ethiopia as the new egyptian regime seems for now to favor good relations and trade over the instrumentalization of the conflict von lossow and roll 2015 at the same time reforming the hydro centric organization nbi into an a rbo is still an integral part of the regional vision the ability of such an organization to effectively incorporate water and land issues as well as other common challenges such as climate change is not clear it is also difficult to explain how joint action on overarching issues such as resource trade infrastructure and grid integration or groundwater can take place without some integration arrangements at least on a bilateral level or through international agreements supporting or complementing arrangements at the basin level in the african context regional integration in western and southern parts is increasingly linking the regional and the basin levels together the southern african development community sadc of 16 countries sharing many rivers covers a number of natural resources including shared water through a lens of regional integration and economic interdependence in the case of sadc muller et al 2015 highlighted the role of water although small due to limited interactions on shared rivers as a showcase for mutual benefits through cooperation and recommended hydro supportive transboundary water management for this region this means managing water on the same geographical scale as other sectors and in alignment with wider socio economic activities or regional development similarly shared waters in western africa are also promoted as part of a larger zone of regional integration however the economic community of west african states ecowas excludes cameroon an important riparian country uneca 2015 similarly in the eastern nile true regional integration seems distant from current diplomatic negotiation realities instead if riparian countries favor an enhancement of basin approaches they can consider broader approaches such as resource integration wef nexus cross sectoral institutional arrangements and a hydro supportive basin organization with inclusive participation 6 conclusions the water and state centric approach of water diplomacy emphasizes the use of interdisciplinary negotiations tools conflict resolution and transboundary institutions in order to facilitate cooperation mostly on the river basin level benefit sharing a wider and not entirely water basin related lens on cooperation promises to move beyond the zero sum game of allocating water quantities many of the emerging resource use issues in transboundary rivers are not adequately incorporated into concepts such as water diplomacy or the approach of benefit sharing at the same time growing economies demands and external climatic risks are leading to an appreciation of the regional level for cooperation on common pool resources the wef nexus approach can be useful for highlighting key neglected issues on interlinked resources at the basin and regional levels to conceptually accommodate these new issues and concepts at the basin level there is a need to move beyond water perspectives whether hydro centric or hydro supportive we argue that an understanding of a river basin from a broader perspective as a resource basin can be helpful in this regard in our conceptualisation basin boundaries are seen as common socio economic boundaries within which interlinked water energy and land resources whether connected to the river flow or not are utilized for basin development while the benefits therefrom are shared among users such a conceptualization helps broaden cooperation issues incorporate non state actors and increase mutual gains and is also less associated with institutional complexity than the maybe unwanted or unfeasible fully fledged regional integration this paper has aimed at highlighting new issues for transboundary cooperation while exploring institutional arrangements for dealing with them in the eastern nile as a region with a common destiny such issues include wef nexus ones and increased regional cooperation despite the current focus on the transboundary water cooperation issues related to equitable utilization and hydropower projects scholars and practitioners perceive land and energy use issues as being increasingly important and appropriate for future negotiation agendas the issues considered to be the most beneficial and also viable for cooperation are cross sectoral and rather regional technical cooperation trade certain services of nile based eco systems and improving agricultural technologies can help enhance cooperation are more financially and politically feasible and represent climate resistant issues there is also a large degree of support among nile basin experts for the idea of enhancing cooperative institutions and legislations these are seen to have had a positive contribution on transboundary river basin management they also mitigate underlying cooperation challenges such as distrust and regional rivalry finally in order to achieve enhanced cooperation in the region we make the following recommendations these recommendations are based on the study of emerging issues and the analysis of the institutional challenges and set up in the eastern nile basin the transboundary cooperation vision and the issues in the negotiation agenda can be enhanced through a more integrated and regional perspective this means incorporating wef nexus issues overarching challenges such as trade climate change and variability low resource use efficiencies and eco systems protection there are beneficial and not difficult issues that represent low hanging fruits in transboundary cooperation e g technical cooperation technology transfer and investments in nile resources addressing these issues can help build trust showcase cooperation benefits and help although indirectly foster regional integration emergent issues needs to be incorporated into the cooperation process at different phases i e during the preparation phase until the phases of implementation monitoring and learning optimally the cooperation agenda is revised regularly to accommodate new issues arising due to the rapid change of pace in the region new regional institutional arrangements should be based on a negotiated governance approach concerning transboundary natural resources regional integration is an ambitious goal and institutional integration entails important trade offs however deep integration can facilitate cooperation on resource conflicts and governance the basin level is a suitable scale for many resource use issues especially if strengthened through more inclusive institutions in terms of issues and actors the basin is however not only a management scale or a water resources delineation moreover it can be purposefully conceived as a resource basin and thus understood as an integrative entity with a common set of development goals and to certain extent as a coherent socio economic community eastern nile basin countries should deliberate on options for regional integration while considering cooperation trajectories existing arrangements in the region and experiences from other parts of the african continent any institutional arrangements need to reflect cooperation between equals and the appreciation of benefits of interdependence over rivalry or competition 
7259,research on water cooperation in the eastern nile basin has focused on expanding policy and diplomacy tools for a better allocation of transboundary water resources confined to the river regional cooperation on water and related sectors such as energy and land expands the bargaining and areas for mutual gain and thus enhances cooperation perspectives this paper looks at the contribution and the potential benefits of a regional cooperation approach to addressing the underlying challenges of water diplomacy such as complexity and distrust it also promotes the understanding of river basins as a resource basin of integrated and linked resource use issues not always related to the river flow the paper provides an analysis of priority issues for water energy food nexus in regional cooperation in the eastern nile basin this basin represents an illustrative case for regional cooperation and increased integration due to multiple comparative advantages inherent in the uneven endowments of water energy and arable land resources and to varying levels of economic and technological advancement among the three riparian countries egypt sudan and ethiopia the paper also analyzes institutional arrangements on a regional scale and elaborates on the inherent trade offs associated with them keywords regional water cooperation water diplomacy water energy food nexus transboundary water governance eastern nile basin 1 introduction cooperation among key riparian states egypt ethiopia and sudan in the eastern nile basin is now more critical than ever for resolving emerging conflicts around issues such as hydropower and providing resources for growing populations and economies such cooperation has become more complex in light of growing national and economic aspirations since the independence from colonial powers wolf and newton 2009 cascão 2008 nicol and cascao 2011 furthermore stresses such as climate change population growth and depleted and or degraded water resources caused by poor management are causing instabilities and water use conflicts as is the case with other transboundary basins in africa chikozho 2014 being the largest basin in africa the history of transboundary water management in the nile has involved various economic political social and environmental factors that have determined cooperation legacies paisley and henshaw 2013 despite various attempts the water conflict is as yet not resolved as nobody has managed to accommodate egypt s concerns about unfavourable outcomes of dams constructed upstream and ethiopia s recurrent uncertainties regarding recurrent droughts habteyes et al 2015 the conflict over river development and hydropower underpins the need for multifaceted approaches to enhance cooperation and context fit solutions that consider the overall environmental hydrological political economic and social circumstances of a specific basin the governance of transboundary basins has historically been state centric and confined to water related issues and to basin boundaries since there is no unique solution to bringing about immediate transboundary cooperation a multifaceted approach and experimentation with issues and actors is needed a focus on adaptive governance with public involvement and multiple stakeholder participation is necessary to overcome certain issues and failures akamani and wilson 2011 in the context of the nile basin institutional arrangements for water allocation should be complemented by other softer measures to build capacities promote technical cooperation favor political stability and stimulate participatory processes habteyes et al 2015 paisley and henshaw 2013 in this sense cooperation in the nile basin has evolved to incorporate more issues and softer approaches see part 4 1 recently the integrated management paradigm of the water energy food nexus wef nexus has provided an opportunity to expand the debate on transboundary basin cooperation to include new issues academic literature on the wef nexus has provided multiple useful tools for integrated analysis of natural resources including on a river basin scale al saidi and elagib 2017 major concerns in transboundary basins are sometimes not related to water availability and depending on the basin stakeholders might regard issues such as nutrients or sedimentation as more important lawford et al 2013 through a wef nexus perspective benefit sharing options can be extended to key sectors such as agriculture and energy thus providing additional mechanisms for conflict resolution and basin development jalivov et al 2015 in the blue nile basin for example linking operation policies of dams such as the grand ethiopian renaissance dam gerd to irrigation and energy demands downstream provides beneficial opportunities for co management and coordination tan et al 2017 a multi issue analysis of transboundary river basin issues can help improve transboundary cooperation and provide additional tools for water diplomacy keskinen et al 2016 and keskinen and varis 2016 have already showed in the case of large asian rivers how a water energy food perspective complements traditional water focused transboundary approaches and enriches the transboundary context with new tools approaches and actors in the eastern nile basin a wef nexus approach is not only relevant at the basin scale but is also viable on national and regional scales al saidi et al 2017 introduced the resource use profiles of the three countries and analyzed the sectors and the potentials for cooperation on a regional level as we begin to appreciate the merits of expanding the transboundary debate in the eastern nile basin there is a need to advance knowledge on benefit sharing and cooperation options beyond water issues and the basin boundaries a regional and cross sectoral approach can move cooperation beyond the binary thinking in terms cooperation conflict or nationalism solidarity and the current debate on mutual benefits from flow modification such as the construction of the gerd e g habteyes et al 2015 whittington et al 2014 this paper aims to analyze cooperation issues and institutional arrangements for future cooperation beyond the basin scale first on cooperation issues it maps key water energy and food related issues and highlights some priority issues based on key experts survey and workshops urgent as well as politically feasible issues are therefore proposed later the development process of institutional arrangements is explained and some arrangements are discussed using conceptualizations of the adequate level of institutional integration in the eastern nile 2 beyond water diplomacy resource basins and regional cooperation water diplomacy as a term summarizes endeavours by academics and practitioners to contribute to peaceful cooperation and conflict resolution among water users on different scales there is no common definition of this term in literature although two common premises for the different approaches exist 1 the centrality of states river basins and water issues and 2 the instrumental multi approach character of facilitating cooperation first state centric water sharing conflicts are central see petersen perlman et al 2017 while the water basin can be seen as the basic analysis unit in this sense concepts of water diplomacy seek to help national states achieve mutually beneficial agreements through non violent measures often in transboundary contexts hydro hegemonic states threaten peace and incite conflicts warner and zeitoun 2008 while hydro diplomacy via international transboundary river agreements can reverse this equation kraska 2009 there are various theories behind hydro hegemony and the perceived causes normative roles and appropriate remedies see warner et al 2017 whether water diplomacy hydro diplomacy or hydro hegemony such concepts are grounded in a water perspective to which all cooperation issues relate in contrast concepts such as benefit sharing conceal the centrality of water issues behind the theoretical construct of benefits these benefits are outputs of water use that can be negotiated and shared instead of having disputes over water quantities sadoff and grey 2005 alam et al 2009 if we reflect on the essence of this idea the emphasis on benefits rather than water is quite valuable in fact this perspective of benefit sharing leaves the door open for determining the origins of the benefits in theory these benefits can be from direct or indirect water use they also can arise from the river basin or in the river basin at the same time in comparison to water diplomacy benefit sharing has the same premise of being a tool that itself entails a repository of technical tools to facilitate water cooperation water diplomacy and benefit sharing are conceived as multi track and interdisciplinary approaches to bringing about transboundary cooperation huntjens and de man 2014 huntjens et al 2016 unece 2015 through negotiations and networks of states communities and beneficiaries water diplomacy is translated into beneficial agreements and thus enhanced cooperation islam and susskind 2012 islam and repella 2015 it helps resolve disputes and acts to prevent such conflicts through the promotion of rules of international law he 2015 the perspective of the wef nexus in transboundary contexts shifts the focus further away from water issues than the concepts of water diplomacy or even benefit sharing do this is the key difference between these concepts at the same time the wef nexus shares the second premise of water diplomacy in the sense that different interdisciplinary tools promote cooperation negotiations benefits assessments integrated analyses regulations laws multi stakeholder platforms etc fig 1 shows the merits of a wef nexus perspective in expanding cooperation issues at different scales and beyond the traditional transboundary water basin approach on a basin level an integrated perspective on the totality of natural resources water energy and land is used in nexus debates for the analysis of benefits and the development of cooperation mechanisms such as cross sectoral projects or encouraging trade within the basin as a result the water basin as the case with the overemphasized blue nile slips out of focus instead as a suitable term for the wef nexus at a basin level one can think of water basins as resource basins a resource basin can be understood as a water basin where all water values direct and indirect are analyzed and other natural resources energy and land connected to the basin rivers or certain groundwater bodies or to other water bodies within the basin boundaries are considered for basin development and cooperation among users in this sense a resource basin is merely a spatial unit alluding to the importance of river basin boundaries as fictive socio political boundaries within which river based as well as non river based development conflicts and negotiations take place we argue that thinking of water basins as resource basins can help approximate to the wef nexus idea on a basin level and it adds cooperation issues and negotiation leverage by comparison in the case of bilateral integration cooperation on the water energy and food issues is more formal and binding the issues expand to include inter country trade bilateral agreements and the exchange of technology and knowledge in accordance with international diplomacy and legal rules in fact bilateral and regional integrations in wef nexus issues are understood here as a higher level of harmonization and cooperation which can greatly help to promote regional cooperation on water or wef nexus issues the role of integration arrangements in helping transboundary water cooperation and in general regional cooperation on common pool resources has been discussed by schiff and winters 2002 and qaddumi 2008 in our conceptualization regional integration is the most all encompassing form since it entails a high level of economic and institutional integration at the same time it is more economically beneficial and effective to address common future challenges for the wider eastern nile basin such as stressors from climate and regional change finally in order to obtain a concrete picture of possible cooperation issues at any spatial scale using a wef nexus perspective an issue mapping matrix was developed table 1 a c it was filled and synthesized during workshops in 2016 with students from a wef nexus graduate class together with five experts from the nile nexus group at the institute for technology in the tropics and subtropics at th koeln university of applied sciences in cologne germany issues are mapped that cross different resource types whether at a national regional or basin scale and are not confined to the river waters these issue mapping exercises represent a first step in the prioritization of cooperation issues which is explained in the next section 3 priority issues for basin wide and regional cooperation 3 1 methods in order to investigate future priority issues related to water energy and food security and transboundary cooperation among eastern nile riparian countries we implemented an online based survey and carried face to face interviews with 28 key experts from egypt 10 sudan 10 and ethiopia 8 during research visits to the three countries in 2016 the semi structured interviews during the field visits aimed at acquiring qualitative data that helped in designing the survey the experts are prominent experts working in ministries 14 research institutes or universities 8 the eastern nile technical regional office 3 the egyptian embassy in ethiopia 1 or as independent consultants 2 input from key experts was used together with the above mentioned issue mapping exercises for the survey design these experts were also asked about their evaluation of the cooperation potential of certain issues and the viability of a wef nexus approach to enhance transboundary cooperation both within the nile basin and also on a regional level later an online based survey was conducted alongside survey questions on the prioritization of cooperation issues questions were developed to gain insights into the current cooperation challenges and the evaluation of current cooperative institutional arrangements the survey was sent only to key experts using the authors professional networks including key experts interviewed thirty seven partly or fully filled surveys were returned of which 15 were from eastern nile countries and the rest from other mostly european experts finally it is worthwhile to note that the survey and interviews focused by design on potentials for regional cooperation and wef based cooperation and only indirectly referred to gerd while moving issues beyond river utilization and the gerd debate might coincide with egypt s position this is unintentional and the paper does not seek to question the contribution of gerd in the current political debates nor the rights and political views of riparian countries 3 2 results cooperation priorities and challenges the survey first assessed the perception of the importance of overarching cooperation areas in the uses of the resources water energy and food table 2 largely based on a reformulation of issues in table 1 as focus areas for cooperation issues the aim was to investigate which sectors and sub sectors hold the highest potential while water and land were higher rated particularly trade efficiency and resource protection the 27 respondents had favourable opinion of all issues except for a seemingly divided opinion on renewables solar thermal and wind and small scale hydropower in fact the perception of interviewed experts converges on this large scale hydropower projects grid integration and energy trade are more viable for cooperation since other types are rather for domestic production water use efficiency for example is highly important for agricultural development in the region in this regard egypt has relatively well performing irrigation systems with internationally one of the highest water use efficiencies for crops like cotton and wheat al zayed et al 2015 on the other hand sudan s poor irrigation systems are causing poor yields due to water inefficiency poor canal maintenance and lack of water sudan s irrigated agriculture is stagnating while it irrigates only 1 of its arable land awulachew et al 2012 table 3 presents results from an exercise designed in order to identify the most beneficial and viable cooperation priorities the survey participants of which 27 completed this part were presented with 17 cooperation issues these issues were selected using most recurrent cooperation issues in interviews as well as during the issue mapping workshops the selection includes future oriented issues with cooperation potential for example the sediments issue was discarded as some experts considered the maintenance of channels and dams a core national task further most experts attested significant future benefits from the gerd in addressing sediments in the survey exercise of the 17 issues only five could be chosen in each category without ranking between the five selected e g select five issues that you consider the least vulnerable to climate change etc this constituted a game where respondents choose 5 issues in 10 rounds of 5 positive questions e g most feasible and 5 negative ones e g least feasible this game was designed in order not to overwhelm respondents by rating each issue on each category and to avoid redundant information if respondents were allowed to select a large number favorites further choosing best and worst five issues on each of the five criteria allows to identify inconsistencies and controversial issues in the aggregated results table 3 presents the results which are depicted here using the following coding for issues receiving more than 50 of total votes for those between 30 and 50 and for those between 15 and 30 for example wastewater reuse with in the criteria high adaptive capacity for climate change means that it received 15 30 of the total 135 votes of all 27 respondents each giving 5 votes as a consequence a very good option for cooperation is the one that receives a large amount of pluses with few or no minuses results on the most prioritized issues show that only a small number of issues are commonly agreed upon as being beneficial as well as viable technical cooperation food and energy trade eco tourism mechanization in agriculture and water resources protection are perceived to be some of the best options in terms of being low cost politically feasible and suitable for addressing the regional common challenge of climate change and variability which is arguably one of the most important contemporary regional challenges swain 2011 barnes 2017 interestingly the selected issues are not directly connected to the river flow they represent regional or bilateral issues rather than water basin ones issues such as water re use and treatment desalination biofuels and groundwater are seen as difficult to tackle and resolve in cooperation negotiations at the same time opinions on issues like hydropower or rainwater harvesting seem to be divided for example rainwater harvesting is perceived to be vulnerable to climate variability although it was considered as a priority for cooperation on many other aspects in fact this issue is highly interesting for the region due to the decent amount of precipitation however the major challenge here is the uneven distribution and the decrease of rainfall towards the north since the main run off producing areas are in the ethiopian highlands and the south west of sudan a climate vulnerable region nbi 2012 table 4 summarizes the answers of 21 respondents to statements assessing the perception of the need for enhancing legislations and agreements transboundary institutions and cooperation here the overall results show that experts look positively on the established legislations and institutions for transboundary cooperation in the nile despite some ineffectiveness the majority of participants disagree that there are already many cooperative mechanisms or that they are not working on the other hand there is a clear majority in favor of additional cooperative arrangements of a binding nature in order to overcome a perceived difficult legacy of conflict and to some extent regional rivalry finally table 5 depicts standardized results on questions regarding cooperation challenges 20 respondents ranked six recurrent challenge categories from 1 to 5 1 being not important and 5 being very important the most relevant challenges identified were trust and political will conflict legacy regional tensions and a sense of unfairness especially for pre 1990 agreements result in distrust and cooperation derails yihdego and rieu clarke 2016 suggested that post 1990 frameworks like the nbi might be more aligned with fairness and distributive justice principles while a basin wide or regional approach to cooperation with participation of non state actors at multiple levels can help rectify power imbalances and improve fairness this is the same perception as that of most of the key experts interviewed who emphasize the value of broad cooperation and also agree that financial resources and knowledge are less of a challenge rather they represent opportunities for collaboration for instance sudan and ethiopia have started to develop early warning and forecasting systems through a joint project with partial participation from egypt harmonization of data infrastructure can allow easy communication and knowledge transfer among riparian countries 4 transformation of issues into institutional arrangements 4 1 issue expansion in the cooperation process the perception of key stakeholders on cooperation priorities reveals that emerging issues such as trade technical and financial cooperation and transboundary investments in conservation and mechanization are well received in the region if broader issues are included they can increase the bargaining area in negotiations and eventually lead to additional mutual gains there are plenty of specific topics under the above mentioned broad cooperation priorities al saidi et al 2017 reviewed specific wef nexus topics which are based on the distinct comparative advantages inherent in the difference between the resource endowments of the eastern nile countries other studies have also demonstrated how a wef nexus perspective can highlight neglected issues in transboundary basins such as the mekong basin dore et al 2012 the euphrates tigris basin kibaroglu and gursoy 2015 the syr darya basin strasser et al 2016 or other large basins in asia keskinen et al 2016 expanding transboundary cooperation means incorporating regional issues whether by integrating resource use issues within the basin boundaries river basin as a socio political resource basin or between states state based bilateral and regional cooperation emergent regional issues can be embedded in the different phases of the cooperation process such cooperation processes are depicted in fig 2 by extending the cooperation continuum into international rivers sadoff and grey 2005 to highlight key functions of each phase and what each phase entails in terms of typical cooperation actions we highlight functions related to the development and revision of institutional arrangements i e policies agreements laws rules practices etc such arrangements are based on certain visions or regimes for governing previously prioritized transboundary issues for example water issues might be best tackled at the river basin level through a river basin organization rbo while trade climate change and the promotion of renewables might require a regional governance approach furthermore polycentric or multi level governance can be preferred for conservation and restoration issues as well as addressing the use of biofuels and their effects on land degradation once issues are prioritized and governance approaches are negotiated actual cooperation can begin by formalizing arrangements and the process of institutionalization i e ensuring that institutional arrangements will be accepted and translated into social and resource use change during their implementation sufficient resources and monitoring are necessary and lessons learnt need to lead to new issues for future reforms and transboundary negotiations it is important that the development of suitable governance approaches as a basis for institutional choice begins early on immediately following an initial phase focusing on the promotion and assessments of cooperation benefits in this preparatory phase diplomacy and trust building are highly important as they help promote the idea of benefit sharing and its values susskind and islam 2012 these cooperation benefits can be broad and arise at the river basin or any other regional scale sadoff and grey 2002 and can be easily integrated into the various methods of benefits assessment unece 2015 4 2 level of institutional integration for many decades transboundary cooperation in the nile has been oriented towards the issue of the utilization of nile waters in an equitable and sustainable manner table 6 summarizes major transboundary cooperation milestones all of which are practically river basin driven despite the incorporation into them of a few overarching development aspects especially after the establishment of the nile basin initiative nbi however the history of cooperation conflicts agreements and political power in the nile has been dominated by the river control see tesfaye 2014 metawie 2004 the establishment of nbi in 1999 marked an important milestone since it sought to outline mutual benefits and a basin wide collaboration framework for example the shared vision program svp promoted data sharing pilot projects as best practices for sustainable development knowledge infrastructure and regional power trade a bigger and more relevant initiative for the ideas of benefit sharing and regionalism was the 2005 launched joint multipurpose program jmp which entailed large investments in basin development such as improving storage or hydropower use however this promising program represented a donor driven add on mechanism it did not institutionalize beyond the basin or regional cooperation approaches while water sharing remained the dominant topic in the negotiation track in fact with no new broader institutional arrangements in place since the water driven nbi act of 2002 nile issues have continued to be resolved through an ad hoc issue based cooperation driven by facts on the ground and the absence of a basin wide perspective with the nile being managed as a collection of connected but independent river reaches and sub basins hilhorst 2016 the jmp failed in 2012 after egypt s opposition to the proposed focus of investments in the blue nile basin at the same time sectoral infrastructure projects such as power transmission between sudan and ethiopia continued bilaterally with donor funds but formally under the auspices of the nbi despite the lack of institutionalized mechanisms behind the jmp its collapse might be regrettable especially for egypt who witnessed the rising geopolitical ambitions of ethiopia and sudan challenge its water hegemony and the unilateral move of ethiopia to construct the gerd as a result a new era of cooperation begun see cascão and nicol 2016 nicol and cascao 2011 cascão 2008 the gerd era means a return to single issues and allocation conflicts but also offers new opportunities for technical cooperation hydrosolidarity and the joint exploitation of development spillovers yihdego et al 2016 abdelhady et al 2015 at the same time failure of cooperation on the gerd can seriously threaten benefit sharing let alone regionalism while egypt is under pressure to advance its water policies and exploit additional resources yihdego et al 2017 tawfik 2016 yet some scholars are optimistic about the prospects of cooperation on the gerd especially in light of the 2015 principles agreement between ethiopia egypt and sudan see salman 2013 2016 the agreement included a commitment to regional integration but did not offer any specific regional topics rather focusing on many points related to the construction of the gerd incorporating further issues into future transboundary institutional arrangements in the eastern nile basin might require developing additional institutional arrangements and utilizing opportunities provided by international law fig 3 shows the trade offs regarding the optimal level of institutional integration the hard or legal based approach entails various instruments such as substantive and procedural rules bilateral and multilateral agreements regional organizations etc e g belinskij 2015 he 2015 it results in increased formality of cooperation but a higher level of trust at the same time it increases institutional complexity and also coordination cost two issues that often undermine the institutional effectiveness of the established governance regimes wallis and ison 2011 further abebe 2014 questions whether a legal resolution based on international law can work in the absence of a central enforcement mechanism instead an economic approach that minimizes transaction costs and establishes property and liability rules in order to balance states preferences can be more helpful in fact egypt still regards the nile as its historic right but might be willing to accept a smaller share in exchange for beneficial agreements on trade and technical cooperation regional cooperation can help accommodate increasing internal pressures such as growing populations and unemployment in any case cooperation arrangements must strike a balance between formality transaction costs and the issue complexity the cooperation and diplomacy status quo is based on one issue river flow utilization soft measures such as diplomacy and non binding agreements the formalization of transboundary water cooperation through a rbo which can enhance trust and cooperation is under discussion a further development of this transboundary cooperation to include formal institutional arrangements for regional and bilateral cooperation can be mutually beneficial 5 discussion of regional cooperation options in the eastern nile basin the highlighted emerging issues related to water energy and land resources have risen from recent pressures such as increased river basin development external risks such as climate change or variability and technological advances in agriculture conservation and renewables further the global economic actors push to exploit local resources in africa in order to increase water energy and food outputs while african states are utilizing this opportunity to redefine their national politics verhoeven 2013 in the past the hegemonic position of egypt was associated with the favouritism of historic agreements but also with superior adaptive capacity e g diversified economy and virtual water to withstand the asymmetric endowment of surface and soil water allan 2009 recently however sudan and ethiopia are using their comparative advantages e g surface water in ethiopia and arable land in sudan to challenge egypt s hegemony increased land and energy investments from local and foreign actors helped the two countries cement their national ambitions but also strained transboundary water relations see sandstorm et al 2016 while ethiopia opted to take a major unilateral step in order to boost its economy by constructing the gerd using own funds sudan does not see itself obliged to stick to the historic pact with egypt regardless of its national interests this new basin dynamics does not provide evident coalitions and incites a broad thinking in terms of what is best for the region while preserving national interests and sovereignty the academic argument for moving beyond sharing the benefits from the direct use of transboundary rivers towards a regional perspective using the lens of transboundary natural resources has been around for some time now e g sadoff and grey 2002 schiff and winters 2002 qaddumi 2008 in the eastern nile regional cooperation can address common challenges and capitalize on development opportunities while breaking the zero sum mentality of river basin negotiations options to do this in terms of the set of institutional arrangements depend on the negotiated political vision for the region and consequently the adopted regional governance regime arguably these options range between the four poles depicted in fig 4 integration entails formal i e based on international law institutional arrangements that achieve a profound level of harmonization regional integration arrangements rias are established among states to advance regional integration regional cooperation e g on water issues can however advance without regional arrangements e g nile or indus basins therefore regional integration is seen as separate from cooperation while integration can be a facilitating factor for cooperation by widening the issues and thereby the bargaining arena or helping develop effective enforcement of sectoral agreements schiff and winters 2002 on the other hand qaddumi 2008 sees a stronger influence of integration on cooperation since regional integration can be an instrumental factor in bringing about cooperation on issues such as transboundary water management e g the rhine commission the bottom line is that cooperation entails more informality and less complexity in terms of binding institutional arrangements the other poles of cooperation are the state or basin levels for example eastern nile countries can incorporate new issues using bilateral or multilateral agreements on issues not confined to river these agreements can result in sector based cooperation or a deeper integration as an economic community on the basin level the new issues can be embedded in current transboundary water basin cooperation arrangements e g enhancing nexus issues alternatively the countries can adopt a stronger approach of integration that considers the totality and interlinks between natural resources within the basin thus perceiving the basin an economic and socio political entity resource basin options for regional cooperation or regional integration might be determined in the end by the two factors of geopolitics and the aforementioned trade offs of enhanced institutional integration examples from transboundary cooperation in the african context can provide some orientation in eastern africa the 1996 founded intergovernmental authority on development igad is a regional economic community comprising five nbi states including ethiopia and sudan but not egypt as a successor to a drought focused regional organization its vision is closely linked to environmental issues and in practice highly influenced by nile conflicts economic integration free trade and infrastructure development are aims of igad however members prioritize security concerns while they observe the growing influence of ethiopian interests on the organization and the region at large with suspicion byiers 2016 egypt has occasionally expressed interest in joining igad something that presumably depends on the outcome of the regional hydro rivalry joining igad might make a regional economic community for the eastern nile unnecessary one should note that egypt has tried to build such a community in the form of the undugu group which ethiopia did not join however the group was conceived to be an instrument by egypt to maintain its status quo interests with ethiopia as a rising hydropower both countries might reconsider this option after all in the post gerd era both egypt and ethiopia will still be confronted with rising populations of mostly young people eager to find jobs and use opportunities provided by peaceful relations e g trade in food energy or technology at the same time a new community implies more coordination costs and institutional complexity while it might be an altogether difficult option due to weak cultural and geographical ties on the other hand egypt might opt for strengthening bilateral and or multilateral ties with sudan and ethiopia or advance the development of a rbo as a successor to the nbi there have been recent indications of increased cooperation between egypt and ethiopia as the new egyptian regime seems for now to favor good relations and trade over the instrumentalization of the conflict von lossow and roll 2015 at the same time reforming the hydro centric organization nbi into an a rbo is still an integral part of the regional vision the ability of such an organization to effectively incorporate water and land issues as well as other common challenges such as climate change is not clear it is also difficult to explain how joint action on overarching issues such as resource trade infrastructure and grid integration or groundwater can take place without some integration arrangements at least on a bilateral level or through international agreements supporting or complementing arrangements at the basin level in the african context regional integration in western and southern parts is increasingly linking the regional and the basin levels together the southern african development community sadc of 16 countries sharing many rivers covers a number of natural resources including shared water through a lens of regional integration and economic interdependence in the case of sadc muller et al 2015 highlighted the role of water although small due to limited interactions on shared rivers as a showcase for mutual benefits through cooperation and recommended hydro supportive transboundary water management for this region this means managing water on the same geographical scale as other sectors and in alignment with wider socio economic activities or regional development similarly shared waters in western africa are also promoted as part of a larger zone of regional integration however the economic community of west african states ecowas excludes cameroon an important riparian country uneca 2015 similarly in the eastern nile true regional integration seems distant from current diplomatic negotiation realities instead if riparian countries favor an enhancement of basin approaches they can consider broader approaches such as resource integration wef nexus cross sectoral institutional arrangements and a hydro supportive basin organization with inclusive participation 6 conclusions the water and state centric approach of water diplomacy emphasizes the use of interdisciplinary negotiations tools conflict resolution and transboundary institutions in order to facilitate cooperation mostly on the river basin level benefit sharing a wider and not entirely water basin related lens on cooperation promises to move beyond the zero sum game of allocating water quantities many of the emerging resource use issues in transboundary rivers are not adequately incorporated into concepts such as water diplomacy or the approach of benefit sharing at the same time growing economies demands and external climatic risks are leading to an appreciation of the regional level for cooperation on common pool resources the wef nexus approach can be useful for highlighting key neglected issues on interlinked resources at the basin and regional levels to conceptually accommodate these new issues and concepts at the basin level there is a need to move beyond water perspectives whether hydro centric or hydro supportive we argue that an understanding of a river basin from a broader perspective as a resource basin can be helpful in this regard in our conceptualisation basin boundaries are seen as common socio economic boundaries within which interlinked water energy and land resources whether connected to the river flow or not are utilized for basin development while the benefits therefrom are shared among users such a conceptualization helps broaden cooperation issues incorporate non state actors and increase mutual gains and is also less associated with institutional complexity than the maybe unwanted or unfeasible fully fledged regional integration this paper has aimed at highlighting new issues for transboundary cooperation while exploring institutional arrangements for dealing with them in the eastern nile as a region with a common destiny such issues include wef nexus ones and increased regional cooperation despite the current focus on the transboundary water cooperation issues related to equitable utilization and hydropower projects scholars and practitioners perceive land and energy use issues as being increasingly important and appropriate for future negotiation agendas the issues considered to be the most beneficial and also viable for cooperation are cross sectoral and rather regional technical cooperation trade certain services of nile based eco systems and improving agricultural technologies can help enhance cooperation are more financially and politically feasible and represent climate resistant issues there is also a large degree of support among nile basin experts for the idea of enhancing cooperative institutions and legislations these are seen to have had a positive contribution on transboundary river basin management they also mitigate underlying cooperation challenges such as distrust and regional rivalry finally in order to achieve enhanced cooperation in the region we make the following recommendations these recommendations are based on the study of emerging issues and the analysis of the institutional challenges and set up in the eastern nile basin the transboundary cooperation vision and the issues in the negotiation agenda can be enhanced through a more integrated and regional perspective this means incorporating wef nexus issues overarching challenges such as trade climate change and variability low resource use efficiencies and eco systems protection there are beneficial and not difficult issues that represent low hanging fruits in transboundary cooperation e g technical cooperation technology transfer and investments in nile resources addressing these issues can help build trust showcase cooperation benefits and help although indirectly foster regional integration emergent issues needs to be incorporated into the cooperation process at different phases i e during the preparation phase until the phases of implementation monitoring and learning optimally the cooperation agenda is revised regularly to accommodate new issues arising due to the rapid change of pace in the region new regional institutional arrangements should be based on a negotiated governance approach concerning transboundary natural resources regional integration is an ambitious goal and institutional integration entails important trade offs however deep integration can facilitate cooperation on resource conflicts and governance the basin level is a suitable scale for many resource use issues especially if strengthened through more inclusive institutions in terms of issues and actors the basin is however not only a management scale or a water resources delineation moreover it can be purposefully conceived as a resource basin and thus understood as an integrative entity with a common set of development goals and to certain extent as a coherent socio economic community eastern nile basin countries should deliberate on options for regional integration while considering cooperation trajectories existing arrangements in the region and experiences from other parts of the african continent any institutional arrangements need to reflect cooperation between equals and the appreciation of benefits of interdependence over rivalry or competition
